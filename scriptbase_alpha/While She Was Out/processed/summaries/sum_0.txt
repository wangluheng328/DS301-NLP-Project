Della Myers is an overwhelmed upper-middle-class housewife who lives in a large house in the suburbs with her twin children and her abusive husband, Kenneth.
Kenneth lets Della know that he thinks she gives all her attention to the twins and neglects her house and her appearance.
Late on Christmas Eve, Della drives to the local mall to buy gift-wrap.
While searching for a parking space in the jam-packed lot, Della notices an old car taking up two spaces.
Frustrated and annoyed, she decides to leave a paper message on the windshield of the old car, writing, "Hey, 'Jack'.
How selfish can you be?"
After the mall closes, Della's car is held by the driver of the old car and she is threatened by four punks -- Chuckie, Huey, Vingh, and Tom√°s.
When the security guard of the mall attempts to protect Della, he is shot and killed by Chuckie.
Della tries to escape from the criminals in her truck, but the gang chases her.
In the chase, she crashes in a nearby forest.
What unfolds in the woods is Della's lone fight for survival against a band of angry young men who would like nothing more than to see her dead.
