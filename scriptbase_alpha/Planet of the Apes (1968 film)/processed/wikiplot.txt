Astronauts George Taylor[8] (Charlton Heston), John Landon[9] (Robert Gunner[10]), Dodge[11] (Jeff Burton)[12] and Lieutenant Stewart[13] (Dianne Stanley,[14] uncredited) are in deep hibernation when their spaceship crashes in a lake on an unknown planet after a long near-light speed voyage, during which, due to time dilation, the crew ages only 18 months.
As the ship sinks, Taylor finds their shipmate Stewart dead and her body desiccated.
They throw an inflatable raft from the ship, and climb down into it; before departing the ship, Taylor notes that the current year is AD 3978.
Once ashore Dodge performs a soil test and pronounces the soil incapable of sustaining life.
