Nelson Mandela after being elected President, sets to bring his divided country together.
But it won't be easy cause there are those who still resent the presence of the Arikaaneers who oppressed them.
They want to get rid of all symbols of their oppression, among them is the National Rugby team, the Springboks which for many is a major symbol of their oppression.
But Mandela chooses to stand up for them.
With the World Cup approaching, Mandela sends for the team Captain, Francoise Pieenar.
And he subtly tells him that he wants them to win the World Cup.
So they train but Mandela decides to show them what they are playing for by making teach rugby in small townships and making them spend sometime in the prison where he was held for 27 years.
