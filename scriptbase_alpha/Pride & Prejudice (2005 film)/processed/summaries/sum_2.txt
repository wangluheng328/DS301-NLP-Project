This tale of love and values unfolds in the class-conscious England of the late 18th century.
The five Bennet sisters - including strong-willed Elizabeth and young Lydia - have been raised by their mother with one purpose in life: finding a husband.
When a wealthy bachelor takes up residence in a nearby mansion, the Bennets are abuzz.
Amongst the man's sophisticated circle of friends, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters.
But when Elizabeth meets up with the handsome and - it would seem - snobbish Mr. Darcy, the battle of the sexes is joined.
