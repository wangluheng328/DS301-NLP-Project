When Nora engages to the British Captain John Quin, Barry challenges him for a duel of pistols.
He wins and escapes to Dublin, but is robbed on the road.
Without any other alternative, Barry joins the British Army to fight in the Seven Years War.
He deserts and is forced to join the Prussian Army, saving the life of his captain and becoming his protégé and spy of the Irish gambler Chevalier de Balibari.
He helps Chevalier and becomes his associate until he decides to marry the wealthy Lady Lyndon.
They move to England and Barry, in his obsession of nobility, dilapidates her fortune and makes a dangerous and revengeful enemy.
