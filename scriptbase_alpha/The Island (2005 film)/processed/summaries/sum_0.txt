Lincoln Six-Echo is a resident of a seemingly Utopian but contained facility in the year 2019.
Like all of the inhabitants of this carefully controlled environment, Lincoln hopes to be chosen to go to the "The Island" - reportedly the last uncontaminated spot on the planet.
But Lincoln soon discovers that everything about his existence is a lie.
He and all of the other inhabitants of the facility are actually human clones.
Lincoln makes a daring escape with a beautiful fellow resident named Jordan Two-Delta.
Relentlessly pursued by the forces of the sinister institute that once housed them, Lincoln and Jordan engage in a race for their lives to literally meet their makers.
