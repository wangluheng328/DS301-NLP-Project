In the city of Los Angeles, a Christmas party is held on the 30th floor of the Nakatomi Plaza Hotel.
While the party is going on, downstairs, a band of German terrorists arrive and take the entire building hostage including its employees and attempts a huge robbery.
But the only one who eludes capture is New York City Cop John McClane who launches a one man war in an attempt to stop the terrorists and save all hostages including his wife Holly.
