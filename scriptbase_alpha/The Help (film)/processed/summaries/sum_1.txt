In Jackson, Mississippi, in the 60's, the aspirant writer Skeeter Phelan has just graduated and returns home after finding a job writing in a futile newspaper column in the local newspaper.
When she arrives home, she finds that her nanny and family's maid Constantine Jefferson is gone.
Skeeter sees the chance of writing a book about the relationship of the black maids with the Southern society for an editor from New York.
First she convinces Aibileen Clark to open her heart to her; then Minny Jackson is unfairly fired by the arrogant Hilly Holbrook, who is a leader in the racist high society, and Minny decides to tell her stories after finding a job with the outcast Celia Foote.
Soon eleven other maids accept to be interviewed by Skeeter that also tells the truth about Constantine.
When the book "The Help" is released, Jackson's high society will never be the same.
