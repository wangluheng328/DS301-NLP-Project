The year is 1998.
Due to huge crime rates, the United States turns its once great city of New York into a maximum security prison where hardcore criminals are put for life.
All the bridges leading into the city are mined, a large wall is built along the shoreline and a large police force army is based there to stop or kill any attempted escapees.
En route to a conference, the President, on board Air Force One, is forced to eject in a pod when a female terrorist takes over the controls and crashes the plane into a building.
A new prisoner, ex-soldier Snake Plissken is offered his freedom if he goes in, frees the President and finds a tape with important information for the conference.
Snake agrees but to ensure his co-operation he is injected with a small but powerful explosive that will only be destroyed if his mission is successful.
Snake must set out into the decaying city, filled with immoral criminals, and he must succeed - for his own life.
