Heather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard, student filmmakers, set out to shoot a documentary about a local legend, the Blair Witch.
In the forests near Burkittsville, Maryland, many children have vanished in the 1940s and people still avoid going too deep into the woods.
So, the party sets out to look for facts that prove the legend, equipped only with two cameras and a little hiking gear.
First, they find little piles of stone that must have been arranged artificially, later, they have to admit to be lost in the woods.
Eerie sounds at night and more piles of stones in places where they have not been before cause the already desperate group to panic.
And one night, days after they should have been back home, Josh disappears completely.
Only what has been recorded and filmed with the cameras is found a year later and shows what happened in the woods.
