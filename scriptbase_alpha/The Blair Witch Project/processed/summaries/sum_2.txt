Three film students set out into the Black Hills Forest to make a documentary on the legendary Blair Witch.
Armed with a 16mm camera, a Hi8 video camera, and a DAT recorder, every step, word and sound is captured.
After wandering around the Black Hills Forest, Heather, Josh, and Mike are cold, lost and hunted.
Finally, one night after the last ray of light had left the forest black, they were never to be seen again.
One year later, a bag full of film cans, DAT tapes, and video tapes were found.
The behind the scenes, video footage and the film, are cut together, and this is..."The Blair Witch Project."
