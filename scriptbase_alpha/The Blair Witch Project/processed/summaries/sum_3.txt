In October of 1994, three student filmmakers hike out to the woods of Blair, hoping to find evidence of a local legend "The Blair Witch".
At first, they find nothing except a pile of stones arranged by hand.
As the sun goes down, they realize they are lost, but there is little panic.
They camp out, and in the middle of the night they see and hear things, things that are not normal.
When they awake, they find wooden dolls in cross-like formations.
They were not there that night.
Then one of the students, Josh, is separated from the group.
The other two finally realize that they are in a very serious situation, and that they are being stalked, stalked by something that may be the very thing they were looking for...
