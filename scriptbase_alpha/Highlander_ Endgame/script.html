</p><p></p><p id="act">A FACE reflects in the window glass. It's RACHEL ELLENSTEIN, early 60's now, a graying, maternal beauty.
</p><p></p><p id="act">She moves to the front door, reaches out to unlock i.t.
</p><p></p><p id="act">It falls open at her touch. Even though the hanging placard is still flipped to "WE’RE CLOSED"
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rachel hesitates. Draws a shallow breath and steps

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT - ANTIQUE STORE
</p><p></p><p id="act">All those sublime European antiquities now drip with menace. Celtic harp. Scottish targe. Brooding statuary.
</p><p></p><p id="act">She moves deeper into the shadowed recesses, flicks on a lamp.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of things. An open wooden case, empty.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Just the felt impression of a missing broadsword.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RACHEL
</p><p id="spkdir">(icy dread) 
</p><p id="dia">Connor...?
</p><p></p><p id="act">She crosses to the foot of the staircase. Listens.
</p><p></p><p id="act">A MUSIC BOX
</p><p></p><p id="act">spools a faint, tinny madrigal.
</p><p></p><p id="act">She climbs the stairs, padding softly upward.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The music grinds EVER LOUDER in its maddening repetitions. Every so often, it's punctuated by a CHILD'S GIGGLE.
</p><p></p><p id="act">AT THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rachel edges around the corner. Her breath catches in her throat.  BEFORE HER stands a locked wooden cabinet. It's been cleaved nearly in half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the splintered front panel.  PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have been shredded and scattered across the floor--
</p><p></p><p id="act">--except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS, skewered onto the sword tip like a Medieval message spike. Rachel struggles to breathe. Like she's taken that sword in her own gut.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME MOVIES.  A LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL) is entranced by a PORCELAIN MUSIC BOX held out by an AGELESS CONNOR MACLEOD.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">YOUNG RACHEL 
</p><p id="dia">Let me see, Connor! Let me see!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rachel stands frozen, watching her life with Connor flash by in RAGGED FILM CLIPS.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CONNOR teaching RACHEL to ride a horse.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CONNOR with RACHEL outside an English boarding school. In a train station. At her college graduation.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CONNOR and RACHEL in a laughing embrace that only hints at something deeper.
</p><p></p><p id="act">In each new clip, Rachel has aged further. Connor has not.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rachel steps up to the broadsword, wraps both hands around the grip and jerks it clean of the cabinet.
</p><p></p><p id="act">THE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS (flutterd to the floor like dead leaves)
</p><p></p><p id="act">THE VIDEOTAPE ENDS, CLICKS OFF...
</p><p></p><p id="act">and a NEW IMAGE burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital clarity. Rachel. Staring back at herself, terror-stricken.
</p><p></p><p id="act">She hadn't even noticed it before now. The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf above the TV with the glowing red light.  
</p><p></p><p id="act">MOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY. Keep moving in on the TV until the PIXELS SWIM...
</p><p></p><p id="act">THE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness. The old rotary phone on the little Louis XIV stand. It's not just beckoning her.  It's taunting her.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast, Rachel slowly approaches the phone.  Any second now, you'd expect it to stop ringing, nobody home. But  whoever's on the other end knows better. It keeps right on RINGING. Insistant.  Trembling fingers reach out for the receiver. Slowly lift it off the hook.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RACHEL 
</p><p id="dia">Hello?
</p><p></p><p id="act">EXTREME CLOSE ON PHONE:
</p><p></p><p id="act">A TINY ELECTRIC CLICK is the last thing Rachel hears before--

</p><p></p><p id="act">BEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife, HEATHER, watch from the steps of their simple, isolated home. Connor betrays no emotion. Heather looks on in horror.

</p><p id="dia">A warning?! They drove you from your home! They cut you off from your own people! What else could they want?!

They throw open the heavy iron door and descend upon Connor with swords and axes. &gt;Wielding the iron bar like a battle mace, Connor splits the first guard's head, catches his sword mid-air and slices into the next. Third guard's axe catches on a ceiling beam. Connor runs him through like an overstuffed feedsack.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Connor stands atop the burning pyre, wicked tongues of flame leaping off his back and shoulders like fiery wings.  He throws back his head and HOWLS to the heavens.  Fire dances across Connor's skin and clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd.

Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging at Connor's smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that shroud his eyes. It's the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see.  Connor opens his fingers and lets him DROP, the sword hilt still jutting from Kase's chest.  Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber, Connor HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops, setting them instantly ABLAZE.  In short order, the village is transformed into a giant swirling INFERNO.  Silhouetted against the crimson sky, Connor lifts Caiolin's body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time.

spared. Rachel and Connor's richly-cultivated collection has been reduced to a bitter moonscape. One can only shudder at the degree of overkill that went into this attack. Duncan climbs the back stairs to THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse. Ash and cinder are virtually all that remain of Connor's home.
Pausing at the far wall, Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry, revealing
<b>AN INNER DOOR

</p><p></p><p id="act">ENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM surrounded by a staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from centuries of personal history. We're looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeod's existance, stacked floor to ceiling.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Duncan moves among the mementos, smiles as he lifts them; an old Scottish coin, pocket flask... a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War I uniform.
He pauses at a painting of Connor's wife HEATHER, radiant in simple peasant garb, smiling serenely across the ages.
Finally, a tarnished epee that he wields with instant familiarity.

Duncan and Connor face off with duelling swords, sporting black waistcoak andd knee breeches in the manner of the times.  Several other elegant FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient bloodsport, a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen earlier.  A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with lint brush, pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid series of strikes and parries.

</p><p id="dia">We call it "The Quickening"-- our strength, our knowledge, our life essence-- it all flows into the victor, feeds him, makes him stronger, in ways you can't possibly comprehend. It's what drives other Immortals to kill us. And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than the rest.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He takes Duncan by the arm, jerks him to his feet. 
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CONNOR (cont'd) 
</p><p id="dia">Survival. Learn it.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Duncan goes on the attack. What he lacks in technique, he makes up for in determination. Almost. Connor sidesteps Duncan's next lunge, swats his blade flat across Duncan's ass and sends him plowing face-first into the floor. Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance. Puffer races up behind Duncan again, meticulously dusts his backside. Reaches around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb and forefinger.

</p><p id="dia">If you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade... just keep this in mind.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He proceeds to take Duncan through a move that's dazzling in it's inherent simplicity-- a move that winds up with Duncan's blade whisking perilously close across Connor's throat.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CONNOR (cont'd)
</p><p id="dia">It's a coup de fin.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He catches Duncan's sword-fist in his own, holds it immobile.
