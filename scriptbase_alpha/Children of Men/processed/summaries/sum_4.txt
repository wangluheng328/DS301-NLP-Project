With this dystopian world ravished by war, paranoia and the frustrations of Man the Orwellian vision of Nineteen Eighty-Four, the totalitarian future is now complete and amongst us.
With female fertility becoming obsolete, Man cannot reproduce, and no child has been born on the face of the planet for eighteen years.
Man, and his future, is dying.
Soon he shall be extinct.
Theo, the beaten, downtrodden and middle-aged ex-political activist will, unwittingly, become involved in a war of an underground revolt.
Here he is active once more, in the perilous journey across England's Home Counties, with a young girl, Kee, who, to Theo's bewilderment is pregnant.
The first pregnant woman for more than eighteen years.
This secret must be protected, at all cost, and mother and child must flee to the mysterious and enigmatic Human Project, across the seas.
Their flight is a constant fight for survival.
Who can be trusted?
Who can keep a secret?
