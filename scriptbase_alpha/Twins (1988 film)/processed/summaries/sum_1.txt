Many years ago, an experiment was conducted to produce a perfect human being.
Unfortunately, there was a serious problem.
The zygote split unevenly leaving two children - one with strength, brains, personality and love and the other one with what else was left!
Both children were raised separately at different locations until one day, the two unite and help each other find their long-lost mother.
