<b>1. EXT. SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
     During Brian's monologue, we see various views of things
     inside the school including Bender's locker.

<b>                          BRIAN (VO)
</b>               Saturday...March 24, 1984.  Shermer
               High School, Shermer, Illinois.
               60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept
               the fact that we had to sacrifice a
               whole Saturday in detention for
               whatever it was that we did wrong,
               what we did was wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make us write this
               essay telling you who we think we
               are, what do you care?  You see us
               as you want to see us...in the
               simplest terms and the most
               convenient definitions.  You see us
               as a brain, an athelete, a basket
               case, a princess and a criminal.
               Correct?  That's the way we saw each
               other at seven o'clock this morning.
               We were brainwashed...

<b>2. INT. CLAIRE'S CAR - DAY
</b>
     We see CLAIRE and her FATHER sitting in their car in the
     parking lot.

     Claire is the prom queen and is clearly a snob.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               I can't believe you can't get me
               out of this...I mean it's so absurd
               I have to be here on a Saturday!
               It's not like I'm a defective or
               anything...

<b>                       CLAIRE'S FATHER
</b>               I'll make it up to you...Honey,
               ditching class to go shopping
               doesn't make you a defective.  Have
               a good day.

     Claire rolls her eyes and gets out of the car and walks
     up the school front steps

<b>3. INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY
</b>
     We are in BRIAN's car.  His MOTHER is there and so is
     his little SISTER.  He is sort of a nerd.

<b>                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
</b>               Is this the first time or the last
               time we do this?

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>                    (upset)
               Last...

<b>                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
</b>               Well get in there and use the time
               to your advantage...

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Mom, we're not supposed to study; we
               just have to sit there and do
               nothing.

<b>                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
</b>               Well mister you figure out a way to
               study.

<b>                    BRIAN'S LITTLE SISTER
</b>                    (annoyingly)
               Yeah!

<b>                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
</b>               Well go!

     Brian gets out of the car and walks towards the school.

<b>4. INT. ANDREW'S CAR - DAY
</b>
     We see ANDREW and his FATHER.  Andrew is clearly a jock;
     he’s wearing a letterman’s jacket with lots of patches on it.

<b>                       ANDREW'S FATHER
</b>               Hey, I screwed around...guys screw
               around, there's nothing wrong with
               that.  Except you got caught, Sport.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright?

<b>                       ANDREW'S FATHER

               You wanna miss a match?  You wanna
               blow your ride?  Now no school's
               gonna give a scholarship to a

     Andrew gets out of the car and walks into the school.

<b>5. EXT. SHERMER PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
     We see JOHN BENDER walking towards us.  He is wearing
     sunglasses.  A car is coming towards him but he doesn't
     stop walking.

     The car slams on its breaks directly in front of him.

     Bender gets out of the frame.  Out of the car steps
     ALLISON.  She is dressed all in black.  She steps
     forward to look in the car's front window and the car
     drives away.

<b>6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
     There are six tables in two rows of three.
     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in
     and sits at the table behind her.

     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire
     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.

     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout
     desk and takes a few things in the process.

     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to
     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian
     reluctantly gets up and moves.

     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his
     feet up.

     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the
     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind
     Brian.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.

     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.

     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack
     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with
     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the
     job.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want
               to congradulate you for being on
               time...

     Claire raises her hand.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's
               been a mistake.  I know it's
               detention, but...um...I don't think
               I belong in here...

     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have
               exactly eight hours and fifty-four
               minutes to think about why you're
               here.  To ponder the error of your
               ways...

     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his
     mouth again.

     Claire looks like she is going to gag.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               ...and you may not talk.  You will
               not move from these seats.

     He glances up at Bender and points at him.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               ...and you...

     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,
               we're gonna try something a little
               different today.  We are going to
               write an essay--of no less than a
               thousand words--describing to me
               who you think you are.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Is this a test?

     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice
     of Bender.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               And when I say essay...I mean essay.
               I do not mean a single word repeated
               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.
               Bender?

     Bender looks up.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Crystal...

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little
               something about yourself.  Maybe
               you'll even--decide whether or not
               you care to return.

     Brian raises his hand and then stands.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               You know, I can answer that right
               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.
               'cause...

<b>                            BRIAN

     He sits.

<b>                            VERNON

     Vernon points.

</b>               ...is right across that hall.  Any
               monkey business is ill-advised...

     He looks around at them.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               ...any questions?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Yeah...I got a question.

     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his
               wardrobe?

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               I'll give you the answer to that
               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.
               Don't mess with the bull young man,
               you'll get the horns.

     Vernon leaves.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               That man...is a brownie hound...

     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud
     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is
     Allison, biting her nails.

     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is
     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You keep eating your hand and you're
               not gonna be hungry for lunch...

     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I've seen you before, you know...

     We see Vernon look out from his office.

     We see Brian playing with his pen.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>                    (quietly to himself)
               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?
               Who are you?

     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top
     under his upper lip.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               I am a walrus...

     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices
     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--
     embarrassed.

     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the
     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing
     his jacket.

     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands
     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket
     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still
     staring at him.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               It's the shits, huh?

     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable
     laugh.

     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He
     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's
     head.

     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore
     Bender.

     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a
     song.  “Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...”

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>                    (to herself)
               I can't believe this is really
               happening to me...

     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do
               if we hafta take a piss?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>                    (disgusted)
               Please...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               If you gotta go...

     We hear Bender unzip his fly.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You gotta go!

     Everyone is now looking at Bender.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>                   (disgusted)
               Oh my God!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes
               it crawl back up!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               You whip it out and you're dead
               before the first drop hits the
               floor!

     Bender gasps mockingly.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You're pretty sexy when you get
               angry...grrr!

     He turns to Brian.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Hey, homeboy...

     Brian points at himself with his pen.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>              ...why don't you go close that door.
               We'll get the prom queen--
               impregnated!

     Claire turns and glares at him.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Hey!

     Bender ignores him.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Hey!
<b>                          BENDER

<b>                            BRIAN

               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we

<b>                            ANDREW

               Look, just because you live in here
               doesn't give you the right to be a
               pain in the ass...so knock it off!

     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               It's a free country...

<b>                            BENDER

               you tried!

     Claire rolls her eyes.

<b>                           BENDER

     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.

     They all look at each other.  Andrew turns away from
     Bender.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>                    (to himself)
               Scumbag!

     Bender stands up and walks over to the railing.  He sits
     on it.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               What do you say we close that door.
               We can't have any kind of party
               with Vernon checking us out every
               few seconds.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Well, you know the door's s'posed to
               stay open...

<b>                           BENDER
</b>               So what?

<b>                           ANDREW
</b>               So why don't you just shut up!
               There's four other people in here
               you know...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               God, you can count.  See!  I knew
               you had to be smart to be a...a
               wrestler.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Who the hell are you to judge
               anybody anyway?

<b>                            CLAIRE

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               You know, Bender...you don't even
               count.  I mean if you disappeared
               forever it wouldn't make any
               difference.  You may as well not
               even exist at this school.

     Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment
     before speaking.  He doesn't let his emotions out,
     however.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Well...I'll just run right out and
               join the wrestling team.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and laugh at
     Bender.

               either, but I'm not gonna run out

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Hey let's watch the mouth, huh?

     Brian again feels he needs to contribute.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               I'm in the physics club too...

<b>                            BENDER

<b>                            BRIAN

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               So...academic clubs aren't the same
               as other kinds of clubs.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Oh, but to dorks like him...

     Bender points at Brian.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               ...they are.
                    (to Brian)
               What do you guys do in your club?

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               In physics, um, we ah, we talk about

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               So it's sorta social...demented and
               sad, but social.  Right?

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Yeah, well, I guess you could
               consider it a social situation.  I
               mean there are other children in my
               club and uh, at the end of the year
               we have, um, you know, a big
               banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton.

<b>                            BENDER

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Well, no, we get dressed up...I
               mean, but, we don't...we don't get
               high.

<b>                            CLAIRE

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               And, uh, I didn't have any shoes.
               So I had to borrow my dad's.  It
               was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't
               like me to wear other people's
               shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my
               cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana...
               He got high once and you know, he
               started eating like really weird
               foods.  And uh, and then he just
               felt like he didn't belong anywhere.
               You know, kinda like, you know
               "Twilight Zone" kinda.

<b>                            ANDREW

               and Vernon's gonna come right in

               Oh and wouldn't that be a bite...

     Bender lets out a moan of fake agony.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Missing a whole wrestling meet!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Well you wouldn't know anything
               about it, faggot!  You never competed
               in your whole life!

<b>                            BENDER
</b>                    (with mock hurt)
               Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside
               because of it.  I have such a deep
               admiration for guys that roll around
               on the floor with other guys!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Ahhh...you'd never miss it.  You
               don't have any goals.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Oh, but I do!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yeah?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I wanna be just--like--you!  I
               figure all I need's a labotamy and
               some tights!

     Brian becomes interested.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               You wear tights?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>                    (to Brian)
               No I don't wear tights, I wear the
               required uniform...

<b>                            BRIAN

</b>                    (defensive)
               Shut up!

     They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender
     quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and
     Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table.
     Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and
     gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors
     that separate the library from the hallway.

</b>               You know there's not s'posed to be

<b>                            BENDER
</b>                    (in a stern voice)
               Young man...have you finished your
               paper?

     Bender turns back away and goes to the door.  He looks
     around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.

<b>                            CLAIRE

     We see Vernon getting a drink at the fountain. He stands
     up and checks the way he looks in a mirror.  He does a
     muscular pose and utters some manly jibberish “Cobadonga!”

     library.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Bender, that's, that's school
               property there...you know, it doesn't
               belong to us.  It's something not to
               be toyed with.

     The door slams shut.  Bender runs back to his seat.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               That's very funny, come on, fix it!

     We see Vernon walking back to his office.  He stops and
     listens to them through the closed door.

     We see Brian as we hear Vernon in the hall.

<b>                         VERNON (OS)
</b>               God damnit!

     He opens the door and storms in.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Why is that door closed?

     For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare
     at Vernon.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Why is that door closed?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               How're we s'posed to know?  We're
               not s'posed to move, right?

     Vernon turns to Claire.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Why?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               We were just sitting here, like we
               were s'posed to...

     Vernon looks around and looks at Bender.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Who closed that door?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I think a screw fell out of it...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               It just closed, sir...

     Vernon looks at Allison in the back.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Who?

     Allison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the
     table, hiding in her jacket hood.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               She doesn't talk, sir...

<b>                            VERNON

<b>                            BENDER

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               You want me to yank you outta that
               seat and shake it out of you?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I don't have it...screws fall out
               all of the time, the world's an
               imperfect place...

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Give it to me, Bender...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Excuse me, sir, why would anybody
               want to steal a screw?

<b>                            VERNON
</b>                    (to Claire)
               Watch it, young lady...

     Vernon goes over to the door.  He tries to hold it open
     by putting a folding chair in front of it.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               The door's way too heavy, sir.

     The door slams shut despite the chair.

<b>                         VERNON (OS)
</b>               God damnit!

     They laugh.

     Vernon opens the door again.  He comes back in.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>                    (pointing)
               Andrew Clark...get up here.  Come on,
               front and center, let's go.

     Andrew gets up and walks over to Vernon.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?
               If he gets up, we'll all get up,
               it'll be anarchy!

     Vernon and Andrew are now attempting to move the steel
     magazine rack in front of the door.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>              Okay, now, watch the magazines!

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               It's out of my hands...

     They get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire
     door.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               That's very clever sir, but what if
               there's a fire?  I think violating
               fire codes and endangering the
               lives of children would be unwise
               at this juncture in your career, sir.

     Vernon thinks about it.  He turns to Andrew.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Alright, what are you doing with
               this?  Get this outta here for God's
               sake!  What's the matter with you?
               Come on!

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               You know the school comes equipped
               with fire exits at either end of the
               library.

     Brian points at them and Bender glares at him.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>                    (to Brian)
               Show Dick some respect!

     Andrew and Vernon come back into the main section of
     the library.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>                    (to Andrew)
               Let's go...go!  Get back into your
               seat.

     Andrew sits.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>                    (to Andrew)

               varsity letterman!
                    (to Bender)
               You're not fooling anybody, Bender!
               The next screw that falls out is
               gonna be you!

     Vernon turns to leave.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>                    (under his breath)

     Vernon spins in his tracks and faces Bender again.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               What was that?

<b>                            BENDER

</b>                    (screams)
               Fuck you!

     We see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight.

     We see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a
     cigarette with his shoe.

     We see Claire thinking.

     We see Brian playing with his balls.

     We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt.

     We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and
     making it turn purple.

     We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then
     plays air guitar.

     We see Allison drawing.

     We see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers
     silently.

     Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture.

     We see everyone fall asleep.

     Vernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids.

     Everyone raises their hands.

</b>
     Later.

     We see the clock, it now says 10:22.

     We see Andrew stretching.  We see Bender tearing pages
     out of a book.  He is tossing them around.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               That's real intelligent.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You're right...it's wrong to
               destroy literature...

     He continues to tear pages out.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               It's such fun to read...and, Molet
               really pumps my nads!

<b>                            CLAIRE

               Mol-yare.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>              I love his work.

     Bender tosses the rest of the pages at Brian.  He picks
     up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards
     out.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Big deal...nothing to do when you're
               locked in a vacancy..

<b>                           ANDREW
</b>               Speak for yourself...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Do you think I'd speak for you?  I
               don't even know your language!

     Andrew turns to Claire.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Hey, you grounded tonight?

     Claire shrugs.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               I don't know, my mom said I was but
               by dad told me to just blow her off.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Big party at Stubbies, parents are
               in Europe.  Should be pretty wild...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Yeah?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yeah, can you go?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               I doubt it...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               How come?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Well 'cause if I do what my mother
               tells me not to do, it's because
               because my father says it's okay.
               There's like this whole big monster
               deal, it's endless and it's a total
               drag.  It's like any minute...
               divorce...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Who do you like better?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               What?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You like your old man better than
               your mom?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               They're both strict.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               No, I mean, if you had to choose
               between them.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               I dunno, I'd probably go live with
               my brother.  I mean, I don't think
               either one of them gives a shit
               about me...it's like they use me
               just to get back at each other.

     Suddenly, from the back of the room.  Allison speaks.

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>                    (loudly)
               Ha!!!

     Everyone looks at her shocked.  Allison blows her hair
     out of her eyes and grins.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Shut up!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               You're just feeling sorry for
               yourself...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else
               would.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Aw...you're breaking my heart...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Sporto...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               What?

     Bender jumps down and goes next to Andrew.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You get along with your parents?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot,
               right?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You're an idiot anyway...But if you
               say you get along with your parents
               well you're a liar too!

     Bender turns and walks away from him.  Andrew follows
     and pushes Bender.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               You know something, man...If we
               weren't in school right now, I'd
               waste you!

     Bender points his middle finger at the floor.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Can you hear this?  Want me to turn
               it up?

     Bender flips his hand around so he is now giving Andrew
     the bird.

     Brian comes over and puts a hand on each of the guy's
     shoulders.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Hey fellas, I mean...

     Andrew pushes away from Brian.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               ...I don't like my parents either,
               I don't...I don't get along with
               them...their idea of parental
               compassion is just, you know, wacko!

     Bender turns to Brian.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Dork...

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>              Yeah?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

     Bender starts to walk away.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Well that's a problem!

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Look, I can see you getting all
               bunged up for them making you wear
               these kinda clothes.  But face it,
               you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie!
               What would you be doing if you
               weren't out making yourself a better
               citizen?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Why do you have to insult everybody?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I'm being honest, asshole!  I would
               expect you...to know the difference!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yeah well, he's gotta name!

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Yeah?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yeah,
                    (to Brian)
               What's your name?

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Brian...

<b>                            ANDREW

<b>                            BENDER
</b>                    (to Brian)
               My condolences...

     Bender walks away.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>                    (to Bender)
               What's your name?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               What's yours?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Claire...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Ka-Laire?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Claire...it's a family name!

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Nooo...It's a fat girl's name!

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Well thank you...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You're welcome...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               I'm not fat!

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Well not at present but I could see
               you really pushing maximum density!
               You see, I'm not sure if you know
               this...but there are two kinds of
               fat people.  There's fat people that
               were born to be fat, and then there's
               fat people that were once thin but
               they became fat...so when you look
               at them you can sorta see that thin
               person inside!  You see, you're
               gonna get married, you're gonna
               squeeze out a few puppies and then,
               uh...

     He mimes becoming fat, making noises.

     Claire gives him the finger.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Oh...obscene finger gestures from
               such a pristine girl!

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>                    (resentfully)
               I'm not that pristine!

     Bender bends down closer to Claire.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Are you a virgin?
                    (a beat)
               I'll bet you a million dollars that
               you are!  Let's end the suspense!
               Is it gonna be...
                    (another beat)
               ...a white weddin?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Why don't you just shut up?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Have you ever kissed a boy on the
               mouth?
                    (a beat)
               Have you ever been felt up?  Over
               the bra, under the blouse, shoes
               off...hoping to God your parents
               don't walk in?

     Claire is getting upset.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Do you want me to puke?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Over the panties, no bra, blouse
               unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on
               the front seat past eleven on a
               school night?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Leave her alone!

     Bender slowly stands and faces Andrew.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               I said leave her alone!

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You gonna make me?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Yeah...

     Bender walks over to where Andrew is standing.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You and how many of your friends?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Just me, just you and me.  Two hits.
               Me hitting you, you hitting the
               floor!  Anytime you're ready, pal!

     Bender goes to hit him but Andrew gets Bender down on
     the ground with a wrestling move.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I don't wanna get into to this with
               you man...

     Andrew gets up.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Why not?

     Bender gets up.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               'Cause I'd kill you...It's real simple.
               I'd kill you and your fucking parents
               would sue me and it would be a big
               mess and I don't care enough about
               you to bother.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Chicken shit...

     Andrew turns and walks away.  Bender takes out a
     switchblade and opens it.

     He stabs the switchblade into a chair.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Let's end this right now.  You don't
               talk to her...you don't look at her
               and you don't even think about her!
               You understand me?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I'm trying to help her!.

     We see the janitor, CARL come into the room.

<b>                             CARL
</b>               Brian, how you doing?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Your dad works here?

     Brian is embarrassed.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Uh, Carl?

<b>                             CARL
</b>               What?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Can I ask you a question?

<b>                             CARL
</b>               Sure...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               How does one become a janitor?

<b>                             CARL
</b>               You wanna be a janitor?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               No I just wanna know how one becomes
               a janitor because Andrew here, is
               very interested in persuing a
               career in the custodial arts...

<b>                             CARL
</b>               Oh, really?  You guys think I'm
               just some untouchable peasant?  Peon?
               Huh?  Maybe so, but following
               a broom around after shitheads like
               you for the past eight years I've
               learned a couple of things...I look
               through your letters, I look through
               your lockers...I listen to your

</b>               Um, I'm here today...because uh,
               because my coach and my father don't

               treated differently because uh,
               Coach thinks I'm a winner.  So does
               my old man.  I'm not a winner

               to ride in the back seat 'cause his
               nuts would ride shotgun.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Yeah, but it was only...was only
               because I didn't want her to know
               that I was a virgin, okay?

     Bender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who
     catches it without even looking up.

     Bender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter.

     We now watch Andrew take a couple sandwiches out of his
     bag, a bag of potato chips, an apple, a banana, a bag
     of cookies and a carton of milk.

     Allison opens her Coke and it fizzes over.  She loudly
     slurps it up off the table and her fingers.

     Andrew sees Bender looking at him.

<b>                            ANDREW

     Allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up.
     It lands on the sculpture above.

     She opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the
     sandwich and then puts Cap'n Crunch on top of that.
     She crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it.

     Bender goes over and sits by Brian, Bender takes
     Brian's bag lunch.

     Bender reaches in the bag and pulls out a thermos.  He
     sets it on the table and points at it.

               Yes Dear, isn't life swell?

     Bender mimes mother kissing father and then father
     kissing mother and then father punching mother in the
     face.

     Suddenly it's not so funny anymore.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Alright, what about your family?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Oh, mine?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               That's real easy!

     Bender stands again and points forward.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>                    (as his father)
               Stupid, worthless, no good, God
               damned, freeloading, son of a bitch,
               retarded, bigmouth, know it all,
               asshole, jerk!
                       (as his mother)
               You forgot ugly, lazy and
               disrespectful.

     Bender slams his hand back to slap his invisable
     mother.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>                    (as his father)
               Shut up bitch!  Go fix me a turkey
               pot pie!
                    (as himself)
               What about you Dad?
                    (as his father)
               Fuck you!
                    (as himself)
               No, Dad, what about you?

                    (as his father--yelling)

     He reaches out and pretend he's his father hitting him.

<b>                            BRIAN

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               That's bullshit.  It's all part of
               your image, I don't believe a word
               of it.

     Bender actually looks hurt.

<b>                     BENDER
</b>               You don't believe me?

<b>                            ANDREW

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Did I stutter?

     Bender comes over to Andrew and rolls up his right
     sleeve to reveal a circular shaped burn.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Do you believe this?  Huh?  It's
               about the size of a cigar...Do I
               stutter?  You see, this is what you
               get in my house when you spill paint
               in the garage.

     Bender begins to walk away.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               See I don't think that I need to
               sit here with you fuckin' dildos anymore!

     Bender walks over to a map table and throws all the
     maps on the floor.  He climbs up on top of the table and
     then up to the second floor balcony.

     Vernon puts an orange in his mouth and then attempts to
     pour coffee out of his thermos.  The top comes off and
     the coffee goes all over his desk.

</b>               Coffee...looks like they scrape it
               off the bottom of the Mississippi
               river.  Everything's polluted,
               everything's polluted...the coffee.

     Bender comes out of the library doors followed
     bye veryone else.

     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.
     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the
     end of the line, Allison is following.

<b>                            BENDER

     Claire walks after Bender.

</b>               That was marijuana!

<b>                            ANDREW

     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison
     who is standing there with her mouth open.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Do you approve of this?

     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of
     Bender's locker.

     We see the crowd walking down the hall.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               We'll cross through the lab, and

               What'd he say?  Where're we going?

     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various
     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon
     until they stop.

<b>                            BENDER

</b>               Now we're through listening to you,
               we're going this way.

     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by
     an iron gate.

     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's
     underwear.

     Bender runs away singing loudly.  “I wanna be an
     airborne ranger...”

     We see Vernon hear Bender.

     The rest of them run.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               That son of a bitch!

     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in
     the gym.

     Bender is going up for a basket.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Three...two...one!

     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is
               this?  What are you doing here, what
               is this?

<b>                            BENDER

<b>                            VERNON

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Gimmie the ball, Bender.

     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball
     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.

     They leave.

               A naked blond walks into a bar, with
               a poodle under one arm and a two
               foot salami under the other.  She
               lays the poodle on the table.  Bar-
               tender says: "I suppose you won't
               be needing a drink."  The naked
               lady says...

     The ceiling under Bender gives and he falls through.

     We hear Vernon in the hall.

<b>                         VERNON (OS)
</b>               God damnit!  What in God's name is
               going on in here?

     Vernon enters.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>              What was that ruckus?

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Uh, what ruckus?

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               I was just in my office and I heard
               a ruckus!

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Could you describe the ruckus, sir?

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Watch your tongue young man, watch
               it!

     We see Bender under the table by Claire's legs.  He
     sits up and bangs his head on the table.  He groans.

     Above the table, Andrew and Claire try to take credit
     for the noise by making more noise.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               What is that?  What, what is that,
               what is that noise?

     Under the table, Bender looks between Claire's legs and
     can see her panties.  He puts his head between Claire's
     legs.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               What noise?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Really, sir, there wasn't any noise...

     Claire squeels.  She squeezes Bender's head between her
     knees.

     Everyone starts faking a coughing fit.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>                    (flustered)
               That noise?  Was that the noise you
               were talking about?

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               No, it wasn't.  That was not the
               noise I was talking about.  Now, I
               may not have caught you in the act
               this time, but you can bet I will.

     Allison laughs at Vernon.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               You make book on that missy!

               And you!  I will not be made a fool
               of!

     He turns and walks away.  We see that he still has the
     toilet seat cover stuck to his pants.
     Vernon leaves.

     Everyone laughs except Claire who lets Bender out to a
     barage of slaps.

<b>                            BENDER

     Bender gets up and walks over to Brian.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               So, Ahab...Kybo Mein Doobage...

     Brian gives Bender his bag of marajuana.  Bender turns
     and walks away.

     Brian, Bender and Claire are sitting in a circle and
     laughing hysterically.

     Bender lights Claire up and she coughs the smoke out.
     Brian laughs at her.  He exhales and tries to eat the
     smoke.  He talks in a really weird voice.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Chicks, cannot hold der smoke!  That's

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Poor baby.

     Brian waves Claire over to him and he falls over.

     We see Andrew emerge from a really smokey room.  He
     inhales another puff and then starts dancing to
     everybody's applause.

     He goes back in the room he was in.  He screams and it
     shatters the glass in the door.

               in the street...I can run away and,
               go to the ocean, I can go to the
               country, I can go to the mountains.
               I can go to Israel, Africa,
               Afghanistan...

     Brian looks at her and then moves over to Andrew.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Andy...you wanna get in on this?
               Allison here says, she wants to run
               away, because her home life is
               unsatisfying...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Well everyone's home lives are un-
               satisfying...If it wasn't, people
               would live with there parents
               forever...

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Yeah, yeah I understand.  But I
               think that her's goes beyond, you
               know, what guys like you and me...
               consider normal unsatisfying...

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               Nevermind...forget it, everything's
               cool!

     Allison starts putting everything back in her purse.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               What's the deal?

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               No!  There's no deal, Sporto.
               Forget it, leave me alone.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Wait a minute, now you're carrying
               all that crap around in your purse.
               Either you really wanna run away or
               you want people to think you wanna
               run away.

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               Eat shit!

     Allison gets up and walks away.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               The girl is an island, with herself.
               Okay?

     Andrew gets up and goes after her.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Hi, you wanna talk?

<b>                           ALLISON

<b>                            ANDREW

<b>                           ALLISON

<b>                            ANDREW

<b>                           ALLISON

     Andrew turns away and Allison starts to cry.

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               You have problems...

<b>                            ANDREW

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               You do everything everybody ever
               tells you to do, that is a problem!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Okay, fine...but I didn't dump my
               purse out on the couch and invite
               people into my problems...Did I?
               So what's wrong?  What is it?  Is
               is bad?  Real bad?  Parents?

     Allison is silently crying.

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               Yeah...

     Andrew nods.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               What do they do to you?

<b>                           ALLISON

<b>                            ANDREW

     They both are crying silently.

     Vernon and Carl are sitting talking.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               What did you want to be when you
               were young?

<b>                             CARL
</b>               When I was a kid, I wanted to be
               John Lennon...

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Carl don't be a goof!  I'm trying
               to make a serious point here...I've
               been teaching, for twenty two years,
               and each year...these kids get more
               and more arrogant.

<b>                             CARL
</b>               Aw bull shit, man.  Come on Vern,
               the kids haven't changed, you have!
               You took a teaching position, 'cause
               you thought it'd be fun, right?
               Thought you could have summer
               vacations off...and then you found
               out it was actually work...and that
               really bummed you out.

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               These kids turned on me...they think
               I'm a big fuckin' joke...

<b>                             CARL
</b>               Come on...listen Vern, if you were
               sixteen, what would you think of
               you, huh?

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Hey...Carl, you think I give one
               rat's ass what these kids think of
               me?

<b>                             CARL
</b>               Yes I do...

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               You think about this...when you get
               old, these kids; when I get old,
               they're gonna be runnin' the country.

<b>                             CARL
</b>               Yeah?

<b>                            VERNON
</b>               Now this is the thought that wakes
               me up in the middle of the night...
               That when I get older, these kids
               are gonna take care of me...

<b>                             CARL
</b>               I wouldn't count on it!

</b>               What would I do for a million bucks?
               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I
               had to...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               That's boring...

<b>                            ANDREW

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               The idea is to like search your mind
               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,

     Andrew laughs.

<b>                            ANDREW

<b>                            CLAIRE

<b>                            ANDREW

</b>               I'll do anything sexual, I don't

</b>               I don't think that from a legal

               construed as rape since I paid him.

<b>                            CLAIRE

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               Yeah...he's married too!

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               I've already told you everything!

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep

<b>                           ALLISON

<b>                            CLAIRE

     Claire silences all of them by screaming.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>                    (screaming)
               No!  I never did it!

     Silence for two beats.

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               I never did it either, I'm not a
               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive
               liar...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               You are such a bitch!  You did that

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               I would do it though...If you love

</b>               I can't believe you, you're so
               weird.  You don't say anything all
               day and then when you open your
               mouth...you unload all these
               tremendous lies all over me!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               You're just pissed off because she
               got you to admit something you didn't
               want to admit to...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it
               any less bizarre...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all
               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just
               better at hiding it, that's all.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>                    (to Andrew)
               How are you bizarre?

     Allison decides to field that question.

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               He can't think for himself...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               She's right...do you guys know what,
               uh, what I did to get in here?  I
               taped Larry Lester's buns together.

     Claire laughs.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>                    (to Andrew)
               That was you?

<b>                           ANDREW
</b>                    (to Brian)
               Yeah, you know him?

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Yeah, I know him...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Well then you know how hairy he is,
               right?  Well, when they pulled the
               tape off, most of his hair came off
               and some, some skin too...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Oh my God...

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               And the bizarre thing is, is that
               I did it for my old man...I
               tortured this poor kid, because I
               wanted him to think that I was cool.
               He's always going off about, you
               know, when he was in school...all
               the wild things he used to do.  And
               I got the feeling that he was
               disappointed that I never cut loose
               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm
               sitting in the locker room, and I'm
               taping up my knee.  And Larry's
               undressing a couple lockers down
               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...
               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I
               started thinking about my father,
               and his attitude about weakness.
               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I
               jumped on top of him and started
               wailing on him...And my friends,
               they just laughed and cheered me on.
               And afterwards, when I was sittin'
               in Vernon's office, all I could
               think about was Larry's father. And
               Larry havin' to go home and...and
               explain what happened to him.  And
               the humiliation...fucking
               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It
               mustuv been unreal...I mean,
                    (he's crying)
               I mean, how do you apologize for
               something like that?  There's no
               way...it's all because of me and
               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate
               him!  He's like this...he's like
               this mindless machine that I can't
               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,
               you've got to be number one!  I
               won't tolerate any losers in this
               family...Your intensity is for shit!
               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a
               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish
               my knee would give...and I wouldn't
               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he
               could forget all about me...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I think your old man and my old man
               should get together and go bowling.

     Andrew laughs briefly.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               It's like me, you know, with my
               grades...like, when I, when I
               step outside myself kinda, and
               when I, when I look in at myself
               you know?  And I see me and I don't
               like what I see, I really don't.

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               What's wrong with you?  Why don't
               you like yourself?

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing
               shop.  See we had this assignment,
               to make this ceramic elephant, and
               um...and we had eight weeks to do
               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was
               like a lamp, and when you pull the
               trunk the light was s'posed to go
               on...my light didn't go on, I got a
               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...
               When I signed up, you know, for the
               course I mean.  I thought I was
               playing it real smart, you know.
               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,
               it'll be such an easy way to
               maintain my grade point average...

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Why'd you think it'd be easy?

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Have you seen some of the dopes that
               take shop?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'
               idiot!

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't
               make a lamp?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               No, you're a genius because you
               can't make a lamp...

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               What do you know about Trigonometry?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               I could care less about

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Bender, did you know without
               Trigonometry there'd be no
               engineering?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Without lamps, there'd be no light!

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>              Okay so neither one of you is any
               better than the other one...

     Allison feels left out.

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               I can write with my toes!  I can

<b>                            BENDER

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               I can't do anything.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               Now, everybody can do something...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               There's one thing I can do, no
               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean
               that guy's been doing that show for
               thirty years.

<b>                            CLAIRE

               you won't laugh...I can't believe
               I'm actually doing this...

     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it
     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.

     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.

      Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               All right, great!  Where'd you learn

<b>                            CLAIRE

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               That was great, Claire...my image of

<b>                           ALLISON

<b>                            BENDER

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               You fucking prick!

     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his
     words hitting home.

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               What do you care what I think,
               anyway?  I don't even count, right?
               I could disappear forever and it
               wouldn't make any difference...I may
               as well not even exist at this
               school, remember?
                    (he turns to Claire)
               And you...don't like me anyway!

<b>                            CLAIRE

               Right?  You know what I got for
               Christmas this year?  It was a
               banner fuckin' year at the old
               Bender family!  I got a carton of
               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me
               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"
               Okay, so go home'n cry to your

     There are a few beats.

</b>               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came
               walking up to you in the hall on
               Monday, what would you do?  I mean
               picture this, you're there with all
               the sports.  I know exactly what
               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and
               when he left you'd cut him all up
               so your friends wouldn't think you
               really liked him!

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               No way!

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               'Kay, what if I came up to you?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Same exact thing!

<b>                            BENDER
</b>                    (furious and screaming at Claire)
               You are a bitch!

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,
               that makes me a bitch?

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that
               is to do to someone!  And you don't
               got the balls to stand up to your
               friends and tell 'em that you're
               gonna like who you wanna like!

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!
               Why don't you take Allison to one of
               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or
               take Brian out to the parking lot at
               lunch to get high?  What about Andy
               for that matter, what about me?
               What would your friends say if we
               were walking down the hall together.
               They'd laugh their asses off and
               you'd probably tell them you were
               doing it with me so they'd forgive
               you for being seen with me.

<b>                            BENDER

               Don't you ever talk about my
               friends!  You don't know any of my
               friends, you don't look at any of my
               friends and you certainly wouldn't
               condescend to speak to any of my
               friends so you just stick to the
               things you know, shopping, nail
               polish, your father's BMW and your
               poor--rich--drunk mother in the

<b>                            BENDER
</b>               And as far as being concerned about
               what's gonna happen when you and I
               walk down the hallways at school,
               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never
               gonna happen!  Just bury your head
               in the sand...and wait for your

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               No...I don't think the kind of

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               I just wanna tell, each of you,
               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't
               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's
               real shitty...

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               Your friends wouldn't mind because
               they look up to us...

     Brian laughs at her.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're

               I hate it!  I hate having to go
               along with everything my friends say!

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Well then why do you do it?

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               I don't know, I don't...you don't
               understand..you don't.  You're not
               friends with the same kind of people
               that Andy and I are friends with!
               You know, you just don't understand
               the pressure that they can put on
               you!

     Brian is shocked.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               I don't understand what?  You think
               I don't understand pressure, Claire?
               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!

     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.

<b>                            BRIAN

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk

</b>
<b>                            ANDREW

<b>                            BRIAN

</b>               I can't have an F, I can't have it
               and I know my parents can't have it!
               Even if I aced the rest of the
               semester, I'm still only a B.  And
               everything's ruined for me!

     Brian bashes a chair over.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               So I considered my options, you

<b>                            CLAIRE
</b>               No!  Killing yourself is not an

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I

<b>                           ALLISON

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               No, it was a flare gun, went off
               in my locker.

<b>                            ANDREW
</b>               Really?

     Andrew starts to laugh.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               It's not funny...

     They all start to laugh, including Brian.

<b>                            BRIAN
</b>               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was

     Everyone laughs.

<b>                           ALLISON

               different.  I can see your face.

<b>                           ALLISON
</b>               Is that good or bad?

</b>                    (laughing)
               It's good!

     Allison smiles.

     We see Brian laugh and give himself a congratulatory
     punch in the arm.

     The five are walking down the hall where they are met
     by Carl, sweeping up.  Brian nods at him.

<b>39. EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
     Brian gets into his dad’s car and leaves.
     Andrew and Allison kiss, Allison rips a patch off
     Andrew’s jacket and gets into the car.

     Andrew's dad arrives and looks at him, then at Allison.

    Andrew gets into the car and they drive off.

     We see Claire take out one of her diamond earrings
     and put it into Benders hand.  They kiss and she gets
     into her car.  She leaves.

     We see Bender put the earring in his ear.

<b>40. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     We see Vernon pick up Brian's essay and begin to read.

</b>               Dear Mr. Vernon, we accept the fact
               that we had to sacrifice a whole
               Saturday in detention for whatever
               it was we did wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make an essay
               telling you who we think we are.
               You see us as you want to see us...
               In the simplest terms, in the most
               convenient definitions.

<b>41. EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

     We see Bender walking towards us as Brian's monologue
     continues.

</b><b>                    (CONT'D)

               one of us is a brain...

<b>                        ANDREW (VO)

<b>                         ALLISON (VO)

</b>               Does that answer your question?
               Sincerely yours, the Breakfast Club.

     We see Bender walking across the football field
     as he thrusts his fist into the air in a silent cheer
     and freezes there.
