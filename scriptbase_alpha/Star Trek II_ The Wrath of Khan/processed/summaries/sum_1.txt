It is the 23rd century.
Admiral James T. Kirk is feeling old; the prospect of accompanying his old ship, the USS Enterprise--now a Starfleet Academy training ship--on a two-week cadet cruise is not making him feel any younger.
But the training cruise becomes a deadly serious mission when his nemesis Khan Noonien Singh--genetic conqueror from late 20th century Earth--appears after years of exile.
He begins capturing Project Genesis, a device holding the power of creation itself, and schemes the utter destruction of Kirk.
