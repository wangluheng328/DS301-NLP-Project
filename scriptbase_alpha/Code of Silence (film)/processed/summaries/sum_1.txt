Chuck Norris plays a tough, honest, Chicago cop.
He gets trapped in the middle of an Italian-American mob war and tries to rescue an innocent kidnap victim.
An underlying plot is Norris bucking the department over a questionable shooting of an Italian-American kid by a veteran cop.
The only witness is a young police officer.
