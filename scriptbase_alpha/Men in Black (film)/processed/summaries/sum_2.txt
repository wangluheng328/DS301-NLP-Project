In present-day America, Agent K is a member of an organization that has been keeping track of extra-terrestrial aliens on Earth for over 40 years.
When K finds himself in need of a new partner, a brash NYPD detective, James Edwards fills the position, becoming Agent J.
Armed with space-age technology (which J barely understands) and their razor-sharp wits, J and K investigate a newcomer who is bad news for Earth.
