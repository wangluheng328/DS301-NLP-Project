Young Helen Keller (Patty Duke), blind and deaf since infancy due to a severe case of scarlet fever, is frustrated by her inability to communicate and subject to frequent violent and uncontrollable outbursts as a result.
Unable to deal with her, her terrified and helpless parents contact the Perkins School for the Blind for assistance.
In response they send Anne Sullivan (Anne Bancroft), a former student, to the Keller home to tutor her.
What ensues is a battle of wills as Anne breaks down Helen's walls of silence and darkness through persistence, love, and sheer stubbornness.
