When burglars break in to a newly-bought house expecting to find money, they find its owners sleeping upstairs.
The odds are against the claustrophobic mother and her child with low blood sugar when they are locked into the Panic Room, a room where they are "safe" from criminals.
Unfortunately, they are locked in with the very money that the burglars want...and the burglars threaten to come in...or make the family of two come out.
