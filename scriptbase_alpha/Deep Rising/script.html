               An enormous Japanese BATHYSCAPHE free-falls through the
               water. An autonomous fifteen-man submersible. Almost
               futuristic in its design. The nose cone is an amazing ultra
               high-pressure plexi-dome. LETTERING along the side tells us
               this is the "SHINKAI 90000." 

               COMPUTER PRINTED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

               The JAPANESE CAPTAIN watches a DLD laser tracking system and
               barks one-word questions to his JAPANESE CREW. The Sailors
               work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers. The
               JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic
               position board, a contiuously-shifting graphic representation
               of the ocean contours below. Behind them is an elaborate
               DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet and
               dropping. The Crew works at a fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS
               as the depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes on the depth
               gauge. Several Science Officers share excited looks.

<b>         4     ON THE DEPTH GAUGE: 35,100 -- 35,200 -- 35,300 -- 35,400...4
</b>
               The excitement builds. Even the Captain's weathered eyes
               widen. And then, as the depth gauge hits 35,801 feet below
               sea level, the entire Crew breaks into CHEERS, WHOOPS,
<b>               HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES.

               As it continues its descent, it passes corroding metal drums
               leaking toxic waste, radioactive waste, dumped in the depths,
               away from prying eyes, and populated areas. The vessel drops
               into the SULU BASIN. Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty
               thousand feet of water. 

               But the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon.

               Down here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm.

               The dual TURBO-PROPS on the ear of the submersible KICK ON.
               The Bathysaphe is now mobile. It glides down the side of an
               enormous rock face, carefully avoiding massive sandstone
               pinnacles which jut up from the ocean floor far below.

</b>
               THE SHINKAI hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate. A ROBOTIC
               ARM extends out from under the plexi-dome. Its "hand" is a
               high-tech LASER CUTTER. It approaches the plate, steadies,
               then fires a direct BLUE BEAM at the bedrock, burns the rock
               into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern. 

               Another ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward, its CLAW rips out the
               cut rock from inside the pattern, then takes the sample and
               sets it inside a hydro-basket on the submersible's port side.

               A desolate, barren, spooky place. Nothing breathes. Nothing
               lives. Or so it would appear. The creepy, foreboding MUSICAL
               SCORE tells us otherwise. The Shinkai ENTERS a huge ROCK
<b>               FISSURE.

</b>
               The Captain and the Science Officers stare through the plexi
               dome and out into the freezing, cobalt blue of the PALAWAN
               TROUGH. The MUSIC intensifies as they round each curve. Then,
               dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half-blocked
               by a rock-encrusted embankment. 

               The MUSIC builds. 

               The Shinkai approaches the embankment. Slowly starts to glide
               up the side. The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized
               by all the lonely creepiness. They crest the embankment. And
               the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror. 

               As far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is
               filled with WHALE BONES. A valley of death. Cluttered here
               and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of
               several ships. Seemingly ripped apart. Clusters of shark
               cartilage float through the water like white ghosts. 

               The Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just
               stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them.

               The vessel cruises through the valley of death. Everyone is
               nervously taking readings, making calculations and adjusting
               equipment. 

               Gone is the excitement and euphoria of the record breaking.

               Several Crewmen cast nervous glances out through the plexi
               dome. Giant skeletons everywhere.

               The Shinkai approaches an eerie-looking rock formation. The
               robotic arm comes out. The laser cutter steadies, aims, then
               shoots out its blue beam and cuts into the rock.

<b>               WHOOSH!! A HUGE JET STREAM OF INKY BLOOD BLASTS OUT OF THE

</b>
               The Captain and the Science Officers recoil as the inky stuff
               envelopes the plexi-dome, completely blotting out the VIEW.

               The Shinkai VANISHES into a huge cloud of inky blood. We HOLD
               for a LONG OMINOUS BEAT. And then, like a slow-motion
               earthquake, large boulders and giant crevices begin to shift
               in the murky waters. WHALE BONES TOPPLE and SCATTER. Several
               feet under the ancient silt, something is coming alive.

               Everything outside the plexi-dome is still BLACK. Everyone is
               staring at the position board, which shows a large section of
               the OCEAN FLOOR STARTING TO MOVE, its contours incongruous
               with the rest of the graphic representation. 

               The Science Officers look stunned. The Captain barks
               commands. The Crew leaps into high gear. 

               Then the Captain reverses the trottle, and petal-to-the-metal
               he starts to back out. 

               The inky blood swirls past the plexi-dome. Then suddenly, and
               impossibly, the SUBMERSIBLE JERKS TO A HALT. Everybody goes
               ass-over-teacups. EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. SPARKS FLY. GLASS
               BREAKS. Lots of YELLING in Japanese. 

               The SHINKAI starts to ROCK and SHAKE. Something has a hold on
               it. More EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. Men are thrown about. Then it
               stops rocking. The Sailors stop yelling. Everything goes dead
               quiet. Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks. A SOUND is
               HEARD coming from the exterior of the ship, like feet runing
               across the outside of the hull. Very creepy. 

               The HULL starts to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE.
               And then the sub begins to be crushed like it's a beer can.
               The metal HULL TORQUES on all sides. RIVETS POP and SNAP.
               WATER SPRAYS and SHOOTS. More SPARKS FLY. The STEEL PLATING
               DIMPLES, CRUMBLES and SCREAMS in agony. CHAOS. PANDEMONIUM.
               And then the SHINKAI IMPLODES. A massive CHURNING SWIRL of
               water, metal and men.

               FINNEGAN, bathed in the last light of day, all taut muscle
               and sinew, all business, with every one of his 38 years
               etched on his rugged, good looking face, is harnessed into

               propelled, it seems, by the music blasting out of four state

               Wearing a mechanic's toolbelt, slung sideways across the hips
               like a gunslinger, singing the theme to "Gilligan's Island"
               over the engine's roar. Way off-key. His hands crammed deep
               in a tangle of wires. On the walls are a few pictures: Of a
               few major league engines. Of a few major league pinups, and a

               nervous eyes around six men, big, bad men, standing on the

               A Maori(VIVO). Two Aussies(MASON and MULLIGAN). A

               Tattooed, armed to the teeth, packed in Kevlar body armor.
               Mercenaries. Who would as soon wring your neck as shake your

               Smoother than the rest, but still showing the edge of a man

               Finnegan's hand finds the console. He hits a button. The

               The smile Trillian bestows on the old woman is loving,

               Hanover watches calmly as BILLY, the Aborigine, cracks his
               fist against the side of Pantucci's head, knocking him out of
               Vivo's arms.

               BILLY hoists Pantucci. He draws his knife under Pantucci's
               bloody nose.

               The Chinese merc steps forward, and whaps Pantucci upside the
               head with a cruelly accurate crescent kick. Pantucci hits the
               wall hard, crumbling. Chin lifts him.

               Mason raises his ham of a fist drawing his tree trunk arm
               back, taking dead aim at Pantucci's face. He never gets the
               punch off. His arm is caught from behind. He looks over his
               shoulder to Finnegan. Gripping his wrist. Right in his face.

               Mason, enraged, swings with his free hand. Finnegan twists
               his arm sharply, sending Mason's head into the steel wall,
               knocking the big man senseless. The other mercenaries go to
               draw their weapons. Before the guns are out of holsters,

               Finnegan cocks the spear. CLICK! Hanover does not blink.
               Everyone freezes. With his free hand Finnegan lifts Pantucci
               to his unsteady feet, the spear stays poised. Finnegan backs

               With a quick look over her shoulder, she enters the vault.

               box.
               Finding it, she pulls a lock pick from her fabulous coiffure,

               box, Trillian removes the only thing she came for. A dazzling
               diamond ring with the center stone the size of an egg. With a
               twist, she pops the stone from the setting, holds it up to

               Finnegan slams the piece of speed boat into the back of
               Mason's knees buckling him to the floor. In the blink of an
               eye there is the barrel of a .45 pressed hard against his
               head, Hanover at the trigger end.

               Hanover cracks Finnegan across the face with the barrel of

               Everyone jumps, freaked. Mulligan and Vivo spin around and
               OPEN FIRE. Start BLOWING the shit out of the TROLLEY CAR. The
               GUNS sound like nothing we've ever heard. ROLLING THUNDER.
               Absolutely deafening.

               The GUNFIRE ECHOES through the hull. Suddenly, with a loud
               SPLASH, a sixteen-foot-long LIFEBOAT pops to the surface.
               Then another LIFE BOAT POPS UP. Then ANOTHER. Then THREE MORE
               off to the port side. Then TWO MORE off to the starboard.
               It's as if the SOUND of the GUNFIRE is somehow releasing the
               boats from their watery graves. They start to drift away.
               Spooky quiet.

               Finnegan finally tilts the muzzle of Mulligan's gun to the
               ceiling. They stop firing. A little wigged-out. Their
               professional demeanor going by the boards. All goes quiet.
               They look at Finnegan, who is the picture of calm.

               Trillian goggily crawls out from under a mound of boxes. Her
               left eye's got a nice purple shiner. Her elegant gown is
               ripped. 

               A VERY STRANGE SOUND coming from behind the wall. Wet. Gooey.
               Slithery. Ominous. 

               Trillian freezes.

               The SOUND slowly MOVES across the wall. Then another WALL
               starts to GURGLE. Trillian spins around. She forces herself
               not to panic. Very cautiously, taking small measured steps
               she reaches the handle to the freezer, and tries to open it.
               No go. 

               The gurgling ripples above her. Her mouth goes dry as her
               eyes follow the sound across the ceiling. Her hand goes to
               her hair. She pulls her lock pick out, and very slowly kneels
               down until she is eye level with the door lock. She begins to
               pick her way out, her ears and eyes following the gurgling
               above. Suddenly the sound stops. The silence makes Trillian's
               heart sound that much louder. She sidles close to the wall.

               nothing. And then...

               Something slams against the wall from the other side in

               her throat.

               Vivo pulls his feet further up on the barrel.

               Then out of the corner of his eye, Vivo sees SOMETHING MOVE.
               He spins around. Nothing but pipes and hoses.

               Finnegan and Pantucci stop working. All eyes are focused on
               the maze of pipes. THINGS are HISSING, HUMMING and RUMBLING.
               Nothing moves.

               Disgusted, Vivo puts his feet in the water, gingerly.

               He walks toward the mass of hissing pipes. His pulse rifle
               rising.

               Then he hears a strange SLURPING and SUCKING SOUND coming
               from behind some gears at the end of a little alleyway.

               Vivo slowly goes in for a closer look, gun out front, heading
               down the little alleyway. He looks behind some pipes. The
               SLURPING gets LOUDER. Then he sees it. His eyes widen --

<b>                                   VIVO (CONT'D)

               And that's the last thing he ever says. Because just then,
               from a dark area between the pipes, SOMETHING SHOOTS OUT!

               Mulligan, Finnegan, and Pantucci stare in horrified amazement
               as Vivo is viciously YANKED into the pipes.
               A moment later a WASH OF BLOOD is FLUNG across a wall.
               Mulligan freaks out, aims his rifle at the pipes.

               As Mulligan's attention diverts, Finnegan instinctively heads
               for Vivo's rifle, lying on the floor. Mulligan swings around.
               KACHUNK!! His rifle is armed. The laser dot fixes on
               Finnegan's forehead.

               Finnegan freezes, looking up at a very freaked out Mulligan.

               She shrugs, must be her imagination. From inside her low cut

               -- Mason JERKS the vault door open. A FIRE-AXE SWING DOWN
               into his head, WHUMP! Kills him instantly. Eyes wide open.
               Everybody freaks out. Jumps back. Hanover lets go of
               Trillian, and stares into the vault directly at Nigel Canton.
               Holding the axe.

               Behind Canton the Captain is on the floor, in severe pain,
               his clothes are ripped up, REVEALING nasty looking RED SCARS,
               blistered and puffy, all over his chest and arms.

               Chin jams his rifle to the middle of Canton's forehead, and
               cocks a round into the chamber.

               But this is one soldier who is slow to obey the order.
               Hanover grabs Chin by both shoulders and gives a colossal
               yank.

               Finnegan and Pantucci hit the watery deck. 

               BULLETS RICOCHET everywhere. Mulligan is WHIPPED across the
               floor. SCREAMING in fear. His pulse-rifle goes flying. He's
               SLAMMED into a metal pylon, then SUCKED into a dark void in
               the pipes. All in the blink of an eye. 

               Finnegan grabs Mulligan's pulse-rifle. OPENS FIRE. BLASTING

               Everyone hears the MASSIVE GUNFIRE. Hanover looks around for

               scared enough to forget the reason she came cruising in the

               billowing and clanging of the engines. Smoke and sparks
               obscure their vision.

               Both of them listen to the silence. And then, at the far end
               of the grating, one grate rises...and falls. Finnegan and
               Pantucci watch, transfixed. Then, like a locomotive gathering
               speed, the grates start rising and falling, faster and
               faster, clanking louder and louder, headed right for the two
               of them.

               Finnegan and Pantucci run up the stairs as fast as they
               can...just as the grate they were standing on rises and
               falls. Silence returns. Except for the steaming, creaking
               machinery...and an ominous sucking sound.

               Trillian comes running down the passageway to a freight
               elevator. Looking over her shoulder, she hits the button. The
               elevator doors open to a freight elevator large enough to
               hold a dozen people. Trillian rushes in and hits the up
               button. She breathes a sigh of relief as the steel doors
               close...until the elevator starts going down.

               She panics. And starts pushing the up button frantically, her
               heart pounding in her chest.
               There is not a sound except for the hum of the elevator
               descending...until something drops on the roof with a THUMP!
               Trillian screams. The elevator comes to a bumps stop.

               Trillian shrinks from the ceiling of the elevator...and then
               the car starts to move again.

               Trillian pounds on ever button on the console, to no avail.
               The car continues its inexorable descent. Finally, in
               desperation, she hits the emergency stop button. The elevator
               stops. The emergency SIREN WHINES. A LONG BEAT. Nothing
               moves...and then...

               WHAM! Something beats on the roof, trying to break in. And
               again -- WHAM! The ELEVATOR SHUDDERS and continues its
               descent. Trillian backs up against the wall, staring at the
               ceiling, scared. The ELEVATOR DINGS! 

               Startled, TRILLIAN SCREAMS. The DOORS start to OPEN.
               Panicked, Trillian raises the only weapon at her disposal...a
               high heel. The DOORS OPEN. -- SOMETHING LUNGES IN! Trillian
               swings her high heel...right into Pantucci's face! 

               Finnegan plows in right behind him.

               Trillian buries her high heel into the back of Finnegan's
               hand, breaking his grip.

               Trillian and Finnegan turn to Pantucci who is looking down at
               the floor where a mass of yellow slime has dripped from the
               ceiling. All look up to the yellow goo dripping from the
               ceiling...followed by a sucking sound.

<b>                                   TRILLIAN
</b>                         It's up there!!

               Finnegan lifts his pulse rifle and blasts the ceiling. The
               sucking sound stops.

<b>                                   FINNEGAN
</b>                         Not anymore.

               The elevator stops. DING! The door opens. Finnegan whirls his
               rifle, rising. Trillian lifts her high heel, ready to
               strike... 

               Hanover, Chin, and Mamooli have their massive guns trained on
               the car. The Captain and Canton quiver behind them. There is
               a momentary stand off.

               Chin charges Finnegan, the butt of his rifle raised to smash
               Finnegan's skull. Finnegan parries and drives Chin into the
               rear wall of the elevator. Mamooli jumps Finnegan from
               behind, wrapping his rifle against Finnegan's throat.
               Pantucci jumps on Mamooli's massive back, ripping at his
               face. Finnegan drops, buries his elbow in Mamooli's solar
               plexus, spins, and has his knife out of his boot and at
               Mamooli's throat in a flash. 

               ANGLE ON: Trillian. Impressed. She had no idea.

               The Captain and Canton are only to happy to comply. As they

               on her.

               And then the jerking stops...and the sound of sucking
               surrounds the car. The cable starts twisting, creaking
               sickeningly above their heads.

               with the bloodcurdling shrieking of the metal elevator frame
               against the shaft. Finnegan's eyes go to the floor indicator.

               Which is actually good, because it's getting jammed sideways
               in the shaft which slows it down. The it HITS bottom with a

               Pantucci steps on something. CRUNCH! He looks down, his eyes
               widen.

               He starts dancing around, trying not to step on whatever it
               is. Trillian looks down and SCREAMS. 

               Everybody freaks -- 

               Finnegan grabs a flashlight from Chin's utility belt, and
               sweeps the beam over the lobby. The entire floor of the lobby
               is littered with shattered HUMAN SKELETONS. Picked clean and
               spit out. Just like the earlier whale bones. 

               Then suddenly, at the far end of the hallway, one of the
               metal WALLS suddenly EXPANDS and FLEXES. Everybody feezes.
               And then the FLEXING suddenly comes RACING down either side
               of the hallway, accompanied by the most god-awful PRIMORDIAL
<b>               SCREECH!

               FINNEGAN BOLTS. Everybody else right behind him. The FLEXING
               and SCREECHING VANISHES into the walls.

               Damp, dark and disgusting. A MAZE of pipes and gears lines
               the walls. Finnegan SLAMS the HATCH shut. Dogs it tight.
               Everyone's gathering themselves around the room: Trillian,

               Canton flashes Hanover a look. The Captain is confused.
               Trillian suddenly GRABS CANTON, spins him around and SLAMS
               him against the hull.

               Unseen by anyone, there is MOVEMENT within the MACHINERY. The
               walls start to come alive with dark, SHADOWY IMPRESSIONS.
               HIDDEN within the maze of machinery, OBSCURED by the bad
               lighting, glistening abominations slither over pipes, squirm
               through gears, and undulate in and out of crevices and holes.
               The room is becoming a living, throbbing, pulsating horror.

               Everybody slowly and quietly moves for the far hatch. Then a
               loud GURGLING is HEARD. Everybody looks up at the ceiling. 

               Hidden within the girders, and sticking to them, a large
               translucent INTESTINE-like thing CROSSES the ceiling. Inside
               it are strange, disgusting biological workings. The GURGLING
               suddenly gets dramatically LOUDER. And then we SEE BILLY and
               LEILA, being sucked down the entire length of the fatty
               intestine. Still alive. And squirming wildly. EVERYBODY
               freaks out and HAULS ASS for the hatch. Finnegan and Hanover
               OPEN FIRE. Covering their asses.

               chambers in a sort of surreal horror tableau. We catch more

               Finnegan comes to a ladderstair leading to a catwalk. He
               starts to climb. Trillian, hampered by her long slinky dress,
               rips at the bottom, making it maxi to mini in a flash, and
               scoots after Finnegan.

               next to Finnegan, who is deciding which way to go.

               SNAP!! A TENTACLE SHOOTS OUT between Finnegan and Trillian.
               Just missing them as it SLAMS into a wall. 

               Finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed.
               Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt.
               Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks -- 

               The TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach.
               Trying to find its prey. Finnegan is frozen in place.
               Watching. Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees
               -- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up
               and down the Tentacle. WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling
               their way across the wall. Getting closer and closer to
               Finnegan. 

               Finnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's
               feet. He motions for her to push it toward him. But, frozen
               in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her.
               Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall.
               FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head. Then he BRUSHES
               against some dirt, making a SCRAPING SOUND. 

               A Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm. He
               leaps to his feet. So does Trillian. She grabs the rifle,
               turns and bolts off down the dark alley. Finnegan tries to
               run, but the Feelers hold him tight. Two more Feelers slap
               onto his arm. HE YELLS. 

               The Creature starts reeling him in. 

               ANGLE ON: Trillian, running. Finnegan's YELL reaches her. She
               stops cold. Looking back the way she came, torn. 

               ANGLE ON: Finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being
               reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle.
               When...out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running
               back. Panting hard, she aims the gun.

</b>                         Shoot it! Shoot it!

               Spurred to action, Trillian jams the rifle barrel against the
               tentacle and pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.

</b>                         The safety! The safety!

               Trillian frantically fumbles around, looking for the right
               lever on the complicated, sophisticated weapon, trying to
               find it.

</b>                         On the side!!

               Desperate, unable to find it, she does the next best
               thing...she swings her rifle like it's a baseball bat. SMACKS
               the TENTACLE. HARD. RIPPING into its flesh. It SQUIRTS ink
               blood, releases Finnegan and recoils.

               Finnegan drops to his knees. Grabbing his arm, in pain. The
               tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again.
               Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to
               his feet, and starts to drag him backward. The tentacle
               coils, ready to strike. Just before it does so, Finnegan
               grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and
               fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces.

               The Captain is stuck in a strange gelatinous spider web.
               Struggling, frantic. But the more he struggles, the more
               enmeshed he gets. He holds his hands out beseechingly to
               Canton, who stands looking at him in terror.

               But Canton does not move. All of a sudden Canton sees
               something deep in the web, behind the Captain, which makes
               his blood freeze.

               The Captain tries to look over his shoulder to see what it
               is. There is a DARK MOVEMENT deep within the spider web.

               Canton backs away from the Captain, as the Captain's struggle
               draws him further into the web. The Captain's eyes bulge,
               horrified, as he feels SOMETHING inside the spider web GRAB
               him from behind.

               He struggles WILDLY. Then starts to freeze up as the
               tentacles wrap around him. 

               Finnegan and Trillian race across the floor as the Captain is
               slowly sucked deeper into the spider web; his face and body
               bady constricting, paralyzed. His VOICE is CHOKED OFF.

               Hanover, Chin, Mamooli and Pantucci burst out of another
               alleyway. Finnegan and Trillian reach the Captain just as his
               FACE is SUCKED into the gelatinous web. They skid to a stop.
               Everybody piles up. Eyes wide. Watching as the Captain's body
               is pulled deeper into the dark web. Tentacles enveloping him.

               faces. Breath coming in short nervous bursts. Hearts pounding
               out of chests. 

               The ominous MUSICAL SCORE adds to the tension. 

               Then the EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON. A creepy-looking
               reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship. Finnegan
               continues on. Followed by the others. All sweating hard. Eyes
               nervously shifting. Fear thick in the air. 

               LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A METAL GATE, we SEE Finnegan, Trillian
               and the others passing below. Then suddenly, in the dark
               foreground -- SOMETHING WET WRIGGLES across the gate. They
               come to a door. Finnegan tries the handle. No go. Finnegan
               turns to Canton, and mimes for keys. Canton shakes his head.
               He has none.

                         Very good Finnegan...very good.

               Trillian moves up to Finnegan. She reaches into her hair, and
               pulls out her trusty lockpick. As he watches, somewhat
               mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times,
               and depresses the handle. Click! The door opens. Finnegan
               looks at her curiously, but with respect.

               They ENTER the rear ballast section, where the walls are
               indeed far apart, half of which is now a small POND.
               Obviously flooded. The only way out of this room is down some
               STEPS which VANISH beneath the seawater, or through a single
               violently twisted HATCH DOOR. 

               Finnegan tries to push the hatch. It will not give. 

               Mamooli and Chin join him, adding their considerable muscle
               to the task. The hatch holds tight. Finnegan turns to Canton,
               who stands slumped against a railing. He does not look well
               at all.

               With a smile, Finnegan dives under. Pantucci right behind

               Finnegan SWIMS down to the floor of the ballast. Then into a
               passageway lined with black pipes. Pantucci right behind him.
               STRANGE NOISES REVERBERATE through the MURKY waters. 

               CREAKS and MOANS. Spooky shit. Both men are wide-eyed as they
               swim. Weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts.
               The THINGS could come out of almost anywhere. Bubbles drift
               up from the darkness below. 

               The MUSIC IS TENSE...VERY VERY TENSE. Pantucci falls behind.
               He swims around a curve and right into a SEVERED HUMAN ARM!
               AIR BUBBLES BLAST out of his mouth as he SCREAMS. The fingers
               on the dead hand seem to reach out for him. He fights his way
               past and swims off in a panic.

               Trillian stares down into the water. Hanover keeps a sharp,
               nervous eye back down the catwalk, white-knuckling his pulse
               rifle. Chin and Mamooli keep watch, tight lipped. Canton
               paces back and forth, driven by anxiety.

               Canton acts as if he does not hear. He keeps pacing. Hanover
               chops sharply with the stock of his rifle into Canton's arm.
               Canton crumbles against the railing, in pain.

               of glistening striated MUSCLE.

               The three men open up with their pulse rifles. The CREATURE
               gets RIPPED TO SHREDS. Red and blue INK-BLOOD SPLATTERS
               everywhere. But onward it comes. Down the gangway. 

               Trillian grabs the pistol off Chin's utility belt, and opens
               fire. Canton jumps into the water and disappears.

               Finnegan explodes to the surface. GASPING for air. He reaches

               without warning Hanover drops his rifle and dives into the
               water, disappearing beneath the surface. 

               Trillian is astounded. She throws down her pistol, picks up
               the pulse rifle, and slams on the trigger. The recoil of the
               rifle throws her into the water. When she surfaces, she sees
               Chin and Mamooli, firing as they retreat to the water's edge.
               Still holding her rifle, she dives.

               open, eyes wide, screaming in agony, being ripped past her.
               She tries to fire her rifle. Too late. Trillian watches as
               Chin VANISHES down the shaft in a CLOUD OF BUBBLES.

               Trillian can only nod, and gasp for breath. Canton and

               Hanover reaches over to retrieve the rifle in Trillian's
               hand. Trillian points the barrel at him, and hits the safety.

                         the fish.

               The LIQUID SHADOW OOZES down and hits the floor, starts to
               EXPAND, filling like a water balloon. It's not a liquid. It's
               a Tentacle. VEINS, FEELERS and SUCKERS begin to form.

               The TENTACLE slowly RISES UP right behind Mamooli. Inches
               behind his head. Finnegan and Hanover see it. Eyes widening.

               Mamooli turns to the tentacle looming over him, about to
               strike.

               He opens fire, emptying his clip into the tentacle. The
               tentacle retreats into the pipes. Mamooli looks around. The
               room is empty. He runs out.

               Mamooli rushes into the empty passageway, looks left. Then
               right. His POV. Down the hall another TENTACLE comes racing
               at him. Mamooli panics, drops his rifle. 

               TRACK WITH Mamooli racing down the hallway, looking over his
               shoulder in fear, as the tentacle comes racing after
               him...gaining...gaining... almost on him... Mamooli leaps
               through an open hatch, and swings it shut in one swift
               motion. The tentacle slams into the glass portal. Stopped.
               Mamooli keeps his eye on the portal, and backs up two steps.
               He lets out a long deep breath of relief, turns... WHAM!!!
               Another tentacle envelops his face!

               As they round a corner, the CEILING IMPLODES right in front

               Leaving only one route open...a slim passageway.

               Finnegan leads them single-file, they quickly head into a
               SHAKING narrow void. Fear has led to silence, and unbearable

               strange noises.

               Finnegan moves on. The others follow. Guns out front. TENSE.
               They round a huge metal pillar and come face-to-face with a
               soul-wrenching nightmare. The CREATURES' NEST -- OR STOMACH.

               Across a small portion of the ship's midsection, is a huge
               GELATINOUS WOMB. Imagine a massive thick wall of clear-yellow
               JELL-O, with hundreds of BLUE VEINS running through it.
               If it weren't all so horrific, it would be considered
               beautiful. Inside the womb, A DOZEN HUMANS, passengers, float
               around in some kind of twisted embryonic state, the living
               dead. They all seem to be breathing the gelatin. Several
               TENTACLES WRIGGLE through the stuff; which divides and re
               forms in some sort of strange mitosis. 

               Finnegan and the others look at the passengers, horrified.
               But even more horrifying is that the people can look back at
               them. Many start to reach out, seemingly in slow motion as
               their hands ooze through the thick gelatin. Trillian looks
               sick, trembles in fear.

               Canton looks like he's about to throw up, he starts backing
               away, heading for a side hatch.

               In the womb, a Tentacle suddenly approaches a sexy young
               LADY. The Lady tries to back-pedal away, but because of the
               gelatin, it's like one of those nightmares where you can only
               move in slow motion. The FEELERS GRIP her naked thigh. She
               tries to scream, but her face is already starting to
               constrict, her whole body is being paralyzed. Pantucci is so
               horrified he's about to cry.

</b>                         Oh no...oh God please no.

               The TENTACLE-SAC gloms onto the Lady's forehead. THROUGH THE
               SAC we can SEE her SKIN MELTING. The only thing she can move
               are her EYES, which are bugging-out in absolute horror as she
               is imbibed alive. Our heroes are frozen in fear. Until the
               Lady's EYES LIQUEFY. 

               Trillian burries her head in Finnegan's shoulder, trying to
               shut out the horror.

               He begins to lead her toward the hatch...when her eyes
               recognized the old lady with the orchid in her hair. The old
               lady seems to see her too. Her hands read out, IMPLORING. Her
               mouth silently shapes the words: HELP ME! Just as a tentacle
               comes creeping toward her.

               Spitting FLAMES and SMOKE. The BULLETS IMPACT the gelatin.
               BLASTING IT AWAY. But the bullets only manage to go about
               twenty feet into the thick shit before gliding to a stop.
               GELATIN EXPLODES all over the place. TRACER HOLES STREAK
               through the stuff. But all the bullets are sliding short.

               Finnegan looks around and spots the place in the ceiling
               where most of the Tentacles are coming from. Their long TAILS
               WIGGLE down from a massive clutter of pipes. A bas-relief of
               horror. Finnegan reaches over and yanks two thermite grenades
               off Hanover's utility belt.

               All the MOVEMENT STOPS. The remaining TENTACLES VANISH into

               covered in slime. Finnegan and Trillian also look up...and

               He yanks the blade. Trillian pulls. The seal pops. The portal
               flies open. Waist-high in water, Trillian sticks her arm out,

               There's just enough room between two metal beams to get out.
               The rising WATER SHOVES them up through the hole.

               starts SCRAMBLING through the water. UNDERWATER, the INKY

               himself into the opening of a dumbwaiter. SLAMS the DOOR

               CLOSE ON: Hanover's trembling FINGER. As it slowly squeezes
               the trigger. He want to kill himself. Needs to hill himself.
               He squeezes harder. The TRIGGER DEPRESSES! -- CLICK! The gun
               is empty. Hanover's mouth opens in a horrible, silent scream.

               Finnegan points to the water...and an INKY PSEUDOPOD FORM
               racing after the speedboat underwater.

                         sound...

               The Tentacle quickly picks up speed, going faster and faster,
               getting closer and closer, stretching further and further.
               Suddenly, behind them, a METALLIC THRASHING SOUND is HEARD.
               They turn around and look -- The hook, the tow-line, and the
               entire railing have dropped down onto the watersports
               platform and are tangled up around the two jet skis, trying
               to tear free -- The Saipan is still clinging by its
               fingernails to the Fuji Maru! Finnegan races over to a WINCH
               and grabs the winch- line.

               Canton, smiling brightly, peers at the approaching island
               through the speedboat's windscreen. So relieved he sings to

               When...YANK!!...the SPEEDBOAT is GRABBED from below,
               practically exploding as it DISINTEGRATES into TWO PIECES.
               Canton is PROPELLED through the windscreen and onto the hood.

               Finnegan struggles to clip the winch-line onto the tow-line,
               hanging precariously over the edge of the ship, clip in one
               hand, winch-line in the other. The whole METAL MESS is
               BUCKING and TWISTING and SCREECHING. His every joint is being
               ripped out of socket as he strains to get the clip on the
               line before the entire rig tears away into the sea. 

               With one last heroic effort of will and grit, he snaps the
               clip in place just as it all BREAKS LOOSE. One of the JET
               SKIS and the ENTIRE RAILING are RIPPED over the side and fall
               down into the ocean. Finnegan is also YANKED over the side,
               but he manages to hold on by his fingers, dangling
               precariously.

               The HOOK and the TOW-LINE drop -- then SNAP TAUGHT as the
               winch-line holds them tight.

               Trillian throws the start lever on the winch. The WINCH KICKS
               ON and starts reeling in the Saipan. Finnegan tries to crawl
               up on the deck, exhausted. Trillian reaches down and pulls
               him the rest of the way up. He half collapses on top of her.

               Despite the grimness of their position, the closeness of

               Canton is pinned to the hood of the speedboat, his face
               shredded by glass, his leg mangled, screaming as his panicked
               eyes watch a TENTACLE slowly squirm across the hood toward
               him, it's hideous feelers writhe and arch. Canton backs away
               from it as far as he can.

               Another TENTACLE SQUIRMS up next to him. Canton crawls away
               from that one. Its Feelers and Suckers unsheathe, dripping
               mucus. Canton's eyes widen, horrified. Then another TENTACLE
               SQUIRMS up. Canton crawls to the center of the hood. And
               another TENTACLE. Canton has nowhere to go. The Tentacles

               They step up to one of the big CRATES. Finnegan starts
               SMASHING it with the butt of his pulse-rifle. The CRATE BURST
               OPEN. REVEALING the WARHEAD of the torpedo. Trillian is

               moment. Something SWISHES in the water below her. Trillian's

               sloshing his way through the water. Trillian sees him coming.

               Finnegan turns as the DANCE FLOOR and the D.J. BOOTH EXPLODE
               as SOMETHING RISES UP from below them. His eyes widen. And
               there it is -- The huge, horrible, mutated, mucus-covered,
               sucker-faced HEAD OF THE CREATURE. 

               A giant mutated protoplasm. Jutting up from a breach in the
               floor. The trunk of the Creature, the part where all the
               Tentacles come from, is below the next deck. A slimy,
               translucent MEMBRANE slowly RISES, REVEALING what appears to
               be some sort of ORGANIC LIQUID EYE. It seems to stare right
               at Finnegan, who is transfixed by the sight. A Tentacle
               slowly starts to move in on Finnegan. 

               Finnegan starts making his way around the shattered debris
               that blocks his shot. The EYEBALL-type organism follows him.
               Another Tentacle starts to move. Silently undulating through
               the water towards Finnegan. The membrane over the EYE moves.
               And another Tentacle starts to close in for the kill. They
               are surrounding Finnegan. Finnegan comes around the shattered
               D.J. booth. Faces the Creature full-on. He can't miss. He
               gives it a wicked smile.

               In SLOW-MOTION, Finnegan lifts his pulse-rifle. It DRIPS
               WATER. He jams the gun-butt into his hip. Takes aim -- FIRES!
               But he only gets off one quick BURST before a TENTACLE LASHES
               OUT and GRABS him. JERKS him into the air. His pulse-rifle
               goes flying. Finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into
               the floor, and the death that awaits him.
               He struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer,
               closer. He is about to disappear down the hole of no return,
               when his hand comes up with his knife. He slashes the
               tentacle in two, scrambles up and heads for an open door. As
               he reaches the door, a tentacle rises up in front of him.
               Huge. Blocking his way. It's maw opens wide. A terrifying
               sight of jaws and teeth and death. About to devour him. As it
               strikes forward, Finnegan draws his shotgun, and blasts the
               vile thing to smithereens. He bolts through the door, several
               Tentacles already after him.

               TENTACLE SIDE-SWIPES him. Hard. SMASHES him into a wall.
               Finnegan DROPS the shotgun. Hits the floor running. Another
               TENTACLES CHECKS him. Sends him SPIRALING through a hatch. 

               Finnegan TUMBLES in. Face-first. Quickly rolls over and looks
               back -- A TENTACLE LASHES in through the doorway. Finnegan
               back-pedals on his hands and feet, stumbling over various
               sports equipment. The TENTACLE homes-in on him. CHARGES
               FORWARD. Finnegan hurls himself backwards. THROWING anything
               that comes to hand at the Tentacle. A VOLLEYBALL. A WATERSKI.
               A TACKLE BOX. A FRISBEE. But onward it comes. Finnegan back
               pedals faster. Over diving gear. Scuba tanks. Fins and masks. 

               The TENTACLE RISES. About to STRIKE. 

               Finnegan backs into the wall. Trapped. He spots a SPEARGUN.
               Grabs it. 

               The TENTACLE LUNGES. Finnegan FIRES. NAILS IT. PINS IT to the
               wall. Finnegan scrambles past the furiously WRITHING TENTACLE
               and runs out of the room.

               Trillian lifts up her feet as the jet ski touches down into
               the dark water. She frantically whispers to herself:

<b>                                   TRILLIAN
</b>                         Oh my God, oh my God.

               Suddenly, twenty feet from the jet ski, SOMETHING SWIRLS
               through the water. Trillian aims her pulse-rifle at it. Eyes
               wide. Knuckles white. Breathing hard. WHAMM!! Something drops
               onto the ski behind her.

               Finnegan whistles. Waits. No engine goes on. He whistles
               again. Still no response. Removes his watch, gives it to
               Trillian.

               He grabs Trillian's pulse rifle, and leaps up on the side of
               the Saipan, and scales up to the deck. Trillian watches him,
               and then looks at the watch.

               Then he spots something on the floor. He reaches down and
               picks it up. It's Pantucci's leather tool belt. It's been
               RIPPED TO SHREDS. Finnegan stares at it. His grip tightening.
               Tears rising in his eyes. His jaw clenching. Then he flings
               the belt aside. Filled with rage.

               Finnegan hits the ignition button. A desperate moment of dry
               cranking ...and then the one remaining engine catches,
               sputters, and fires to life.

               Trillian hears the Saipan's engine come to life. She hits the
               ignition on the jet ski. Right next to her something drops
               from the deck of the Saipan into the water. Finnegan clambers
               up in front of her. His pulse rifle still in hand.

               The Saipan strains on its leashes. ENGINES GUNNING. Finnegan
               swings his rifle around. OPENS UP on the tie-lines. All the
               TIE-LINES SHRED. The Saipan starts to break free.

               He GUNS the ski...and it stalls. The jet ski stalls. Goes
               dead in the water.

               Nearby, the WATER SWIRLS violently. He hammers the starter

               The ENGINE STUTTERS. He tries again.

               Another STUTTER. More WATER SWIRLS, getting closer now. But
               the third time's a charm. The jet ski comes to life and
               shoots off along the side of the ship. Just as a tentacle
               comes shooting out of the water. Finnegan fires at it,
               blowing it to pieces. The last TIE-LINE SNAPS. The SAIPAN
               LURCHES AWAY from the Fuji Maru. The jammed steering-sticks
               force the rudder to turn it in a tight circle.

               Finnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski. Pedal
               to the metal. Looking straight ahead. Trillian holds on for
               dead life. Suddenly, a WAVE EXPLODES in front of the jet ski.
               Finnegan cranks the handlebars. The JET SKI SLEWS SIDEWAYS.
               The Saipan starts to arc around. The WARHEAD gleams in the
               MOONLIGHT. Dripping water. Finnegan HAULS ASS away from the
               Fuji Maru. ENGINE ROARING. Throwing water. Another WAVE
               EXPLODES. A tentacle rears up. Right in front of the jet ski.
               Finnegan and Trillian lean hard. The JET SKI SKIDS sideways
               across the water.

<b>               BOUNCING HARD.
</b>
               Trillian can't hold on. Flips off the back. Skips across the
               water. Finnegan ROARS away. A tentacle hard on his ass.
               Trillian pops to the surface. Treads water. Panicked. Watches
               Finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind. Finnegan looks
               back at Trillian. Bobbing in the water. The he looks at the
               Saipan. Continuing its arc. Its deadly payload racing for the
               Fuji Maru. Finnegan CRANKS the HANDLEBARS. SMASHES through a
               wave and heads for Trillian. Trillian sees him and swims
               hard. The SAIPAN ROARS straight at the Fuji Maru. The warhead
               perfectly positioned to strike its hull. Only fifty meters
               away. Now forty. Now thirty-five.

</b>
               Finnegan cuts the motor of the jet ski. Slides up next to
               Trillian. Grabs her by her arm. Rips her out of the water.
               Throws her onto the back of the jet ski. Just as a tentacles
               rises up, lashing out. He GUNS IT. SMASHES through the waves.
               The WARHEAD SPLASHES through the water. The jet ski hauls
               ass.

<b>               ENGINES WHINING OUT.
</b>
               Faster and faster. A HUGE GEYSER OF WATER EXPLODES in front
               of the jet ski. A tentacle slaps down hard. Finnegan cuts
               hard. Too late. The JET SKI RAMPS through the geyser.
               They and the JET SKI TUMBLE and SPLASH across the water. The
<b>               SAIPAN CHARGES FORWARD. 
</b>
               Twenty-five meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru. No twenty
               meters away. Now fifteen.

               Finnegan pops to the surface. Looks around. Can't find
               Trillian. He DIVES under the water. His POV: Tentacles
               converging on him from the murky depths. The "retrieve"
               feature that's on all jet skis forces it back around towards
               where Finnegan and Trillian fell off. Finnegan BURST to the
               surface. Holding Trillian. She looks nearly lifeless. The jet
               ski heads right at them. Finnegan swims for it. Dragging
               Trillian. As tentacles converge from all sides. 

               The JET SKI is suddenly SUCKED under the water! Swallowed
               whole. Finnegan quickly reverses. Backstrokes like mad. The
               WARHEAD SLICES through the water. Now only ten meters away
               from hitting the Fuji Maru.

               Now nine meters away. Now eight. Seven. Six. Five.

<b>       153     GO INTO SLO-MO NOW AS:                                 153

               Finnegan paddles hard. Sucking in as much water as he is air.
               A TENTACLE RISES UP out of the water. Looms above Finnegan
               and Trillian. Dripping water. About to strike. There's
               nowhere to hide. Finnegan paddles harder.

<b>       154     COME OUT OF SLOW-MO AS:                                154
</b>
               The TENTACLE starts its DOWNWARD LUNGE. And that's when the
               SAIPAN RAMS the Fuji Maru. The WARHEAD SLAMS into its hull.

<b>               BA-WHOOOOOOMMM!!
</b>
               The SAIPAN EVAPORATES.

<b>               METAL FLIES.
</b>
<b>               WATER SPRAYS.
</b>
               FIRE FILLS the night sky. The TOP DECK of the Fuji Maru
               CARTWHEELS across the waves. The Tentacle above Finnegan
               drops like lead. And just lies there. Quivering. Another
               EXPLOSION. LIFTS the remains of the FUJI MARU out of the sea.
               Sends shock waves across the water. 

               Blows Finnegan's hair back. He swims on. Towards the island.
               Pulling Trillian. The remains of the SAIPAN and the FUJI MARU
               SMOLDER and SINK. BUBBLES EXPLODE to the surface.
               A couple dozen small FIRES dot the waves. WATER SIZZLES and
               STEAMS. SMOKE drifts into the night sky. Debris coats the
               water.

<b>                                                    SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               Finnegan and Trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the
               beach of the island. 

               They collapse next to each other. Finnegan is exhausted.
               Trillian coughs up seawater. They both turn and look out to
               sea, and the rising sun. Trillian reaches into her bra, and
               pulls out the egg sized diamond. She holds it up. The sun
               refracts off it brilliantly... 

               Trillian looks at the diamond, looks around at the picture
               perfect island, the picture perfect sunset...and then she
               heaves it as far as she can into the sea. For the first time
               since they know each other there is nobody around. No people.
               No tentacles. And when they look at each other, something
               else comes to mind besides survival. 

               Finnegan moves towards Trillian. Trillian moves towards
               Finnegan. Their lips move closer, closer... 

               And then, down by their feet -- SOMETHING EXPLODES OUT OF THE
               WATER! Scares the shit out of them. The audience too.

               But it's just Pantucci. Looking waterlogged and shell-
               shocked. Coughing up half the sea. Finnegan and Trillian help
               him to his feet.

               And then they head the most gut-wrenching, spine-tingling,
               teeth- shattering ROAR ever. Pure primeval. Like no sound or
               animal or thing we've ever hear beofre. Coming from DEEP

               Finnegan, Trillian, and Pantucci slowly turn and look INLAND.
               We BEGIN TO PULL BACK as they all stand up. MORE STRANGE
