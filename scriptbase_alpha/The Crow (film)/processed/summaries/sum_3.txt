Shelly and Eric were very much in love.
But no one gets married on Halloween, not in Detroit.
Shelly is raped and beaten by city boss Top Dollar's thugs, only to die 30 hours later in a hospital.
Eric is shot and pushed out a window.
A year later death is no longer what it was as Eric Draven, accompanied by a Crow and gifted with new powers and a world of grief and pain, is brought back to life to avenge his love's death.
After all, love is forever.
And some of us Believe in Angels.
