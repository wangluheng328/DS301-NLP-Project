Rock singer Eric Draven and his fianc√©e Shelly are brutally killed the night before Halloween, which is also the night before their wedding.
Exactly one year later, with the help of a crow, Eric wakes from the dead and takes revenge for his death and the death of the woman he loved.
Creepy, Gothic tale with fantastic shots of the city the plot takes place in and a scary, dark atmosphere.
The film mostly became a legend because its protagonist, Brandon Lee, ironically and "by accident" was killed during the shooting.
Still very interesting to watch with a great soundtrack.
