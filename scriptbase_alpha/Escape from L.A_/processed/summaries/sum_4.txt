Sequel to "Escape From New York".
In 2000, a huge earthquake hits Los Angeles which causes the whole city to be now situated on an island.
In that year the new life-term US President, an out-spoken moralist declares that all people not conforming to the high morals he sets for the country will be deported to the Los Angeles island.
Like New York, a wall is built, guards posted to stop any escapes and if sent there - you can't return to the US.
In 2013, Cuervo Jones, a terrorist invades the dreams of the President's daughter, Utopia, and brainwashes her into stealing a device from a weapons establishment and runs with Cuervo to the island.
Snake Plissken, hero of Escape From New York, is forced again to go to the island to get the device by the President (who doesn't care if Utopia returns or not.)
and he is poisoned to ensure his co-operation.
Like New York, Los Angeles is now a decaying city, a hot-bed of scum and weirdos and Snake has 9 hours to find the device and Utopia, and get out before the poison kicks in.
