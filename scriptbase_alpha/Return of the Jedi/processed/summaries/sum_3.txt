The Empire is more than halfway through construction of a new Death Star - almost twice as big, but more than twice as powerful.
When completed, it will spell certain doom for Luke Skywalker and the Rebels.
Han Solo is a prisoner of crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and Princess Leia soon finds herself in the gangster's hands.
Luke Skywalker, aided by C-3PO and R2-D2, makes his way into Jabba's palace, hoping to secure his friends' freedom.
But the Hutt has no intention of doing so and tries to kill them all.
After escaping from Jabba and the sands of Tatooine, they regroup with the Rebel fleet, which is massing for an attack against the new satellite battle station at Endor.
Lando Calrissian is pressed into action to lead the Rebel fighter attack, while Han is put in charge of a group of soldiers to take out the shield generator protecting the Death Star.
However, Luke surrenders to Vader's soldiers on Endor, and is taken in front of Vader's master - the Galactic Emperor - on the Death Star for final corruption to the Dark Side of the Force.
The fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ambushes the Rebels, cutting them off.
Worse, the new Death Star begins turning its giant laser on the Rebel carriers.
It appears that nothing will stop the Empire's triumph - unless things start to change quickly.
