The Fowlers are a normal family in Maine.
Matt is the town doctor and loves to fish, his wife, Ruth, is the school's choir leader, and their son, Frank, is home from his first year of college.
Frank is in love with Natalie, a young mother who isn't quite divorced yet from her ex-husband, Richard Strout, whose family runs the local cannery.
It makes Richard's blood run cold to see his wife running around with another man.
And soon, an unthinkable tragedy happens that will tear the Fowlers apart...
