<b>	T H E   A M E R I C A N   P R E S I D E N T
</b>
	Screenplay by Aaron Sorkin

<b>	--------------------------------------------------------------
</b>
<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
	As the OPENING TTTLES ROLL against a series of shots of
	statues and paintings of former presidents, we HEAR shards of
	dialogue from various presidential speeches.


<b>	MAIN TITLES END ON
</b>

<b>	EXT. BEAUTIFUL ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
	It's an early November morning, and the sun has just come
	over this extraordinary building. WE HOLD on this for a moment
	before we

<b>                                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. A CORRIDOR IN THE RESIDENCE - DAY
</b>
	A SECRET SERVICE AGENT presses the button by the private
	elevator as he talks into his shirt cuff.

<b>				AGENT COOPER
</b>		Liberty's moving.

	Another AGENT rounds the corner into the corridor and is
	followed a step or two later by

<b>	PRESIDENT ANDREW BENJAMIN SHEPHERD.
</b>
	SHEPHERD's walking with his personal assistant, JANIE, a shy,
	professional and incredibly efficient 25-year-old.

<b>				JANIE
</b>		The 10:15 event's been moved inside
		to the Indian Treaty Room.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (to Janie)
		The 10:15 is American Fisheries?

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Yes, sir. They're giving you a
		200-pound halibut.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Janie, make a note. We need to
		schedule more events where somebody
		gives me a really big fish.

	JANIE starts to make a note.

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Yes, sir.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Janie, I was kidding.

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Of course, sir.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		       (to the AGENT at the
		        elevator)
		Hey, Cooper.

<b>				AGENT COOPER
</b>		'Morning, Mr. President.

	SHEPHERD and JANIE enter the elevator. As the doors close...

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Mr. Rothschild asked to have a moment
		with you this morning.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Is he upset about the speech last night?

<b>				JANIE
</b>		He seemed concerned.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Well, it wouldn't be a Monday morning
		unless Lewis was concerned about
		something I did Sunday night.

	The elevator doors open, revealing LEWIS ROTHSCHILD. At 32,
	LEWIS is the President's chief domestic policy advisor. It
	would appear that he averages about two hours sleep a night,
	though that doesn't seem to slow him down.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		You skipped the whole paragraph.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (to Janie)
		And Monday morning it is.

	LEWIS falls into the pace as the three of them head for the
	double doors leading to the South Lawn.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		"American can no longer afford to
		pretend that they live in a great
		society"...and then nothing. You
		dumped the whole handguns paragraph.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		This is a time for prudence, Lewis.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		That was the kick-ass section.

	The three of them are now OUTSIDE and making their way down
	the COVERED WALKWAY that runs from the East Wing to the West
	Wing.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I thought what with being the
		President and all...

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Sir, of course I didn't mean to
		imply--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I thought you'd be turning cartwheels
		this morning, Lewis -- 63 percent job
		approval.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		That's great news, sir, but...

	They walk past a GROUNDKEEPER who's at work at a patch of grass.

<b>				GROUNDKEEPER
</b>		'Morning, Mr. President.

	Before he's even completed the last syllable of the greeting,
	JANIE quickly and quietly said--

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Charlie.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		'Morning, Charlie.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Sir, the press is gonna need an
		explanation.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		For what?

	SHEPHERD, LEWIS and JANIE walk through the door being held
	open by an AGENT. The conversation continues as they make
	their way through the corridors of


<b>	INT. THE WEST WING - DAY
</b>
	They walk quickly down a hallway teeming with STAFFERS, AIDES
<b>	AND OFFICE WORKERS.
</b>
<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Because you dropped the whole kick-ass
		section, now we've got this thing hanging
		out there.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		There's a thing hanging out there?

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		"Americans can no longer afford to
		pretend that they live in a great
		society." Then ...nothing. No
		explanation. No context. So now it's
		just this thing.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		And it's hanging out there?

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Yes, sir.

	SHEPHERD stops at an open doorway, calls to a STAFFER--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Maria--

<b>				STAFFER (MARIA)
</b>		Good morning, sir.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Did they tell you I'm gonna need--

<b>				STAFFER (MARIA)
</b>		--overall consumer spending and not
		just first homes. Yes, sir. We'll have
		it for you in 15 minutes.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Thanks.

	SHEPHERD moves on. LEWIS and JANIE stay with him.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Mr. President, I really feel we need
		to focus on...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Lewis, however much coffee you drink
		in the morning, I want you to reduce it
		by half.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		I don't drink coffee.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Then hit yourself over the head with
		a baseball bat, would you please?

	Another STAFFER crosses their path--

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Happy birthday, Laura.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Hey, Laura, happy birthday.

<b>				STAFFER (LAURA)
</b>		Thank you, sir.

	Once out of earshot--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			(to JANIE)
		I should send her some flowers.

<b>				JANIE
</b>		You already did, sir.

	And, with that, they walk through a doorway and into


<b>	INT. THE OVAL OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	In the OUTER OFFICE, MRS. CHAPIL, the President's secretary,
	is hard at work on a word processor. She stands as SHEPHERD
	walks in--

<b>				MRS. CHAPIL
</b>		Good morning, Mr. President.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		How're you, Mrs. Chapil?

<b>				MRS. CHAPIL
</b>		Fine, thank you, sir. Mr. Kodak left
		the detailed breakdown of the approval
		poll for you. He seemed to indicate that
		it was very good news.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Sixty-three percent of it, at any rate.

	And by now they're in the OVAL OFFICE itself. SHEPHERD has
	gone to his desk and is looking over the various overnight
	briefing memos that have been left for him. As someone used
	to doing six things at once, he has no trouble reading,
	listening, and talking at the same time.

<b>				MRS. CHAPIL
</b>		Lucy called just a moment ago. You
		forgot to sign her permission slip
		for her class--

<b>				JANIE
</b>		--the museum trip. I'll go get it.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (to JANIE)
		What time does she get home today?

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Three-twenty.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		How's my afternoon look?

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Very crowded.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Schedule some time for me at 3:30.

<b>				WOMAN (O.S.)
</b>		Buenos dias, Senor Presidente.

	This from ROBIN McCALL, a strikingly tall black woman and the
	President's press secretary, as she strides into the room.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Too-tall McCall, how was Mexico?

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		I didn't truly appreciate it until I
		came back and discovered that America
		isn't a great society.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>			   (to ROBIN)
		He dumped a whole section.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Now there's a thing hanging out there.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		Not a great society, sir?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Well, with you out of the country, it
		wasn't, Robin. Now that you're back,
		we're great again.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		There's a press room full of people
		saying "What did he mean by that?"

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		See?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (re: a memo he's been
			    looking at)
		A.J., did you get one of these?

	This is said to A. J. MACINERNEY as he walks through a
	separate entrance on the left side of the room. In addition
	to being the President's Chief of Staff and closest advisor,
	he's the President's closest and oldest friend.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Is that the letter from Solomon at
		the GDC?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		It would appear to be a letter from
		the entire environmental community.
		These people are outta control.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		I think they're just frustrated,
		Mr. President.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		Are they blaming the President for
		global warming?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Well, they don't think he caused it,
		if that's what you mean.

			   (continuing;
			    to SHEPHERD)
		Sir, I'm on the phone with these
		people twice a week. I honestly
		don't know what they want at this
		point.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		What they want is a 20 percent reduction in
		fossil fuel emissions.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		It won't pass at 20 percent.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		We haven't really tried.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
		hold too many markers. If we try to
		push this through and lose, there will
		be a very loud thud when we hit the
		ground, and that's not what you want in
		an election year.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them
		the President resents the implication
		that he's turned his back on the
		environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to
		the floor. But we're gonna ask for a
		10 percent reduction. If they want to pull
		their support, fine. At 63 percent job
		approval rating. I don't need their help
		getting a bill passed. We gotta get going--
		where's Leon?

<b>				A.J.
</b>			   (to an AIDE)
		Would you call Mr. Kodak and tell him
		the President's--

	A.J.'s sentence is cut short by the sound of a head-on
	pedestrian collision in the outer office--

<b>				MRS. CHAPIL (O.S.)
</b>		Aaagh!

<b>				KODAK (O.S.)
</b>		Sorry! Sorry, my fault.

<b>				A.J.
</b>			   (to the AIDE)
		Never mind.

	LEON KODAK comes into the oval office. The White House
	pollster is a likable, if clumsy, numbers whiz. He, along
	with A.J., LEWIS, and ROBIN, are regarded as the President's
	Starting Team. The people in this room have grown very close
	over the past few years.

<b>				KODAK
</b>		Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. President.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		You all right?

<b>				KODAK
</b>		They keep moving that big ficus plant.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		We're all here, Mr. President.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Okay. First, I wanted to say
		congratulations. Three years ago, we
		were elected to the White House by
		one of the narrowest margins in history,
		and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of
		registered voters think we're doing a
		good job.

<b>				KODAK
</b>		Wait a second. You wanted me to poll
		registered voters?

	Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		But the poll also tells us what we
		already knew: We don't get this
		crime bill of ours through Congress
		and these numbers are gonna be a
		memory. So, starting today, we're
		shifting it into gear.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		Can I tell my morning press gaggle
		that gun control--

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Crime control, Robin. Gun control
		means we're wimps and we're soft on
		crime.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Hang on, are we not--

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Lewis--

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Are we not putting back the handgun
		restrictions?!

<b>				A.J.
</b>		We're leaving 'em out.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Sir, we campaigned on this issue.
		Now, I understand we took it out when
		we were in the low forties, but we
		can push it through now.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		After the elections.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Sir, we may never have an opportunity
		like this again. Let's take this 63
		percent out for a spin and see what
		it can do.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis.
		We need it to get re-elected. For
		reasons passing understanding, people
		do not relate guns to gun-related crime.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Robin, you can brief the press this
		afternoon. As of today, the crime
		bill's priority one on the President's
		domestic agenda.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		Got it.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Leon, you're gonna run the war room.
		We're gonna need detailed projections
		for all the target districts by the
		end of the week. And, Leon, don't be
		a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do
		what the N.R.A. does.

<b>				KODAK
</b>		Scare the shit out of 'em?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				KODAK
</b>		I can do that.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Lewis, we want you to be legislative
		liaison on this. You're gonna run
		the show on the hill.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Can I just say, to return to the
		subject for one moment, that it might
		be easier to fight a war on drugs if
		we weren't arming drug dealers.

	SHEPHERD responds a little too quickly -- we see a spark of a
	temper.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Lewis, we've gotta fight the fights
		we can win.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Yes, sir.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		We want to announce the crime bill at
		the State of the Union, which is 72
		days from today. The last nose count
		put us 18 votes short.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Eighteen votes in 72 days. Thank you,
		everyone. Janie, what's next?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Thank you, Mr. President.

	The meeting's over. LEWIS, ROBIN, and KODAK say their "Thank

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		It was aggressive, and we should

</b>		This isn't the guy who needed us four

		popular. He's gonna win re-election

</b>		You talked to Mr. Linder?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Yes. It's called a Parent-Teacher

</b>		I like it fine, Dad.

</b>		All your other teachers say you're

</b>		I don't know what to say, Dad. I

</b>		Luce, take a look at this book. This

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Your concerns are not falling on deaf

		known no greater alley in the White
		House than President Shepherd.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Hardly an impressive distinction, A.J.

	SUSAN is trying to avert the inevitable--

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		Sydney, we should leave Mr. MacInerney
		alone now. He's already given us more
		time than--

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Susan, Mr. MacInerney doesn't want
		us to leave, because Mr. MacInerney's
		not yet done what he needs to do today.

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		Sir, Ms. Wade's been thrown into the
		deep end of the pool on her first day.
		She hasn't even had a chance to read
		the report of the Quebec Conference.

	SYDNEY -- whose brain is telling her to slam on the brakes,
	check her swing, smile and leave the building -- decides,
	instead, to hit the gas and swing away. The OTHERS are watching
	this as if they were watching the evolution of a train wreck.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		You're right. I haven't read it. If
		someone had asked me yesterday, I'd
		have told them the Quebec Conference
		was made up of six professional hockey
		teams. But what I do know is that it's
		time for the President to run for
		president again. Leon Kodak is as good
		as it gets when it comes to electoral
		strategy, and I'm certain he's told the
		President exactly what I'd tell him:
		Nail down Michigan and California,
		where they make cars and airplanes --
		and burn plenty of fossil fuel. But if
		I had read these eight hundred pages,
		I would have discovered that it's the
		burning of fossil fuels that's been
		mostly responsible for global warming and
		that the 20 percent reduction recommended
		by the GDC is a necessary first step
		toward arresting the catastrophic greenhouse
		effect that has gone unchecked by this
		administration...

<b>				SUSAN
</b>			   (to SYDNEY)
		It's really time to--

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Susan, I promise you, the White House
		Chief of Staff will not let us leave
		here until he's broken the bad news.

	No one in the room really understands what's going on...
	except A.J., who would like to take the time to admire
	SYDNEY but, of course, can't.

<b>				A.J.
</b>			   (pause)
		I'm afraid Sydney's right. Although
		not about Michigan and California.
		The President has asked me to convey
		to you that he's sending his energy
		bill to the floor with a call for a
		reduction of 10 percent.

	There's an uncomfortable silence in the room...

<b>				A.J.
</b>			   (continuing)
		The President is willing to go it
		alone on this, but he's asking for,
		and frankly he's expecting, the full
		support of the GDC.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		The President's expecting our full
		support?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Yes, he is.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		The President's dreamin', A.J.

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		Sydney!

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		--the President has critically
		misjudged reality. If he honestly
		thinks that the environmental
		community is going to whistle a
		happy tune while rallying support
		around this pitifully lame mockery of
		environmental leadership just because
		he's a nice guy and he's done better
		than his predecessors, then your boss
		is the Chief Executive of Fantasyland.

<b>				VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Let's take him out back and beat the
		shit out of him.

	SYDNEY's blown out her speakers because she's turned in the
	direction of the private office entrance to see, live and in
	person, The President of the United States.

	She is frozen. Mortified. If she were capable of thought
	process, she would be preying for something heavy to fall on
	her head right now.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Good morning, Mr. President. How are
		you today?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Couldn't be better.
			   (to the GROUP)
		I apologize for the interruption, but
		A.J. asked me to stop and say hello.
		You wouldn't be Sydney Ellen Wade, by
		any chance, would you?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Mr. President, I'm...don't know what
		to say. I'm speechless.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		All evidence to the contrary.

<b>				SUSAN
</b>		Mr. President, we haven't met. My
		name is Susan Sloan. I used to work
		with Congressman Myers. I hope this
		episode in no way--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Sydney?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Yes, sir?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		You got a second?

<b>				SYDNEY

		Of course.

		This is my personal assistant, Janie

</b>		Mr. President--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Is it okay if I call you Sydney?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Of course. Mr. President--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Have you ever been in the Oval Office?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I've just been on the regular tour.
		It didn't include...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I hear it's pretty good.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Mr. President, what you saw in there
		was nothing more than vanity run amok.
		I was showing off for a colleague who
		doesn't think very much of me. It'd
		be a real injustice for you to hold the
		GDC accountable for my behavior today.
		On top of which, I'm monumentally sorry
		for having insulted you like that.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Are you under the impression that I'm
		mad at you?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>			   (pause)
		Well...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Sydney, seldom does a day go by that
		I'm not burned in effigy.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Not by a professional political
		operative standing 30 feet from the
		Oval Office.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		No, I'll give you that.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Mr. President--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Did you know that when the City
		Planners sat down to design
		Washington, D.C., their intention was
		to build a city that would intimidate
		and humble foreign heads of state?
		It's true.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I didn't know that.


<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		The White House has the single
		greatest home court advantage in the
		modern world.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Learned that one the hard way.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Sydney, this bill is important to me.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Yes, sir, I'll convey your message.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		But you don't believe me?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		The GDC is asking for 20 percent, sir.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		It's not gonna pass at 20 percent.
		It's a long shot at 10.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		How do you know that until you put
		the full weight of the White House
		behind--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes
		shy in the House. It can't be done.
		But I tell you what. I'll make you a
		deal with you. If you can get 24
		votes, I'll get you the last 10.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Twenty-four votes?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		If you can swing 24 votes by the
		State of the Union, I'll promise you
		full White House support.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Do I have your word on that, sir?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Absolutely. Listen, are you hungry?
		I skipped breakfast. You wanna have
		some coffee? A donut or something?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Sir, I'm a little intimidated by my
		surroundings, and yes, I've gotten
		off to a rocky and somewhat stilted
		beginning, but don't let that
		diminish the weight of my message:
		The GDC has been at every president
		for the last decade and a half that
		global warming is a calamity, the
		effects of which will be second only
		to nuclear war. The best scientists
		in the world have given you every
		reason to take the GDC seriously.
		But I'm gonna give you one more. If
		you don't live up to the deal you
		just made, come New Hampshire, we're
		gonna go shopping for a new candidate.

	SYDNEY heads for the door--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		You can't do that, Sydney.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		With all due respect, Mr. President,
		who's gonna stop me?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Well, if you go through that door,
		the United States Secret Service.
		That's my private office.

</b>		Nice shot, Mr. President? You won't
		call me by my name when we're playing
		pool.

	A.J. assesses the table.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		I will not do it playing pool, I will
		not do it in a school, I do not like
		green eggs and ham, I do not like
		them Sam I am.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		At ease, A.J., and get away from the
		pocket. 9 in the corner.

	SHEPHERD makes the shot.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Leo Solomon phoned. He said he was
		thrilled with the deal you made this
		morning.

	SHEPHERD lifts his cue for a moment...trying to think it
	there was something he was supposed to tell A.J.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I forgot to tell you.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		It's a waste of time.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Not our time. GDC makes a big
		push for the votes, and when they
		come up short, we move in with the
		softer bill, to get passed, we're
		everybody's hero. 3 in the side.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Also, Sydney Wade called.

	SHEPHERD, a hair too excited by this news, misses by a mile.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Sydney Wade?

<b>				A.J.
</b>			   (beat)
		She wanted to apologize one more time
		for her behavior. 3 in the side.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Did she say anything about me?

<b>				A.J.
</b>			   (beat)
		Sydney Wade?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		When she called.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Did she say anything about you?
		13 in the corner.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		No, it's just that we had a nice
		couple of minutes together. She
		threatened me and I patronized her
		and we didn't have anything to eat,
		but I thought there was a connection.

	A.J. is staring at him in disbelief.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		She didn't say anything about me?

<b>				A.J.
</b>			(quietly)
		Well, no, but I could pass her a note
		before study hall and--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Tell me this: Hypothetically, what
		would happen--

<b>				A.J.
</b>		I feel a nightmare coming on. 1 in
		the corner.

	He misses the shot.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		--if I called Sydney and asked her
		to be my date at the State Dinner
		Thursday night?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		You're not serious.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Don't I sound serious?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		The President can't just go out on
		a date.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Why not? Jefferson did. Wilson did.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		You're not--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Wilson was widowed during his first
		term. He meets a woman named Edith
		Gault. He dated her, courted her,
		married her, and somewhere in there
		managed to form the League of Nations.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Mr. President, this is an election
		year. If you're looking for female
		companionship, we can make
		arrangements that'll insure total
		privacy and--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I don't want you to get me a girl,
		A.J. What is this, Vegas?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		No, sir, this is the White House.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		And I'm talking about something
		that in no way is at conflict with
		my oath of office. I'm a single
		adult, and I met a woman that I'd
		like to see again socially. How's
		that different from what Wilson did?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		The difference is he didn't have to
		be the president on television.
		You've said it a million times:
		If there were a television set in every
		living room 60 years ago, this country
		does not elect a man in a wheelchair.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		What are you saying?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		We'll take a hit.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		How big?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		I don't know. Five points. Maybe
		more.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Five points we're standing here
		talking about?!

<b>				A.J.
</b>		It could be more.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I drop five points when Wisconsin
		doesn't make it to the Rose Bowl.
		5 in the corner.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Do you want me to have Kodak put
		together some numbers so we know
		what we're talking about?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Yeah.
			   (beat)
		No. No. I don't want to check a
		polling sample to see if this is
		okay, like I'm asking permission
		to stay out an hour past curfew.
		This isn't the business of the
		American people.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Mr. President, the American people
		have a funny way of deciding on
		their own what is and what is not
		their business.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I like her, A.J.
			   (pause)
		Stop being my chief of staff for one
		minute.

<b>				A.J.
</b>			   (beat)
		Give her a call.

<b>				SHEPHERD

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		You know who else is good at that?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		The C.I.A.?

</b>		Well, yeah, but I was thinking of the

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Then you're experienced at this.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Oh yeah, you can ask me anything.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		How are we doing so far?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		It's hard to say at this point. So
		far it's just your typical first date
		stuff.

	And all of a sudden an INCREDIBLE SOUND from inside the East
	Room--

	--The Marine Corps Brass and Percussion Ensemble plays four
	ruffles and flourishes.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Damn. And I wanted to find a way to
		be different from the other guys.

	A BOOMING VOICE over the P.A. announces--

<b>				VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Ladies and gentlemen, the President
		of the United States.

	And now -- the whole walk timing out with incredible precision --

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		By the way, nice shoes.

	--SHEPHERD walks into the hall as the Brass and Percussion
	Ensemble plays HAIL TO THE CHIEF.

	The 180 GUESTS come to their feet and applaud long and loud.

	The GROUP following the President catches up to the spot
	where SYDNEY has stopped walking. They all join in the
	applause. We can see in SYDNEY's face that she's been quite
	swept up.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Mr. President, the President and Mrs.
		D'Astier look bored. They're not
		talking to anybody.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		They're hammered. Esther, do you speak
		French?

<b>				ESTHER
</b>		Latin.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I thought you spoke French.

<b>				ESTHER
</b>		No, Latin.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Great, next time Julius Caesar comes
		to town, you're our gal. Sydney, I
		don't suppose that you speak any--

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		         (taking over--
		          to D'Astier)
		Monsieur le President, nous sommes
		tous habilles, nous avons ce
		merveilleux orchestre, une piece
		magnifique...comment se fait-il que
		les invites ne dansent pas?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (proudly to A.J. and
			    Esther)
		That's my date.

<b>				D'ASTIER
</b>		Je ne connais pas la tradition en
		Amerique, mais dans mon pays, si les
		invites de Louis XVI et Marie
		Antoinette avaient ose danser devant
		le roi et la reine, ils auraient
		perdu la tete.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Really?

<b>				MADAME D'ASTIER
</b>		Absolument.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Sydney, you didn't dissolve the NATO
		treaty, did you?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I just said that we're sitting in this
		beautiful room, listening to the music
		of this wonderful orchestra, and I
		wondered why nobody was dancing.

<b>				D'ASTIER
</b>		And I informed Ms. Wade that in my
		country, a guest at the palace of
		Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette would
		soon find their head in a guillotine
		if they made the impertinent gesture
		of dancing without so much as a
		by-your-leave from the King and the Queen.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		I'll bet no one accused Louis of
		being soft on crime.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		There's a lesson there, Mr. President.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		More beheadings at the White House?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Bob Rumson would embrace it.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I'm sure he would, but I have a
		better idea.

	SHEPHERD stands, holds out his hand to SYDNEY.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		Would you like to dance?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Uh, yeah, I guess. I mean, yes, sir,
		I'd love to.

	SHEPHERD and SYDNEY move to the dance floor, accompanied by
	the appreciative "oooh's" and "ahh's" of the GUESTS.

	The dance band begins, and SYDNEY and SHEPHERD dance...

	...beautifully.

</b>		First of all, the 200 pairs of eyes

<b>				SYDNEY

<b>				LEO
</b>		Then I picked up the Times--

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		It was crazy. He called me at home.

<b>				LEO
</b>		What's going on?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Nothing. It was innocent. His
		cousin got the flu at the last

<b>				LEO
</b>		Did you sleep with him?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		What?

<b>				LEO
</b>		Did you sleep--

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		That's none of your business, Leo.

<b>				LEO
</b>		Yeah, it is, Sydney.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		You wanna tell me how my personal
		life in any way--

<b>				LEO
</b>		Because when it's the President, it's
		not personal. Sydney, I hired your
		reputation. I hired a pit bull, not
		a prom queen.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		That's unfair.

<b>				LEO
</b>		It's incredibly unfair. But you've
		spent a lot of time over the year
		telling me the trouble with the
		environmental lobby is that we don't
		understand the fundamental truth that
		politics is perception. This is a
		bad time to develop ignorance.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		You're making way too much of this.

<b>				LEO
</b>		Am I? This is your time, Sydney.
		You're sitting at the grown-ups'
		table. You have a chance to get
		everything you want -- run a national
		campaign, be a major player inside
		the party. But this relationship had
		better go all the way, because with
		the leader of the free world there is
		no halfway. Politics is perception,
		and if thing don't work out, the
		amount of time it'll take you to go
		from being a hired gun to a cocktail
		party joke can be clocked with an egg
		timer.

	There's a quick knock at the door -- Leo's SECRETARY steps in
	with a strange-looking package.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Leo, there is no relationship. It
		was one night. It's done.

<b>				LEO'S SECRETARY
</b>		Mr. Solomon, this was just delivered
		by White House messenger. It's
		marked "Perishable."

<b>				LEO
</b>		The White House has sent me something
		perishable?

<b>				LEO'S SECRETARY
</b>		It's for Ms. Wade.

<b>				LEO
</b>		Here we go...

	SYDNEY begins unwrapping the package.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Relax, Leo. I'm sure it's just a
		formality.

<b>				LEO'S SECRETARY
</b>			   (exited)
		It's from him.

<b>				LEO
</b>		Of course it's from him.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		So he had some staff flunky send
		me a fruit basket.

<b>				LEO'S SECRETARY
</b>		He wrote the note himself.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I'm sure he didn't take the time to--

<b>				LEO'S SECRETARY
</b>		The messenger said he was waiting in
		the Oval Office for ten minutes while
		the President wrote the card.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Okay, listen, so he--
			   (to LEO'S SECRETARY)
		--it took him ten minutes to write a
		card?!

<b>				LEO'S SECRETARY
</b>		Apparently he went through several
		drafts.

	SYDNEY can't stifle her laugh -- she sees what the gift is.

<b>				LEO
</b>		What is it...what is it?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		A ham.

<b>				LEO
</b>			   (beat)

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		He sent me a Virginia ham.

<b>				LEO'S SECRETARY
</b>		Dig it, Ms. Wade. You're the

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		No problem. Did you get the ham?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I got the ham, yes. Thank you very

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I wanted to send you flowers, but
		there seem to be some kinks in the

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		So did I. It's just that...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I'm delivering a luncheon speech at

</b>		Are you free for dinner tomorrow night?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Dinner?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Casual. In the Residence. Without
		the United Nations. My daughter'll

		United--

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I'd love to meet Lucy, but...

	An AIDE has slipped in and hands SHEPHERD a note.

<b>				SHEPHERD

		She's gonna like you.
			   (calling to the AIDE)
		Excuse me -- Jeff!

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Actually, I have some concerns that--

	The AIDE (JEFF) steps back in--

<b>				JEFF
</b>		Yes, sir.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (reading the note)
		I can't do this.

<b>				JEFF
</b>		Which? Robbins or Stackhouse?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Either one. I have to be in and out.

<b>				JEFF
</b>		Sir, Governor Stackhouse said he just
		needed 10 minutes. I think he wants
		to talk about the assault weapons.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Stackhouse wants to talk about
		grazing rights. Trust me.

<b>				JEFF
</b>		Got it.

	And he's gone.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (to Sydney)
		Sorry. You have concerns.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Yes. Not many. A few. One. I have
		one concern.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Does it having anything to do with
		one of us being the President?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		You like to make jokes about this,
		but--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I am not mocking you, honest. I'm
		just a guy asking a girl over for a
		meal.

	And, as if from out of nowhere, a LOUD CLAAAMMERING, like the
	sound of a jackhammer against cement, comes from somewhere
	outside -- growing louder and closer --

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		What's that?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		My ride's here.

	And, sure enough, coming into view outside the windows of the
	Oval Office, is MARINE-1, the President's helicopter. JANIE

</b>		It's not the dish--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Yeah, it is. It's the room with all

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		It's the China Room.

</b>		I'm more of a West Wing President.
		If you're curious about the mansion,

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		There're about seven-thousand books.
		I'll get one for you.

	SYDNEY's been walking slowly around the room, looking at the
	display cases, and as she gets near one of the large windows,
	she takes another step which drapes her in a shaft of
	incredibly flattering moonlight.

	The vision isn't lost on SHEPHERD. They stare at each other
	for a moment.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Sydney.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Mr. President -- have you ever noticed
		how similar the Van Buren flatware is
		to the Buchanan flatware?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Do you think there will ever come a
		time when you can stand in a room
		with me and not think of me as the
		President?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		This isn't a state of mind. You are
		the President. And when I'm in a
		room with you, oval or any other
		shape, I'm always gonna be a
		lobbyist, and you'll always be the
		President.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I got news for you, Sydney. As a
		lobbyist, you would never be alone in
		a room with the President.

	This last statement is not lost on SYDNEY.

	He moves toward her until they are both bathed in the
	moonlight. He puts his arms around her.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		You think this is a good idea?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Probably not.

	They lean in to kiss each other. They barely make contact
	when...

<b>				AGENT #3 (O.S.)

	An AGENT is standing in the doorway -- SHEPHERD and SYDNEY
	break apart.

<b>				AGENT #3
</b>		We have a secure call from the sit-

	SHEPHERD knows what that means.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Excuse me.

	He moves out the door and into the corridor.

	SYDNEY, knowing something's wrong, instinctively moves to
	follow him and be with him, but the AGENT hasn't moved from
	the doorway, so--

<b>				AGENT #3
</b>		Sorry, ma'am.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>			   (beat)
		No...of course.

	SHEPHERD comes back in.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Listen--

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Is anything wrong?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I'm sorry, we're going to have to cut
		our evening short. The Libyans have
		just bombed C-STAD. I'll try to call
		you tomorrow.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Well, I have no intention of pursuing

<b>				SYDNEY

</b>		I asked if--

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>			    (of course she is)
		That's not the issue--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Well, I tell you what. Let's make

		new, 'cause I know that most couples,
		when they're first getting together,
		are inclined to slam on the brakes

		Rumson's drool.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		You're not most people.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		What's my problem?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Sex and nervousness.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Sex and nervousness is my problem.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Yes. Last night when we were
		looking at the different place
		settings in the dish room, I
		realized that those place settings
		were provided by the First Ladies.
		And I'll bet none of those First
		Ladies were nervous about having
		sex with their President husbands.
		And you know why?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		No, but I'm sure you'll explain it
		to me.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I will. Because they weren't
		presidents when they met them. Not
		the case here.

</b>		Ahhhhhh.

<b>				SHEPHERD

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Yes. May I use your bathroom for a

</b>		Sure. It's right through there.

		you feel comfortable, hang up your

		have fixed up a drink, we'll sit on

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		You have a plan? Don't make me

	SYDNEY disappears into the BATHROOM/DRESSING ROOM area.
	SHEPHERD keeps talking as he goes to the bar and makes a
	couple of drinks.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (speaking up)
		Okay. You're attracted to me, but
		the idea of physical intimacy is
		uncomfortable because you only know
		me as the President. It's not always
		gonna be that way, and the reason I
		know that is because there was a
		moment last night when you were with
		me and not the President, and I know
		what a big step that was for you.
		So, Sydney, I'm in no rush. Here's

		When you're comfortable, that's
		when it'll happen.

	SYDNEY comes back into the room...she's wearing one of
	SHEPHERD's dress shirts and nothing else. She walks toward
	him.

<b>				SHEPHERD

		Perhaps I didn't properly explain
		the fundamentals of the "Slow Down"
		plan.

</b>		You explained it great.

	She moves closer to him.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (pause)
		Are you nervous?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		No.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Good. My nervousness exists on
		several levels. Number 1 -- and
		this is in no particular order --
		I haven't done this in a pretty
		long time. Number 2: Any expectations
		you might have, due to the fact that
		I'm, you know...

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		The most powerful man in the world?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Exactly, thank you. Just so you
		remember that's a political
		distinction that comes with the

	SYDNEY turns around.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Hi.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		What are you doing?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I wanted to leave the building before
		the press corps got here.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I have those same thoughts every day
		of my life. Say, you know Lewis
		Rothschild, don't you? Well, he's...

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Sure. Boy, Lewis'd go nuts if he

	There's a KNOCK on the door.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		...on his way up.

</b>		What?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Come on in, Lewis.

</b>		Hi, Lewis. Well, Mr. President,

</b>		I think the important thing is not

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		How do we exit Sydney from the
		building and what do we say to the

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		We need a diversion.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		A diversion.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		You understand that by diversion
		I'm not saying we set the White

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		No, please, let's do.

</b>		Can I state very clearly that I
		can't be party to anything illegal.

</b>		Good for you, Lewis.

	SHEPHERD regards A.J. for a moment...clearly the man planned

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Okay. Good. Now, the press
		statement.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (to SYDNEY)
		Sydney, when you leave here, you're
		gonna run into reporters and
		photographers. Your picture's gonna
		be taken every day, and you're gonna
		be asked questions every day. Answer
		them, don't answer them -- it's
		entirely up to you. The White House
		has no official position except to
		say "no comment."

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		No comment?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		The White House doesn't comment on
		the President's personal life.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		We can't just leave it at that, sir.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I tell you what, Lewis, we just did.

</b>		But, sir...

		Sydney. Esther'll be in my office.
		You take your time.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Thanks, A.J.

	A.J. leaves...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I'm sorry about all this. We'll do
		it better next time.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I'm no expert, but I thought we did
		it pretty good this time.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		No, I mean...

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I know. I had a good time.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Me, too. I'll call you. I'll be in
		Panama, but I'll call you.

</b>		I'd like that.

<b>				SHEPHERD

</b>		Ahhh...I had a terrible meeting

</b>		It was a disaster.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		You're in good company. I sat with
		'em a week ago. They told me there
		was nothing on the President's
		domestic agenda they were more
		committed to defeating than the crime
		bill.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Well, congratulations, fellas, you're
		outta the cellar. McSorley told me
		the only thing on the President's
		domestic agenda they were more
		committed to defeating than the crime
		bill was the fossil fuel package.

		happen? Did the GDC's political
		director just tell the President and
		the White House Chief of Staff that
		there are three votes on the crime
		bill that can be bought by stickin'
		the fossil fuel package in a drawer.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		No, the GDC's political director
		didn't tell us anything. Sydney Wade
		told her boyfriend and her
		boyfriend's best friend that she had
		a lousy day.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		It doesn't change the facts, Mr.
		President. If Sydney gets her 24
		votes and we're three short, there's
		some maneuvering to be done.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I made a promise, A.J.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		You made a deal, Mr. President.

<b>				SHEPHERD

	LEWIS hangs up the phone. He takes a deep breath, slumps
	down in the nearest chair, and looks up at ROBIN and KODAK.

	There's a long silence before LEWIS says--

<b>				LEWIS
</b>			   (continuing)
		We lost Jarrett.

<b>				KODAK
</b>			   (beat)
		I hope so. 'Cause, you know, if
		that was an "undecided," then we
		need to work on our people skills.

	LEWIS picks up the phone and punches in a few numbers. Even
	before that line starts ringing, he picks up another phone
	and punches in a different set of numbers.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>			   (into the first phone)
		Karen, it's Lewis. Could you hunt
		down Congressman Quincy for me. I
		need to talk to him right way.

</b>		We lost Quincy, too.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Did he give a reason?

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		He thinks your numbers aren't likely

<b>				KODAK
</b>		We're three votes down again, sir.

	There's a pause before ...

<b>				KODAK
</b>			   (continuing)
		Mr. President, as of this morning,
		Sydney only needed one more vote.
		The Motown Three have gotta be
		scared blind. I don't think there'll
		be a better opportunity.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		The press is expecting an
		announcement on the crime bill by

<b>				KODAK
</b>		If you agree to stick 455 in a drawer
		until after the elections, they'll
		give you the three votes.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>			   (beat)
		And we declare victory, sir.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		We said as a last resort.

<b>				KODAK
</b>		We're there, sir. The State of the

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		No. Come on. There's gotta be three

<b>				KODAK
</b>		There isn't.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Bullshit, Leon. There's gotta be

<b>				KODAK
</b>		There isn't, sir.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Storch.

<b>				KODAK
</b>		I beg your pardon?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		What about Storch?

<b>				A.J.

		That one too, sir.

	SHEPHERD is stopped.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Mr. President, I think we have to

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		She is one vote away, A.J. It's
		important legislation that for the
		first time has a legitimate chance.
		 I think she deserves every possible
		opportunity to--

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		She? You meant "it," didn't you,
		sir? You meant the "important
		legislation" deserves every
		opportunity.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Lewis, shut up.

	There's a horrible silence in the room. SHEPHERD has locked
	eyes with LEWIS.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		You got something to say to me?

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Respectfully, sir. I think we should
		examine the new poll for more than
		its value as a box score.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Examine what? They don't like that
		I'm going out with Sydney.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		It's not that simple, sir. I think
		this poll helps bribg a murky problem
		into specific relief.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Whose problem we talking about,
		Lewis? Yours? You worried about
		your job? This poll isn't talking
		about my Presidency. This poll is
		talking about my life. Two hundred
		and sixty-four million people have
		decided--

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Mr. President, two hundred and sixty-
		four million people don't give a damn
		about your life. They give a damn about
		their own.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		All right, that's enough.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Mr. President, you've raised a
		daughter almost entirely on your own,
		and she's terrific. What does it say
		to you that in the last seven weeks,
		59 percent of this country has begun
		to question your family values?

<b>				A.J.
</b>		The President doesn't answer to you,
		Lewis.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Oh yes, he does, A.J.  I'm a citizen,
		this is my president, and in this
		country it is not only permissible to
		question our leaders, it is our
		responsibility. But you already know
		that, Mr. President, because you have
		a deeper love of this country than
		any man I've ever known, and I want
		to know what it says to you that in
		the past seven weeks 59 percent of
		Americans have begun to question your
		patriotism?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Look, if people want to listen to Bob
		Rumson--

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		They don't have a choice! Rob
		Rumson's the only one doing the
		talking. People want leadership.
		And in the absence of genuine
		leadership, they will listen to
		anyone who steps up to the
		microphone. They want leadership,
		Mr. President. They're so thirsty
		for it, they'll crawl through the
		desert toward a mirage, and when
		they discover there's no water,
		they'll drink the sand.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (evenly)
		Lewis, we've had Presidents who were
		beloved, who couldn't find a coherent
		sentence with two hands and a
		flashlight. People don't drink the
		sand, 'cause they're thirsty, Lewis.
		They drink it 'cause they don't know
		the difference.

	The room is slightly stunned by what their President has just
	said.

	SHEPHERD picks up the polling data and heads to the door...

</b>		Richard Reynolds' campaign. He may
		be able to get me a job.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		When did you decide to get a new job?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Not long after Leo Solomon fired me
		from my old one. Beth's gonna kill
		me. She loves that--

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Why did he fire you?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Total failure to achieve any of the
		objectives for which I was hired. I
		told him he was being unreasonable.
		After all, I did get to dance with
		the President and ride in Air Force
		One a couple of times. But you know
		those prickly environmentalists.
		It's always gonna be something with

</b>		You'll call him? You mean you'll
		call him yourself? Personally?
		It'll come from the President?
		That's a great idea. I think you
		should call Leo and make a deal. He
		hires me back for, say, 72 days. I
		go around scaring the hell out of
		Congress, making them think that the
		President's about to drive through a
		very damaging and costly bill.
		They'll believe me, right, 'cause I'm
		the President's Friday Night Girl.
		Now I don't know if you can dip into
		this well twice, especially since
		I've lost all credibility in politics,
		but you never know, I might just be
		able to pull it off again. I might
		be able to give you just the leverage

		--sometimes when you talk, you say

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (pause)
		Politically?

<b>				LUCY
</b>		Yes.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (pause)
		What do you mean?

	It just starts spilling out in a stream--

<b>				LUCY
</b>		Yes. Okay. Yes. Sometimes, I mean,
		I'm not sure. You know a lot more
		than I do -- but still, I have these
		feelings, and I don't think they're
		wrong. Like, okay, for instance, I'm
		not so sure it's all right to burn a
		flag. I mean, it really bothers a lot
		of people, and I don't know why you
		think it's okay. I hear Senator
		Rumson talk, and some of the things
		he says sounds right to me, and I
		think, "God, am I like Bob Rumson?!
		I mean, Dad thinks he's a jerk. Dad
		hates this guy!
		Why am I agreeing with him" And then
		I think, "Well, maybe I'm not really
		like Bob Rumson, but maybe I'm not
		like Dad either." But the point is
		I'm the President's kid, and people
		pay attention to what I say, and if
		I say something different from what
		you say, it'll be embarrassing for
		you. So I can't just get up in social
		studies class and say whatever I want.

	SHEPHERD is silent...totally blown away...he had absolutely
	no idea...

	He stands up slowly and moves toward her...LUCY doesn't know
	what's coming...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (quietly)
		Stand up please.

	LUCY gets up slowly...

	She's never seen her father like this...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		I want you to pay very close
		attention to what happens now.

	SHEPHERD knees down, cups her daughter's face in his hands,
	and gently kisses her forehead. He pulls her to him and
	holds her in a tight embrace...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		In your  lifetime, you will never
		embarrass me. It could never happen.
		You're not the President's daughter,
		Lucy, you're mine.
		And no one's gonna vote me out of
		that job. You're my daughter, and
		everything else is a distant second.
			   (more)
		School is for you, Lucy. You say
		what you want. The only thing you
		have to do to make me happy is
		come home at the end of the day.

	LUCY squeezes her dad tight...they hold the embrace for a
	long moment.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		One more thing. I don't dislike
		Senator Rumson because of his
		political views. And even if you
		voted for everything he would vote
		for, that wouldn't make you like him.
		There's a fundamental difference
	between you and the Bob Rumsons of
		the world.

<b>				LUCY
</b>		What's that?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		The difference is that he says he
		loves America. Saying you love
		America is easy. What takes
		character -- and this is what you
		have--

	SHEPHERD trails off, realizing he's about to quote Sydney...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		What takes character is loving
		Americans.

	And now it's as if SHEPHERD is waking himself up from the
	longest trip of his life...

	...he looks over at the T.V. monitor..."No comment"...
	"No, I don't know how many other ways I can say it. The
	White House isn't getting involved in..."

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		Luce, I gotta go.

<b>				LUCY
</b>		Dad, is everything all right?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Everything's fine. I'm just a little
		late for work.

</b>			   (continuing)
		Why would a senator, his party's most
		powerful spokesman and a candidate
		for president, choose to reject
		upholding the Constitution? If you
		can answer that question, then,
		folks, you're smarter than I am,
		because I didn't understand it until
		a couple of minutes ago. Everybody
		knows American isn't easy. America is
		advanced citizenship.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		You gotta want it bad, 'cause it's
		gonna put up a fight. It's gonna
		say, "You want free speech? Let's
		see you acknowledge a man whose words
		make your blood boil, who's standing
		center stage and advocating, at the
		top of his lungs, that which you
		would spend a lifetime opposing at the
		top of yours. You want to claim
		this land as the land of the free,
		then the symbol of your country can't
		just be a flag; the symbol also has
		to be one of its citizens exercising
		his right to burn that flag in
		protest." Show me that, defend that,
		celebrate that in your classrooms.
		Then you can stand up and sing about
		the land of the free. I've known Bob
		Rumson for years. I've been operating
		under the assumption that the reason
		Bob devotes so much time and energy to
		shouting at the rain was that he simply
		didn't get it. Well, I was wrong.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		Bob's problem isn't that he doesn't
		get it. Bob's problem is that he
		can't sell it. Nobody has ever won
		an election by talking about what I
		was just talking about.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		This is a country made up of people
		with hard jobs that they're terrified
		of losing. The roots of freedom are
		of little or no interest to them at
		the moment. We are a nation afraid
		to go out at night. We're a society
		that has assigned low priority to
		education and has looked the other
		way while our public schools have
		been decimated. We have serious
		problems to solve, and we need
		serious men to solve them. And
		whatever your particular problem is,
		friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is
		not the least bit interested in
		solving it. He is interested in two
		things and two things only: Making
		you afraid of it and telling you
		who's to blame for it. That, ladies
		and gentlemen, is how you win
		elections. You gather a group of
		middle-aged, middle-class, middle-
		income voters who remember with
		longing an easier time, and you talk
		to them about family and American
		values and personal character. Then
		you have an old photo of the
		President's girlfriend. You scream
		about patriotism and you tell them
		she's to blame for their lot in life,
		you go on television and you call her
		a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done
		nothing to you, Bob. She has done
		nothing but put herself through law
		school, prosecute criminals for five
		years, represent the interests of
		public school teachers for two years,
		and lobby for the safety of our
		natural resources.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		You want a character debate? Fine,
		but you better stick with me, 'cause
		Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your
		league. I've loved two women in my
		life. I lost one to cancer, and I
		lost the other 'cause I was so busy
		keeping my job I forgot to do my job.
		Well that ends right now.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		Tomorrow morning the White House is
		sending a bill to Congress for its
		consideration. It's White House
		Resolution 455, an energy bill
		requiring a 20 percent reduction of the
		emission of fossil fuels over the
		next ten years. It is by far the
		most aggressive stride ever taken in
		the fight to reverse the effects of
		global warming. The other piece of
		legislation is the crime bill. As of
		today it no longer exists. I'm
		throwing it out. I'm throwing it out
		and writing a law that makes sense.
		You cannot address crime prevention
		without getting rid of assault
		weapons and handguns.
		I consider them a threat to national
		security, and I will go door to door
		if I have to, but I'm gonna convince
		Americans that I'm right, and I'm
		gonna get the guns. We've got
		serous problems, and we need serious
		men, and if you want to talk about
		character, Bob, you'd better come at
		me with more than a burning flag and
		a membership card. If you want to
		talk about character and American
		values, fine. Just tell me where and
		when, and I'll show up. This is a
		time for serious men, Bob, and your
		fifteen minutes are up. My name's
		Andrew Shepherd, and I am the
		President.

	SHEPHERD exits the press room, leaving a stunned room in his
	wake.

	The MURMURS begin from the PRESS CORPS. They're talking
	among themselves, confirming that they just saw what they
	just saw. ROBIN steps to the podium.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		Any questions?

<b>	                                                     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. HALLWAY - WEST WING - DAY
</b>
	A.J. and LEWIS are following after the President.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Well, you don't see that every day
		of the week.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		He's got the whole White House Press
		Corps asking each other how to spell
		"erudite."

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Lewis, call the printer.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		I know. Gotta rewrite the State of
		the Union.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Every word, Lewis. It's a whole new
		ball game. You've got 35 minutes.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Oh, good. I thought I was gonna be rushed.

	LEWIS goes off in one direction. A.J. heads towards the Oval
	Office.

<b>	INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	SHEPHERD is on the phone.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I don't want the limo. I don't want
		an escort.

	A.J. enters.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		I want a plain, ordinary, non-
		bullet-proof automobile. Someone
		around here must have a Chevy I
		can borrow. Well, find one and
		meet me outside the West Wing
		entrance in five minutes.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Where are you going?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I'm going to her house. I'm gonna
		stand at her front door till she
		lets me in. And I'm not leaving till
		I get her back.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		How're you gonna do that?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I haven't worked that out yet. But
		I'm sure groveling will be involved.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		You're just gonna drive over?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I'm the Commander-in-Chief of the
		most powerful army in the world.
		You don't think I can drive ten blocks?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Just stay away from DuPont Circle.
		I hear it's murder this time of day.

	SHEPHERD doesn't need to turn around to know who's standing
	in the doorway, but of course he does anyway.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Hi, A.J.

<b>				A.J.
</b>		It's nice to see you, Ms. Wade. If
		anybody needs me, I'll be in the
		Roosevelt Room, giving Lewis oxygen.

	A.J. exits.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I heard your speech. I was in my
		car, and it just kind of steered
		its way over here.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I'm glad.

	SYDNEY and SHEPHERD just gaze at each other for a moment and
	smile. SYDNEY starts toward him.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		Sydney, I didn't decide to send
		455 to the floor to get you back.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		I didn't come back 'cause you decided
		to send 455 to the floor.

	They move to kiss. It doesn't last very long because...

<b>				LEWIS
</b>			   (entering)
		Mr. President, I thought you might
		want to look at this. I moved Social
		Security up front. Hello, Sydney.

	JANIE enters--

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Mr. President, Leventhal at
		Treasury wants two minutes. Hello,
		Sydney.

	MRS. CHAPIL enters--

<b>				MRS. CHAPIL
</b>		Mr. President -- Excuse me, Miss
		Wade -- Miss McCall is on her way
		over.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (to SYDNEY)
		I've got some things to do.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Yes, you do.

<b>	                                                     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. THE CAPITOL - NIGHT
</b>
	It's lit up and glowing on this cold, clear night.

<b>				ANCHOR (V.O.)
</b>		We're only a moment or two away from
		the arrival of President Shepherd and
		his State of the Union address.
		Lloyd, you've served on the staffs of
		several past administrations, what
		kind of last-minute activity is the
		President engaged in right now?

<b>	                                                     CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. A VIP ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	It's off the main corridor, and it's being used as a green
	room for SHEPHERD and his group -- LEWIS, KODAK, A.J., JANIE,
	and various AIDES and STAFFERS. People are buzzing around in
	a last-minute flurry. SHEPHERD is fumbling with his cuff
	links.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		I'm having a cuff links crisis.

	LUCY takes his sleeves.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing; to LUCY)
		I think they've locked.

<b>				LUCY
</b>		Hold still.

	ROBIN steps in.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		Mr. President, they're waiting for
		you.


<b>				LUCY
</b>		All done.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Lewis.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Sir.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Things have been a little rough
		between us lately.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		I know sir, I'm sorry.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Don't stop what you're doing.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		That's kind of you, sir, but I
		realize I've been a little
		insensitive about some personal...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		No, you were right. Two hundred and
		sixty-four million people don't give
		a damn about my life.

<b>				LEWIS
</b>		Just so you know I've never been one
		of them, Mr. President.

<b>				ROBIN
</b>		This way, people. Let's go.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (to LEWIS)
		See you after.

	The PEOPLE in the room start to gather their things and exit,
	ROBIN handling any and all last-minute "Mr. President"'s as
	she herds people out the door.

	LUCY walks past SHEPHERD. She holds SHEPHERD's old tattered
	textbook and has it opened to a specific page...

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		Whatcha got there, Luce?

<b>				LUCY
</b>		Article 2, Section 3, of the U.S.
		Constitution. Executive Powers.
			   (reading)
		"He shall, from time to time, give to
		the Congress information of the State
		of the Union, and recommend to their
		consideration such measures as he
		shall judge necessary and expedient."

<b>				A.J.
</b>		Sounds right up your alley.

	SHEPHERD looks at his old friend and extends his hand for a
	deeply-felt handshake. A.J. grasps SHEPHERD's hand and then
	pulls him into a strong embrace.

	A.J. whispers a shout into SHEPHERD's ear--

<b>				A.J.
</b>			   (continuing)
		Give 'em hell, Andy.

	A.J. pulls away, leaving SHEPHERD to enjoy the moment without
	having to speak--

<b>				A.J.
</b>			   (continuing)
		You've got 30 seconds, Mr. President.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Thank you.
			   (to LUCY)
		I'll see you afterward. I want a
		critique.

	The room clears out...revealing SYDNEY, dressed like the
	First Lady she's soon to be, sitting against the window sill.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		There's been something I've been
		trying to give you since our first
		date. I tried a bunch of times, but
		somehow I've always managed to trip
		over my job.
			   (beat)
		Anyay...

	SHEPHERD has picked his black canvas gym bag with the gold
	Presidential seal.

	He reaches in the bag and pulls out a bouquet of flowers.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (continuing)
		These are for you.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		They're beautiful.

	JANIE pokes her head in.

<b>				JANIE
</b>		Mr. President?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Gotta go.

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Should I stay here?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		No, walk with me.

	They exit into a hallway lined with Congressional STAFFERS,
	SECRET SERVICE, CAPITOL SECURITY, WHITE HOUSE STAFF, and,
	most prominently, A.J., LEWIS, ROBIN, JANIE and KODAK.

	SYDNEY is still clutching her flowers as they near the double
	doors to the House Chamber--

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		How'd you finally do it?

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>			   (raising his voice
			    above the cheering)
		Do what?

<b>				SYDNEY
</b>		Manage to give a woman flowers and
		be President at the same time.

<b>				SHEPHERD
</b>		Well...it turns out I've got a rose
		garden.

	SYDNEY is stopped in her tracks as--

	--the doors to the Chamber fly open--

<b>				DOORKEEPER
</b>		Mr. Speaker!!!...THE PRESIDENT OF THE
<b>		UNITED STATES!!!
</b>
	The CHAMBER leaps to its feet in a thunderous ovation,
	shouts of "Bravo!" from the gallery...

	At the back, LEWIS and ROBIN and KODAK are trying to maintain
	their professional cool, but it's a moment impossible not to
	get caught up in...SYDNEY is clutching her flowers with both
	hands...SHEPHERD is making his way down the aisle, shaking
	hands and receiving congratulations and good wishes, and we

<b>	FADE OUT.
