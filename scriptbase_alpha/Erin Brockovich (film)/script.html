   <title>"Erin Brockovich", early draft, by Susannah Grant</title>



   <pre>






<b>                          ERIN BROCKOVICH
</b>                           A True Story

                                by

                          Susannah Grant





                                                  February 1, 1998






<b>     EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY
</b>
     Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars
     motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls
     of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.

     ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk,
     past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops,
     Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of
     this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-
     HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look
     at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see
     they're leaving a 99-cent store.

     As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are
     connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS.
     Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.

     They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men
     pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful
     woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes
     rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.

     - Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the
     tops of her thighs.

     - A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a
<b>     MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.
</b>
     - A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the
<b>     TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.
</b>
     It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block
     that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is
     so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All
     those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have
     obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH.

<b>     EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY
</b>
     A side street.  No pedestrians, just parked cars.  A PARKING
     TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Fuck.

     Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to
     her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.

     As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses
     accidentally CLATTER to the ground.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Shit.

     When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            God <u>damn</u> it.

     She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.

<b>     WIDER ON THE STREET
</b>
     The Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls
     slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the
     corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side
     of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It
     SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops.

<b>     EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE - DAY
</b>
     A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded
     by strip malls.  Definitely not where the power lawyers work.

<b>                               ROSALIND (O.S.)
</b>            Morning, Mr. Masry.  How you doing today?

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY
</b>
     Generic.  Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art.  A sign over
     the reception desk reads: MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW.

     ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper
     receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his
     mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM --
     already rumpled.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Don't ask that on Mondays, Rosalind.

     Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that
     is his career has long since dissipated.  He trundles off
     toward his office.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Ed's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what
     can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner.
     She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            Tony Marvin.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain
            and suffering this time?

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            His dry cleaners.  You want him?

<b>                               ED
</b>            What do you think?  What's this?

     He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's
            your nine o'clock in there.

     Ed peers into his office.  It's a mess -- papers everywhere,
     unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin,
     in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress.  As she jiggles a
     spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously.
     Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Whoa.
                        (to Brenda)
            Remind me.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her
            fault, she says.
                        (sarcastic)
            And she looks like such an honest girl, don't
            you think?

<b>                               ED
</b>            You shouldn't judge, Brenda.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            Right.  Lap-dancers are people too.

     As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            I can't find him, Tony.  We'll have to call
            you back.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Not an office that exudes authority, and Ed's blustery
     entrance only adds to the sense of chaos.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Erin -- hi.  Sorry you had to wait.  Here,
            sit down, sit down.

     He clears a stack of papers off a chair.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Thanks a lot.
                        (as she sits)
            I tell you, I never thought just standing
            would take it out of me, but ever since that
            shithead hit me, it feels like my whole
            body's put together wrong.

     Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Jesus, you poor thing.
                        (he sits)
            Well, listen, you came to the right place.
            Whoever did this to you made one hell of a
            mistake, and you and me, we're gonna make
            him pay for it.

     He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Why don't you tell me what happened?

<b>                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>     INT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY
</b>
     Erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she
     owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to
     Ed, who's questioning her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I was pulling out real slow, and out of
            nowhere, his Jaguar comes racing around the
            corner like a bat outta hell ...

     She glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits
     nobly in surgical scrubs.  His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS
     are behind him.  A frigging Norman Rockwell painting.

<b>     LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:
</b>
<b>                               ERIN
</b>            They took some bone from my hip and put it
            in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm
            about seventeen thousand in debt right now.

<b>     STILL LATER:
</b>
<b>                               ERIN
</b>            ... couldn't take painkillers cause they
            made me too groggy to take care of my kids.

<b>     STILL LATER:
</b>
<b>                               ERIN
</b>            ... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's
            just nine months.

<b>     STILL LATER:
</b>
<b>                               ERIN
</b>            ... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person,
            a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care
            of my kids.  You know?

<b>                               ED
</b>                        (oh so moved)
            Yeah.  I know.

<b>     INT. COURTROOM - LATER
</b>
     Erin is still on the stand.  But now the doctor's lawyer is
     questioning her.

<b>                               DEFENDING LAWYER
</b>            Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your
            ex-husband helping out?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Which one?

<b>                               DEFENDING LAWYER
</b>                        (feigning shock)
            There's more than one?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah.  There's two.  Why?

     Erin looks over at the jury.  The personification of
     conservative family values.  Oh, shit.

<b>     LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (getting defensive)
            ... not like a career, cause I had my babies.
            But I woulda worked, for sure, if I didn't
            have this neck thing.

     Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem.
     Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch.

            Right.  No doubt.

     Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances.  Great.

<b>     STILL LATER:
</b>
     The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive.  Erin's starting
     to feel the case slipping away.

<b>                               DEFENDING LAWYER
</b>            So.  You must've been feeling pretty
            desperate that afternoon.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (pointed)
            What's your point?

     Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad.

<b>                               DEFENDING LAWYER
</b>            Broke, three kids, no job.  A doctor in a

            meal ticket.

     Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement.
     She's on a sinking ship.

<b>                               ERIN

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            He came tearing around the corner, out of

</b>            An ER doctor who spends his days saving

</b>                        (erupting)
            That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!

<b>     INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
     The door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out,
     furious.  Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?

<b>                               ED
</b>            I told you the questions might get a little
            personal --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a
            million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.

     Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Okay -- let's try and settle down here.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            <u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr.

     Beat.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I'm sorry, Erin.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my

     Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway.

<b>     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     A shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge.  The
     Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb.

     Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads
     over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell.

     A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white
     baby.  This is MRS. MORALES.

<b>                               MRS. MORALES
</b>            Hi, Erin!  You're back so soon.  How was it?

     She hands Erin the baby.  It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old.
     Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where
            are Matt and Katie?

<b>                               MRS. MORALES
</b>            Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?

     The truth is too depressing to share.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It'll be fine, yeah.

<b>                               MRS. MORALES
</b>            Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell
            you before, with your worries --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What?

<b>                               MRS. MORALES
</b>            My daughter, she's bought a big house with a
            room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You're moving away?  When?

<b>                               MRS. MORALES
</b>            Next week.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (stunned)
            Wow, that's soon --

<b>                               MRS. MORALES
</b>            I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can
            help my daughter take care of my grandkids.
            And it's good for you, too.  Now you have
            money, you can find a good babysitter, huh?
            Not the old lady next door.

     Oh, God.  In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH.

<b>     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Erin carries Beth up to her house.  As she nears her door,
     she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG.  It crunches under her sole.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Ugh.

     Insult added to injury.  She heads up to the house, dragging
     her shoe, wiping off the bug guts.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAY
</b>
     Just as dull inside.  Salvation Army furniture.  A lot of
     beige.  Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are
     at the table.  Beth is in a baby seat.  Erin spoons some Mac
     &amp; Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry.

<b>                               MATTHEW
</b>            I don't like this part, it's all crusty.

<b>                               KATIE
</b>            I like the crust.

     Erin switches the plates.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.

<b>                               KATIE
</b>            How come you're not eating?

     Cause there isn't enough food.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Mamma's gonna eat later.

     From her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more.
     Thick, sick-sounding coughs.  Erin looks at her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Don't go getting sick on me, baby.  Okay?

<b>     INT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     The shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with
     STEAM.  Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap,
     trying to steam the illness out of her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.  I promise.

     But her face doesn't look like she believes it.

<b>     EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY
</b>
     Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine.

<b>     INT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAY
</b>
     Erin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles.  She stops at the
     medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself,
     glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle.

<b>     INT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAY
</b>
     As a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up
     with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hi, remember me?  I was in yesterday.  Bought
            a whole mess of stuff?  Round about five?

<b>                               CHECK-OUT LADY
</b>            Honey, it's a zoo here at five.  I'm lucky
            if I even see a face, much less remember it.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh, shoot, yeah, I guess that'd be tough.
            Well, listen, I meant to buy my baby here
            some medicine, and by the time I got home, I
            realized I'd bought the adult stuff by
            mistake.  And now, wouldn't you know, I
            can't find the receipt.  I was wondering --
            could I maybe exchange it anyway ...

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
     Erin feeds Beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Just remember.  No matter what your Mamma
            does, lying and stealing is real bad.  I
            don't ever wanna hear you doing something
            like that ...

     On the table beside her sit the classifieds.  Row after row
     of want ads circled, then X-'d out in red.  A WATER BUG
     crawls across the edge of the paper.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            ... Cause there's no excuse for it, you hear
            me?  No excuse at all.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Midday.  Ed enters with a cup of coffee in his hand.  As he
     heads to his desk, he trips on a box of files.  Coffee
     sloshes out of his cup, onto his shirt.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Damn it!
                        (calling out)
            Brenda!

     She pops her head in.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            Yeah?

     He grabs a tissue, swabs his shirt, then kicks at the box.

<b>                               ED
</b>            What the hell is this doing here?

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            It's those files you asked for.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I didn't mean for you to leave them in the
            middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me.
            What do I have this afternoon?

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.

     As Ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office,
     he notices, on the other side:

     ERIN, standing in the middle of the secretaries' area, in a
     miniskirt and leather bustier, talking to MARIO, the firm's
     mentally challenged office boy.  Mario heads away from her.

<b>                               ED
</b>            What's she doing here?

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            Who?

     Ed goes to his office door and waves Mario over.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Hey -- Mario -- what's she doing here?

<b>                               MARIO
</b>            She works here.

     Ed looks back at her -- what the hell?

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
</b>
     The support staff -- mostly middle-aged women -- are all
     stealing glances at Erin.  Ed comes up to her, all friendly.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Erin!  How's it going?

     Up close, the wear and tear of worry show on her face.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You never called me back.  I left messages.

<b>                               ED
</b>            You did?  Wow, sorry about that.
                        (beat)
            Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He
            seems to think that you said --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry.
            Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did
            both.

     Glances skitter between the secretaries -- get a load of
     this.  Ed lowers his voice.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I never lied.  I may have miscalculated --
            that happens sometimes, but --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You said things would be fine, and they're
            not.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And
            I've looked, but when you've spent the last
            six years raising babies, it's real hard to
            convince someone to give you a job that pays
            worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the
            one who said I was gonna be okay, you should
            be the one to hire me.

     Ed sees everyone watching him, listening.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I'd love to help, Erin, but I'm sorry, I
            have a full staff right now, so --

     He starts to escort her out, but she stays put.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Bullshit.  If you had a full staff, you'd
            have time to return your damn phone calls.

     She's backing him into a corner here.  He shifts gears.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Okay, look.  If you really want to apply for
            a job here, you can do it the way everyone
            else does.  Send in a rÈsumÈ, make an --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm
            someone you made promises to that you didn't
            deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids'
            well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard-
            working, and I'll do anything.  But if you
            think I'm leaving here without a job, you
            got another thing coming.

     Ed glances around the room.  Not a whole lot of options here.
     He looks back at Erin.

<b>                               ED
</b>            No benefits.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY
</b>
     A tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves.  ANNA,
     the humorless file clerk, is showing Erin around.

<b>                               ANNA
</b>            ... what we do in here is keep track of all
            the case files.  That way, at any time, we
            can find out a case's status -- where it is
            in the office, stuff like that.  We file 'em
            all here, alphabetically --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh, hell.
                        (beat)
            I'm dyslexic.

<b>                               ANNA
</b>            That's a joke, right?

     Erin shakes her head, no.  Great, thinks Anna.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
</b>
     As Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass JANE, the
     bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area.

<b>                               JANE

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            What's your sister look like?

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     Ed is packing up his office.  Erin sticks her head in.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Mr. Masry?

     He turns, sees her.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Yeah?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd
            talk to about maybe getting an advance on my
            paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Jane's the office manager.  She handles
            payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early
            on Fridays.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.

     Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Oh, for Christ's sake ...

     He takes out his wallet, looks in.

<b>                               ED
</b>            All I have is hundreds.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.

</b>            Bullshit, you don't.

     He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves.  When he's gone,
     she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a
     great big kiss.

<b>     EXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a
     shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's.  Katie and Matt
     pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house.

<b>     EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag
     of groceries in the other.  Katie and Matt are each carrying
     a bag of groceries as well.  They are all singing and moving
     with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.  Katie spots a
     flower display outside the store.

<b>                               KATIE
</b>            Mommy, can I get a flower?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     A small room with Salvation Army furniture.  A BUNCH OF
     DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table.
     Matt and Katie are asleep in bed.  Erin looks down at them,
     smiles, then kisses them good-night.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door.
     But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled
     with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING.
     It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall.

<b>     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what
     used to be Mrs. Morales's house.  A few MOTORCYCLES are
     parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the
     stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hey!

     But of course he can't hear her.  She walks over to him,
     stands right in his line of vision.

<b>                               ERIN
</b><b>            HEY!
</b>
     He sees her and kills the engine.  Everything about GEORGE
     HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long
     hair.  Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Well, hello to you, darlin'.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What the hell do you think you're doing,
            making all that Goddamn noise?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Just introducing myself to the neighbors.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're
            introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.

     The guys on the porch chuckle.  Erin turns and starts back to
     her house.  George hops off his bike and follows her.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a
            beautiful woman next door, I'da done this
            different.  Let's start over.  My name's
            George.  What's yours?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Just think of me as the person next door who
            likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what.
            How about if I take you out on a date to
            apologize for my rudeness?

     Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Come on.  Gimme your number, I'll call you
            up proper and ask you out and everything.

     She stops at her porch, turns to him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You want my number?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I do.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Which number do you want, George?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            You got more than one?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of
            my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Ten?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how
            many months old my little girl is.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            You got a little girl?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five.
            That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven
            is my son's age.  Two is how many times I
            been married and divorced.  You getting all
            this?  16 is the number of dollars in my
            bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number.
            And with all the other numbers I gave you,
            I'm guessing zero is the number of times
            you're gonna call it.

     She turns and heads inside.  He calls out after her:

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            How the hell do you know your bank balance
            right off the top of your head like that?
            See, that impresses me.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
</b>
     Morning.  Erin walks in, wearing her usual garb.  She passes
     the coffee area, where Jane, Brenda, and Anna are milling.
     Brenda sees her, gives Anna a nudge.  They both check out her
     short hem.  Anna nudges Jane, who looks as well.  Erin
     glances over just in time to see all three of them staring at
     her judgementally.  She stops in her tracks and stares back.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Y'all got something you wanna discuss?

     The women go back to stirring their coffees.  Erin walks on.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Ed is walking into his office with a coffee cup in his hand
     when he trips over the same box of files again.

<b>                               ED

</b>            How long's she been crying like that? ...
            Well, she's got that tooth coming in --

     Ed appears in the door, carrying the box of files.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --

            I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that
            bag -- I'll check back in a bit.
                        (hangs up)
            Sorry.  My kid --

<b>                               ED
</b>            Where's Anna?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Out to lunch with the girls.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Oh.  Huh.
                        (beat)
            Well, look, I got this file I need valued.
            Real estate thing.  A lady has some property
            next to a PG&amp;E plant that PG&amp;E wants to buy.
            I need to know what to ask for it.

     He plunks the box of files on her desk.  She stares at it,
     with no idea of how to go about that.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh.  Okay.

     He sees her staring at the box.

<b>                               ED
</b>            You do know how to do that, don't you?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.

<b>                               ED

</b>            How come you're not at lunch with the girls?
            You're a girl.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I guess I'm not the right kind.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, FILE ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin is at her desk, staring bewildered at the files from the
     box Ed gave her, which are now spread across her desktop.
     She sees Anna packing up her things, to leave.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff -
            - could you remind me, cause I'm a little
            confused about how exactly we do that.

<b>                               ANNA

            Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you

            not about to do it for you.

<b>     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Katie and Matt are running up to the house.  Erin follows,
     toting Beth under one arm and the box of documents under the
     other.  She steps on another water bug.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Ugh.

     As she wipes the bug guts off the bottom of her shoe:

<b>                               GEORGE (O.S.)
</b>            Hey, neighbor, wanna beer?

     She spots George on his stoop, with a six-pack beside him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            No.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for
            that night.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money
            back.

     He gets up and follows her to her house.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Now, why're you giving me such a hard time?
            I'm just trying to be a good neighbor.

     Erin turns to him.  The kids are waiting at the door.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60
            and Mexican and she watched my kids for
            free.  Something tells me you're not gonna
            be able to measure up to that.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            You need help with your kids?  I could
            probably do that.

     George reaches out and grabs the box from under her arm.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Why not?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Cause I don't even know you.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Yeah, and whose fault is that?

     He's got a point there.  After a beat:

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            What, you got so many friends in this world,
            you don't have use for one more?

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     George is on the floor with Matt and Katie, playing War.
     Katie points to the Harley emblem on his leather jacket.

<b>                               KATIE
</b>            What's that stand for?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            That's for Harley Davidson.  The best damn

     Erin comes in from the kitchen.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And if I catch either of you anywhere near

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Great kids.

     Erin bends down to help him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            How?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I was serious before, you know.  If you need

            school or something -- I don't have a job
            now, so I'm around in the afternoons.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Great.  Another deadbeat.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I'm not a deadbeat.  I work when I need to.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the
            time, live off your trust fund?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I do construction, which pays real good.
            And I make it last by living cheap.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (with a little laugh)
            I hope that's not supposed to impress me.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Are you this hard on everyone who tries to
            help you?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of
            practice.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is
            to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer,
            I don't mind taking you up on it.

<b>                               ERIN

            kids?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with
            them.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Right.

     She starts cleaning up the cards.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I do.  I like how they keep it all simple,
            you know?  They don't get all complicated
            about life, like grown-ups do.  A bicycle
            and an ice cream cone -- boom, done, they're
            happy.

     Erin thinks about the offer.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You're around every afternoon?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Yup.  Usually working on my bike.
                        (she's tempted)
            No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you
            can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.

     Tempting.  Erin looks him over.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>                        (with a laugh)
            Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     The wee hours.  Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress
     on the floor.  The paperwork from the box is now spread all
     over the floor around her.  She's reading a letter.

<b>     CLOSE ON THE LETTER
</b>
     It's from PG&amp;E, to Donna and Peter Irving.  We see the
     phrases, "purchase your house ...", "fair market value ..."

<b>     CLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT
</b>
     It's a list of comparable house sales in the area.  Owner,
     cost; owner, cost.  Every house is in the $65,000 range.

     From another room, she hears the sound of BETH CRYING.  Still
     reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into:

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Still reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib.  Beth quiets.

</b>
     Erin lies down on the mattress and rests Beth on her chest.
     She sets down the file she was reading and picks up another.

<b>     CLOSE ON THE FILE
</b>
     It contains a letter from a Dr. Howard Reeves.  The first
     paragraph contains the phrase "... medical examination of
     Donna and Peter Irving ..."

     Toward the end of the letter, there are two columns.  One is
     headed: "IN RANGE".  The other: "OUT OF RANGE".  Under that
     head appear the following: "lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes,
     natural killer cells, T Helpers, T8 suppresser cells".

     Erin stares at it, confused.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY
</b>
     Erin is talking to Jane, who's pouring herself coffee.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It was in this real estate file I'm valuing.
            And -- see, I know they're the medical
            records from the people selling the house --
            but it talks about things like lymphocytes
            and T8 suppressers.

     Erin sees Ed pass behind Jane.  She lowers her voice, so he
     won't see her asking for help.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but
            -- I'm just a little unclear on what those
            things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.

<b>                               JANE
</b>            What do I look like, Erin?  A library?

     And Jane walks away with her coffee.

<b>     EXT. UCLA MAIN LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
     Large.  Looming.  Very establishment.  Through the windows,
     we see Erin at the desk, talking to a LIBRARIAN.  She has the
     file in her hands.  Over this:

<b>                               ROSALIND (O.S.)
</b>            Masry &amp; Vititoe, can I help you?

<b>                               ERIN (O.S.)
</b>            Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich.
            From the file room?  I was wondering if you
            could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up
            on that real estate thing out of the office.

     The librarian gives her directions to somewhere else.

<b>     EXT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
     Smaller, but still establishment.  Erin's Hyundai pulls into
     the parking lot.

<b>     INT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
     Erin is at the reference desk, eating a candy bar while she
     talks to the LIBRARIAN.  He checks something on the computer.
     A couple of WHITE-COATED MEDICAL STUDENTS pass her, double-
     taking.  They don't see many like her around here.

<b>     INT. UCLA SCIENCE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
     A long, academic hallway lit by fluorescents.  Erin gets off
     an elevator and heads down the hall.  She finds a door with a
     nameplate that reads "Jim Paulsen, Epidemiology" and KNOCKS.

     The door opens and DR. JIM PAULSEN appears.  He's a classic
     scientist: unruly hair, thick glasses.  Nothing like Erin has
     ever shown up at his door.  He reels at the sight of her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Dr. Paulsen?

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>            Yes?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in
            the library there, asking a mess of
            questions about -- I guess they call it
            epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me
            to find you, cause you know all about it.

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>                        (suspicious)
            Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to
            this?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Who's Baxter?

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>            He did, didn't he?  <u>Baxter</u>!

     BAXTER, another scientist, leans out of a door down the hall.

<b>                               BAXTER
</b>            Yeah?

     Baxter and Erin look at each other.  No recognition, of
     course.  Paulsen is immediately embarrassed.

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>            Oh.  Oh.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            No one put me up to anything.  I was just
            hoping I could ask you a couple questions.

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>                        (mortified)
            Of course!  Oh, gosh, of course --

<b>     INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Orderly chaos.  Dr. Paulsen, still recovering, has Erin's
     file in his hands.  Erin is sitting across from him.

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>            Well, look, there isn't a ton of information
            here, but from what there is, I'd say that
            these two people here -- what are their
            names?  Shanna and Ashley?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Right, I guess those are the kids --

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>            They've both got some immune system problem.
            Can't say what from, whether it's viral or
            genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And
            these guys -- Donna and Peter --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Their parents, I'm pretty sure.

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>            Well, from what this stuff says, I'd say
            they both have some form of cancer.

     Wow.  That's more serious than Erin was expecting.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
     CLOSE ON THE FILE on the kitchen counter.  The Irvings' phone
     number is written on the front.  A PHONE IS RINGING.

<b>                               ERIN (O.S.)
</b>            Whoa, whoa!  Easy, easy, easy --

     WIDEN to see Erin, phone to her ear, grabbing a carton of
     juice from Matt and Katie, who are fighting over it at the
     table.  Just as she takes it from them, the phone picks up.

<b>                               DONNA'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>            Hi!  You've reached the Irvings.  Leave a
            message and we'll get back to you just as
            soon as we can.  Bye-bye.

     BEEP.  Erin thinks a bit, then hangs up and looks at the
     file.  Scrawled on the cover is the Irvings' address, in
     Hinkley, California.

<b>     EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
     The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of L.A.  DISCO MUSIC
     blares from its speakers.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY
</b>
     This is a dry, desolate part of California.  No downtown, no
     community.  Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with
     small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the
     landscape like occasional tombstones.

     A beat-up old sign on the road reads: "HINKLEY, CA.  POP: "
     but the  corner where the number would be has broken off.

     As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto
     Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY
</b>
     Erin looks around.  The house she's passing has been razed.
     A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property.

     As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she
     drives by the PG&amp;E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray
     structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from
     the road.  Erin passes it without noticing it.

     She stops at an intersection.  The house on the corner has
     been boarded up with plywood.  Erin notices it -- depressing
     -- then turns the corner onto Donna's street.

<b>     EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of
     nothing.  There's a pool out back and a chain link fence
     hugging the property.  No landscaping.  Dull, but clean.  A
     few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door.

     The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.  Erin gets
     out.  As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into
     the dirt.  She rings the bell.  It has a melody chime.

     DONNA IRVING opens the door.  She's 35, petite, with a
     scrappy, high-strung manner.  She's wearing tight jeans, and
     her dark curls are piled on top of her head.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hi.  Donna Irving?

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Yes?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry &amp; Vititoe?

<b>                               DONNA
</b>                        (a little surprised)
            You're a lawyer?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for
            them.  You got a minute?

<b>     INT. THE IRVINGS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
     The house is furnished with little money, but lots of care.
     Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows.
     Out back, two GIRLS, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            This is a real nice place you got here.

<b>                               DONNA (O.S.)
</b>            Well it oughta be, with all the work I put
            into it.

     She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            I added air conditioning, put in the pool,
            made all those pillows by hand ...

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that.
            They make the place feel real homey.

     Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm
            being such a stickler on this house price
            thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&amp;E's
            backside, especially after all they've done
            for Hinkley, but I look around here and I
            think, if they want this place, they're
            gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just
            mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay
            me for the trouble of starting over.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Right.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Cause first you gotta move, then there's
            decorating, and if the windows aren't the
            same size, you know -- you're making all new
            curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I
            have the energy.  You know, I've been sick.
            Me and Peter both have.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I
            was going through your file here, and I ran
            into these medical records.  They kinda
            surprised me --

     This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self-
     pitying.  But not Donna.  Life's handed her a shitload of
     lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            I know.  They're more than a bit unusual.
            See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's
            disease.  That's a kind of cancer --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the
            Lord, but you never know.  And then while
            that's going on, I end up having to have a
            hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps
            removed from my breasts.  All benign so far,
            but still, no matter how positive you stay,
            an operation can still take it out of you.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'll say.  Holy moley.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            So the whole idea of selling the house --
            don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to
            some better place, but if they aren't gonna
            pay us properly, I just don't see the point.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah, I can see that.
                        (beat)
            I guess the only thing that confused me is -
            - not that your medical problems aren't
            important, but -- how come the files about
            them are in with all the real estate stuff?

     Donna tops off their iced teas.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if
            I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I
            just kept all PG&amp;E correspondence in one
            place.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you
            were corresponding with PG&amp;E about it in the
            first place.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            They did?

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole
            family.  And not like with insurance where
            you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed,
            either.  They just took care of it.  Just
            like that.  We never even saw a bill.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Wow.  Why would they do that?

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Cause of the chromium.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            The what?

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this
            whole thing off.

<b>     INT. IRVING HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY

<b>                               DONNA (O.S.)
</b>            PG&amp;E came around a few years ago, told us
            they put chromium in our well by mistake.
            And since we shouldn't have to drink it if
            we don't want to, they gave us free spring
            water and offered to buy our house.

     WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What's chromium?

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            It's a chemical they used over at that
            compressor station up the road there.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have
            been so sick --

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            I thought the same thing, right off the bat.
            That's why we went to see the doctor.  But
            hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do
            with the other.

     She rifles through the box.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            This is the info they gave us.  You'll see
            if you look through it, chromium's good for
            you.  When I saw what they charged for it at
            the health-food stores, I about fainted.

     She hands Erin a printed fact sheet.  Erin scans it.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your
            water being messed with and you being so
            sick.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Not around here.  This is a rough part of
            the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money,
            not a lot of luck.
                        (beat)
            It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town
            like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin's driving away from Donna's house.  A street lamp throws
     light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat.

     She gets to an intersection and looks across the street at
     the massive COMPRESSOR STATION.  Six stories high, lit up
     like a Christmas tree, with all sizes of PIPES criss-crossing
     the outside and GIANT COOLING TOWERS sticking up out of it.
     Far more massive than anything else in town, it looms over
     the horizon like the Capitol in D.C. or St. Peter's in Rome.

     Erin takes a long look at the compressor station, then turns
     onto Community Boulevard and drives away.

<b>                               ERIN

</b>            I guess we get what we pay for, huh?

     Erin pours him some coffee, hands it to him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You think it could make you sick, living in
            a place like this?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            What do you mean?

     George settles in, helps himself to sugar.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I was talking to this lady -- she and her
            husband both got cancer, and she thinks it's
            cause they live in a bad neighborhood.  You
            think that's possible?  That living in a bad
            neighborhood could give you cancer?

     George laughs a little at the thought.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Man, I hope not.  You got enough damn
            problems.

     But Erin's still mulling it over.

<b>     EXT. NORTHRIDGE, ERIN'S BLOCK - DAY
</b>
     Erin clips down the block in short-shorts and high-heeled
     boots.  Up ahead a few of DOWN-ON-THEIR-LUCK MEN are out on a
     stoop, drinking their breakfast.  Erin approaches them.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hi, y'all -- how you doing today?

<b>                               MAN 1

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm okay, I'm just fine.  I was wondering --
            could I maybe ask you a couple questions?

     She settles down on the stoop with them for a chat.

<b>     INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Dr. Paulsen and Erin are sitting, talking.  He's thrilled to
     have her back in his office.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            ... and when I realized our area's just as
            bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors
            are all sick too.  So I went and asked.

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>                        (surprised)
            You did?

     Erin digs a pad of paper out of her bag.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on
            doors.  And you know what?  They're not.
                        (reads from the pad)
            I mean, they got problems, but none of this
            cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So
            I don't know -- I just can't shake the
            feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they
            put in the water.

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>            Well, if you're talking about contamination,
            you're getting out of my area of expertise.
            Let me give you the name of a toxicologist
            friend of mine over at USC.

     Paulsen reaches for a notepad, scrawls on it.

<b>     INT. UCLA MEDICAL BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
     Paulsen is seeing Erin out of his office.

<b>                               PAULSEN
</b>            I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I
            did not peg you as the kind to go off and
            conduct her own epidemiological study.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my

<b>     EXT. USC CAMPUS - DAY
</b>
     Erin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus
     with him.  He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia,
     Birkenstocks, bushy beard.  He's as dry as dust, and as much
     as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her.

<b>                               FRANKEL
</b>            What kind of chromium is it?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            There's more than one kind?

<b>                               FRANKEL
</b>            Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does
            all kinds of good things for the body.
            There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and
            then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium,
            which, depending on the amounts, can be very
            harmful.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?

<b>                               FRANKEL
</b>            With repeated exposure to toxic levels --
            God, anything, really -- respiratory
            disease, liver failure, heart failure,
            reproductive failure, chronic headaches,
            bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of
            course, any type of cancer.

     He rattles it off coolly.  Just facts.  Erin's stunned.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            So that stuff -- it kills people.

<b>                               FRANKEL
</b>            Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly
            carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well, how do I find out what kind of
            chromium is up in Hinkley?

<b>                               FRANKEL
</b>            Have you been to the water board?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hunh-uh.  What's that?

<b>                               FRANKEL
</b>            Every county has one.  They keep records of
            anything water-related within their
            jurisdiction.  You should be able to find
            something there.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            County water board.  All righty, thanks.

<b>                               FRANKEL
</b>            Good luck.
                        (beat)
            Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're
            looking for if I were you ...

     His line continues over:

     Erin's Hyundai pulls up and stops in a cloud of dust.

<b>                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
</b>            ... Incriminating records have a way of

     Erin hops out, checks her reflection in the side-view mirror,
     then heads into the building.

     Drab, government-issue.  ROSS, the bored desk clerk is
     thumbing his way through ROAD &amp; TRACK.  Just as he stops to
     stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling
     the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters.

<b>                               ERIN

     off the page.  He jumps up, to help her with the door.

<b>                               ROSS

<b>                               ROSS

     She smiles and winks at him, then goes around the counter
     with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well.  Here goes nothing.

     She heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files.
     They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande,
     Helendale -- in no particular order.  Finally, Erin spots one
     that says Hinkley.  She pulls it down.

<b>     IN THE FILE 
</b>
     are pages and pages of Xeroxed memoranda, letters, charts, 
     graphs, handwritten notes.  All shoved in willy-nilly. 

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     George is watching a football game on TV.  He's just put TV

</b>            Most people think a sandwich's gotta have

     The one in her hand has caught her attention. 

<b>     INSERT ON THE PAPER

     It's a memo titled "CLEAN-UP AND ABATEMENT ORDER" from the

     As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs
     into the MAILMAN.  He hands her a packet of mail. 

<b>                               MAILMAN 
</b>            Here ya go, Miz Brockovich. 

     Erin looks at the top of the stack.  It's the electric bill.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY 
</b>
     Erin enters, puts down the box and stares at the mail. 
     Bills, bills, and more bills.  As she throws them on the
     table, she sees George coming out of the kitchen.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What are you doing here? 

<b>                               GEORGE 
</b>            Fixing a leak under your sink. 

     She heads into the kitchen, weary and irritated. 

<b>                               ERIN 
</b>            I didn't ask you to do that.  Damn it, 
            George, I don't ask you to do things like
            that. 

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
</b>
     Erin enters, sees all the cleaning stuff from under the sink
     is spread around the kitchen floor.  A tool box lies open. 

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Great. 

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I'm gonna clean it up. 

     Erin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away. 

<b>                               GEORGE 
</b>            Relax, Erin, I'll do it -- I'm not --

     Before he can finish, a huge WATER BUG runs onto Erin's hand. 

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Ugh -- <u>Jesus</u> -- 

     She jumps and brushes it off. 

<b>                               GEORGE 
</b>            Yeah -- you had a whole family of those
            things hanging out back there. 

     She takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it. 

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Damn it -- 

     The bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard.  Erin
     chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time. 

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Don't worry about it, I'll get it later. 

     But Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into
     killing that one bug. 

<b>                               ERIN 
</b>            Come here, you little motherfucker --

     The bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt,
     the pepper, the napkin holder.  Erin keeps after it, BANGING
     the table harder and harder with each SMACK of her shoe.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Hey, whoa -- relax --
<b>         
</b>     The salt and pepper skid off the table.  The napkins fly from
     their holder.  Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips
     into a crack in the wall and disappears.  Erin hurls her shoe
     at the crack.  It SMASHES into the wall.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            <u>GOD DAMN IT</u>!

     As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts
     to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears.
     She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her.
<b>

            ... God damn it.
<b>         
</b>     She looks around at her for-shit kitchen and starts to cry.
<b>         
</b><b>                               ERIN

            I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I
            thought it meant something.  I thought it
            meant I was gonna do something great with my

</b>     He takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very
     close.  He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on
     her foot.  Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them.

     the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle.

     As she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the
     plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and
     notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue.
     She looks at the dirt right her feet.  Kicks the ground.

     Below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green.  Erin
     notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt.
     Worry comes over her face.  She heads back to them.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY MART - DAY

     The kids are waiting at the car.  Erin comes out of the store
     with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands.

     The sound of a BABY CRYING.  The Hyundai's parked in front.

<b>                               MATTHEW (O.S.)

     Erin is at the Xerox machine, copying a file while she tries
     to calm Beth.  There's a stack of files on the nearby table.
     Matthew and Katie are flopping around on the floor.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            We'll go eat in a minute.  Settle down.

     Whining, fussing.  Ross goes over to her.

<b>                               ROSS
</b>            You know what, Erin?  I got nothing but time
            here.  Why don't you let me do that for you,
            and you can get your kids some dinner.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Ross -- you are an absolute angel.

     She hands Ross the STACK OF DOCUMENTS.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY
</b>
     Ed comes in in the morning, and without pausing, hands Brenda
     a copy of the STACK OF DOCUMENTS, with a Post-it on the top.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Fax these to this number, okay?

<b>                               BRENDA

<b>                               ED
</b>            All of them.

     He continues into his office and closes the door.

<b>     CLOSE ON THE FAX MACHINE LED
</b>
     Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up on
     the LED: PG&amp;E CLAIMS DEPT.

<b>     INT. IRVING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Another copy of those DOCUMENTS, now in Donna's hands.  She's
     on her couch with Erin, reading them.  Outside, Donna's two
     daughters are playing in the pool.  She reads the last page
     and looks up at Erin, bewildered.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            An on-site monitoring well?  That means --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It was right up on the PG&amp;E property over
            there.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            And you say this stuff, this hexavalent
            chromium -- it's poisonous?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Well -- then it's gotta be a different than
            what's in our water, cause ours is okay.
            The guys from PG&amp;E told me.  They sat right
            in the kitchen and said it was fine.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking
            to?  He gave me a list of problems that can
            come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And
            everything you all have is on that list.

     Donna resists this idea hard.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the
            doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely
            nothing to do with the other.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by
<b>            PG&amp;E?
</b>
     Donna sits quietly, trying to make sense of this.  The only
     sound is the LAUGHING and SPLASHING from the pool out back.
     Then, gradually, Donna realizes what it is she's hearing --
     her kids playing in toxic water.  She jumps up ...

<b>                               DONNA
</b><b>            ASHLEY!  SHANNA!
</b>
     ... and runs out to the pool.  Erin follows her.

<b>     EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     From the door, Erin watches Donna run to the edge of the pool
     in a frantic response to this news.

<b>                               DONNA
</b><b>            OUT OF THE POOL!  BOTH OF YOU, OUT OF THE
</b>            POOL, <u>RIGHT NOW</u>!

<b>                               SHANNA
</b>            How come?

<b>                               DONNA
</b><b>            CAUSE I SAID SO, THAT'S WHY, NOW GET OUT!
</b><b>            OUT!  NOW!!!
</b>
     Erin watches compassionately as Donna flails to get her kids
     out of the contaminated water.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     It's morning.  Ed is checking the lie of his tie in his
     reflection in the window.  Erin is on his couch, high-heeled
     legs stretched out in front of her.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Jane is delivering paychecks.  When Brenda gets to her desk,
     Jane tips her head toward Ed's office, as if to say, check it
     out.  Brenda peers in and sees Erin.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            What's she doing here?
<b>         
</b><b>                               JANE

<b>                               JANE
</b>            Well, let's see.  It's not cause she's
            smart, and it's not cause she's
            professional.  That leaves ...

     Brenda's stunned.  Takes a beat.  Makes assumptions.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            And dumb old me thought working hard and
            being loyal was the way to get ahead.

<b>     INT. ED'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
     Ed is still checking his reflection.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the
            fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed
            that send button -- PG&amp;E claims department
            is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            So you think we got 'em scared?

<b>                               ED
</b>            It sure as hell sounded like they were
            sitting up and taking notice.

     Brenda pops her head in, ignores Erin.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            David Baum from PG&amp;E is at reception.
<b>         
</b>     Erin feels the chill Brenda's sending her way.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Nice to see you again, too, Brenda.

     Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Ed and Erin come out and see DAVID BAUM waiting at reception.
     Forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of
     twelfth grade.  Not a hair on his chin.  His suit and shoes
     look brand new.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Not to question your judgment or anything,
            Mr. Masry, but -- that doesn't exactly look
            like sitting up and taking notice to me.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Ed and Erin are seated across the table from Baum. To say
     this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement.  He
     doesn't talk; he squeaks.

<b>                               BAUM
</b>            ... in the interest of putting this whole
            thing to rest, PG&amp;E is willing to offer the
            Irvings 250,000 dollars for their home.

     Ed laughs a little in disbelief.

<b>                               ED
</b><b>            250,000?
</b>
<b>                               BAUM
</b>            In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr.
            Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.

<b>                               ED
</b>            What about in terms of medical expenses?
            250,000 doesn't come close to what this
            family's gonna have to spend on doctors.

<b>                               BAUM
</b>            I understand they've had a bad run of luck,
            health-wise, and they have my sympathies.
            But that's not PG&amp;E's fault.

<b>                               ED
</b>            You're kidding, right?
                        (Baum doesn't answer)
            Look at these readings for Christ's sake.
            PG&amp;E's own technicians documented toxic
            levels of hexavalent chromium in those test
            wells, on numerous occasions.

     Ed shoves them across the table.  Baum doesn't look at them.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Everything the Irvings have had is a proven
            reaction to exposure to hexavalent chromium.
            They've had ...

     He stalls a moment.  Erin jumps in.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            -- breast cysts, uterine cancer, Hodgkin's
            disease, immune deficiencies, asthma,
            chronic nosebleeds.

     Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously
     the party line:

<b>                               BAUM
</b>            A million things could have caused those
            problems.  Poor diet, bad genes,
            irresponsible lifestyle.  Our offer is final
            and more than fair.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Wait a minute -- I thought we were
            negotiating here.

<b>                               BAUM
</b>            250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.

     Ed looks across at this pissant little kid.

<b>                               ED
</b>                        (to himself)
            Jesus Christ.
                        (he stands, to leave)
            I will present your offer to my clients.  I
            doubt they'll accept it.

     As Ed starts out:

<b>                               BAUM
</b>            Mr. Masry, before you go off on some
            crusade, you might want to remember who it
            is you're dealing with here.  PG&amp;E is a 28-
            billion dollar corporation.

<b>                               ED
</b>                        (containing his anger)
            Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.

     And Ed leaves the conference room.  Erin follows him out.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

     Erin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            At least they made an offer.

<b>                               ED
</b>            That wasn't an offer.  A million would've
            been an offer.  When they send the God damn
            mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my
            time, it's a fuck you.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I don't get why they'd do that.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Because they can.  You heard that kid --
            they have 28 billion dollars at their
            disposal.  They can afford to waste all the
            time in the world.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And you can't?

<b>                               ED
</b>            What, you think I'm made of money?

     Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room.

<b>                               BAUM
</b>            Hey, you know where I can get a cab?  My
            plane leaves Burbank in forty-five minutes.

     Ed turns and looks at him.  He gets a tiny smile.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Tell you what, why don't you go on over to
            reception, tell them I said Mario should
            take you to the airport.

<b>                               BAUM
</b>            Hey, excellent.  Thanks.

     Baum heads out to the reception area.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the
            bathroom.  They'll be driving around the
            valley for hours.

<b>                               ED
</b>                        (gleeful)
            Yeah.  Isn't that a shame?

     She watches him go into his office, impressed.  Big smile.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well I'll be God damned.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

     End of the day.  Most everyone has left.  Erin is at her new
     work space near Ed's office.  She's poring over a fat file of
     documents.  ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on.

     Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out.

     Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to
     a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's.  These are MANDY and
     TOM BROWN.  He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope
     under his arm.  Rosalind points to Erin.  The Browns enter
     the office and approach her.

<b>                               MANDY

            born without any muscles in the neck.

     WIDEN to see Erin looking at them with Tom and Mandy.

<b>                               ERIN

<b>                               TOM
</b>            Twelve, maybe thirteen.

<b>                               MANDY
</b>            When Donna told us about you, and what you
            told her about the chromium, we figured that
            might have something to do with this, too.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.

     She tucks them into a file, as if that's it.

</b>            What?

<b>                               TOM
</b>            Well.  Mandy here's had nine miscarriages.

<b>                               ERIN

<b>                               TOM
</b>            She doesn't know.  No one does.  It's not

<b>                               MANDY
</b>            I figured it musta been something I did,
            like when I smoked marijuana, maybe.  Or
            took birth control pills.  But then Donna
            told me you thought this chromium might be
            to blame for her problems, so I figured ...

     Matt and Katie are in bed, with the light off.  Erin comes
     in, quietly, in clothes from work.

     They still don't answer.  She comes in and sits on a bed.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this
            job is, things come up at the last minute,
            real important things, and I gotta deal with
            them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner
            any more than you do, but we're all gonna
            have to get used to it, cause the fact is,
            it's gonna happen sometimes.

<b>                               KATIE
</b>            It happens all the time.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            That's not true; we had dinner together just
            last night.

<b>                               MATT
</b>            You were reading the whole time.

     He's got a point there.  Erin feels like shit.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm sorry, pumpkins.  I'll try a whole lot
            harder to be around, okay?  I promise.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     The room is dark.  Erin enters and flops down onto the bed,
     exhausted.  George is lying on the bed next to her.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            If it's any consolation, <u>I</u> love you.

<b>     EXT. ROUTE 10, INLAND EMPIRE - DAY
</b>
     Dry, flat California.  Ed's big old Mercedes is toodling down
     the freeway, at an overly safe, almost-geriatric speed.

<b>     INT. ED'S MERCEDES - DAY
</b>
     Frank Sinatra is playing on the stereo.  Ed is swaying in
     time.  This is his kind of music.  He smiles, looks at Erin.

<b>                               ED
</b>            It's Sinatra's world, we just live in it.

     Whatever.  Erin glances at the speedometer.  Oy.  So slow.
     His car phone rings.  He picks it up.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Hello? ...
                        (his voice softens)
            Hi, babys.  Baby's fine.  Yes, I did.  I
            did, too, you just didn't feel it.

     He starts swerving across the lane markers.  THWACK THWACK
     THWACK.  Ed doesn't notice.  Erin's getting nervous.

<b>                               ED
</b>            You think I could leave without kissing my
            babys?  Okay, here you go.

     He kisses into the phone.  Swerves.  A car barely misses
     them.  Erin's eyes widen.  Not fun at all.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Bye-bye ... bye-bye ... no, you.  Okay,
            together.  Bye-bye.

     He finally hangs up, smiling to himself.  Erin clears her
     throat.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Um -- you mind pulling over?  Just -- for a
            second?

<b>     EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
     The Mercedes pulls to a stop on the shoulder.  Erin gets out,
     walks around to the driver's side.  Opens the door.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            First of all, don't talk baby talk to your
            wife in front of me.  It <u>really</u> undermines
            your authority.  And second, I know you're
            my boss and all, but you are the worst
            fucking driver I've ever seen.  Move over or
            I quit.

     He moves over.  She gets in, turns off the Sinatra.  They
     pull back out onto the freeway in silence.

<b>     EXT. MANDY BROWN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     The Mercedes and a truck are parked out front.

<b>                               PETE (O.S.)
</b>            There's something about this whole thing I
            don't quite understand, Mr. Masry.

<b>     INT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Donna and Pete Irving, and Mandy and Roy Brown are all
     seated, sipping iced tea.  While they talk, Erin hands them
     all information packets on chromium.  Ed is standing in front
     of them, a little stiff.

<b>                               PETE
</b>            If PG&amp;E messed with our water, why would
            they bother saying anything about it to us?
            Why not just keep quiet about it?

<b>                               ED
</b>            To establish a statute of limitations.  See,
            in a case like this, you only have a year
            from the time you first learn about the
            problem to file suit.  So PG&amp;E figures,
            we'll let the cat out of the bag -- tell the
            people the water's not perfect; if we can
            ride out the year with no one suing, we'll
            be in the clear forever.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            But it was more than a year ago that they
            told us --

<b>                               ED
</b>            It's okay.  We're not suing.  All we're
            doing is using this information to get you
            a real nice purchase price on your house,
            and get you two --
                        (to the Browns)
            -- a comparable retroactive bonus added to
            your sale price.  This way, and PG&amp;E can
            still look good to their shareholders, cause
            they're not involved in an ugly lawsuit; all
            they're doing is buying a little property.

     Roy looks up from his retainer agreement.

<b>                               ROY
</b>            It doesn't say here how much this whole
            thing's gonna cost us.

<b>                               ED
</b>            My fee's forty percent of whatever you get
            awarded.

     Erin watches them look around at each other, stunned by the
     figure.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I
            heard that number, I said you got to be
            kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Erin --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm the one who's injured, and this joker
            who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk
            away with almost half my reward?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Erin --

     Erin's enjoying Ed's discomfort almost too much to stop.  But
     just almost.  She shifts gears.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Then I asked him how much he makes if I
            didn't get anything.

     They look at Ed.  Well?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Then I don't get anything either.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And I realized, he's taking a chance too.

     When they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they
     all reach for their pens and sign.   They hand the agreements
     over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed.  He
     stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up.  That's that.

<b>                               ED
</b>            All right, then.  Let's hit the road.

     Boy.  Cold as ice.  Erin stares at him, stunned by his
     brusque manner, then leans in to him, close.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (whispering)
            Mr. Masry, if you don't mind my saying, you
            got a lot to learn about being friendly.
            These people just hired you as their lawyer.
            The least you could do is make a little
            pleasant conversation.

     She gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women.
<b>         
</b><b>                               ERIN
</b>            Donna, let me help you clean all this up.

     She picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the
     kitchen.  Donna and Mandy follow, leaving Ed alone with Pete
     and Roy.  He stands there, awkwardly.  Then, finally:

<b>                               ED
</b>            So, what's, uh ... what's new?

<b>     INT. DONNA'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
     Erin and Donna are putting away the cleaned glasses.  Mandy
     is scanning the chromium pamphlet Erin gave her.

<b>                               MANDY
</b>            You know that thing it says in here about
            rashes?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Uh-huh?

<b>                               MANDY
</b>            Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood
            -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed
            like someone in his family always had a rash
            somewhere or other.  I just figured it was
            something in the genes.  And you know how it
            is -- you don't like to ask about things
            like that ...

     Erin listens, interested.

<b>     EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY, BARN - DAY
</b>
     Another day.  BOB LINWOOD, 40's and gruff, is in the barn,
     tossing hay around.

<b>                               ERIN (O.S.)
</b>            Excuse me.  Are you Mr. Linwood?

     He sees Erin picking her way toward him in her high-heels.

<b>                               LINWOOD
</b>            Yeah?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm Erin Brockovich.  I work at the law firm
            that represents your former neighbors the
            Browns.  They suggested I give you a call.

     She steps in a cow patty.  Laughs at herself good-naturedly.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Boy howdy, did I ever wear the wrong shoes.

<b>     EXT. THE DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     CLOSE ON A SIGN that reads: THE DESOTOS, hanging on the side
     of a small, paint-chipped house.  Erin is at the door talking
     to MARY DESOTO, 65, who's wearing a big cross at her breast.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            ... and Mr. Linwood seemed to think that
            your husband had been sick as well.

<b>                               MARY
</b>            Yes, Mr. DeSoto has lung cancer.  Never
            smoked a day in his life, neither.

<b>     INT. LAURA AND MIKE AMBROSINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin is talking to MIKE and LAURA AMBROSINO -- 30's.  Solid,
     family folks.  But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look
     swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that
     she's in a lot of pain.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Mrs. DeSoto said she wasn't sure exactly
            what it was that you had --

<b>                               PETE
</b>            She's not alone on that one.

<b>                               LAURA
</b>            Well, they know what it is -- it's called
            fibrous dysplasia --

<b>                               PETE
</b>            The bones start growing again.  Gives her
            headaches like you wouldn't believe.

<b>                               LAURA
</b>            -- they just don't know what caused it.

<b>     INT. RITA AND TED DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Erin is talking to TED AND RITA DANIELS.  Their daughter
     ANNABELLE, 10, is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            ... then Mike Ambrosino remembered seeing
            you folks at the hospital from time to time
            too, so I thought I'd just stop by.
                        (to Annabelle)
            You must be Annabelle.

<b>                               ANNABELLE

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Whew, are you ever a beauty.  I mean, you
            must drive those boys crazy.

     Annabelle smiles a little.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Late night.  George rolls over -- Erin's side of the bed is
     empty.  He checks the clock, then gets up and heads into:

<b>     INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
     He peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's
     chair in Matthew and Katie's room.

     Erin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep.  Erin
     hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Tell me something, George.  What kind of God
            lets a beautiful little 10-year-old girl get
            brain cancer?  Isn't He supposed to be in
            charge of stuff like that?  Make sure it
            doesn't happen?
                        (beat)
            I swear, any other job, He'd be fired.

<b>     EXT. VALLEY SIDEWALK - DAY
</b>
     Ed and Erin are walking down the street, take-out coffee cups
     in their hands.  Ed is sipping his, but Erin is in too much
     of a lather to drink hers.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Because I said no.  Look -- the only reason
            PG&amp;E's even talking to us is cause this is a
            quiet little real estate dispute.  We add
            plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle
            of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem --
            against a massive utility.  No, thank you.

     They go into their office building.

</b>            Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up
            to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest
            people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend
            every single day watching their little girl
            fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll
            tell them we can't help them cause you don't
            feel like working that hard.

<b>                               ED

</b>            -- It's about being realistic.  Something
            like this, Erin -- it could take forever.
            They're a huge corporation.  They'd

</b>            And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not

     Erin tails Ed back to his office.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            We can get these people.  With a little

</b>
     Ed goes over to his desk, sits down.  He sees a stack of

<b>                               ED
</b>            Damn it.

     He shoves the messages aside and puts his head in his hands.
     He sits like that for a moment, GROANS to himself.  Then he
     pushes himself up and heads over to his door.

     When he opens it, he finds Erin still standing there, exactly

            from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have
            lived on that land since then.

     Ed pauses, groans again, realizing what decision he's making.

<b>                               ED
</b>            This is a whole different ball game, Erin.
            A much bigger deal.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Kinda like David and what's-his-name?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole
            fucking family.
                        (heavy sigh)
            Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if,
            you find me the evidence to back all this up
            -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.

     She smiles victoriously.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm
            filing for bankruptcy.

     He heads back to his desk.  Erin follows him into his office.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Course, gathering evidence -- now, that's a
            big job.  A hell of a lot bigger than just
            filing.  I'm gonna be working a lot harder
            now, taking on a lot more responsibility ...

     He gives her a look.  Knows what's coming.

<b>                               ED
</b>            What now?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all
            the time I'm gonna be spending on the road,
            I'll probably be needing my own cel phone,
            won't I?

<b>     INT. TOYS 'R' US - DAY
</b>
<b>     CLOSE ON A BEEPING CEL PHONE
</b>
     as Erin tries to program numbers into its speed dial.  WIDEN
     to see she is reading from the phone's manual as she enters
     Toys 'R' Us with George, Matthew, Katie and Beth.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You each can pick out four things.  But
            nothing huge.  Look at the price.  Nothing
            crazy.

     Matthew and Katie fan out into the store.  Erin keeps messing
     with the phone.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            You can buy 'em all the toys you want, but

     Erin looks over at him, weary.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            George, I am just trying to do something
            nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            One toy per kid is doing something nice.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh?
            They're scarred for life.  They're gonna
            start holding up 7-11's any day now.

<b>                               GEORGE

            I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna
            hear it.  I am doing the best I can.

     And she walks away from him.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY, ROADSIDE DITCH - DAY
</b>
     Erin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch,
     scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic
     containers.  Over this:

<b>                               ERIN (O.S.)
</b>            Dr. Frankel, it's Erin Brockovich.  Tell me
            something: if I wanna find as much evidence
            of hexavalent chromium contamination as I
            possibly can, what should I do?

     As Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side
     of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked
     "No Trespassing".  Her arms are full of more containers.

<b>                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
</b>            Well, what you have to remember is, if you
            have hex chrom in the water, you have it in
            anything that lived off the water.

     She adds them to a growing collection of containers in the
     trunk of her car.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY, THE POOL BEHIND AN ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Another day.  This time it's RAINING.  Erin minces her way
     down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels.

<b>                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
</b>            What I'd do is start a collection.  Anything
            that existed in water, on water, under water
<b>            ...
</b>
     She gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of
     rancid pool water and seals it.

<b>                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
</b>            anything that had water flow over or under
            it ...

     Erin spots a few dead frogs in the water.  She picks one up
     by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well.

<b>     EXT. WELL - DAY
</b>
     With a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up
     over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against
     one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts
     shimmying down the well.

<b>                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
</b>            anything that had water pass through it ...

<b>     INSIDE THE WELL
</b>
     she winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as
     she descends to the water level.  When she's low enough, she
     takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY
</b>
     Erin's at her desk, bending over her notebook in a miniskirt,
     adding reports to the TOXICOLOGY binder.

<b>                               FRANKEL (O.S.)
</b>            ... collect 'em, label 'em, then bring 'em
            to me.  I'll analyze 'em, see what we got.

     ON THE REPORTS: We catch a few words: "water sample A ...",
     "soil sample D ...", "frog sample A ...", "... traces of
     hexavalent ..."

     Brenda looks at Erin and sees her hem rising in the back.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            For God's sake, Erin, I can see your
            panties.

     Erin turns to Brenda, relishing the chance to irritate her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Liar.  I'm not wearing any.

     Ed, in his office, laughs.  He's starting to like this gal.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     It's a hot night.  George is playing on the floor with the
     kids.  Erin is behind them on the couch, laboriously reading
     a book labeled, simply, CHROMIUM.  The phone RINGS.  Erin
     picks it up.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hello?

<b>                               MALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>            Is this the Erin Pattee Brockovich that's
            been snooping around the water board?

     His voice is flat, creepy.  Not friendly.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yes.  Who's this?

     CLICK.  Erin stares at the phone, freaked.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
     George watches Erin double-checking the locks on the door.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone
            call, George.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Come on, Erin.  A job's supposed to pay your
            bills, not put you in danger.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt.
            Remember?

     She goes to the living room, double-checks the window locks
     in there.  George follows.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Look, don't take this the wrong way, but
            don't you think you might be out of your
            league here?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            No, see -- that's exactly what those
            arrogant PG&amp;E fucks want me to think -- that
            because they got all this money and power,
            we don't stand a chance in hell against
            them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.

     She heads into the bedrooms.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            It doesn't have to be this complicated,
            Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (off-hand)
            How would you know?

     George reacts, a little stung.  He follows her into:

<b>     INT. MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Matt and Katie are asleep.  Erin is checking their windows.
     George comes in.  They whisper.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            You mind telling me what that's supposed to
            mean?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Nothing.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            If you got a problem with me taking care of
            your kids instead of getting some job, just
            say so.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I didn't say that.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can
            start leaving the kids with the chicken fat
            lady again.  Would that make you happy?

<b>                               ERIN

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I know what they can sleep through, Erin.  I
            probably know it better than you.

     She gives him a glare, then leaves the room.

<b>     INT. WATER BOARD - DAY
</b>
     Erin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of
     files.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ross passing.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&amp;E
            pay you to cover their ass, or do you just
            do it out of the kindness of your heart?

<b>                               ROSS
</b>                        (a bad liar)

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee.
            That heavy-breathing sicko that called the
            other night could've only found out about me
            from you.
                        (beat)
            People are dying, Ross.  You got document
            after document here, right under your nose,
            that says why, and you haven't said word one
            about it.  I wanna know how the hell you
            sleep at night.

     Ross is speechless.  He just stands there.  Erin drags the
     box to the floor and goes to work.

<b>     EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin's car is parked in front.  A DIRTY OLD PICK-UP comes
     rumbling up the road.  When its lights hit Erin's car, it
     slows, then pulls over.  The driver flicks on his BRIGHTS to
     get a better look at the car.  The truck sits there for a
     bit, a dark presence.  Then, as the headlights of another car
     appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out
     and drives off.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - NIGHT
</b>
     A pile of documents is strapped into the passenger seat.  An
     empty coffee cup rolls around the floor.  Erin's driving,
     exhausted.  She yawns as she dials her phone.

<b>                               GEORGE (O.S.)

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Well, come to think of it, we did have a big
            event around here.  Beth started talking.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and
            she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."

     Erin says nothing, just stares out at the empty highway,
     feeling all hollowed-out.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I'd never seen that before -- someone's
            first word.  Pretty intense.

     Erin just nods.  Keeps staring straight ahead as a tear rolls
     down her cheek.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S AREA - DAY

     CLOSE ON SOME FILES as Erin hands them to Ed.  As he takes
     them from her, he notices a crematory urn on Erin's desk.

<b>                               ED

<b>         
</b>     Ed laughs and hands the documents to Brenda without looking
     at her.  She grumpily takes them over to the fax machine.

     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED as Brenda types in the number. The
     recipient's name comes up again: PG&amp;E CLAIMS DEPT.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY BARBECUE - DAY
</b>
     Open pits, pony rides, watermelon.  George is watching Katie
     and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped
     being fun hours ago.  Now they're just hot and tired.

     BY THE BARBECUE, Ed is talking to an OLDER COUPLE as they
     sign retainer agreements.

     ELSEWHERE, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a
     swimming pool with FIVE OTHER WOMEN.  The water is green.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            This was the community pool?

<b>                               WOMAN 1
</b>            Yeah, that PG&amp;E built.  The whole time we
            thought it was algae that made it so green.

<b>     LATER ...
</b>
     Erin's trunk is open.  She and Ed are clipping new clusters
     of retainer agreements into the "PLAINTIFFS" binder.

<b>     LATER STILL ...
</b>
     Erin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets.  She
     sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I'm bored, and so are the kids.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Just a few more minutes, then we can go.
                        (as he heads off)
            Take her, will you?

     George drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin.  He heads
     over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log.

     As he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he
     dropped.  It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET.  He's in his
     50's, strong and sinewy.  Military-style dark glasses obscure
     his eyes.  He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working
     the crowd.  Watches her carefully.  He slides the pamphlet
     into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY
     OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board.

<b>     LATER STILL ...
</b>
     Erin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave,
     when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Erin, this here's Frank Melendez.  He works
            over at the compressor station --

     Erin stops in her tracks, very interested.

<b>     LATER STILL ...
</b>
     Erin and Frank are on a bench, talking.  Out of the corner of
     her eye, she sees her car drive off.  George's hand sticks
     out the driver's side and flips her the bird.  She watches
     him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>             I'm sorry.  What were you saying?

<b>     LATER ...
</b>
     The barbecue is winding down.  Ed is heading for his
     Mercedes.  Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I need a ride.

<b>     INT. ED'S CAR - DAY

     Another beat.  Then Erin's cel phone rings.  She digs into
     her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can.  Answers.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            <u>What</u>, asshole?

     There's a pause.  Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the
     line, very strained:

     at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired.

     Erin opens the door.  Very dark, very quiet.  Laura is lying
     in bed.  Erin goes over to her.  They speak in whispers.

<b>                               LAURA
</b>            I'm embarrassed.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            That's okay.  I understand.

<b>                               LAURA
</b>            It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting
            worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be
            a good mother.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm real sorry, Laura.

     Erin sits down on the chair next to the bed.  Takes a beat.

<b>                               LAURA
</b>            Know what I always thought I wanted outta
            life, Erin?  A Jaguar.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Jaguar's a darn pretty car.

<b>                               LAURA
</b>            I thought if I could spend that kinda money
            on a car, it'd mean everything else was
            fine.
                        (beat)

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll
            get one.

     Laura shakes her head.

<b>                               LAURA
</b>            Wouldn't mean the same thing.

     Erin watches her sadly.

     A LOUD, industrial plant.  Erin and Frank Melendez walk
     through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress.  Both
     in hard-hats.  He's giving her a tour.

<b>     EXT. NORTHRIDGE STREET - DAY
</b>
     George, in his leather and denim, is walking down the
     sidewalk.  As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER.
     He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change.

     In the stroller, Beth starts to whine.  George reaches in his
     pocket, finds her pacifier.  As he's leaning down to give it
     to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him.
     The roar grows.  He stands, looks.  A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN
     BIKERS has pulled up next to him.  He looks at them.  They
     look at him, then at the stroller.  George feels ridiculous.

     When the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out.
     George just stands there and watches them go.

     His office is all about Hinkley.  A map of the plume area and
     a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant
     cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface;

     Erin is up at the map, eating Chinese food.

</b>            They used the hex chrom here, in these
            cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then
            they dumped it here, in these six ponds.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            They covered 'em over.  And not too
            carefully either, cause you dig one inch
            under the surface, and the dirt is green as
            a fucking shamrock.

<b>                               ED
</b>            And that's what caused the contamination?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's
            on the bottom.

     She reaches for a document, reads from it.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            See, according to this, they were supposed
            to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep
            into the ground.  But guess what --

<b>                               ED
</b>            They skipped that step.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I guess it was a little too inconvenient.
            So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed
            into the groundwater, free as you please.

<b>                               ED

            I don't even wanna ask what you did to make
            this Melendez guy talk.

     In response to the insinuation, Erin gives him a glare.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            For your information, Frank cares what was
            in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half
            his day wading around them.  That was his
            job.

<b>                               ED
</b>            No shit.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            No --

     Suddenly, her eyes pop out of her head --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            <u>SHIT</u>!  SHIT!  Hot!  Hot!  Hot!

     Tears spring to her eyes.  She fans furiously at her mouth.
     Ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her.
     She takes a swig.  There's a nanosecond of relief ... until
     the tequila hits.  Her eyes redden.  She spews and gasps.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You ... <u>asshole</u> ...

     Ed chuckles.

     The tequila's been dipped into.  Ed and Erin are each lying
     on a couch, staring at documents.  Late-night working.

</b>            Erin -- lemme tell you something.  If I'da

            haven't billed a minute of my time since I
            started on this case, so you can quit
            hitting me up like I'm rich or something.

     He gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room
     with it, cleaning up all the Chinese food cartons.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty
            rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got
            those PG&amp;E fuckers by the balls here.

<b>                               ED
</b>            We've got the PG&amp;E fuckers in Hinkley by the

            in San Francisco.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What do you mean?

<b>                               ED
</b>            PG&amp;E corporate is claiming they had no way
            of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh, they knew.  They had to know.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Show me the document that proves that.

     She doesn't have one.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Then they didn't know.  And if they didn't
            know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages.
            And punitive damages is where the money is.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I
            work on this thing, the more I realize what
            a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here
            we got a company that poisoned a whole
            aquifer -- that built a pool for a town,
            then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u>
            the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving
            things?  That's just not right.

<b>                               ERIN

<b>                               ED
</b>            Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a
            long time since I had a case I cared about.

<b>                               ERIN

<b>                               ED

     He gives her a long look.

     They both smile a little awkwardly.  Take a beat.  Then:

     She flicks on the lights.  Brenda's desk is decorated and as
     a present on it.  Erin's is empty.

<b>                               GEORGE

                        (it's obvious)

            could do ...

     George looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little.  He
     goes over to her, wraps his arms around her.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Hey.  Fuck 'em, babe.  Who needs 'em, huh?

     He kisses her.  She leans into him.  He kisses her some more.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>                        (quietly)
            See?  All we need is each other.

     She kisses back.  She's gonna let him take care of her.  Some
     more kisses, heating up.  He slides her onto her empty desk.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Good thing there isn't a present there, huh?
            That mighta hurt.

     She laughs a little.  He slides his hands up her skirt.  She
     pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants.

     After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant.
     It misses.  Not that it would do anything if it hit.  He
     reaches for another, throws it.  Then another, and another.
     He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant.  Then,

            say they're taking us more seriously.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah, I heard that one before.

     Brenda leans her head in.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Webster, Mr. Buda, and Ms.
            Cooper, from PG&amp;E are here.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
</b>
     Talk about moving up the food chain.  MS. SANCHEZ, MR.
     WEBSTER, MR. BUDA, and MR. COOPER mill slowly about the
     reception area like sharks.  They all ooze importance.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, OUTSIDE OF ED'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Erin, Ed and Brenda are staring out at them.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.

<b>                               ED
</b>            They're trying to intimidate us.
                        (then, to Brenda)
            Tell them to wait in the conference room.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Sanchez, Webster, Buda, and Cooper are seated.

     The door opens and Ed enters, legal pad under his arm.
     Followed by Erin, legal pad under her arm.  Followed by Anna
     (looking professional in Brenda's suit coat), legal pad under
     her arm.  Followed by Mario (in a suit produced from who
     knows where), legal pad under his arm.  If you didn't know
     better, you'd assume it was a team of lawyers as well.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Counselors --

<b>                               MR. SANCHEZ
</b>            Counselors.

     Ed and Erin sit down and get to work.  Mario and Anna,
     clearly told to just follow along, sit down a moment later.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER
</b>
     Mario and Anna are sitting mutely in their seats beside Ed
     and Erin, firing blank looks across the table.

<b>                               SANCHEZ
</b>            Let's be honest, here.  Two million dollars
            is more money than these people have ever
            dreamed of.

     Erin has no patience for this today.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh, see, now that pisses me off.  First of
            all -- we got more'n a hundred plaintiffs.
            They may not be sophisticated, but they do
            know how to divide, and two million dollars
            isn't shit when it's split between them.

     Mario and Anna exchange a look.  This is getting interesting.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Erin --

     But there's no stopping her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And second of all -- these people don't
            dream about being rich.  They dream about
            being able to watch their kids swim in a
            pool without worrying they'll have to have a
            hysterectomy at age 20, like Rosa Diaz -- a
            client of ours -- or have their spine
            deteriorate like Stan Bloom.  Another client
            of ours.  So before you come back here with
            another lame-ass offer, I want you to think
            real hard about what your spine is worth,
            Mr. Buda -- or what you'd expect someone to
            pay you for your uterus, Miss Sanchez --
            then you take out your calculator and
            multiply that number by a hundred.  Anything
            less than that is a waste of our time.

     And she gets up and storms out of the meeting.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY
</b>
     Erin drinks a big swig of coffee and pops a few more aspirin.
     Beyond her, the PG&amp;E lawyers are filing out of the office.
     Anna wanders over to Erin, a little uncomfortable.

<b>                               ANNA
</b>            Um, Erin?
                        (Erin turns)
            Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily
            my favorite person in the world ...
                        (beat)
            ... sometimes you're not half-bad.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm gonna assume that was meant as a
            compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin's at her desk, which is completely buried in documents
     and files.  She's visibly exhausted, struggling to focus on
     the page, and COUGHING while she works.  Ed calls to her.

<b>                                ED
</b>            Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet
            you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.

<b>                                ERIN
</b>            D'you get his name?
                        (no answer)
            Course not.  Jesus, Ed --

<b>                                ED
</b>            He said he'd be at the gas station at six.

<b>                                ERIN
</b>            Boy, this job takes me to some of the best
            damn places, huh?

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY GAS STATION - SUNSET
</b>
     Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the
     bottle.  She checks her watch: 6:30.  The GAS STATION
     ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights.

<b>                                ERIN
</b>            This is the only station in town, right?

<b>                               ATTENDANT
</b>            Yup.

     He gets in his car and drives off.  Erin sits down again.
     Looks down the road in both directions.  Nothing.

     Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint
     of chrome.  She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees:
     the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery.

     Erin looks around, realizes she's alone.  As she looks back
     at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab.
     She realizes she's being watched.  The driver's door opens.

     Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys.  She
     jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it
     won't turn over.  Panic.  The Man in the Dark Glasses has
     gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around
     again.  Not a soul.  She tries the engine again.  And again.

     Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages.  Erin peels
     out of the gas station.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus
     on the road.  She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing.

     She reaches the train tracks.  A train is passing.  She has
     to stop.  As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce
     off her rear view mirror.  Truck lights, coming her way.
     Fuck.  She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back
     at the headlights closing in on her.  The train, the
     headlights, the train, the headlights ...

     Finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last
     train car zips by.  Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car
     over the tracks.  The truck follows.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
     The Hyundai zips down the road.  And behind it, the truck.

<b>     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT
</b>
     She looks out at the landscape around her.  It's black.  No
     other cars on the road.  She starts to panic, accelerates.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
     The Hyundai going faster.  The truck still following.

<b>     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin comes up on a stop sign.  She runs it.  So does the
     truck.   A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST
     CAUSE SALOON.  In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's
     Mercedes.  She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car.

<b>     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT
</b>
     Ed is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door.  She
     rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Someone's following me.

<b>                               ED
</b>            What?  Who?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was
            alone, then he followed me, like, two miles.
            Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.

     Ed gets up and heads toward the door.

<b>                               ED
</b>                        (to the counter guy)
            Beer, please.

     As Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench.

<b>                               ED
</b>            What kind of truck?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I don't know.  Big.  Dark.

<b>                               ED
</b>            He's gone.
                        (back to the table)
            Did you get a license plate?  Or a make?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            No, Ed -- what with me running for my life,
            I didn't have time to check those things --

<b>                               ED
</b>            I was just asking.  Are you all right?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.

     Ed looks at her.  She looks terrible.  Shaky, tired, drawn.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Jesus, you look like shit.  When was the
            last time you had a decent night's sleep?

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
     Crappy and pink.  Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot.
     Erin's Hyundai follows.  Ed stops, gets out.

<b>     INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT
</b>
     Ed swings by Erin's open car window.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Don't worry.  I'm getting two rooms.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each
     rattling a key.  They find their adjacent rooms and stop.
     Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Lock the door every which way you can.  And
            if there's anything -- funny sound, whatever
            -- pound on the wall.  I'll come right over.

     She nods a little.  Then before she goes into her room:

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I think you should know -- there's very few
            people in the world who don't piss me off 90
            percent of the time.
                        (beat)
            You're one of 'em.

     It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.  They look
     at each other.  Maybe even considering.  But after a long
     beat, she reaches for her door again.  Moment over.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I'm triple locking my door, so don't even
            think of trying to take advantage.

     She smiles, goes inside.  He watches her close her door
     behind her before going inside himself.

<b>     EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT STOOP - NIGHT
</b>
     George is sitting alone on the stoop, drinking a beer.  Music
     is coming from his house next door.  He stares out into the
     street with a lot on his mind.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
     Katie and Matt are making a mess of breakfast.  Beth is on
     the floor, grinding cereal into the linoleum.

<b>                             ERIN (O.S.)
</b>            Hello?

     Erin enters, having just gotten home, and sees the mayhem.

<b>                             ERIN
</b>            What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?

<b>                             KATIE
</b>            I don't know.

<b>                             ERIN
</b>            George!

     She heads out.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     George is sitting on the bed when Erin enters.

<b>                             ERIN
</b>            Jesus, George, they're turning the kitchen
            into a hellhole.  You know you can't leave
            them alone like that.

     He doesn't answer.  Doesn't move.  She notices this.

<b>                             ERIN
</b>            What's going on?  What are you doing?

<b>                             GEORGE
</b>            Thinking.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            About what?

     He's very calm.  He holds out a small jewelry box.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            About this.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What's that?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the
            mall one day, and I thought, damn, those
            would look good on those beautiful earlobes.
            So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next
            time Erin says something nice, does
            something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.
                        (beat)
            Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In
            six months, you haven't said one nice thing
            to me.  That's a long time.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I know.  But still.  Six months.
                        (he stands)
            I think you oughta either find a different
            job or a different boyfriend.  Cause there
            may be men who don't mind being the maid and
            getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as
            shit not one of 'em.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I can't leave my job, George.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People
            do it all the time.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best
            thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it.
            For the first time in my life, I got people
            respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a
            room and everyone shuts up just to hear what
            I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever.
            Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            More than you need me.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I need it.

     He nods, then stands, to leave.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Maybe you didn't like who you were before,
            Erin, but I did.  That's who I fell in love
            with.

     Only then does she see the packed duffel bag in the corner.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You already packed up your stuff?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I pretty much knew what your answer was
            gonna be.

     He picks it up and walks out the door, tossing the earring
     box on the bed as he goes.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin is at her window, looking out at the street below.
     George is strapping a couple of bags onto the back of his
     bike.  He gets on the bike, starts it up, and drives away.

<b>     INT. HYUNDAI - DAY
</b>
     Erin is driving, looking weary.  Her kids are in the car.

     Matthew turns on the radio.  Erin reaches over and turns it
     off.  Matthew turns it back on.  Erin glares at him, turns it
     off.  On/off/on/off.  A test of wills.  Finally, when Matthew
     turns it on one more time, Erin turns it off, yanks the knob
     off the stereo and throws it out the window.

<b>     EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
     The Hyundai pulls into the lot.

<b>     INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

     Erin parks the car, unclips her seat belt.

<b>                               ERIN

     She gets out.

     Business as usual.  Erin comes in, goes straight to her desk.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY

     Erin flips through her "in" box, looking for something in
     particular.  Doesn't find it.  Grrr.  She heads off to:

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, JANE'S OFFICE - DAY

     Jane is at her desk when Erin comes in.

<b>                               ERIN

     Ed is on the phone when Erin barges in, rage in her eyes.

<b>                               ERIN

            for just one second here --
                        (puts the call on

            Do you mind?

<b>                               ERIN

            Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.

     Clearly, she's in a dander he's going to have to deal with.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the
            problem is here, or --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I

            That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a
            problem with Jane, work it out for yourself.
            I don't have time to deal with --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass
            for you.  I watch everything else in my life
            go straight in the toilet, for you.  And
            what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the
            way I'm treated around here -- but have you
            ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever
            mentioned to everyone what good work I'm
            doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey,
            Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has
            the best tits; she gets paid the most cause
            she's the best God damn employee I've ever
            had?

<b>                               ED

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.

     Ed sighs.  Realizes he's going to have to take this on.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I'll see what I can do.

<b>                               ERIN

            amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God
            damn parking lot right now, cause I still
            don't make enough to afford good child care.
            Makes me think about looking around for a
            job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.

     She storms out.

     Erin is standing at the sink, visibly exhausted, trying to do
     the dinner dishes with one arm and comfort Beth, who's
     CRYING, with the other.  Matthew comes in.

     The DOORBELL RINGS.  Erin goes to get it.  Matthew follows

     Matthew is dogging Erin on this.  Beth is still crying.

<b>                               MATTHEW
</b>            Randy's mom said yes right away.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (snapping)
            Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom
            doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's
            dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's
            gonna take who where is a little easier over
            at Randy's house.

     Erin opens the door.  A MESSENGER is there.

<b>                               MESSENGER
</b>            Erin Brockovich?

<b>                               ERIN

<b>                               MESSENGER
</b>            Package from Masry &amp; Vititoe.

     He hands her a manila envelope.  She signs for the package,
     then tears into it as the Messenger heads away.

     A CHECK and a SET OF KEYS fall out.  She looks at the check.
     It's made out for $5,000.  A note attached reads "HIRE A
<b>     NANNY. AND LOOK OUTSIDE. - E."
</b>
     Erin looks up and sees A BRAND-NEW CHEVY BLAZER parked on the
     curb.  She looks at the keys in her hand.  Chevy keys.  Whoa.

<b>     EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
     Erin drives up in the Blazer, pulls into a parking space.

</b>
     It's dark.  Ed's seated at a table, alone.  Erin walks by the
     door, then spots him and stops in the doorway.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Believe it or not, I would've been satisfied
            with just the check.

     Ed turns, sees her.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Well, you go threatening to leave, I can't
            take any chances.  You're the only person
            around who understands what I'm doing.
            Things come up, I gotta know I got someone
            to turn to.

     She sits, reading him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What kind of things come up?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Things like the head counsel for PG&amp;E
            calling me with an offer.
                        (beat)
            20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it
            or leave it.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Whoa.  No shit.

<b>                               ED
</b>            It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            So what are you thinking?

<b>                               ED
</b>            I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to
            make this decision.
                        (beat)
            50 thousand bucks is more than any other
            California toxic plaintiff has gotten.
            Ever.  But ...

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            ... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's
            medical bills.

<b>                               ED
</b>            And it's less than pocket change for PG&amp;E.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Do you think we'd do better by going to
            trial?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have
            anything linking this to PG&amp;E corporate.
            Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus,
            we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to
            bring on more lawyers ...

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot
            of money.

<b>                               ED
</b>            It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight
            million dollars.

     Beat.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            That's a fucking fortune, Ed.  And you know
            I'm the last person on Earth to walk away
            from a big payday.  But you and me didn't
            get into this to get rich.  We did it cause
            we both have this voice in our heads saying,
            do the right thing; get these plaintiffs
            what they deserve -- the right to live and
            die in some kind of comfort and peace.  If
            50,000 isn't gonna buy that, then we gotta
            say no.
                        (beat)
            Trust me.  If you don't do the right thing
            for these people, getting that 6 million
            dollars is gonna feel like shit.

     He nods to himself, and looks up at her, his mind made up.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I knew I put up with your bullshit for a

<b>     INT. ERIN'S NEW CAR - DAY
</b>
     It's raining.  They're driving through the tall buildings of
     Century City.  Ed is full of nervous excitement.

<b>                               ED
</b>            This guy, Erin -- he's got more toxic tort
            experience than anyone else in California.
            He's huge.  And he said yes to me on the
            first phone call, right off the bat.
                        (points to a building)
            That's it.  The big one.  They've got the
            top three floors.

<b>     INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, RECEPTION - DAY
</b>
     It feels more like the lobby of a five-star hotel than an
     office.  Erin and Ed step off the elevator.  Erin gawks.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Don't joke.  They might.  So do me a favor
            and behave yourself for once.
                        (to receptionist)
            Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.

     As Ed turns to check his reflection, a YOUNG LAWYER comes
     through the reception area.  Erin watches him pass, then,
     still miffed, calls out to him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Scuse me, sir, you got a real nice ass, you
            know that?

     The lawyer double-takes on her, then retreats into the
     office.  Erin turns to Ed, smiles.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh, I'm sorry.  Was that not what you meant
            by behaving myself?

<b>     INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD RECEPTION AREA - DAY
</b>
     THERESA DELLAVALLE, 38, junior partner, comes out to greet
     them.  She's everything Erin isn't: conservative, restrained,
     unemotional.  And about as sexy as a station wagon.

<b>                               THERESA
</b>            Ed.  Good to see you again.

<b>     INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
     Theresa leads Ed and Erin down a long hall of teak desks.
     The sound of their footfalls is swallowed up by the plush
     carpeting.  Occasional ATTORNEYS and PARALEGALS glance at
     Erin.  She feels their stares.

<b>     INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, KURT POTTER'S OFFICE - DAY

     Potter is sitting behind his giant desk when Theresa leads Ed
     and Erin in.

<b>                               THERESA
</b>            Kurt, Ed Masry's here.  And this is Erin

            Kurt Potter.

<b>                               POTTER

            Well.  Now I know what you meant when you
            called her your secret weapon.

     Erin gives Ed another look.  What the fuck?  Ed gives her a
     firm look back.  Behave.

<b>     INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

     Potter, Ed, Erin, Theresa and few  PARALEGALS are sitting
     around the table.  As the conversation ping-pongs between Ed
     and Potter, Potter completely ignores Erin.

<b>                               POTTER

<b>                               ED
</b>            It's PG&amp;E saying to the judge that we don't

<b>                               POTTER

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            How long's he gonna take?

     Erin's starting to steam at Potter.  Theresa sees it brewing,
     tries to intercede.

<b>                               THERESA
</b>            You know what?  Why don't I take Erin down
            the hall, so we can start in on this stuff?

     Erin notices all her files in stacks against the wall.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hey -- those are my files --

<b>                               THERESA

            We're just going to have to spend a little
            time filling in the holes in your research.

     Okay, these people are starting to piss her off.

<b>                               ERIN

<b>                               THERESA
</b>            No offense.  There are just some things we
            need that you probably didn't know to ask.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I
            may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18
            months on this case, and I know more about
            those plaintiffs than you ever will.

<b>                               THERESA
</b>            Erin.  You don't even have phone numbers for
            some of them.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Whose number do you need?

<b>                               THERESA
</b>            Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to
            be able to contact the plaintiffs.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?

<b>                               THERESA
</b>            You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs'
            numbers by heart.

     Erin just stares at her.  Theresa sighs, reluctantly glances
     down at a file.

            wrong foot here --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet.
            In fucking ugly shoes.

<b>     INT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
     It's still raining.  Erin is following Ed to the car.  He's
     furious.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            She insulted me!

<b>                               ED
</b>            Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But
            instead of handling it politely, instead of
            treating her with respect --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Why the fuck should I respect her?

     Ed stops in his tracks, furious.  He glares at her.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Not in my world.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Gee, I wonder why.

     On that, he gets in his car, slams the door, and drives off,
     leaving her standing alone in the pouring rain.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hey!  You're my ride!

<b>     INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
     Potter and Ed are walking down the hallway, mid-conversation.
     A FEW PARALEGALS follow them with files.

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            I've also been thinking about the team.
            Responsibilities, who should cover what --

<b>                               ED
</b>            Right.

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            I think we should makes some changes.

<b>     EXT. LINWOOD'S DAIRY - DAY
</b>
     Bob Linwood is in his barn, mucking it out.  Theresa is at
     the edge of the property, trying unsuccessfully to get his
     attention by yelling and waving her arms.  In her expensive
     shoes, she's stopped short of the cow patty minefield.

<b>     INT. POTTER, HUGHES &amp; ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
     CLOSE ON A CLIENT FILE as a hand fills in a phone number.

     WIDEN TO SEE Erin seated with a PARALEGAL, rattling off facts
     and numbers from memory.  She's seized by a COUGHING FIT.

<b>     EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY - DAY
</b>
     Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention.  Finally,
     rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses
     it at the barn.  It hits the window and BREAKS IT.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - DAY
</b>
     Erin's desk is empty: no Erin, no files, nothing.  Ed comes
     out of his office and hands Brenda a STACK OF DOCUMENTS.

<b>     CLOSE ON THE FAX LED
</b>
     Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up
     again, only this time it says: POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD.

<b>     INT. POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY
</b>
     A SECRETARY carries the documents to Potter's office.  On the
     way, she passes THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  Inside, Erin is still
     dictating to the PARALEGAL.  She's shivery with fever now.
     The floor around her is littered with tissues.

<b>     INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Theresa is talking to Rita and Ted Daniels.  Annabelle is
     curled up on the sofa, wrapped up in a blanket.  Rita and Ted
     notice that Theresa doesn't even look at Annabelle.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
     Erin is lying in bed, home sick, talking on the phone.  She's
     talking over the noise of TANIA, her 20-something Eastern
     European nanny, vacuuming the hall.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I know she isn't real warm, but they say
            she's a real good lawyer ...

<b>     INTERCUT WITH

<b>     INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Ted Daniels is on the phone.  Rita is next to him.

<b>                               TED
</b>            That may be.  But I don't want her coming to
            the house again.  She's kinda stuck-up, and
            she upsets Annabelle.  Now, I hate to say
            this, but when she left today, Rita asked if
            we should get a new lawyer.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Ted, no -- don't do that.  If you don't like
            Theresa, you don't have to work with her.
            Me and Ed are still here for you.

<b>                               TED
</b>            I called Ed two days ago, Erin, and he still
            hasn't called me back.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY
</b>
     The phone rings.  Brenda picks up.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>            Ed Masry's office ... Sorry, he can't be
            interrupted.

     INTERCUT WITH Erin at home, still in bed, so irritated.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Don't be a pain in the ass, okay, Brenda?
            Just put him on.

<b>                               BRENDA
</b>                        (with finality)
            I said, he can't be interrupted.

     Erin hangs up.  Then, with a groan, she pulls her weary body
     out of bed.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY
</b>
     Erin drags herself into the office.

<b>                               ROSALIND
</b>            Hey, Erin, I thought you were taking a sick
            day.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            So did I.

     She heads toward Ed's office, but stops when she sees a
     meeting in progress in the conference room.  Ed is on the
     side of the table facing her, flanked by Potter and Theresa.
     On the other side of the table, are FOUR SUITED BACKS.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What's going on in there?

<b>                               ROSALIND
</b>            Some meeting.  With PG&amp;E people.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            PG&amp; -- Are you sure?

<b>                               ROSALIND
</b>            Yup.  They must be important, too, cause
            they came on a special plane.

     Erin feels this like a sock in the gut.  She stares at the
     meeting, stunned.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
     This band of PG&amp;E lawyers is the oldest and most impressive
     of all.  Ed, Potter, and Theresa are listening to the most
     senior PG&amp;E lawyer, MR. CORBIN, talk.

<b>                               CORBIN
</b>            ... we would enter into binding arbitration
            -- judge, no jury -- with a settlement to be
            between 50 and 400 million dollars.

     Ed and Potter hear this and think about it.

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            Any preconditions on the settlements?

<b>                               CORBIN
</b>            The plaintiffs have to agree to it
            unanimously.  And they're barred from ever
            discussing their settlement with anyone.

<b>                               ED
</b>            50-400 million dollars isn't a whole hell of
            a lot of money for your company, Mr. Corbin.

<b>                               HEAD COUNSEL
</b>            50-400 million dollars is a great deal of
            money for your plaintiffs, Mr. Masry.

     As Ed mulls this, he sees, beyond Mr. Corbin,

<b>     ERIN
</b>
     staring at him from the other side of the glass wall, her
     face cold with hurt and anger.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Could I -- just take a brief break here for
            a moment?  I'll be right back.

     He gets up and goes out into:

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Ed comes out.  Erin's so angry she can barely breathe.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your
            fucking head off --

<b>                               ED
</b>            Erin, it's just a meeting.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            People don't fly down in their own god damn
            plane for "just a meeting" --

<b>                               ED
</b>            Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I
            thought you should rest.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if
            it suited you.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Okay, look.  It's an important meeting.
            Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think
            anymore?

     He resists being dragged into an knock-down, drag-out fight.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Look, this is serious now.  They're talking
            serious money --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And, what, I'm not serious?

<b>                               ED
</b>            You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say
            any God damn thing that comes into your
            head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That
            can be great; that can be a lot of fun --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            "Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a
            year and a half, hand you the best case of
            your life on a God damn silver platter,
            remind you of why you became a lawyer in the
            first place, and you think of me as "fun?"

<b>                               ED
</b>            Okay, now you're making this personal, and
            it isn't --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            <u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed.
            My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not
            personal, I don't know what is.

     She starts to COUGH and CRUMBLE, but fights it.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (weakened)
            How dare you take that away from me.

<b>                               ED
</b>            No one's taking anything --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating
            to some God damn steno clerk so you could
            finish this thing without me.  After all
            I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.

     By now the entire office is watching.  As are the lawyers in
     the conference room.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty.
            You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of
            perks ...

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?

     Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            If this piece of shit is supposed to take
            the place of your respect, you can take it
            and shove it up your ass.

     She throws it at him and storms away.  The phone hits the
     glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it.  Ed just
     stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the
     splintered glass wall.

<b>     EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
     Erin gets to her car.  As she opens the door, the ALARM
     SOUNDS.  She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it
     off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out.  With the
     siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin's driving home.  As she turns onto her street, her
     headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small
     boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Holy shit --

     She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark.
     She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street.  A CAR HONKS.

     Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again.  Holy shit,
     is right.  It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Matthew --

     She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk,
     blocking his path.  When he sees her car, he turns and runs
     the other way.  Erin leaps out and follows him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Matthew!  <u>MATTHEW</u>!

     She catches up and collars him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you
            doing out here?

<b>                               MATTHEW
</b>            I'm gonna go live with George.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     MUSIC is playing.  TANIA is on the phone.  The receiver is
     yanked from her hand.  She turns to see Erin hovering over
     her, barely containing herself.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            If you leave here real fast, I might not
            kill you.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATTHEW AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Matthew's in his bed, facing the wall.  Erin sitting on the
     foot of his bed, near tears.  Katie's watching from her bed.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            We'll work out the roller hockey thing,
            okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out.
            I promise.

<b>                               MATTHEW
</b>            You always say that.  Then you go to work
            and forget you promised.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard.
            It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to
            be able to organize things right and -- when
            it comes to you guys, I end up falling
            short.

<b>                               MATTHEW
</b>            You never fall short for the work people.  I
            guess maybe you just love them more.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on
            Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.
                        (beat)
            I promise.

     She lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and
     inches away from her.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Erin comes out of the bedroom.  As she turns to close the
     door, she collapses to the floor in a heap.  Out cold.

     A busy Southland ER.  George bursts through the doors with

<b>                               DOCTOR

     Erin's in bed, hooked up to an IV, looking exhausted.  All

</b>                        (giving nothing)
            Mm-hm.

     As she watches him reach for his motorcycle helmet, to leave,
     she's hit with a wave of regret.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            George, hang on.
                        (he pauses)
            Look ... I'm sorry.  I just --

     There's a KNOCK at the door, and Ed enters.  George looks at
     him.  Not interested in her apologies.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            I'll drop 'em by tomorrow.

     And Erin watches George leave the room, then turns to Ed.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            If you're here to fire me, your timing's
            lousy.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I'm not gonna fire you.
                        (beat)
            I wanted to.  But then you got sick, and
            that woulda made me look like a shit.
                        (serious)
            You embarrassed me, Erin.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I know.  I'm sorry.
                        (beat)
            Do I get to hear what happened anyway?

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER
</b>
     Ed has taken off his coat and pulled a chair up next to
     Erin's bed.  He's eating the pudding off her tray.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Uh-huh.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And if you had to guess ...

<b>                               ED
</b>            With nothing linking it to the corporate
            offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the
            lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            So why would PG&amp;E offer it?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Because.  They know the evidence; they know
            they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they
            wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once
            you factor in all they'd spend on this case
            in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Wait, what do you mean, ten years?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that
            for the appeal.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (confused)
            I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing
            goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before
            these plaintiffs see their money?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the
            Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and
            those people still haven't seen a dime.  So
            in legal terms, ten years is --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human
            beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of
            them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They
            need their money now!
                        (beat)
            We gotta get 'em to agree to the
            arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn
            one of those plaintiffs to --

<b>                               ED
</b>            <u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all
            set up --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            When?  Where?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to
            tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --

<b>                               ED
</b>            You're not gonna be there.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the
            doctor says --

<b>                               ED
</b>            This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm
            saying you can't come.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Why not?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you.
            He thinks you're a loose cannon.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Fuck Kurt.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Erin --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter
            is?  He's the kind of guy who never would
            have taken this case in the first place.
            He's the kind of guy who would have sold
            these plaintiffs down the river when PG&amp;E
            offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like
            us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head
            telling him to do the right thing.

     But his mind's made up.  He stands to leave.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Don't come, Erin.  I mean it.  If you do,
            I'm gonna have to fire you.
                        (beat)
            Just ... concentrate on getting well.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     The parking lot is empty, except for three Mercedes.  Ed,
     Potter, and Theresa are in the doorway, going over their
     notes.  A TRUCK pulls into the lot.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Katie and Matt are watching TV.  Beth is playing near them.
     Behind them, Erin is lying on the couch, under a blanket,
     distractedly trying to watch TV.  She checks her watch.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     The lot is filling with more cars and trucks; headlights
     criss-cross each other as people pull in from all directions.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin's sitting up now, jiggling her knee, unable to sit
     still.  She checks her watch again.  6:30.  She can't take
     it.  She throws off the blanket and gets up.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Come on, kids, we're going for a ride.

<b>     INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     CLOSE ON HANDS.  As people stream in, they are each handed a
     release form with a space for a signature on the bottom.

<b>     INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - LATER
</b>
     It's sweltering.  The room, packed with plaintiffs, hums with
     horse flies and tension.  People are fanning themselves with
     the release forms.  Potter's addressing them from a raised
     platform.  Ed, Theresa, and Andrew are seated behind him.

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            Binding arbitration isn't all that different
            from a trial.  It's overseen by a judge.
            Evidence is presented in much the same way.

<b>     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     One more car pulls into the lot.  It's Erin's Chevy.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin unbuckles her seat belt.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Stay in the car, babies, I won't be long.

<b>     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a
     window and looks in at the packed meeting.

<b>                               PLAINTIFF (O.S.)
</b>            And then a jury decides?

<b>                               POTTER (O.S.)
</b>            No, sorry, I should have mentioned that.
            There's no jury in binding arbitration.  No
            jury, and no appeal.

     She climbs up on an old wagon for a better view.

<b>                               BOB LINWOOD (O.S.)
</b>            No appeal?  So what are our options if we
            don't like the result?

<b>                               POTTER (O.S.)
</b>            Well -- you have none.  The judge's decision
            is final.  But I really don't anticipate
            that as a problem.

<b>     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Now, in addition to the stifling heat, the large room is
     thick with mistrust.  People are shifting in their seats,
     whispering to each other.

<b>                               TOM BROWN
</b>            You don't even know what it's gonna be; how
            do you know we're gonna like it?

     Agreeing MURMURS ripple through the crowd.

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            As I said before, it will <u>definitely</u> be
            somewhere between 50 and 400 million
            dollars.

<b>                               MANDY BROWN
</b>            Which?  There's a big difference there.

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            I wouldn't want to speculate at this point.

<b>                               MANDY BROWN
</b>            Ed -- what do you think it'll be?

     Potter turns around and looks at Ed seated behind him.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I think ... Kurt's right.  We shouldn't
            speculate.

<b>                               MANDY BROWN
</b>            So then, what, that mystery number's divided
            up at the whim of some judge --

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            Judges don't make decisions based on whim,
            ma'am.  They make them based on precedent
            and evidence.

     The GRUMBLE of discontent has overtaken the room.  More
     whispering, more movement.

<b>     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin watches the meeting fall apart.  It's driving her crazy.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Fucking idiot --

<b>     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Potter sees he's losing them, too.  Tries to gain control.

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            Look.  Everyone.  Is this a big decision?
            Absolutely.  But I do believe that if you
            put a little faith in the system, you'll be
            quite pleased with the outcome.

     Ted Daniels gets up from his seat.

<b>                               TED DANIELS
</b>            Mr. Potter, if you knew me from Adam, you'd
            know that being pleased isn't an option for
            me anymore.  Now don't take this personally,
            sir, but I've never seen you before in my
            life.  I'm not about to put my faith in
            anything just cause you tell me to.

     He drops his agreement form, unsigned, then takes Rita's hand
     and heads for the door.

<b>     EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Meeting's over.  The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse.
     Cars start up, headlights flick on.  People pull away.

<b>     INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Everyone has left.  Erin enters and looks around.  The floor
     is littered with rejected, unsigned release forms.

     She thinks for a moment, then gets an idea.  She picks up a
     release form, and leaves the firehouse.

<b>     EXT. MINI MALL - NIGHT
</b>
     Everything's closed, except the KINKO'S store at the far end.
     Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot.

<b>     INT. KINKO'S - NIGHT
</b>
     A BORED EMPLOYEE is at the register, painting with Wite-Out
     on a blue piece of paper.  Erin enters, dragging her kids.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Can I have one of those counter thingies,
            please?

     The Employee gives it to her.  Erin crosses to the copiers.
     She slips the release form into one, then taps in the number
     of copies: 635.  Presses "START."  The machine WHIRS to life.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin's Chevy pulls into the parking lot.

<b>                              MATTHEW (O.S.)
</b>            I don't want to stay here.  It smells.

<b>     INT. HINKLEY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin is entering the crappy motel room with her kids.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            We got no choice.  I'm not gonna make it
            home tonight.  Now go wash up and climb into
            bed.

     As the kids wander toward the bathroom, Erin picks up the
     phone and dials.  RING, RING.

<b>                               GEORGE (O.S.)
</b>            Hello?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hi.  It's me.
                        (silence)
            I got a favor to ask you.

<b>                               GEORGE (O.S.)
</b>            I don't do favors for you anymore.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're
            the only one I trust them with.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - DAY
</b>
     Very early.  Erin is visible in the motel office, talking to
     the clerk, when George's motorcycle pulls into the lot.  She
     turns around and sees him pulling up next to her Chevy.

<b>     EXT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Erin comes up to him, hands him a key.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I got you your own room.

     He takes it, glances toward the motel room.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            They up?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hunh-uh.  Not yet.
                        (awkward beat)
            Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike,
            okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.

     She hands him a wad of cash.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            How long's this whole thing gonna take?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I don't know.  Few days.
                        (beat)
            Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.

     He nods.  She gets into her car.  Before closing the door,
     she turns back to him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And I miss you.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.

     She sees how mad she's made him.  Takes a beat.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I treated you real bad, George.  I know
            that.  But, my problem was -- I never been
            with anyone who deserved better than that.
            You're the first nice guy who ever liked me.

     George softens, shifts.  He steps toward the truck and gently
     closes her door, so he's standing close to her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I just ... didn't know how to handle it.
            That's all.

     He thinks about this.  Finally:

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Think you could learn?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (with a smile)
            You know me.  I pick things up real fast.

     He smiles back at her, nods, then tenderly brushes a piece of
     hair out of her eyes.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            You shouldn't be driving around, you know.
            You're sick.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of
            these folks aren't.

     He nods, understanding.  Then he taps the side of her truck
     and turns toward the motel room.  She puts the truck in gear
     and pulls out.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - DAY

</b>
     Donna's gardening out front, her head wrapped in a scarf to
     cover her chemo-thinning hair, when Erin's Chevy pulls into
     the driveway.  Erin gets out, goes to the back of the truck,
     gets two of the release forms, then heads over to Donna.

</b>            And after all we been through -- no jury, no
            appeal.  It just makes me nervous.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I understand all that. And I don't wanna
            force you into anything.  If you don't want
            to sign, that's fine.  But why don't we talk
            it over a little, cause I'd sure hate for
            you to turn this down for the wrong reasons.

<b>     EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     The door opens.  Erin emerges, holding two signed agreements.
     Donna is letting her out.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            You wouldn't happen to have a little time
            right now, would you, Donna?

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            For what?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns
            now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values
            your opinion ...

<b>     INT. MANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Erin, Donna, Mandy, and Tom are seated on the sofas.  Mandy
     signs an agreement.  Hands the pen to Tom, who also signs.

<b>     EXT. LINWOODS' HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     From outside, we see Erin at the kitchen table with Donna and
     Bob and Ruth Linwood, who are listening intently.

<b>     INT. DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Erin and Donna are leaving, saying good-bye to Mary DeSoto.
     Erin has a signed release form in her hand.

<b>     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S CAR - DAY
</b>
     DISCO blares.  The two boxes.  The formerly empty one now has
     a small stack of signed release forms in it.  The top one has
     Bob Linwood's signature.

<b>     IN THE FRONT SEAT
</b>
     Erin is driving, eating a hamburger, and going over her list
     of plaintiffs.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY MART - EVENING
</b>
     People are going about their shopping.  Rita Daniels is
     stopped, talking with A FEW MORE PLAINTIFFS.

<b>                               RITA
</b>            I thought so, too, but Erin says a trial's
            gonna take years

<b>     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT
</b>
     The signed stack has grown; the unsigned stack has shrunk.
     Erin drops five more agreements into the "signed" box.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     In the wee hours.  While her kids sleep, Erin sits at the
     cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing,
     alphabetizing.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     CLOSE ON ERIN, fast asleep at the table, her face pressed
     against the linoleum.  There's some NOISE in the room,
     WHISPERING.  Erin stirs and looks around to see George behind
     her, diapering Beth, while Matt and Katie put their shoes on.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What time is it?

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            Real early.  We're just gonna take your car
            to get some breakfast.

     Erin forces herself awake.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            No, I need my car --

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more
            sleep.

     He picks up Beth, takes Katie's hand, and calls across the
     room to Matthew.

<b>                               GEORGE
</b>            C'mon, pal.  Leave that alone, we gotta go.

     Erin turns to see Matthew holding one of her release forms.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh, baby, please don't play with that, okay?
            I got 'em all organized.  Just put it back.

     But he's reading it.  And something has caught his attention.
     He looks up at Erin.

<b>                               MATTHEW
</b>            This girl's the same age as me.

     Erin gently takes the form away from Matthew, wanting to
     shield him from the harsh realities of this case.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            That's right, sweetheart.

     She replaces the form on top of the stack.

<b>                               MATTHEW
</b>            She's one of the sick people?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah.  She is.
                        (beat)
            But you know what?  That's why I'm helping
            her.  So she can get some medicine to make
            her feel better.

     Matthew mulls this over a bit more.

<b>                               MATTHEW
</b>            How come her own mom isn't helping her?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Cause her own mom's real sick, too.

     Matthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the
     door, where George, Beth, and Katie are waiting for him.
     Before he leaves, though, he turns back to Erin.

<b>                               MATTHEW
</b>            Maybe we'll bring you back some breakfast.
            You want eggs?

     She looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward
     acceptance.  Smiles, moved.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Eggs'd be great, baby.  Eggs'd be perfect.

<b>     INT. ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY
</b>
     Erin's driving along a dusty Hinkley road, eating cold eggs
     out of a take-out container with her fingers.

<b>     EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Morning.  A GROUP OF MEN are arriving at work.  Erin's truck
     pulls up.  She grabs some release forms from the truck and
     wanders up to the men.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hey, y'all.  How you all doing today?

<b>     INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY
</b>
     She tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
     Morning drop-off time.  Erin is handing out release forms zo
     a GROUP of MOTHERS who just dropped off their kids.

<b>     EXT. HINKLEY MART - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin is leaning on the hood of her truck, going down her list
     of plaintiffs, checking off the ones who have already signed.

<b>     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - DAY
</b>
     Another day.  Erin has set up shop here and is at a table
     with about FIVE PLAINTIFFS, all reading agreements.  MIKE
     AMBROSINO enters.  Erin spots him.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Mike!  I been looking all over for you.
            Come here, I wanna talk to you.

<b>     INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT
</b>
     The signed stack is getting bigger.

<b>     INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY
</b>
     And bigger.

<b>     INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY
</b>
     And still bigger.

<b>     EXT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT
</b>
     CLOSE ON ERIN'S TRUNK.  A bunch more forms get thrown onto
     the signed stack, which is now much higher than the unsigned.

<b>                               ERIN (O.S.)
</b>            I'm gonna head out to Barstow and talk to
            some folks out there tonight.

     WIDEN TO REVEAL Erin talking on a nearby pay phone.

<b>                               GEORGE (O.S.)
</b>            Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I will.  Bye.

     She hangs up.  As she turns to get into her car, she finds
     herself face-to-face with the Man in the Dark Glasses.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Jesus!

     He's just standing there, a foot away, blocking her exit.
     She recognizes his truck as the one that chased her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Okay, what're you gonna do?  You gonna kill
            me?  Dump my body in a ditch somewhere?  Or
            maybe you just wanna inject me with some
            poison too -- why change tactics at this
            stage of the game?
                        (beat)
            Get outta my way, you make me sick.

     She pushes past him.  But he grabs her by the arm.  He's a
     big guy; it's a strong grab.  Now she's scared.  For a
     moment, he does nothing.  Just looks at her.  Then:

<b>                               DARK GLASSES
</b>            If PG&amp;E made someone destroy a whole lot of
            documents -- would that matter to you?

     Erin takes a beat, realizing she completely misread him.  She
     gently pulls her arm away.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well ... I guess that depends on what the
            documents were.
                        (she takes a beat)
            I'm sorry -- I didn't get your name.

<b>                               DARK GLASSES
</b>            Embry.  Charles Embry.

<b>     INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT
</b>
     Erin and Embry are the only patrons.  Erin's eating a burger.
     Embry has a beer.  He's talking quietly, not looking at her.

<b>                               EMBRY
</b>            I was working in the compressor, and out of
            nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the
            office and says, we're gonna give you a
            shredder machine, and send you on down to
            the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of
            all the documents stored out there.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Did he say why?

<b>                               EMBRY
</b>            Nope.  And I didn't ask.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Did you get a look at the stuff you
            destroyed?

<b>                               EMBRY
</b>            Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding --
            you gotta find some way to entertain your
            mind.  So yeah, I took a look.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And ...?

<b>                               EMBRY
</b>            There was a lot of dull stuff -- vacation
            schedules, the like.
                        (beat)
            But then there were a few memos about the
            holding ponds.  The water in them.  They had
            readings from test wells, stuff like that.

     Erin tries to hide her excitement at this information.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And you were told to destroy those?

<b>                               EMBRY
</b>            That's right.

     Destruction of evidence.  Pretty big deal.  Erin plays it
     down.  Wipes her mouth with her napkin, takes a sip of beer.

<b>                               EMBRY
</b>            Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good
            employee.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What do you mean?

<b>                               EMBRY
</b>            Well.  There were a few documents that I
            somehow didn't get around to shredding.
                        (beat)
            That I kept instead.

     Erin stops, mid-bite.

<b>     INT. EMBRY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
     He's dug out an inch-high stack of documents.  Erin looks
     them over, stunned.  Embry is standing apart from her, hands
     shoved deep in his pockets.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            How come you didn't say anything when you
            found these things?

<b>                               EMBRY
</b>            At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some
            of 'em want to go to college.  I can't
            afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was
            being honorable.
                        (beat)
            But there's nothing honorable in what I did.
                        (beat)
            Maybe that's why they picked me for the job.
            Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY
</b>
     Rosalind is at the desk.  Anna, Brenda, and Jane are helping
     themselves to coffee.  Erin enters, with a big box in her
     arms and a whole lot of attitude.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hey, Ros, where are they?

<b>                               ROSALIND
</b>            In the conference --

     But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can
     finish.  Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her
     gait.  They watch her with interest.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
     The table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated
     slew of paper that PG&amp;E is sending them.  Ed, Kurt, Theresa,
     Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them.

     Erin breezes in like sunshine.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Morning!

<b>                               ED
</b>            Erin?  What are you --

<b>                               ERIN
</b>                        (ignoring Ed)
            You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely
            forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing
            as how you've been so good to me, I think
            that is a terrible oversight.  So what I
            been doing over the last few days is I've
            been putting together a present for you.

     She plunks the box down on the table.  Potter opens the top
     of the box.  Looks in.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            635.  They all signed.  Every single one.

     IN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering
     what's up.  A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads
     across Ed's face.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Ho - ly - shit.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a
            little something for you, too.

     Erin hands Ed a manila envelope.  He opens it.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Internal PG&amp;E documents, all about the
            contamination.  The one I like best says,
            and I'm paraphrasing here, but it says yes,
            the water's poisonous, but it'd be better
            for all involved if this matter wasn't
            discussed with the neighbors.  It's to the
            Hinkley station, from PG&amp;E Headquarters.
            Stamped received, March, 1966.

     Potter and Theresa reel.  Ed shakes his head in disbelief.

<b>                               POTTER
</b>            Where did -- how did you do this?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well, what with me not having any brains or
            legal expertise, I just went on up there and
            performed sexual favors.  635 blow jobs in
            five days.  Whew, am I ever tired.

     And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed.
     The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away.

<b>     EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
     Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads
     down the hall.  She presses the elevator button.  The doors
     open.  As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Hey!

     Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing.  He
     stares at her, in awe.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I don't know what to say.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Say you were wrong.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I was wrong.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged
            yourself.

<b>                               ED
</b>            I did.  Both.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on

<b>                               ED
</b>            The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe,
            Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in
            history.

     He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in
     the elevator.  He walks toward her, stops right outside the
     elevator.

<b>                               ED
</b>            But I know you're not gonna quit on me.

</b>                        (with a smile)
            Cause you got a little voice in your head
            saying, do the right thing.  Give him
            another chance.

     Of course she will.  She releases her hand so he won't see
     her smiling.  Ed watches the doors close.

     Erin's at the wheel.  Time has passed -- her hair's a little
     different.  She's singing along with "Funky Town."

<b>     EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
     Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a
     little cluster.  Donna's under an umbrella.  Pete is
     slathering on sunscreen.  The two girls zip out toward the
     water.  Erin waves.  Pete and Donna spot her, wave back.

<b>     EXT. BEACH - LATER
</b>
     Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her
     girls boogie board in.  Erin comes up behind her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            How you feeling today?

     Donna turns, sees her.  Smiles.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            It's a good day.  I feel good.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it,
            maybe we should talk shop.

     Erin sits down on a rock.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            The judge came up with a number.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            A number for the whole group, or for us?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Both.

     Donna sits down next to her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            He's making them pay the maximum.

     Tears of vindication spring to Donna's eyes.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Oh, my God.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            And he's making them give five million of it
            to you all.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Five million dollars?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Five million dollars.

     She reels.  After a breathless beat:

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            I don't even know how much money that is.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            It's enough -- for whatever you need, for
            whatever your girls need, for whatever your
            girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.

     Donna wipes the tears off her face, then watches the light
     flickering off her girls playing in the surf.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            I can put them in a good school.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Any school you want.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            And get someone to help around the house.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yup.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Oh my God.  Oh my God.

     Donna is overwhelmed.  Erin pulls her close.

<b>                               DONNA
</b>            Oh, my God.

<b>     EXT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</b>
     Now <u>this</u> is where the hot lawyers work.  A gleaming testament
     to power.

<b>     INT. MASRY &amp; VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     Boxes everywhere.  They just moved in.  Everyone is unpacking
     at his or her desk.  Rosalind is manning the new phones.

<b>                               ROSALIND
</b>            Masry &amp; Vititoe, can I -- shoot!

     She lost them.  Her reaction indicates this isn't the first
     time.  The front doors open and Erin enters.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?

<b>                               ROSALIND
</b>            Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.
                        (into phone)
            Masry &amp; Vititoe, can I -- damn it.
                        (calling out)
            Does anyone know anything about these
            phones?

     Erin heads on down a hall to:

<b>     INT. ED'S NEW OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     A beautiful corner office.  Ed is unpacking when Erin enters.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Careful you don't spit from here; you could
            kill someone.

<b>                               ED
</b>            You see your office?

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Yeah.  Yours is nicer.

<b>                               ED
</b>            Oh, okay.  Here it comes.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Here what comes?

<b>                               ED
</b>            The extortion, the threats ...

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            I wasn't gonna --

<b>                               ED
</b>            "I can always find someplace else to work.
            Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give
            me a view of the French Riviera ..."

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Ed, I swear, I'm not --

<b>                               ED
</b>            Okay, fine.  <u>Fine</u>  You backed me into a
            corner again.  You're holding me hostage ...

     He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a check.  Hands
     it to her.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            What is that?

<b>                               ED
</b>            Take it.

     Erin does.  Looks at it.  Her eyes bug out.

<b>                               ERIN
</b>            Two million dollars?

<b>                               ED
</b>            The firm took in sixty.  That's three
            percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.

     She stares at it, speechless.  He goes back to unpacking

<b>                               ED
</b>            Oh, now I suppose you're gonna say it's not
            enough.  Well, tough, Erin.  Too goddamn
            bad.  Cause this is absolutely, positively
            where I draw the line.

<b>                                                  FADE OUT.
</b>
                               <u>THE END</u>
