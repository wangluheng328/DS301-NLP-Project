The film is based on the fate of the brigantine Albatross, which sank May 2, 1961, allegedly because of a white squall.
The film relates the ill-fated school sailing trip led by Dr. Christopher B. Sheldon (Jeff Bridges), whom the boys call "Skipper".
He is tough and teaches them discipline.
He forms a close connection with all-American Chuck Gieg (Scott Wolf), troubled rich kid Frank Beaumont (Jeremy Sisto), shy Gil Martin (Ryan Phillippe) and bad-boy Dean Preston (Eric Michael Cole).
When a white squall threatens their ship, the boys try to use what Skipper has taught them to survive the horrific ordeal.
