In 1984, horror director Wes Craven created "A Nightmare on Elm Street."
It was acclaimed as one of the scariest movies ever made and made unknowns like Robert Englund, Johnny Depp, and Heather Langenkamp huge stars.
Ten years later, Heather is living happily with her husband, Chase, and her son, Dylan.
But her life has now been turned upside down because she is being stalked by a person who sounds like Nightmare villain Freddy Krueger.
Chase has just been killed in a car accident after he accidentally fell asleep behind the wheel.
Dylan refuses to sleep any more, and New Line Cinema has just offered her a part in "the ultimate Nightmare."
But some other strange things have been happening, including earthquakes and Craven being tight-lipped about the script.
The ultimate truth is that Freddy Krueger is actually an ancient demon breaking out into our world, but in order to do that, he must go through Heather.
And he knows he can get out by harming those near her.
