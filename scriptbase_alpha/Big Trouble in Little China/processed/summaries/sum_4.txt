Somewhere in the 80s, trucker Jack Burton arrives in a small town to deliver his cargo and win a few bucks playing cards with the locals down at the Chinese market.
Practically bankrupting nearly all of his opponents, his friend Wang bets him a game of "double or nothing" to try and regain his cash and loses.
Jack wants his well earned money, but Wang explains he doesn't have the cash on him and that'll he pay later because he's due to pick up a long, lost girlfriend from the airport.
Convinced Wang's pulling something sly, Jack insists he drive Wang to the airport so they can stick together.
However, at the airport Wang's girlfriend is captured by the Lords of Death, a streetwise Chinatown gang.
She is essential for an upcoming plan to revive a thousand year old Chinese sorcerer and bring him back to the world as a mortal again.
So begins a daring adventure to rescue Wang's girl and stop the ruthless operation that's going on down in Little China.
Teaming up with a cast of very different individuals, Jack and Wang delve deep into an uncovering conspiracy in which everything's not exactly as it seems.
Here comes big trouble...
