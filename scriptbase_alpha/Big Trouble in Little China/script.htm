<p> For copyright reasons, I can't post the full script, but here's the first <strong>twenty pages</strong> of the screenplay to John Carpenter's: </p>
<p align="center"> BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA </p>
<p align="center"> Screenplay by W.D. Richter </p>
<p align="center"> First Draft - February 27, 1985 <font face="Courier New"></font> </p>
<p> FADE IN: </p>
<p> EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - DAY </p>
<p> ...where it's raining like hell around Eureka, California, one hundred two
  miles south of the Oregon border. </p>
<p> Traveller's advisories are in effect... but there's always one guy ignoring
  them, either because he's gotta be somewhere yesterday or because he's just
  down-and-out reckless, like... </p>
<p> ...the character driving that big FLOATING-CHROME PETERBILT through this
  particular monsoon, powerhousing his cargo of LIVE PIGS right into our face,
  the screen suddenly all title... WHAMMO! </p>
<p align="center"> BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA </p>
<p> INT. PETERBILT TRAILER - DAY </p>
<p> PIGS squealing, bouncing, getting rained on under TITLES. </p>
<p> INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY </p>
<p> A truly unusual person up here running the whole show, yapping into his CB,
  drinking coffee, scarfing down a customized baked-ham sandwich on a monster
  roll. JACK BURTON they call him when they're not calling him more trouble
  than he's worth. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  (chewing his CB)<br/>
  Like I told my last wife, I said, "I<br/>
   never drive faster than I can see."  </p>
<p> Then how come you're doing sixty today, Jack? If they still made outlaws
  in 1985, Jack Burton'd be one. And ladies love outlaws... </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  You just listen to the ol' Pork<br/>
  Chop Express an' take his advice on<br/>
  a dark and stormy night when some<br/>
  wild-eyed eight-foot tall maniac grabs<br/>
  your neck an' taps the back of your<br/>
  favorite head up against a barroom wall.<br/>
  An' he looks you crooked in the eye<br/>
  an' he asks if you've paid your dues.<br/>
  You look rihgt back at that big<br/>
  sucker an' remember what Jack Burton<br/>
  always says at times like that. "Have<br/>
  you paid your dues, Jack"  "No, sir,<br/>
  I've just charged 'em." </p>
<p> EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - DAY </p>
<p> Ghostly headlights glowing, SLAMMING BY CAMERA, Jack's massive ten-wheeler
  kicking up so much WATER the screen turns a hazy wash... and WE DISSOLVE
  THROUGH TO... </p>
<p> INT. PEKING AIRPORT - NIGHT </p>
<p> ... the other side of the world, an environment at once as exotic and mysterious
  as the inside of Jack Burton's truck is familiar. China's flirting with
  capitalism, to be sure, but there's still a heady aroma of a sinister,
  unforgiving Orient around this airport... </p>
<p> ... a lot of harried CHINESE TRAVELLERS in quilted, blue garb, their cardboard
  boxes bound up with twine, doing the job of suitcases, everybody smoking
  these stubby little Chinese cigarettes and getting into long lines for not
  that many flights to very few places. </p>
<p> Thickly-accented, a few English words poke from the babble: </p>
<p align="center"> PUBLIC ADDRESS<br/>
  ...Bombay...San Francisco...London... </p>
<p> This mixed with mostly CHINESE ANNOUNCEMENTS as TITLES LET UP and we discover
  a great looking girl making her way through all the confusion...MIAO YIN.
  Barely twenty, there's such determination in her face and purpose in her
  gait that when a noxious little BUREAUCRAT at Passport Control follows his
  lecherous instincts... </p>
<p align="center"> NOXIOUS BUREAUCRAT<br/>
  You! Here. Passport. </p>
<p> ...we know the guy's bitten off more than he can chew. ALL THE DIALOGUE'S
  CHINESE, but so what? Miao Yin wants to board that flight to America... the
  bureaucrat wants to make a pretty girl squirm. He has her papers and all
  the time in the world. </p>
<p align="center"> PUBLIC ADDRESS<br/>
  Hong Kong...Moscow...San Francisco... </p>
<p> Miao Yin reaches for her passport... and the bureaucrat slaps her hand playfully,
  studies her picture, something fascinating him. Miao Yin's GREEN EYES...
  which he points out to his equally OILY COLLEAGUE... as the PUBLIC ADDRESS
  anounces the imminent departure of China Airlines Flight 2! </p>
<p> Miao Yin just grabs her papers, stamps them, and rushes off for the gate,
  leaving these two Passport Control idiots first startled and then amused
  at their own annoying cleverness. </p>
<p> INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT </p>
<p> MORE TITLES. Jack Burton's at the counter, eating a piece of god-awful lemon
  meringue pie and holding forth to a handful of TRUCKERS come in out of the
  rain. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  You don' need sleep. Hell, sleep's<br/>
  something shoved down our throats when<br/>
  we're kids by the people that think<br/>
  they run the world, parents, teachers,<br/>
  you know, the type that likes to keep<br/>
  us locked up tight in our place. </p>
<p align="center"> TRUCKER<br/>
  Hey, Tommy, you gonna finish them<br/>
  onion rings? </p>
<p> Apparently not because they're passed right through Jackand his nowhere story.
  Undaunted: </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Your movers an' your shakers average<br/>
  four hours a night, tops. So every<br/>
  week these guys are asleep twenty-eight<br/>
  hours less than the rest of us. An'<br/>
  since most people are only <u>awake</u><br/>
  sixteen hours a day, what these hotshots<br/>
  got there's the equivalent of nearly <u>two</u><br/>
  extra days a week. But call it one an' a<br/>
  half, okay, so there's no nit-pickin'.<br/>
  <br/>
  TRUCKER<br/>
  Where in hell's the ketchup at? </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Now multiply that one point five<br/>
  by fifty-two weeks per year and<br/>
  what is it...<br/>
  (does the math)<br/>
  ...five times two times carry the<br/>
  decimal...is what, <u>sixty-eight days</u>,<br/>
  I think. Or two entire extra months<br/>
  a year! Which if you live to be<br/>
  only fifty is one hundred extra<br/>
  months to the good or something<br/>
  like <u>eight</u> extra years jammed onto <br/>
  your life! </p>
<p> A moment of silence while everybody ponders the astounding implications. </p>
<p> INT. CHINA AIRLINES FLIGHT 2 - DAY </p>
<p> Human sardines, a plane-load of CHINESE TRAVELLERS, most of them emigrants,
  smoking and eating their way westward. </p>
<p> Miao Yin crammed between a BUDDHIST MONK and a RED ARMY SOLDIER, her attention
  fixed downward at a small, ragged PHOTO OF A YOUNG CHINESE MAN. We'll be
  meeting him soon enough. </p>
<p> <br/>
  EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT </p>
<p> <br/>
  FOG AND RAIN. Jack Burton's pig-filled Peterbilt barreling into San Francisco
  in the quiet hours after midnight. </p>
<p> INT. PETERBILT - NIGHT </p>
<p> <br/>
  THE RADIO ON, some lunatic talk-show holding Jack's interest. </p>
<p align="center"> RADIO CALLER<br/>
  The point I'm makin', Ray, is way <br/>
  back in 1852 what we did was we<br/>
  <u>welcomed</u> all them crazy Chinamen<br/>
  into Frisco with open arms. </p>
<p align="center"> RADIO HOST<br/>
  As I imagine this country did to<br/>
  <u>your</u> great grandparents fifty<br/>
  years earlier... </p>
<p align="center"> RADIO CALLER<br/>
  Well, that is not the point I'm<br/>
  makin', Ray. I'm sayin' the Gold<br/>
  Rush is over. So why in hell they<br/>
  still comin'? With their opium<br/>
  dens and their... </p>
<p align="center"> RADIO HOST<br/>
  What is your point, pinhead? This<br/>
  is 1986 not 1852. </p>
<p align="center"> RADIO CALLER<br/>
  My point is the same point The<br/>
  Workingmen's Party of California<br/>
  been makin' for one hundred years!<br/>
  "The Chinese Must Go!" </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Can't stand the fire, get your ass outta the kitchen. </p>
<p> EXT. WHOLESALE MARKET - NIGHT </p>
<p> TITLES CONCLUDING over this wonderfully colorful, bustling link in the city's
  food chain... RAIN making it all the more fascinating, fruits and vegetables,
  poultry, pushcarts and pickups glistening under the lights... </p>
<p> <br/>
  ...ITALIANS buying from BLACKS and CHINESE MERCHANTS mixing with CHIC
  RESTAURANTEURS, making deals as fast as they can, counting money, guzzling
  coffee, backslapping, bullshitting, and gambling under cardboard and canvas
  canopies as...<br/>
              <br/>
  ...here he comes with his pigs, Jack Burton rolling into the thick of it
  all... </p>
<p> INT. PETERBILT - NIGHT<br/>
    <br/>
  Jack's view of this mad house. His kind of world... a carnival with rules
  made to bend.<br/>
              <br/>
  EXT. WHOLESALE MARKET - NIGHT </p>
<p> Jack off-loading the little swines into the waiting arms of a FEW PACKING
  HOUSE BUYERS, their trucks backed up to Jack... </p>
<p> <br/>
  ... SEVERAL CHINESE dickering for a choice pig here and there, Jack cutting
  deals on the side, pocketing cash... accepting business checks and signing
  invoices... all of this seeming to us slightly illicit and exciting, Jack
  a wheeling dealing, rougish figure in this night world. </p>
<p> <br/>
  NOT MUCH LATER... Jack on foot, moving through the crowd, nodding to FRIENDS,
  stealing an orange, biting right into the damn thing and spitting out the
  skin to get at the flesh... </p>
<p> Jack sitting with a BUNCH OF CHINESE, one of the gang, gambling for stacks
  of hills at a contest called <u>fan-tan</u>, a kind of Chinese shell game
  where each guy grabs a handful of beans from a pot, takes away four beans,
  everyone betting on whether the remaining beans in everyone else's pile is
  an odd or even quantity. Or something like that. The point being this is
  all second nature to Jack, and he's taking these Chinese to the laundry... </p>
<p> <br/>
  ...one fella in particular catching our attention, a hand-some young Chinese
  we've seen before... in that photo in Miao Yin's hands. WANG CHI. He's got
  some style: a fedora hat, a baseball jacket, a red shirt and a narrow black
  leather tie. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  (of Wang Chi's pile)<br/>
  Odd. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  (of Jack's pile)<br/>
  Odd. </p>
<p> Both men count. Jack's right. Wang Chi's wrong. More money for Jack. </p>
<p> <br/>
  EXT. FRENCH CHARTER TERMINAL - NIGHT<br/>
  <br/>
  The outback of a large Parisian airport. PASSENGERS from that Chinese airliner
  crossing the tarmac, clearing an open-air Customs, boarding an Air France
  charter flight... the whole operation eerie and lonely... </p>
<p> Miao Yin. This girl's a survivor, lugging her cardboard box of belongings
  like a commando off to war. </p>
<p align="center"> FRENCH AUTHORITY<br/>
    <u>Arretez-vous ici, s'il vous plait.</u> </p>
<p> Said to an OLD CHINESE who doesn't understand... </p>
<p align="center"> FRENCH AUTHORITY<br/>
  Non, non! Here. Stop! Wait! Arretez-vous ici! </p>
<p> Miao Yin sticks her nose in, explains to the oldster in Chinese what the
  Frenchman's saying. </p>
<p align="center"> FRENCH AUTHORITY<br/>
  Merci! </p>
<p align="center"> MIAO YIN<br/>
  Don't mention it. </p>
<p> EXT. WHOLESALE MARKET - DAWN </p>
<p> Those first tracings of daylight in the sky. The rain over, the market thinning
  out... </p>
<p> ... but Jack Burton and his Chinese friends are still at it, fan-tan having
  long since given way to a spirited game of <u>pai</u> <u>gow</u>, fueled
  by bottles of Chinese beer and steamed dumplings. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  What'd he say? What'd he say? Gimme it in English. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Something about beginner's luck. <br/>
  It doesn't translate, but he quits. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  He quits? Why? It's a brand-new <br/>
  day an' the man's still got a hundred <br/>
  bucks... </p>
<p> <br/>
  Not only does the guy quit, but the dominoes they're playing with are his
  and with him they go. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Hey, suit yourselves, fellas. I'm <br/>
  not gonna complain cause I bet in the next <br/>
  twenty minutes, I'da lost my shirt. </p>
<p> Yeah, right. Jack's packing up his winnings, stuffing money into his pockets
  ... Wang Chi emptying a bottle of beer, eyeing Jack who, as usual, can't
  shut up... </p>
<p align="center">  JACK BURTON </p>
<p align="center"> Breaks my heart to do this, guys, <br/>
  but I figure next time I'm down<br/>
  here you'll gang up on poor ol'<br/>
  Jack so fast he won't know what<br/>
  the hell... </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  No. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Ah, sure, easy come, easy go, Wang. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  No. Not next time. Now. </p>
<p> Jack looks up and across at Wang Chi who's suddenly got in his right hand
  the biggest, sharpest PRODUCE KNIFE you ever saw...in his left that empty
  beer bottle. </p>
<p> THE OTHER CHINESE, from Jack's point of view, backing off just a bit here. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Is this gonna get ugly? I hope not<br/>
  cause I thought what we were, racial<br/>
  differences notwithstandin', was all<br/>
  friends here, all Californians. </p>
<p> Wang Chi slams the beer bottle onto their ratty little table, makes those <u>pai gow </u>dominoes jump! </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Ah shit, Wang, it's only a game. </p>
<p> Said while Jack slips his own hand below the table, unzips the ankle seam
  of his canvas pants ... revealing a Gerber Mark II SURVIVAL KNIFE laced to
  his calf with leather thongs. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI </p>
<p align="center"> Nothing or double. </p>
<p> Jack looks at him. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Nothing or double what, you <br/>
  inscrutable son of a bitch? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  This knife... chops this bottle <br/>
  in half. Nothing or double. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Bullshit. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<i> </i><br/>
  Nothing or double, Jack. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Why, man? Don' be stupid. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  I need the money. </p>
<p> There is something kind of desperate about Wang Chi. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Double? I got near a thousand <br/>
  dollars in my pocket. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  One thousand, one hundred forty-eight. </p>
<p> This Wang Chi knows the score. Jack thinks. The whole notion is getting a
  big grip on his brain. But a cautious man he can still be... </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Tell you what ... not-that bottle. <br/>
  This bottle. </p>
<p> Jack empties his <u>own</u> beer. Just in case Wang's got a trick bottle
  up his sleeve here. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Okay. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  You're outta your mind, Wang, but <br/>
  God bless you. </p>
<p> Jack steps back a pace. Wang Chi sets himself in the chair, moves that big
  blade against the beer bottle, taking its measure ... </p>
<p> ...all the Chinese step back. </p>
<p> Wang Chi swings! WHAMMO! The bottle flies off the table like a rocket! Right
  at Jack! His arm comes up in a reflexive blur ... and he catches the damn
  thing in his fist! A great save! The bottle unbroken. And even Jack's amazed
  he's not picking glass out of his teeth. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  You idiot. </p>
<p> Wang Chi looks at his big knife, mystified. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  It always works at home. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Yeah, well, have me over for dinner some <br/>
  year an' prove it. Meantime, pay up. <br/>
  One thousand one hundred and <br/>
  forty-eight bucks. Times two. </p>
<p> Jack puts his bottle back on the table in front of Wang Chi, towers over
  the poor Chinese ... </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  I don't have that kind of money, Jack. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  I didn't hear that, Wang. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  I'm just a poor Chinese. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Wang, you own a restaurant. <br/>
  That's more than me. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Oh, yeah, right. I meant I don't<br/>
  have that kind of money on me. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  That’s what I thought you meant.<br/>
  Where’s your truck parked? </p>
<p align="center"> EXT. MARKET LOT - MORNING </p>
<p align="center"> Jack Burton and Wang Chi walking across the mud. Jack's Peterbilt the biggest
  vehicle left around... parked not that far from a beat-up van that says,
  in predictable chop suey script, DRAGON OF THE BLACK POOL RESTAURANT... </p>
<p align="center"> . . .as a matter of fact, the same lettering's sewn onto the back of Wang
  Chi's jacket. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Jack, first I have to go some where, Jack. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON <br/>
  Oh, yeah? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Yeah. So why don't I meet you at the restaurant<br/>
  in a few hours, You know? </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Boy, I can think of a thousand reasons. <br/>
  Where you gotta go? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  The airport. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  I can think of a thousand and one reasons.<br/>
  I'll follow you. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  You don't trust me, Jack. That makes me sad.<br/>
  It reminds me of an old Chinese joke. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Save it. I'll give you a lift. Get in the truck. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  You were going to follow me, Jack. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  I know, then I came to my senses. </p>
<p align="left"> It's getting foggy out again. </p>
<p align="left"> INT. PETERBILT - DAY </p>
<p align="left"> Jack and Wang Chi cruising along, the Oriental appearing increasingly nervous
  as the seconds tick by... and the fog gets thicker. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  So who we pickin' up? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  A girl. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  A girl? Where from, L.A.? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Peking. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  What...in China? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  This is a big day in my life. I should have <br/>
  gone home and gotten forty winks.<br/>
  (pause)<br/>
  The fog is too thick to land. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  A girl from China. I never done that. <br/>
  I picked up girls from everywhere else, <br/>
  but not from China. Is she pretty? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  I'm going to marry her. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Are you kidding? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  I've known her since we were fifteen. <br/>
  I haven't seen her for five years, Jack. <br/>
  I came here, I made something of myself, <br/>
  and I sent for her. Now she's coming. <br/>
  She's gonna put my life in order. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  You look nervous, pal. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  That's why the bottle didn't slice. <br/>
  My mind and my spirit are going north and south. </p>
<p align="left"> As usual, Jack understands only about half the guy says. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Whatever. </p>
<p align="left"> INT. SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL - DAY </p>
<p align="left"> A charter terminal. Jack Burton following Wang Chi inside, the little Chinese
  walking on his toes, alert, looking for some Arrival information... </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  She's on schedule. That's just like her.<br/>
  She's very pulled together. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON <br/>
  She's a pilot? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  No. An accountant. She's gonna put my <br/>
  books in order too. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  First thing she does then is she <br/>
  subtracts one thousand, one hundred and <br/>
  forty-eight bucks times two... </p>

<p align="left"> . . . a girl.. . a white AMERICAN GIRL, moving through the crowd, catching
  Jack's roving eye because not only is she tall, she's sexy.. . in a wholesome,
  no-nonsense way. </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  She has green eyes. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  (watching the American girl) <br/>
  How can you tell from here? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Miao Yin. Beautiful green eyes like creamy jade. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON <br/>
  Miao Yin...? </p>
<p align="left"> The American girl is gone, swallowed up in the crowd pressing forward toward

  boots. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON <br/>
  Wang...check out those three... </p>
<p align="left"> Wang Chi sees them, shakes his head. </p>

<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Punks. From Hong Kong. </p>
<p align="left"> Jack's eyes follow the Lords of Death over to...the American girl. They shove
  past her, making a rude point of it. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  What the hell're they doin' here? </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Hey, they got relatives too, you know, <br/>

<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  Good morning. </p>
<p align="left"> The American girl surprised to hear English, turning to look Jack's
  way...catching his wink...but too smart to give a stranger the time of day.
  Plus she's got too much on her mind, looking at several small SNAPSHOTS..
  . matching one up to a young CHINESE GIRL just emerging from Customs... </p>
<p align="center"> AMERICAN GIRL<br/>
  Tara! </p>
<p align="left"> Hearing her name, the Chinese girl and the Lords of Death close in at the
  American girl's faster, rushing forward, grabbing this Tara's hand, one of
  the Lords (call him NEEDLES) upon her a second later, trying to yank Tara
  away! </p>
<p align="left"> CHINESE back off...SKY CAPS look the other way... </p>
<p align="left"> . . . and Jack sees all this...just as Wang Chi makes eye contact with his

  Miao Yin! </p>
<p align="left"> . . . and WHAMMO! Jack makes his move! Understanding only that two pretty

  Wang Chi in the churning, panicked crowd! </p>
<p align="left"> Miao Yin grabbed! Needles has her, and Wang Chi sees it from five yards away,
  a dozen people between him and his bride-to-be! </p>
<p align="left"> Jack nails Joe Lucky with a right hook, takes One Ear's savage boot heel
  square in the back! </p>

  What, you mean a clubhouse? </p>

<p align="left"> None of the public, touristy hustle and bustle back here. In fact, it's suddenly

<p align="left"> INT. PETERBILT - DAY </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>
  What's goin' on, Wang? Why'd they steal <br/>

<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  I have no idea. They're crazy, <br/>
  these gangs. They're hoodlums. </p>
<p align="center"> JACK BURTON<br/>

<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>
  Miao Yin. I must find her, Jack, before they... </p>
<p align="left"> SLAM! Jack hits the brakes! There's a BAREFOOT FIGURE standing right in front

  in a RED TURBAN and a voluminous black suit. </p>

<p align="left"> Having come from an intersecting alleyway, this red-turbaned OLD MAN moves

<p align="left"> INT. PETERBILT - DAY </p>
<p align="center"> WANG CHI<br/>

<p>The rest of the screenplay includes:</p>
<p> - The missing Storm lines<br/>
  - The missing Miao Yin scenes and lines<br/>
  - Extra Jack Burton monologues<br/>
  - An even less serious tone than the existing film<br/>
  - Explanations regarding the conflicts between the Bing Kong (Wing Kong)
  and Suey Sings (Blue Turbans)<br/>
  - A different and less satisfying ending</p><p> </p>
