 For copyright reasons, I can't post the full script, but here's the first twenty pages of the screenplay to John Carpenter's: 
 BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA 
 Screenplay by W.D. Richter 
 First Draft - February 27, 1985  
 FADE IN: 
 EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - DAY 
 ...where it's raining like hell around Eureka, California, one hundred two
  miles south of the Oregon border. 
 Traveller's advisories are in effect... but there's always one guy ignoring
  them, either because he's gotta be somewhere yesterday or because he's just
  down-and-out reckless, like... 
 ...the character driving that big FLOATING-CHROME PETERBILT through this
  particular monsoon, powerhousing his cargo of LIVE PIGS right into our face,
  the screen suddenly all title... WHAMMO! 
 BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA 
 INT. PETERBILT TRAILER - DAY 
 PIGS squealing, bouncing, getting rained on under TITLES. 
 INT. PETERBILT CAB - DAY 
 A truly unusual person up here running the whole show, yapping into his CB,
  drinking coffee, scarfing down a customized baked-ham sandwich on a monster
  roll. JACK BURTON they call him when they're not calling him more trouble
  than he's worth. 
 JACK BURTON
  (chewing his CB)
  Like I told my last wife, I said, "I
   never drive faster than I can see."  
 Then how come you're doing sixty today, Jack? If they still made outlaws
  in 1985, Jack Burton'd be one. And ladies love outlaws... 
 JACK BURTON
  You just listen to the ol' Pork
  Chop Express an' take his advice on
  a dark and stormy night when some
  wild-eyed eight-foot tall maniac grabs
  your neck an' taps the back of your
  favorite head up against a barroom wall.
  An' he looks you crooked in the eye
  an' he asks if you've paid your dues.
  You look rihgt back at that big
  sucker an' remember what Jack Burton
  always says at times like that. "Have
  you paid your dues, Jack"  "No, sir,
  I've just charged 'em." 
 EXT. HIGHWAY 101 - DAY 
 Ghostly headlights glowing, SLAMMING BY CAMERA, Jack's massive ten-wheeler
  kicking up so much WATER the screen turns a hazy wash... and WE DISSOLVE
  THROUGH TO... 
 INT. PEKING AIRPORT - NIGHT 
 ... the other side of the world, an environment at once as exotic and mysterious
  as the inside of Jack Burton's truck is familiar. China's flirting with
  capitalism, to be sure, but there's still a heady aroma of a sinister,
  unforgiving Orient around this airport... 
 ... a lot of harried CHINESE TRAVELLERS in quilted, blue garb, their cardboard
  boxes bound up with twine, doing the job of suitcases, everybody smoking
  these stubby little Chinese cigarettes and getting into long lines for not
  that many flights to very few places. 
 Thickly-accented, a few English words poke from the babble: 
 PUBLIC ADDRESS
  ...Bombay...San Francisco...London... 
 This mixed with mostly CHINESE ANNOUNCEMENTS as TITLES LET UP and we discover
  a great looking girl making her way through all the confusion...MIAO YIN.
  Barely twenty, there's such determination in her face and purpose in her
  gait that when a noxious little BUREAUCRAT at Passport Control follows his
  lecherous instincts... 
 NOXIOUS BUREAUCRAT
  You! Here. Passport. 
 ...we know the guy's bitten off more than he can chew. ALL THE DIALOGUE'S
  CHINESE, but so what? Miao Yin wants to board that flight to America... the
  bureaucrat wants to make a pretty girl squirm. He has her papers and all
  the time in the world. 
 PUBLIC ADDRESS
  Hong Kong...Moscow...San Francisco... 
 Miao Yin reaches for her passport... and the bureaucrat slaps her hand playfully,
  studies her picture, something fascinating him. Miao Yin's GREEN EYES...
  which he points out to his equally OILY COLLEAGUE... as the PUBLIC ADDRESS
  anounces the imminent departure of China Airlines Flight 2! 
 Miao Yin just grabs her papers, stamps them, and rushes off for the gate,
  leaving these two Passport Control idiots first startled and then amused
  at their own annoying cleverness. 
 INT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT 
 MORE TITLES. Jack Burton's at the counter, eating a piece of god-awful lemon
  meringue pie and holding forth to a handful of TRUCKERS come in out of the
  rain. 
 JACK BURTON
  You don' need sleep. Hell, sleep's
  something shoved down our throats when
  we're kids by the people that think
  they run the world, parents, teachers,
  you know, the type that likes to keep
  us locked up tight in our place. 
 TRUCKER
  Hey, Tommy, you gonna finish them
  onion rings? 
 Apparently not because they're passed right through Jackand his nowhere story.
  Undaunted: 
 JACK BURTON
  Your movers an' your shakers average
  four hours a night, tops. So every
  week these guys are asleep twenty-eight
  hours less than the rest of us. An'
  since most people are only awake
  sixteen hours a day, what these hotshots
  got there's the equivalent of nearly two
  extra days a week. But call it one an' a
  half, okay, so there's no nit-pickin'.
  
  TRUCKER
  Where in hell's the ketchup at? 
 JACK BURTON
  Now multiply that one point five
  by fifty-two weeks per year and
  what is it...
  (does the math)
  ...five times two times carry the
  decimal...is what, sixty-eight days,
  I think. Or two entire extra months
  a year! Which if you live to be
  only fifty is one hundred extra
  months to the good or something
  like eight extra years jammed onto 
  your life! 
 A moment of silence while everybody ponders the astounding implications. 
 INT. CHINA AIRLINES FLIGHT 2 - DAY 
 Human sardines, a plane-load of CHINESE TRAVELLERS, most of them emigrants,
  smoking and eating their way westward. 
 Miao Yin crammed between a BUDDHIST MONK and a RED ARMY SOLDIER, her attention
  fixed downward at a small, ragged PHOTO OF A YOUNG CHINESE MAN. We'll be
  meeting him soon enough. 
 
  EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - NIGHT 
 
  FOG AND RAIN. Jack Burton's pig-filled Peterbilt barreling into San Francisco
  in the quiet hours after midnight. 
 INT. PETERBILT - NIGHT 
 
  THE RADIO ON, some lunatic talk-show holding Jack's interest. 
 RADIO CALLER
  The point I'm makin', Ray, is way 
  back in 1852 what we did was we
  welcomed all them crazy Chinamen
  into Frisco with open arms. 
 RADIO HOST
  As I imagine this country did to
  your great grandparents fifty
  years earlier... 
 RADIO CALLER
  Well, that is not the point I'm
  makin', Ray. I'm sayin' the Gold
  Rush is over. So why in hell they
  still comin'? With their opium
  dens and their... 
 RADIO HOST
  What is your point, pinhead? This
  is 1986 not 1852. 
 RADIO CALLER
  My point is the same point The
  Workingmen's Party of California
  been makin' for one hundred years!
  "The Chinese Must Go!" 
 JACK BURTON
  Can't stand the fire, get your ass outta the kitchen. 
 EXT. WHOLESALE MARKET - NIGHT 
 TITLES CONCLUDING over this wonderfully colorful, bustling link in the city's
  food chain... RAIN making it all the more fascinating, fruits and vegetables,
  poultry, pushcarts and pickups glistening under the lights... 
 
  ...ITALIANS buying from BLACKS and CHINESE MERCHANTS mixing with CHIC
  RESTAURANTEURS, making deals as fast as they can, counting money, guzzling
  coffee, backslapping, bullshitting, and gambling under cardboard and canvas
  canopies as...
              
  ...here he comes with his pigs, Jack Burton rolling into the thick of it
  all... 
 INT. PETERBILT - NIGHT
    
  Jack's view of this mad house. His kind of world... a carnival with rules
  made to bend.
              
  EXT. WHOLESALE MARKET - NIGHT 
 Jack off-loading the little swines into the waiting arms of a FEW PACKING
  HOUSE BUYERS, their trucks backed up to Jack... 
 
  ... SEVERAL CHINESE dickering for a choice pig here and there, Jack cutting
  deals on the side, pocketing cash... accepting business checks and signing
  invoices... all of this seeming to us slightly illicit and exciting, Jack
  a wheeling dealing, rougish figure in this night world. 
 
  NOT MUCH LATER... Jack on foot, moving through the crowd, nodding to FRIENDS,
  stealing an orange, biting right into the damn thing and spitting out the
  skin to get at the flesh... 
 Jack sitting with a BUNCH OF CHINESE, one of the gang, gambling for stacks
  of hills at a contest called fan-tan, a kind of Chinese shell game
  where each guy grabs a handful of beans from a pot, takes away four beans,
  everyone betting on whether the remaining beans in everyone else's pile is
  an odd or even quantity. Or something like that. The point being this is
  all second nature to Jack, and he's taking these Chinese to the laundry... 
 
  ...one fella in particular catching our attention, a hand-some young Chinese
  we've seen before... in that photo in Miao Yin's hands. WANG CHI. He's got
  some style: a fedora hat, a baseball jacket, a red shirt and a narrow black
  leather tie. 
 JACK BURTON
  (of Wang Chi's pile)
  Odd. 
 WANG CHI
  (of Jack's pile)
  Odd. 
 Both men count. Jack's right. Wang Chi's wrong. More money for Jack. 
 
  EXT. FRENCH CHARTER TERMINAL - NIGHT
  
  The outback of a large Parisian airport. PASSENGERS from that Chinese airliner
  crossing the tarmac, clearing an open-air Customs, boarding an Air France
  charter flight... the whole operation eerie and lonely... 
 Miao Yin. This girl's a survivor, lugging her cardboard box of belongings
  like a commando off to war. 
 FRENCH AUTHORITY
    Arretez-vous ici, s'il vous plait. 
 Said to an OLD CHINESE who doesn't understand... 
 FRENCH AUTHORITY
  Non, non! Here. Stop! Wait! Arretez-vous ici! 
 Miao Yin sticks her nose in, explains to the oldster in Chinese what the
  Frenchman's saying. 
 FRENCH AUTHORITY
  Merci! 
 MIAO YIN
  Don't mention it. 
 EXT. WHOLESALE MARKET - DAWN 
 Those first tracings of daylight in the sky. The rain over, the market thinning
  out... 
 ... but Jack Burton and his Chinese friends are still at it, fan-tan having
  long since given way to a spirited game of pai gow, fueled
  by bottles of Chinese beer and steamed dumplings. 
 JACK BURTON
  What'd he say? What'd he say? Gimme it in English. 
 WANG CHI
  Something about beginner's luck. 
  It doesn't translate, but he quits. 
 JACK BURTON
  He quits? Why? It's a brand-new 
  day an' the man's still got a hundred 
  bucks... 
 
  Not only does the guy quit, but the dominoes they're playing with are his
  and with him they go. 
 JACK BURTON
  Hey, suit yourselves, fellas. I'm 
  not gonna complain cause I bet in the next 
  twenty minutes, I'da lost my shirt. 
 Yeah, right. Jack's packing up his winnings, stuffing money into his pockets
  ... Wang Chi emptying a bottle of beer, eyeing Jack who, as usual, can't
  shut up... 
  JACK BURTON 
 Breaks my heart to do this, guys, 
  but I figure next time I'm down
  here you'll gang up on poor ol'
  Jack so fast he won't know what
  the hell... 
 WANG CHI
  No. 
 JACK BURTON
  Ah, sure, easy come, easy go, Wang. 
 WANG CHI
  No. Not next time. Now. 
 Jack looks up and across at Wang Chi who's suddenly got in his right hand
  the biggest, sharpest PRODUCE KNIFE you ever saw...in his left that empty
  beer bottle. 
 THE OTHER CHINESE, from Jack's point of view, backing off just a bit here. 
 JACK BURTON
  Is this gonna get ugly? I hope not
  cause I thought what we were, racial
  differences notwithstandin', was all
  friends here, all Californians. 
 Wang Chi slams the beer bottle onto their ratty little table, makes those pai gow dominoes jump! 
 JACK BURTON
  Ah shit, Wang, it's only a game. 
 Said while Jack slips his own hand below the table, unzips the ankle seam
  of his canvas pants ... revealing a Gerber Mark II SURVIVAL KNIFE laced to
  his calf with leather thongs. 
 WANG CHI 
 Nothing or double. 
 Jack looks at him. 
 JACK BURTON
  Nothing or double what, you 
  inscrutable son of a bitch? 
 WANG CHI
  This knife... chops this bottle 
  in half. Nothing or double. 
 JACK BURTON
  Bullshit. 
 WANG CHI 
  Nothing or double, Jack. 
 JACK BURTON
  Why, man? Don' be stupid. 
 WANG CHI
  I need the money. 
 There is something kind of desperate about Wang Chi. 
 JACK BURTON
  Double? I got near a thousand 
  dollars in my pocket. 
 WANG CHI
  One thousand, one hundred forty-eight. 
 This Wang Chi knows the score. Jack thinks. The whole notion is getting a
  big grip on his brain. But a cautious man he can still be... 
 JACK BURTON
  Tell you what ... not-that bottle. 
  This bottle. 
 Jack empties his own beer. Just in case Wang's got a trick bottle
  up his sleeve here. 
 WANG CHI
  Okay. 
 JACK BURTON
  You're outta your mind, Wang, but 
  God bless you. 
 Jack steps back a pace. Wang Chi sets himself in the chair, moves that big
  blade against the beer bottle, taking its measure ... 
 ...all the Chinese step back. 
 Wang Chi swings! WHAMMO! The bottle flies off the table like a rocket! Right
  at Jack! His arm comes up in a reflexive blur ... and he catches the damn
  thing in his fist! A great save! The bottle unbroken. And even Jack's amazed
  he's not picking glass out of his teeth. 
 JACK BURTON
  You idiot. 
 Wang Chi looks at his big knife, mystified. 
 WANG CHI
  It always works at home. 
 JACK BURTON
  Yeah, well, have me over for dinner some 
  year an' prove it. Meantime, pay up. 
  One thousand one hundred and 
  forty-eight bucks. Times two. 
 Jack puts his bottle back on the table in front of Wang Chi, towers over
  the poor Chinese ... 
 WANG CHI
  I don't have that kind of money, Jack. 
 JACK BURTON
  I didn't hear that, Wang. 
 WANG CHI
  I'm just a poor Chinese. 
 JACK BURTON
  Wang, you own a restaurant. 
  That's more than me. 
 WANG CHI
  Oh, yeah, right. I meant I don't
  have that kind of money on me. 
 JACK BURTON
  That’s what I thought you meant.
  Where’s your truck parked? 
 EXT. MARKET LOT - MORNING 
 Jack Burton and Wang Chi walking across the mud. Jack's Peterbilt the biggest
  vehicle left around... parked not that far from a beat-up van that says,
  in predictable chop suey script, DRAGON OF THE BLACK POOL RESTAURANT... 
 . . .as a matter of fact, the same lettering's sewn onto the back of Wang
  Chi's jacket. 
 WANG CHI
  Jack, first I have to go some where, Jack. 
 JACK BURTON 
  Oh, yeah? 
 WANG CHI
  Yeah. So why don't I meet you at the restaurant
  in a few hours, You know? 
 JACK BURTON
  Boy, I can think of a thousand reasons. 
  Where you gotta go? 
 WANG CHI
  The airport. 
 JACK BURTON
  I can think of a thousand and one reasons.
  I'll follow you. 
 WANG CHI
  You don't trust me, Jack. That makes me sad.
  It reminds me of an old Chinese joke. 
 JACK BURTON
  Save it. I'll give you a lift. Get in the truck. 
 WANG CHI
  You were going to follow me, Jack. 
 JACK BURTON
  I know, then I came to my senses. 
 It's getting foggy out again. 
 INT. PETERBILT - DAY 
 Jack and Wang Chi cruising along, the Oriental appearing increasingly nervous
  as the seconds tick by... and the fog gets thicker. 
 JACK BURTON
  So who we pickin' up? 
 WANG CHI
  A girl. 
 JACK BURTON
  A girl? Where from, L.A.? 
 WANG CHI
  Peking. 
 JACK BURTON
  What...in China? 
 WANG CHI
  This is a big day in my life. I should have 
  gone home and gotten forty winks.
  (pause)
  The fog is too thick to land. 
 JACK BURTON
  A girl from China. I never done that. 
  I picked up girls from everywhere else, 
  but not from China. Is she pretty? 
 WANG CHI
  I'm going to marry her. 
 JACK BURTON
  Are you kidding? 
 WANG CHI
  I've known her since we were fifteen. 
  I haven't seen her for five years, Jack. 
  I came here, I made something of myself, 
  and I sent for her. Now she's coming. 
  She's gonna put my life in order. 
 JACK BURTON
  You look nervous, pal. 
 WANG CHI
  That's why the bottle didn't slice. 
  My mind and my spirit are going north and south. 
 As usual, Jack understands only about half the guy says. 
 JACK BURTON
  Whatever. 
 INT. SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL - DAY 
 A charter terminal. Jack Burton following Wang Chi inside, the little Chinese
  walking on his toes, alert, looking for some Arrival information... 
 WANG CHI
  She's on schedule. That's just like her.
  She's very pulled together. 
 JACK BURTON 
  She's a pilot? 
 WANG CHI
  No. An accountant. She's gonna put my 
  books in order too. 
 JACK BURTON
  First thing she does then is she 
  subtracts one thousand, one hundred and 
  forty-eight bucks times two... 
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL - DAY 
 The Air France charter carrying Miao Yin taxis into its berth...through fog
  so dense you can chew it. 
 INT. TERMINAL - DAY 
 Jack and Wang Chi standing in a CROWD OF ORIENTAL FRIENDS AND RELATIVES here
  to meet the big plane, Jack the tallest human being for miles around. . .no,
  wait... 
 . . . a girl.. . a white AMERICAN GIRL, moving through the crowd, catching
  Jack's roving eye because not only is she tall, she's sexy.. . in a wholesome,
  no-nonsense way. 
 WANG CHI
  She has green eyes. 
 JACK BURTON
  (watching the American girl) 
  How can you tell from here? 
 WANG CHI
  Miao Yin. Beautiful green eyes like creamy jade. 
 JACK BURTON 
  Miao Yin...? 
 The American girl is gone, swallowed up in the crowd pressing forward toward
  the greeting area.. .an expanse of open floor terminating in wired glass
  doors marked "U.S.CUSTOMS--ARRIVING PASSENGERS-NO ADMITTANCE." 
 INT. U.S. CUSTOMS - DAY 
 Miao Yin in the congestion around Baggage Claim, locating her cardboard box. 
 INT. TERMINAL - DAY 
 Jack standing with an anxious Wang Chi, using his height to search the crowd
  for that sexy, illusive American girl... spotting instead THREE SHADY CHINESE
  KIDS with Fu Manchu beards, ski vests, jeans, and heavy-duty black engineer
  boots. 
 JACK BURTON 
  Wang...check out those three... 
 Wang Chi sees them, shakes his head. 
 WANG CHI
  Lords of Death. 
 JACK BURTON
  Street gang...? 
 WANG CHI
  Punks. From Hong Kong. 
 Jack's eyes follow the Lords of Death over to...the American girl. They shove
  past her, making a rude point of it. 
 JACK BURTON
  What the hell're they doin' here? 
 WANG CHI
  Hey, they got relatives too, you know, 
  people to meet, places to go. They're 
  assholes, Jack. 
 INT. U.S. CUSTOMS - DAY 
 Maio Yin... 
 MIAO YIN
  Good morning. 
 U.S. CUSTOMS
  Good morning. Your first visit here? 
 MIAO YIN
  Yes. 
 U.S. CUSTOMS
  You speak English? 
 MIAO YIN
  Some, yes. 
 U.S. CUSTOMS
  Welcome to San Francisco. 
 A MOMENT LATER...MIAO YIN pushing forward toward her side of those wired-glass
  doors.. .passengers already going through.. 
 INT. TERMINAL - DAY 
 Wang Chi pushing forward toward his side of the doors, through friends and
  relatives reuniting.. . Jack on his heels, getting closer to the American
  girl...and the Lords of Death... 
 JACK BURTON
  Good morning. 
 The American girl surprised to hear English, turning to look Jack's
  way...catching his wink...but too smart to give a stranger the time of day.
  Plus she's got too much on her mind, looking at several small SNAPSHOTS..
  . matching one up to a young CHINESE GIRL just emerging from Customs... 
 AMERICAN GIRL
  Tara! 
 Hearing her name, the Chinese girl and the Lords of Death close in at the
  American girl's faster, rushing forward, grabbing this Tara's hand, one of
  the Lords (call him NEEDLES) upon her a second later, trying to yank Tara
  away! 
 CHINESE back off...SKY CAPS look the other way... 
 . . . and Jack sees all this...just as Wang Chi makes eye contact with his
  beloved Miao Yin coming through that wired door... 
 WANG CHI
  Miao Yin! 
 . . . and WHAMMO! Jack makes his move! Understanding only that two pretty
  girls are outnumbered by three undesirable thugs! Needles finds himself spun
  away by the tall American! His pals, JOE LUCKY and ONE EAR, pounce on Jack's
  head! 
 Miao Yin moving tbward Wang Chi moving toward Miao Yin... 
 ...the American girl seizing upon the uproar to grab Tara and spirit her
  off... 
 ...as Needles, picking himself up, sees his buddies trading punches with
  Jack Burton...sees Tara vanish.. .sees Miao Yin... closer to him than to
  Wang Chi in the churning, panicked crowd! 
 Miao Yin grabbed! Needles has her, and Wang Chi sees it from five yards away,
  a dozen people between him and his bride-to-be! 
 Jack nails Joe Lucky with a right hook, takes One Ear's savage boot heel
  square in the back! 
 Wang Chi, practically climbing over people, Miao Yin dragged away kicking
  and screaming by the Lords of Death! 
 WANG CHI
  Jack! Come on, Jack! 
 JACK BURTON
  Where?! What?! 
 EXT. AIRPORT PARKING - DAY 
 Lords of Death on the run, One Ear pausing to muzzle Miao Yin's complaints
  with a round-house right, Needles catching the unconscious girl, heaving
  her over his shoulder like a rice sack... 
 ANGLE ON Wang Chi and Jack Burton exploding out of the terminal! Which way
  did the bastards go!? 
 JACK BURTON
  There! 
 ANGLE ON a brand-new PONTIAC FIREBIRD... the Lords of Death and their getaway
  car.. .into the trunk with Miao Yin! 
 Jack and Wang Chi running like maniacs past bewildered 
 BYSTANDERS... 
 JACK BURTON
  Call the cops! 
 The Firebird starting up with a violent lurch, wheeling out of its space
  and screaming right at them out of the fog! Wang Chi paralyzed, Jack rushing
  forward, diving at his friend, knocking him down against the pavement as
  the Firebird bears in... 
 INT. FIREBIRD - DAY 
 One Ear at the wheel...flooring it...Jack and Wang Chi lying side-by-side
  dead ahead.. . WHAMMO RIGHT OVER THEM! 
 EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
 Flat as pancakes...Jack Burton and Wang Chi.. .but miraculously alive! Jack
  lifts his head. 
 JACK BURTON
  Son of a bitch must pay. 
 It's gonna be that kind of movie. 
 INT. FIREBIRD - DAY 
 The Lords of Death on a real high, speeding out onto the freeway toward San
  Francisco, jamming some loud, demented ROCK 'N' ROLL into their overblown
  sound system, laughing like hyenas... 
 . . .when it looms up behind them in the fog.. .A MONSTROUS GRILL... 
 NEEDLES
  Hey...some idiot... 
 INT. PETERBILT - DAY 
 . . . named Jack Burton at the wheel, Wang Chi riding shotgun and hanging
  on for dear life! 
 EXT. EMBARCADERO FREEWAY - DAY 
 The Firebird swerving left, right, evasive action! Jack hanging in there,
  staying an intelligent fifteen yards back, it certainly not being his plan
  to run these morons off the road and extinquish Miao Yin... 
 INT. FIREBIRD - DAY 
 One Ear beside himself, unable to shake the big truck... 
 JOE LUCKY
  Get off, man! Get off! 
 So he does, practically rolling the damn car hard right down the nearest
  available off ramp! The Peterbilt on his heels... 
 EXT. EMBARCADERO FREEWAY - DAY 
 WANG CHI
  Be careful, Jack! 
 JACK BURTON
  Okay! 
 EXT. STREETS - DAY 
 Remember BULLIT? Forget BULLIT. This truck has wings! The Firebird screeches
  around a corner, blasts across a vacant lot! And so does Jack. 
 INT. PETERBILT - DAY 
 Bouncing like a paint mixer... 
 JACK BURTON
  Where.. . they. . .going?! 
 WANG CHI
  Chinatown! 
 EXT. GRANT AVENUE - DAY 
 Gateway to Chinatown...early-morning TOURISTS on the hoof ...A FUNNY BUS
  covered with garish paintings of The Eight Immortals surrounded by hot yellow
  script announcing EGG FOO YUNG TOURS.. . meandering picturesquely down this
  postcard thoroughfare... 
 INT. FUNNY BUS - DAY 
 The proprietor himself at the wheel, EGG SHEN, a peculiar, talkative little
  charmer born in Canton, China, longer ago than he'd care to remember... 
 EGG SHEN
  From Peking and from Canton, from all over 
  China the men flooded into California, to 
  Gum Shan... America, Mountain of Gold.. 
  with gold-rush fever they came. Leaving 
  behind their wives and children... 
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY 
 The Firebird bearing down on us, BLASTING PAST CAMERA... 
 INT. FUNNY BUS - DAY 
 EGG SHEN
  ...working for years, building the railroad, 
  they saved their pennies until they were able to
  send for their families to help build the 
  beautiful, serene Chinatown you see right 
  outside your window this morning... 
 EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY 
 Jack Burton's Peterbilt thundering through the same intersection that Firebird
  just negotiated! 
 INT. FUNNY BUS - DAY 
 EGG SHEN
  ...the old and the new side-by-side, 
  open-air markets, Chinese vegetables, 
  fresh pork, fresh fish, sausages and 
  winter melon soup. How many of you have 
  tried shark's fin soup? 
 Only one FAT MAN raises his hand...Egg's PASSENGERS firing off INSTAMATIC
  FLASHES at the street.. 
 EGG SHEN
  Then later I take you to special 
  restaurant for... Chinese cheese-burger. 
 Watch out, Egg! The Firebird suddenly coming right at him! 
 EXT. FIREBIRD - DAY 
 Needles and Joe Lucky duck! But One Ear saves the day, skids harmlessly around
  the bus, which itself has swerved... 
 EXT. GRANT STREET - DAY 
 ... and wound up on a diagonal halfway across the road... smack in the path
  of... 
 INT. PETERBILT - DAY 
 . . . Jack Burton and Wang Chi! This looks bad. Jack's only hope a desperate
  right-hand turn up Washington, the wrong way on a one-way street! 
 EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY 
 Look out! Jack's big rig sails in.. . between things, around things, nothing
  and nobody getting knocked aside or over-turned for a change! Only about
  twelve hair-breath near misses in six seconds! 
 INT. PETERBILT - DAY 
 JACK BURTON
  Which way?! 
 WANG CHI
  Not this way! 
 A fast left onto Kearny, going with the flow again, screeching to a halt
  at a RED LIGHT. 
 JACK BURTON
  Holy shit... 
 WANG CHI
  Go left, go back into Chinatown,... 
 JACK BURTON 
  Back? Aren't we still in it? We'll never 
  find 'em. Where the hell are we? 
 WANG CHI
  Go left now, Jack! 
 EXT. KEARNY STREET - DAY 
 So Jack runs the light. 
 INT. PETERBILT - DAY 
 WANG CHI
  Down that alley. 
 JACK BURTON
  Why? 
 WING CHI
  Lords of Death. Down that way! 
 JACK BURTON
  (steering into the alley) 
  What, you mean a clubhouse? 
 EXT. NARROW LANE - DAY 
 None of the public, touristy hustle and bustle back here. In fact, it's suddenly
  so foreign, so forbidding that we might easily be in Hong Kong...Jack's big
  truck the last American element on the scene, slouching along like a
  dinosaur...its days numbered. 
 INT. PETERBILT - DAY 
 JACK BURTON
  What's goin' on, Wang? Why'd they steal 
  your girlfriend? 
 WANG CHI
  I have no idea. They're crazy, 
  these gangs. They're hoodlums. 
 JACK BURTON
  It looked to me like first they wanted somebody 
  else, then they settled for...what's her name? 
 WANG CHI
  Miao Yin. I must find her, Jack, before they... 
 SLAM! Jack hits the brakes! There's a BAREFOOT FIGURE standing right in front
  of him, ghostly in the swirling fog, an image from ancient China, cloaked
  in a RED TURBAN and a voluminous black suit. 
 EXT. FOGGY ALLEYS - DAY 
 Having come from an intersecting alleyway, this red-turbaned OLD MAN moves
  on, followed by more of his ilk, but younger, a DOZEN CHINESE WARRIORS, solemn
  and unsettling. . .THE SOUND OF CYMBALS AND A DRUM behind them... 
 INT. PETERBILT - DAY 
 WANG CHI
  Hatchets and cleavers. 
 JACK BURTON
  What...? 
 WANG CHI
  A fighting tong. They're Suey Sings... 
  

The rest of the screenplay includes:
 - The missing Storm lines
  - The missing Miao Yin scenes and lines
  - Extra Jack Burton monologues
  - An even less serious tone than the existing film
  - Explanations regarding the conflicts between the Bing Kong (Wing Kong)
  and Suey Sings (Blue Turbans)
  - A different and less satisfying ending
