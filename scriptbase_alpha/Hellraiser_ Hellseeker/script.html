                      Carl Dupre




<b>                                              10/27/2000
</b>


<b>
</b><b>INT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</b>
KIRSTY GOODING looks out the passenger window as the trees go
whizzing past. She's attractive, late twenties, warmly
sophisticated. Something makes her smile. She turns to the
driver and thinks real hard as she says this.

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>          Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two
          hundred and sixty one.

TREVOR is her husband, late twenties as well. God gave him
brains and beauty. He has used them both prodigiously.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now
          Kirsty?

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>          Shut up and play darling. Your turn.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Five hundred ninety two thousand seven
          hundred and four.

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>          Uh... eighty two?

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Eighty four.

Kirsty takes a calculator out of her purse and double checks
the math.

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>          You win! Okay pull over.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>              (looking at his watch)
          But... I thought...

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>              (laughing)
          If what I've heard is true this could be
          the last time for a long long time.
          Besides we've got a whole seven minutes
          before the next one. Clock's ticking.
          Tick-tock...

Trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding.

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>              (through clenched teeth)
<b>          PULL OVER NOW.
</b>
<b>                                                     (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                                 2.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

Then pulls over to the side of the road. Kirsty reaches over,
quickly unzips his pants immediately goes down on Trevor OUT
OF FRAME. He reacts accordingly. A little pleasure, utter
shock.

<b>                       KIRSTY'S VOICE
</b>                 (from BELOW FRAME)
             Honey what's wrong?

Kirsty rises INTO FRAME once again.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this
             anyway?

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>                 (self-conscious)
             I'm... I'm doing a very special thing
             here. And you can't even ... respond?

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Sorry honey the present situation isn't
             exactly fodder for an erection. Shouldn't
             we be getting to the hospital?

FULL ON Kirsty. For the first time WE SEE her big pregnant
belly sticking out. She looks at Trevor innocently.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             I was going to keep breathing you know.
             You think I'm an amateur or something?

Trevor stuffs himself back in his pants, puts the car in gear
and presses the accelerator.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Just concentrate on the task at hand
             please. Listen to me. You should be
             giving ME this lecture.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             You've been cheating on me haven't you?

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor
             during your last contraction.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             Roughly two thirds of married men who
             cheat start during the eighth month of
             their wives' first pregnancy.



<b>                                                        (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                              3.
</b><b>CONTINUED: (2)
</b>

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          I would never cheat on you. Not while
          you're pregnant now you know that.

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>              (features tightening)
          Okay... uh oh here comes another one.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Share the pain Kirsty.

She takes Trevor's hand and squeezes as hard as she can. IN
<b>CLOSE UP WE SEE:
</b>
A SOLVED RUBIC'S CUBE sitting between them.

Do we need this vision of the solved rubics cube?

<b>EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b>
The car is approaching a bridge.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Trevor takes his hand off the wheel to look at his watch.

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>          One fifteen.

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>              (in dire pain)
          Oh God...... Trevor, I think my water
          just broke.

Trevor grabs the wheel again. Kirsty GASPS.

<b>                    KIRSTY (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh my God. It's coming out.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          What?

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b><b>          THE BABY IS COMING OUT! I CAN FEEL IT!
</b><b>          SONOFABITCH IT HURTS!! AAAGGGGHHH!!!
</b>
Trevor looks at her, trying to stay calm.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Okay Kirsty don't panic. Just keep
          breathing! DON'T PANIC! Put the seat back
          and hold on to something. Were almost
          there!

<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                                 4.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

Kristy's hand moves down the along side the seat between the
door and she plunges back with the seat. She looks at Trevor
wide eyed.

Shes about to give birth in a Chevrolet.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!! (breathing
             heavily) oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor,
             It's coming out.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             This isn't happening.



Kristy starts to convulse with pain. She begins to tremble
and her arms flail about in an attempt to ease her
discomfort. She grabs Trevors arm for support.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Honey, take it easy.    Your gonna be
             alright.

Kristy becomes more violent, kicking her legs up onto the
dashboard. She starts grabbing Trevors arm a little more
violently, causing Trevors to weave a bit on the road as he
recoils.

<b>EXT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</b>
The car lunges to the side of the road and weaves a bit in
the gravel. Up ahead a bridge approaches.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
Trevor regains control of the car.

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Kristy! Take it easy. everythings gonna
             be alright. Com'on, start the breathing,
             with me... come on. One, two-three, and
             blow..

Trevor starts the lamanns method alone, as Kristy appears to
have passed out from the pain. She has her head leaned away
from him and is limp in the passengers seat.

                        TREVOR (cont'd)
             Krist.   Honey. Kristy!

Kristy doesn't answer. Trevors puts his arm on her and
shakes her. She doesn't react.

<b>                                                        (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Kristy! Honey wake up!

Trevors attention is now on his unconscious wife rather than
the two lane road which stretches across the bridge.

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Honey, wake up. Please wake up.

And with that Kristy's does exactly that. She lunges toward
him in a violent spasm and scares the shit out of him (and
us) which causes Trevor to now completely lose control of the
car.

<b>INT./EXT. CAR - DAY
</b>
The rest is a blur...

... Trevor loses control of the steering wheel... Kirsty
SCREAMS... Their car skids from one side of the bridge to the
other-careening toward the guardrail- SMASH!

The car is plummeting toward the river below. Trevor and
Kirsty brace themselves. The car hits the surface...

<b>INT. RIVER, UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
Trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He
breaks the surface and gasps for air. Getting his bearings
he see the car bobbing on the surface, the current is
separating him from his wife.

Treading water, he looks out at the car and there she is
trapped inside...

Kirsty

Still belted to her seat. Her eyes are wide with desperation,
breath quickening, sinking fast... Kristy pounds the window
with her hands, trying to get out. She's trapped.

Apparently giving in, she presses a hand against the
windshield just before the car disappears under the
surface...

<b>EXT. SHORE - DAY
</b>
Trevor paddles hard to the shore. Exhausted, he crawls onto
the shore underneath the bridge they just jumped.

Trevor stands trying to process what just happened in the
last fifteen seconds. He screams out for his wife, and to
what has just happened.

<b>                                                  (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Kristy!
             Kristy!

Trevor drops to his knee's in distress.

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Oh my God, Kristy! Please Kristy.
             (frantically) I'm so sorry, Kristy.




He hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of the
bashed-up guardrail from the bridge has just snapped off and
is sailing right down toward him-

<b>TREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM
</b>
<b>WHITE LIGHT FLOODS HIS VISION...
</b>
<b>INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Trevor's eyes blink open, darting left and right. He is on a
bed, his head bandaged.

AN ANGULAR NURSE ENTERS the room, walking up to Trevor's bed.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Where is she...? Where's Kirsty?

The Nurse grabs Trevor's right arm and straps it to the side
of the bed. She isn't exactly one of God's gentler creatures.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Hey, what are you-

She moves to Trevor's legs, strapping them down as well, then
his other arm.

By now SEVERAL SURGEONS ENTER the room, features obscured by
surgical masks.

The Nurse fastens a clamp around Trevor's head, attaches it
to the bed.

Trevor is completely discombobulated. The surgeons gather
behind Trevor's bed.

CLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE as he struggles to see what's
happening back there but it's useless.

He cannot move a muscle. He hears a sickening SAWING noise
and his eyes bulge in horror.

WIDE as the doctors calmly lift Trevor's freshly sawed
cranium from his head exposing his brain. The CHIEF SURGEON-
a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place
make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted. He
walks up, presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins.
He cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his
eyes appear even larger. Though no one speaks his name his
name tag reads Dr. Barker.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             What are you people doing?!

The Chief Surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes
into a Trevor's frontal lobe.

<b>                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>             What's happening to-!

Trevor's eyes glaze over and his jaw relaxes. The chief
surgeon speaks in an english accent.

<b>                       CHIEF SURGEON
</b>             As you can see I just accessed the speech
             center, temporarily shutting down all
             verbal ability.

As the Chief Surgeon continues he takes several more pins off
the tray.

<b>                       CHIEF SURGEON (CONT'D)
</b>             The goal is find the exact point in the
             brain where moral decisions are made, the
             place where right and wrong is
             distinguished. In exploring this Morality
             Center I will most likely be triggering
             memories, disrupting the unconscious. Our
             patient may experience some distress

Chief Surgeon slips another pin into Trevors exposed brain.

             As he was thrown into the lake, where the
             beast and the false prophet had been
             thrown.

The Chief Surgeon voice lowers and his eyes turn black. The
eye magification no at a hideous level, showing jet black
eyes.

Trevor looks at the frowning nurse who is watching over him.
Chief Surgeon sticks a needle into another spot on Trevor's
brain.

TREVOR'S POV: The nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with
blackened eyes.

Trevor opens his mouth to scream and-

-IN A BURST OF WHITE LIGHT, AN ANGELIC WOMAN is now standing
before him. She is bathed in a haze of white light.

<b>                    ANGELIC WOMAN
</b>          Well? What do say Trevor? Que pasa?

Trevor relaxes. His bindings are gone. The gargoyle nurse is
gone. The surgeons are gone. And his brain is sitting safely
within his inviolated skull, upon which now sit a few
electrodes. The bandage is no longer there.

But from his pain wracked expression we know the pain in his
head is still very real. He reaches for his head, makes sure
its all intact.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Where do I start?

<b>                     ANGELIC WOMAN

          intensity?

She touches him gently.

                    ANGELIC WOMAN (cont'd)
          Can you describe the pains?

Trevor looks up. The angelic woman smiles back at him. She's
in scrubs, a stethoscope dangling from her neck. Trevor
winces.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          I'm not sure. How about a jackhammer in
          the Occipital lobe?

She picks up a pad and scribbles something on it. Trevor
notices she's wearing a nameplate. Dr. ALLISON DORMERE.

look, then looks at Trevor's chart.

Ambrose gives Trevor a fatherly smile then EXITS, not even
looking at Allison. Allison watches him go, then turns back
to Trevor... then smiles perkily.

<b>                    ALLISON
</b>          Well looks like you're going home! Hope
          you brought your bus pass.

<b>INT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor starts nodding out. The bus is practically empty. TWO
BLACK CHILDREN a boy and a girl sit across from Trevor. A
CREEPY OLD WOMAN sits further back, knitting something.

A CHURCH BELL RINGING causes Trevor to wake again up, wincing
at the sound. As the church passes the BELL becomes louder
and louder.

Trevor hears LAUGHTER and looks up at the children. The girl
and her brother seem to be play-fighting over a toy they hold
between them. Trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this
way and that.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Do you kids mind keeping it down?

The creepy old woman speaks up.

<b>                    OLD WOMAN
</b>          Aww let them be. They're only kids.

Trevor notices what the Old Woman is knitting is a baby's
bootie. As the children continue to laugh at him Trevor
stares at the bootie tears welling up.

<b>INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor lives in a dingy place, one step up from poverty-
level. Funny thing is this used to be a nicer place. We see
remnants of a feminine touch long since past. Dirty dishes
sit in the sink. A cockroach skitters across the kitchenette.

Trevor sits at his TV playing an extremely violent videogame.
We're talking heads getting blown off, bodies exploding,
limbs being severed. As the end ends a DEMONIC VOICE chuckles
from the TV.

<b>                    DEMONIC VOICE FROM TV
</b><b>          YOU LOSE...

The screen flashes TRY AGAIN? Trevor takes a swig of beer and
sits back in the easy chair looking at something atop the TV.
A picture of Kirsty.

</b><b>                                                             11.
</b>


<b>INT. TREVOR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor looks through an old photo album. Pictures of him and
Kirsty. Some pictures of him. A lot of pictures of Kirsty.
Smiles, smiles, smiles...

He stops at one close up of them mugging at a camera they've
pointed on themselves. All we see is their faces, the rest is
dark and blurry, except for one thing. A small shadowy object
Kirsty is holding.

<b>EXT. CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH - DAY
</b>
Dressed in a button down shirt and tie, Trevor walks up to
the pale utilitarian box-like structure.

<b>INT. CUBIC ROUTE, BULLPEN - DAY
</b>
It is a maze of cubicles iced by harsh fluorescence. It is a
mill of data research, where the TAPPING of fingers on
computer keypads never ends...

<b>INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY
</b>
... no thanks to Trevor, who has already resumed his head-in-
hands position at his desk. He rubs his eyes, seemingly
blinded by the screen staring back at him.

A MAN Trevor's age rolls up on his office chair beside
Trevor, banging into the desk. BRET. Trevor's co-worker and
cubicle mate.

<b>                    BRET
</b>          Trevor what is the metric probability of

Bret eyes Trevor suspiciously. Then smiling...

Bret casually gestures to a surveillance camera overhead that
sweeps across the room like a prison spotlight.

<b>                       BRET (CONT'D)
</b>             I'm just looking out for ya.

Bret slides back over to his work station.

Trevor puts his hands on the computer keys and starts to
type. A jolt of pain rips through his cranium forcing him to
stop. Bret stops typing and breathes an exasperated SIGH.

<b>                       BRET
</b>             Sixty five point three percent of all
             headaches are due to low sugar levels in
             the bloodstream Trevor.

A light bulb seems to go off over Trevor's head.

<b>INT. BREAK ROOM - DAY
</b>
Inside the narrow room blasted in fluorescent light, Trevor
eyes a vending machine, examining its wares. He peruses the
sundry sugary snacks, looking for just the right fix.

It's so quiet in here we can almost hear his head pounding in
pain. He shuts his eyes. A couple of the fluorescent bulbs
over his head wink out and the rest flicker weakly.

When Trevor opens his eyes again he notices the room has
gotten considerably darker. He looks up at the weakening
lights and grunts in disgust.

The light is just dim enough now so that he can't see what's
in the vending machine. He goes right up to the glass and
peers into the machine, using his hand as a visor. This
strain on his eyes intensifies his headache.

It's still pretty murky inside the glass case. Trevor squints
and just when he thinks he can read a wrapper on... what is
it? A candy bar?-

A PALE HAND suddenly presses against the glass from inside
the machine. Trevor jolts backwards. The hand is gone. But in
the reflection of the glass Trevor notices someone has been
standing behind him. He whirls around-

-and is face to face with our worst nightmare: PINHEAD.

<b>                       PINHEAD
</b>             It's too late.

Pinhead lashes out at Trevor striking his face with a clawed
hand the rips his face clean off. The lights are back up as
Trevor slams against the machine and grabs his face. It's
still there!

Where Pinhead was standing is THE WOMAN who just slapped him.

<b>                       WOMAN
</b><b>             SNAP OUT OF IT!

She is attractive and studious. Her sensible business attire

supervisor GWEN.

</b>             Jesus what the hell was that? It's like

dumbfounded.

against the vending machine. Before he realizes it, she's
kissing him real hard. He gently ducks out from under her,
freeing himself.

one of the characters.

and pulls back.

Trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen, clicks.

Up comes a jpeg slideshow. Each picture is of Gwen dressed in
a piece of sexy lingerie. The caption underneath reads WORK
HARDER. Looking around his cubicle, he then takes another
look at the jpeg. Trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see
him peer the outer office looking for Gwen. He sits back
down. Embarrassed Trevor closes the memo at least for now.

TREVOR'S PHONE RINGS. Startleing him(and us). He picks it up.

          Trevor hi this is Detective Lange from
          homicide. It's about your wife.

Push in on to a bewildered Trevor.

<b>INT. LANGE'S OFFICE, HOMICIDE - DAY
</b>
It is a dank crumbling room. A place where sunlight is not
welcome. DETECTIVE LANGE, a handsome graying gentleman who's
plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip, sits at his
desk.

Trevor sits across from him. Behind Trevor is another empty
desk.

As Lange speaks he SNIFFS wetly every so often.

<b>                    LANGE

Lange takes out nasal drops and squeezes some in each nostril
as he speaks.

             We still haven't been able to locate your
             the body in that river. And missing
             persons turned up some evidence that

<b>                       LANGE
</b>             For one thing there were no skid marks on
             that bridge, the tires were all intact,
             from what we could tell, nothing wrong
             internally with the vehicle either. Like
             the car had been driven off the bridge
             intentionally.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             It should all in the report. I told you
             guys everything. She was giving birth in

             and I lost control.

Trevor looks numb, unable to answer.    Lange poker faced,
keeps looking through the reoport.

             Listen we really are at a stalemate here
             until we find the body itself. Is there
             any way you did not tell missing persons
             everything that happened just before that
             accident?

Kirsty's eyes are closed. She is motionless. Trevor tries to
look at her while watching the road at the same time.

</b>          Kirsty. Jesus, wake up!

This time she doesn't wake up.

<b>EXT. ROAD - DAY
</b>
The car fishtails. Trevor loses control and the car skids
from one side of the bridge to the other- careening toward
the guardrail- SMASH!

The car is plummeting toward the river below... The car hits
the surface...

<b>INT. UNDERWATER - DAY
</b>
Trevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He
swims up to the passenger door and tries the handle. It won't
give. Unable to breathe Trevor finally swims up...

He breaks the surface and crawls onto the shore...

He looks out at the car to where she should be trapped

Trevors eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening,
The car is sinking fast...

He looks at the car and calls out, but there is no Kristy
insight.

The car disappears under the surface...

Trevor hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of
the bashed-up guardrail is sailing right down toward him-

Trevor blinks and looks around him. Lange is sitting just
where they were when he saw him last. Only now there's a very
wary look on his face. Whoa.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Uhh. Yes detective, sorry. Just trying to

Lange nods.

</b>             Okay. From what I remember now, maybe my
             wife was thrown from the car when it hit
             the water. Maybe she wasn't trapped
             inside.

Lange checks the report again. He believes Trevor...or does
he?

             questions you'll get a call from myself

Trevor exits, both men maintain eye contact as the door
closes between him.

<b>EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT
</b>
The bus pulls up to the curb. Trevor climbs out and starts
walking down the empty street. As soon as the bus pulls away,
the only sound heard is Trevor's footsteps.

POV BEHIND TREVOR: We see Trevor's back from a slight
distance. Someone is following him.

Sensing this, Trevor looks behind him. Nothing but an empty
sidewalk. Trevor hurries his pace, almost there at his
apartment building. He glances behind him again. Nope, nobody
there... then suddenly-

-A DARK FIGURE passes under a streetlight on the opposite
side of the street. Trevor turns a corner no picking up the
pace a little. The DARK FIGURE follows, it picks up it's pace
as well.

Trevors walks an d approaches a small alley way. Should he
take this home?

A enraged Pitbull nearly rips his nose off as it Barks and
lunges to the end of a heavy chain leash. Trevor (and us)
about piss our pant's. The dog continues barking, Trevor
regains his composure. Suddenly the dogs attention moves
toward the direction of the DARK FIGURE. Amazingly, it stops
barking and actually cowers back into the shadows.

Spooked, Trevor rushes up to:

<b>EXT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT
</b>
He hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in.

<b>INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT
</b>
He looks out on the street.

The figure is walking up the building opposite his. It's
features are shrouded in shadow, but it is definitely staring
at Trevor, who slams the apartment door behind him. He peers
out at the street from inside the front hall.

The figure is gone.

</b><b>CONTINUED:

Trevors looks around the apartment. He opens the fridge, it
lights up the darkened room. He grabs one of the three items
sitting on the wire racks. About to twist off the cap off a
cold beer, when a light out his window urges him to
investigate. He draws the curtain open and GASPS.

POV OUT WINDOW: Staring back at him, from a dimly lit window
in the apartment building across the street, is the SHADOWY
MAN that followed Trevor home.

The man's face is shrouded in shadows but Trevor can see he's
holding something bundled up in a blanket. The light in the
window winks out, rendering it dark again.

Trevor can almost still see the figure somewhere in the
darkness still gazing at him.

Trevor looks a little sick all of a sudden, like he can't
breathe.

THE BELL FROM A DISTANT CATHEDRAL begins to peel. BONG...
<b>BONG... BONG...
</b>
Trevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits
out a massive amount of water!

<b>BONG... BONG... BONG...
</b>
Trevor falls to the ground, arms and legs thrashing, heaving
up mouthfuls of water. Trevor is drowning...

<b>BONG... BONG... BONG...
</b>
In the puddles of water, we see bits of debris: leaves,
pebbles, etc. Finally, a hideous eel-like creature's head
pokes out of Trevor's gaping mouth- it escapes and slithers
across the floor, up the window sill and out into the night.

-the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humongous
lungful of sweet oxygen. He then notices he is completely
dry. Stunned, he looks about him.

Trevor is now laying on the easychair, nursing a beer. His
videogame is flashing PLAY AGAIN? Whoa.

The BING-BONG! of his doorbell startles him.

Trevor gets the door to find a striking young GOTHIC WOMAN on
the other side. Black hair, lipstick, fingernails. She smiles
(too brightly for someone with such somber appointments) then
summarily lifts her shirt to just below her breasts for
Trevor.

Trevor looks down at her stomach, the lower half of which
contains tattoos which just break the surface of her jeans.
At its center is a navel pierced with a studded black pearl,
which Gothic Woman then plays with. Trevor looks a little
confused.

<b>                    GOTHIC WOMAN (CONT'D)

Tawny ambles off to her apartment. Trevor closes the door and
leans against it. He slides down the door and covers his face
with his hands. Another headache coming on.

Trevor paces in his living room. Looks at watch. Then the
door. Still no sign of Gwen.

<b>INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY

Trevor rummages through a closet. Reaching up to a shelf
above him, he tugs at a big cardboard box and pulls. The
entire box comes crashing down and out spill about fifty VHS
tapes, all hand-labeled: KIRSTY &amp; TREVOR, then the date.

He puts one in the VCR, hits play...

It's his wedding video. Trevor watches the festivity of the
wedding ON THE SCREEN, he smiles for the first time.

The wedding portion of the tape ends and a not-so-clean edit
takes us into the honeymoon.

Trevor looks like he'd be more turned on sitting bare-assed
on an autopsy table.

</b>             Gwen you scared the living shit out of

She pushes him toward the chair and sits him in it.

Gwen puts one foot on his chest.

<b>                       GWEN (CONT'D)

Trevor pulls the shoe off.

Trevor does the same for the other leg.

It's intense. Gwen is on top. Gwen aggressively pulls
Trevor's shirt off then goes for his belt. Trevor suddenly
grabs her hands.

<b>                       GWEN
</b>             You're kidding me.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             I'm sorry Gwen. I just can't.

Gwen climbs off the chair and throws her jacket back on.

<b>                       GWEN
</b>             You have definitely got a screw loose,
             Trevor. Goodbye.

Stuffing her feet in her shoes, Gwen's out the door.

Trevor SIGHS, relieved the attack is finally over.

About to turn the TV off and stow away his camera. He looks
at the TV and freezes.

THE IMAGE ON THE TV shows that Gwen is still there,
undressing Trevor. Only video Trevor is giving in, kissing
her back, pulling her clothes off.

Trevor looks at the camera. The red "record" light is
flashing. Trevor turns back to the TV walking closer and
closer to the screen.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             What the hell?

He waves a hand in front of the camera and his hand actually
appears on the TV in front of the sex image.

<b>TREVOR WATCHES
</b>
Trevor and Gwen make love in video. Video Trevor turns to the
the camera (to Trevor) and gives a menacing smile.

Video Trevor looks back up at Gwen, who smiles down at him
carnivorously. She licks her lips.

<b>                       VIDEO GWEN
</b>             There's one thing I should have told you
             right from the beginning Trevor.

Video Trevor doesn't see a knife she manages to slip out of
her purse.

</b>          I like it pretty rough.

To Trevor's shock Gwen suddenly drags the knife right across
his throat. Blood shoots up at Gwen's grinning face. Blood
pours out of Trevor's mouth and down his chest.

FROM THE COLOR SCREEN Trevor, having just seen himself get
murdered, shouts:

<b>INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          No!

Allison stands above him Bic razor in her gloved hand. The
bottom half of Trevor's face is covered with shaving cream.

<b>                    ALLISON
</b>          Sorry I thought you were going to stay
          under longer.

His face is clean shaven, a little shaving cream remains
around his chin. He now has several electrodes attached to
his cranium. They're connected to an EEG which BEEPS LOUDLY.
The noise bothers Trevor. His eyes dart this way and that. He
focuses on the Bic razor.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>           What's happening to me? What are you

Trevor seems to like the attention.

Trevor puts his chin up and Allison continues shaving his
neck. Trevor studies her face.

Allison gives him a wink, disarming Trevor.

</b>             My wife said that exact same sentence to
             me the day we got married. She even

Allison wipes his face clean with a towel.

Allison gets up, grabs a clipboard starts filling out a
report. Trevor stares at her.

          still love someone after they're gone.
          But you've got to quit blaming yourself
          okay...? Okay?

Allison looks up and notices Trevor's body has slackened, his
eyes empty. She drops the clipboard and starts snapping her
fingers over his eyes.

<b>                       ALLISON
</b>          Trevor?

He is unconscious. A LOUD STEADY BUZZ sounds from one of the
machines behind her as blood begins to leak out of Trevor's
ear. Allison jumps up and hits call button above Trevor's
bed.

<b>                       ALLISON (CONT'D)

to his dying body and grabs the paddles.

</b>          It's okay Trevor I'm coming for you.

Allison rubs the paddles together, presses the paddles
against Trevor's chest and-

<b>INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY

-Trevor sits bolt upright in his bed. His alarm clock is
making that same BUZZING noise.

Trevor is completely disoriented. He sees a note laying next
to him on the bed. It says ìYou're an animal baby... you-know-
who...î He finally looks at the clock. Seven forty five.

<b>INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY
</b>
Trevor is on his computer typing madly. ON THE SCREEN WE SEE
he has accessed the local newspaper. He calls up an article
reading: ACCIDENT LEAVES ONE HOSPITALIZED ANOTHER MISSING.

He looks at a newspaper picture of the bridge, which is
humming with rescue activity.

Trevor's head is pounding. He goes into his desk drawer and
pulls out a bottle of aspirin.

Trevor empties the last of the bottle's six tablets into his
hand, downs them, chases them with what's left of an economy
sized bottle of Mylanta. Trevor can't seem to even look at
his computer screen. He hears a DING-DING and looks up.

He has an instant office message waiting. Trevor clicks OK.
The instant message reads: ìIT'S TOO LATE.î Trevor rapidly
types up. ìWHO IS THIS.î The same message is repeated. ìIT'S
<b>TOO LATE. IT'S TOO LATE. IT'S TOO LATE.î
</b>
Trevor stands up and looks around mazelike structure of
cubicles as far as he can see. All of his co-workers are
slaving away on their keypads. Trevor sits back down and
cancels the instant message. He ruminates for a moment.

From behind Bret's fingers TAPPING on the keyboard seem to
get louder, more frustrated. They finally stop and Bret
stretches momentarily.

          basket. Her stomach was in the filing
          cabinet. Her ass was on the copy

          remember?

Trevor still can't speak. He goes into his computer mailbox
and re-opens the file he'd received from ìYou Know Who.î

He stifles a scream when he sees the jpegs have changed. Sure
they're still of Gwen. Pieces of her swimming in puddles of
her own blood. Where it once said ìWork harderî it now says
ìPolice File.î

Bret wheels across the cubicle on his chair and hands
something to Trevor. It's an oddly designed postcard bearing
some sort of voodoo mask. The font is faux-Oriental, the kind
they use for Chinese take-out menus. He looks closer. It's an
appointment card for an acupuncturist. Sage.

<b>INT. SAGE'S OFFICE - DAY

A chart of all the puncture points on the human body is
tacked to the wall.

Trevor lies on the table. SAGE, a gorgeous ethereal Indian
woman is at the far end, hovering over the soles of his feet,
sticking pins into the appropriate places. She looks up at
him slyly.

<b>                    SAGE

Sage walks over to one of the cabinets, gathering more
acupuncture needles. Trevor can't help but notice her shapely
body, her feline gait. Sage throws a sultry glance over her
shoulder at him, prompting him to finally answer her
question.

             -it's like I was never wherever I was to
             begin with I was really somewhere else
             entirely.

Sage puts the last needle in. For the first time Trevor
actually feels a releief of pressure in his head.

                       TREVOR (cont'd)
             Ok, whatever that was...do it again.
             That just set me free of the worlds
             longest head ache. Is this making any
             sense?

<b>                       SAGE (CONT'D)
</b>             None whatsoever. Now just relax. Let the
             needles do the driving.

A PHONE OUTSIDE THE OFFICE RINGS. Sage looks up at the door.

<b>                       SAGE (CONT'D)
</b>                 (patting his cheek)
             Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

Trevor watches Sage EXIT the office. He lies there a moment,
bathing in warm sunshine. He is relaxed, pain free.

Behind him, an acupuncture anatomy chart on the wall. Which
begins to change its shape. It morphs (or economically
changes) into PINHEAD.

Trevor is oblivious as PINHEAD approaches, doll eyes
betraying no feeling whatsoever. Then, Pinhead reaches up to
his head and begins pulling out one of those infamous pins.
It takes a while to come out.

Because it is a foot long. Once out, the needle drips with
black ooze.

Trevor hears a noise and believes its Sage who's reentered
the room.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          I'm thinking this might just be what I
          needed.

Pinhead speaks but in Sages voice. As he pushes on of the
pins into the tip Trevors skin in his back .

<b>                    PINHEAD
</b>          No matter what happens just remember...

Before Trevor can react, Pinhead suddenly jabs the pin down
into Trevor's back, pinning him to the table! It sears his
skin. In Pinheads recognizable voice...

<b>                    PINHEAD (CONT'D)
</b>          We're all here for you Trevor.

As Trevor reels in terror, Pinhead pulls another foot long
needle from his head and thrusts this one into his neck! WE
SEE the needle come right out the other side, nailing itself
into the table. Trevor can't believe he's still alive!

Pinhead pulls one more out, aims this one at Trevor's arm,
and swings down.

                                                    quick cuts:

<b>INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Allison pokes Trevor's arm with a hypodermic. She places a
reassuring hand on his chest. Machines behind her are PINGING
and BUZZING like crazy. Allison looks a little worried.

<b>                    ALLISON
</b>          Shh. It's okay. Go back to sleep.

Allison blurs out of focus...

... then briefly comes back into focus...

... only now it's A MAN INSIDE A DARKENED ROOM.

<b>INT. DARKENED ROOM - DAY
</b>
TREVOR'S POV: Buried in the murky shadow, all that can be
seen are his hands, lit by a shaft of sunlight beaming
through a blinded window. A ring on the man's left pinky
finger glimmers eerily, almost too much. We saw this man in
an earlier FLASHBACK

He's holding something. The cube. He speaks in an ECHOED and
<b>DISTORTED VOICE.
</b>
<b>                       DARKENED MAN
</b>             I know. Divorce isn't good enough.
             Abandonment isn't good enough. There's
             only one way to do it and do it cleanly,
             without leaving a trace of evidence.

The darkened man pushes the cube across the desk towards us.

<b>                       DARKENED MAN (CONT'D)
</b>             Open this and your problem will disappear
             forever. And no one will ever suspect
             you. A word of caution though. A certain
             side effect of the box. Pleasure.
             Pleasures that would redefine the
             parameters of sensation.

Trevors picks up the cube.


<b>                       DARKENED MAN (CONT'D)
</b>             Once the cube is opened there is no
             turning back. Ever.

A LOUD BUZZING NOISE BEGINS drowning out the darkened man's
words as we:

                                                    dissolve to:

Trevor quietly wakes up to the sound of his alarm BUZZING
again. He stares at the ceiling.

<b>INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</b>
Trevor pushes through the front doors and a RECEPTIONIST
greets him with a big smile and a business card.

                 (looking at the card)
             Some guy named Givens.

She hands the card to him batting her eyelashes. Trevor looks
at the card as she checks out his package. Trevor reads the
word HOMICIDE.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Uh thanks this looks a little important.
             Could you let the folks upstairs know

                 (winking)
             I'd lay across a bed of nails.

Trevor walks back OUT and the receptionist watches him go.
Another female employee walks by staring at Trevor. She looks
at the receptionist and they both nod in agreement.

<b>INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Same office only Trevor is sitting at the other desk across
from a hawklike MAN who is playing with a yoyo. This is
GIVENS. If good cop bad cop is the scheme here, he's the
latter.

Brow furrowing, Trevor stands up.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             I need to talk to my attorney. Now.

Givens pushes his phone toward Trevor, who takes it and dials
furiously. Givens remains poker-faced. Trevor dials a number.

With that Trevor hangs up the phone and EXITS the office.
Givens BUSTS OUT LAUGHING.

<b>INT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY

Trevor types bitterly on the computer crunching numbers like
a madman.

<b>                    BRET
</b>          I don't know what pissed you off but it's

<b>INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT

Trevor plays his videogame with venom. The cries of his kills
emanate from the TV, building to a crescendo. Finally we hear
a WOMAN'S VOICE come from the TV.

<b>                    WOMAN'S VOICE
</b><b>          I'M SAVED! MY HERO!

Trevor stares at the self-taken picture of him and his wife
mugging at the camera. What is it that Kirsty is holding?

<b>INT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT
</b>
The TV is on. Trevor flips through the channels. He stops on
the Nature Channel. A goat is casually munching on some nuts
and berries.

<b>                    ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE
</b>              (from TV)
          -at the dawning of the agrarian age
          goat's milk would be considered a
          suitable substitute for a mother's breast
          milk. And the sacrifice of a goat would
          appease an angry god and ensure a
          bountiful harvest. But in time the ritual
          would become associated with less
          hallowed purposes.

             blood is considered to be either an
             aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic
             orgies, or a means by which a high priest
             may summon Satan himself.

AN ILLUSTRATION of a goat with many eyes appears on the
screen.

<b>                       ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>                 (from TV)
             The Book of Revelations speaks of the
             anti-Christ as the beast with many eyes.
             For centuries illustrators have chosen a
             goat to represent this beast.

His eyes hurting too much to watch any more, Trevor turns the
TV off. Out of sheer instinct he suddenly turns to look-

<b>-OUT HIS WINDOW:
</b>
The apartment across the street is lit. A STRANGE FIGURE is
standing in the window.

Trevor jumps up and rushes over to his window. He looks OUT
at that same shadowy man he saw earlier. The man's face is
still obscured and is still holding something in a blanket.
Squinting Trevor is able to make out what it is:

A SLEEPING BABY. The stranger pulls the baby's blanket over
the baby's angelic face. Then the light in that apartment
goes out abruptly.

Trevor stares at the darkened window breathing heavily. Is
the stranger still in there, watching Trevor in the dark?
Trevor cannot tell.

A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR makes him flinch.

Trevor goes to the door, opens it to find:

TAWNY. Only now she's dressed in a skintight black rubber
dress. She smiles accentuating a fresh coat of black
lipstick.

<b>                       TAWNY

Tawny grabs the back of his neck, pulling him to her as she
kisses him deeply. She grabs his collar and pulls him out to
the hallway.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

She turns around, leading Trevor through the hall like a
horse. A very confused horse.

<b>                    TREVOR

<b>                       TAWNY

Trevor eyes her gorgeous body and decides not to resist quite
so much.

<b>INT. TAWNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor leans against the counter, sipping at a glass of wine
nervously. Right next to him, Tawny's at the stove, stirring
a pot of something dark and bubbly. She looks up at him,
smiling seductively. But Trevor's still a few lengths behind.

<b>                       TAWNY
</b>          You okay?

<b>                    TREVOR

          weird actually.

<b>                       TAWNY
</b>          Really?

Tawny grabs Trevor's balls and he jumps away as if jolted by
a cattle-prod.

<b>                    TAWNY (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!

          God. Sometimes you can be such an animal.
          Other times you are the ultimate tease...

She holds up a spoonful of what she's been stirring. It looks
like stew.

tastes, licks his lips. Then squints.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?

<b>                       TAWNY

             asparagus, olives, some more of mother
             nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college,
             me and my roommates used to call it hard-

<b>                       TAWNY

Trevor takes another sip of it.

Tawny summarily unzips her rubber dress and whips it off.

Trevor is speechless.

Tawny's body is covered with bites and bruises.

<b>                       TREVOR

Tawny BUSTS OUT LAUGHING.

Trevor shakes his head no.

Trevor grabs his stomach, lurching over. He can't breath.
Trevor looks up at Tawny. But it is no longer her. Tawny has
changed into something else entirely.

<b>A CENOBITE.
</b>
The Cenobite rips Trevor's shirt open, and we can see
movement within his abdomen. Like a baby kicking. Whatever's
in their shoots up expanding Trevor's chest cavity.

The Cenobite pins Trevor to the wall and hovers in his face
as if about to kiss him.

Before Trevor can scream he is choking. The Cenobite watches
with glee as something begins to move up into Trevor's
throat, expanding his neck, forcing his jaws open and
finally...

... a BLACK EEL pokes its head out of Trevor's mouth. The
Cenobite opens its own mouth and the eel starts to crawl
inside it. Meanwhile Trevor's about to pass out from
asphyxiation when-

<b>INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

various pieces of monitoring equipment around him are BEEPING
and PINGING like slot machines.

Allison walks around the room pressing buttons that silent
each machine one by one, then walks up to the bed, looking
surprisingly calm.

<b>                    ALLISON

Trevor looks relieved. Shell-shocked but relieved.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             I'm certainly keeping you busy huh?

She strokes his forehead.

<b>                       ALLISON (CONT'D)
</b>             Feeling better now?

Trevor shakes his head.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             These hallucinations I'm having. I think
             they're more like memories coming back to
             me in a strange way.

<b>                       ALLISON
</b>             Well that's not necessarily a bad thing
             is it?

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             If they're blocked memories... I'm
             starting to realize the reason why I
             blocked them out. Allison I think I
             really... screwed everything up.

<b>                       ALLISON
</b>             Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             I miss her. I miss my wife.

Trevor takes her hand. Allison looks briefly around her
then... climbs onto the bed with him.

<b>                       ALLISON
</b>             If you need to cry, go ahead. I won't
             tell.

Holding her hand to his face, Trevor closes his eyes,
squeezing out a tear.

CLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE. WE start to NOTICE subtle differences
about Allison's hand. It is very pale, the fingernails black.

Trevor opens his eyes.

<b>INT. TAWNY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
He is now lying on Tawny's bed, which is surrounded by unlit
candles. Sunlight streams through her open window. It is her
hand he is holding to his face. The rest of her is sitting
under the sheet, covered head propped against the headboard.

Trevor drops her hand and it falls lifelessly to the bed
beside him. Breathing quickening he reaches up to the black
silk sheet covering her head. He yanks it back and covers his
mouth in horror.

She's been bound to the bed and gagged with a white cloth
that is soaked with blood. A deep vertical incision has been
made in her neck, collarbone to chin and her tongue is pulled
through the wound so it sticks out the bottom of her jaw. And
that's just for starters.

When Trevor looks down he gags when he sees her ribcage has
been opened like a set of French doors and her insides
sitting in her lap.

The coup de grace? Trevor now sees he is covered with blood.
<b>HERS.
</b>
<b>INT. TREVOR'S APT., BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Trevor splashes his face with cold water, trying to get his
composure back. He stares at the water rushing down the drain
for a moment. His breathing stabilizes He finally looks up at
his reflection in the mirror...

... to see PINHEAD staring back at him.

Trevor jolts backward in shock and does a double take. It's
him now, looking completely unhinged.

Outside the PHONE RINGS. The answering machine picks up with
a BEEP.

<b>                    LANGE'S VOICE
</b>              (from answering machine)
          This is Lange. We need to talk as soon as

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Cleaned up now Trevor carefully makes his way back to Tawny's
apartment. He tries the door. It's locked. This can't be
right. He jiggles the door knob violently, then finally KICKS
the door.

Suddenly-

-TAWNY answers the door, looking utterly pissed off. Though
still in Goth mode, she's dressed much more conservatively
now.

<b>                       TAWNY

</b>                 (utterly shocked)
<b>             WHAT?!
</b>
A VERY DEEP VOICE comes from somewhere behind her.

<b>                       VOICE
</b>             Who the fuck is that?

<b>                       TAWNY

Tawny looks aghast.

Suddenly an enormous BRUTE of a MAN, wide as he is tall
ENTERS the doorway. He's wearing a black tee, black jeans
and, Trevor can't help notice, black nail polish... on
fingers and toes. Obviously Tawny's significant other.

<b>                    BRUTE

<b>                    TREVOR

Brute takes a sideward step through the doorway, forcing
Trevor back two steps.

</b>          You know Tawny, you better know me, pal.

<b>                    TREVOR

          mistaken... I'll see you later.

<b>                    BRUTE
</b>          Much.

Trevor turns and hurries off. Brute turns to Tawny who shrugs
and makes a twirly motion at her temple. The two go back into
her apartment.

<b>INT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY

Trevor paces in his apartment telephone to his ear. He lets
out a heavy breath and looks at his watch. Finally:

<b>                    OPERATOR (V.O.)
</b>          City police main switchboard how may I

</b>


<b>INT. BUS - DAY
</b>
Trevor sits at the front of the bus agitated. He folds and
unfolds Detective Lange's business card in his hands like
some frustrated Origami artist.

The SIREN from a passing ambulance drills his ears. The
irritating sound eventually fades away but the pain in his
head is still there.

The BONGING of a distant cathedral's bell makes him pause. He
looks around.

Toward the rear and sees a familiar old lady knitting a
baby's bootie. He looks again. The bootie is bright red and
dripping... blood? Trevor follows the strand of bright red
wool down to their source:

A DYING GOAT laying under the seat. It's insides have been
ripped out. Its veins and tendons are serving as the old
lady's yarn.

Trevor's eyes bolt back up to the old woman. She continues
HUMMING sweetly, her lap speckled with goat's blood. Trevor
pulls the wire and an OBNOXIOUS BUZZING goes off. Trevor
hurries up to the bus driver as the bus pulls over.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Just open the doors I'll jump off.

<b>                    BUS DRIVER
</b>          Not while the bus is moving, sir.

Trevor clutches his head in pain and waits for the bus to
stop. The doors open. He jumps off, knees nearly buckling
from the pain. He looks up as the bus speeds off.

IN THE REAR WINDOW the little black girl seen earlier pops
up. She's holding her little doll. She pushes a clothespin
into its head. Blood drips from the puncture. At the same
time Trevor feels an incredible pain sear through his head.
He squints at the bus again. The little girl is gone.

<b>INT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Lange is at his desk eating a sandwich. Trevor comes in
angrier than a hornet in a beehive.

his face.

<b>INT. LARRY ELLIS' OFFICE - DAY
</b>
LARRY ELLIS is a somber but handsome young attorney. At
present he at his desk poring through several books on child
custody law. He makes notes on a pad beside him as he talks.

<b>                       LARRY
</b>                 (not looking up)
             Basically they know where your wife's
             body is and they're not telling you as a
             tactic to get you to confess? Yet neither
             of them has come out and told you that
             you're a suspect. Is that what you're
             trying to say?

Trevor sits on the other side of the humongous office in a
chair so big it practically swallows him whole.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Look Larry I know you never thought too
             much of me. And I know this all sounds a

<b>                       LARRY

             mindgames with me. I think they got a
             hold of my e-mail address at work too.

Larry is not buying this for a nanosecond. He trims some
brown leaves off a small plant as he speaks.

             And as far as hiding a body goes? I find

             cops would keep a victim's remains hidden
             simply to get someone to confess. It's

<b>INT. CAB - DAY

Trevor hands some money to the CABBIE up front.

the bridge looking down at the water below.

<b>EXT. BELOW BRIDGE - DAY
</b>
Police tape FLAPS between the trees. Other than that there is
no sign of an investigation. Trevor walks out of the woods on
the shore, through the police tape and to the water's edge.

He begins to walk the shore looking out at the still water.
He scans the area where the water meets the land, trying to
remember.

Something on the surface few feet away catches his eye. It's
a rock sticking up. No it's something else. Trevor walks
right up to the water and puts his feet on a couple of large
rocks breaking the surface. He bends down and looks at...

THE CORNER OF A BLACK CUBE. He quickly reaches down, tries to
pick it up. It seems to be stuck just below the surface.
Trevor pulls harder and finally it gives. Trevor slowly lifts
the black cube out of the water and GASPS when he sees-

<b>-A WHITE WATERLOGGED HAND CLUTCHING IT FROM BELOW!
</b>
Trevor GASPS and lets go. And just as the cube (along with
its owner) SPLASH under the surface-

-ANOTHER WHITE HAND breaks the surface grabbing Trevor's
wrist!

As Trevor Struggles he looks up to see the dark figure
standing above him holding a rock over his head. Just as he
swings down towards Trevors head-

                                                smash cut to:

gotten done taking his pulse.

<b>                    ALLISON
</b>          Jesus I wish you would stop doing that.

Trevor looks down at himself. He's on an examination table in
his normal clothes not a hospital johnnie. That's a good
sign.

<b>                       TREVOR

</b>             Okay. What we're going to do is up the

             hallucinatory seizures you've been
             having. The extra Topomax won't interfere

             Really? Does it affect the memory?

Allison looks concerned. Then her features soften.

<b>                       ALLISON
</b>             You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding.
             You keep coming back to your corner for a
             quick fix up then go right back out into
             the ring for another round.

</b>             Some call it resilience. Others,
             stupidity.

Allison lets a lapse in the conversation last too long. That
look of concern returns as she lingers on his face. She's
trying to say something.

Allison finishes writing a few notes, and Trevors rolls down
his sleves. He's intrigued.

conceal a feeling of dread.

stands up looking over his cubicle and sees DET. GIVENS

             into the airport and decide right then
             and there.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             Yeah? You and who else?

<b>                       BRET
</b>             Someone special.

Bret throws a dart with extra mph. It misses the board
entirely and hits the wall. Trevor winces in pain suddenly.
He touches his head and looks at his fingers. Fresh blood.

<b>FLASHBACK
</b>
Trevor in the car in the water. Thrashing about, he bleeding
from his head in the flashback as well. Where's Kristy? He
looks in the passenger seat. She's gone.

Trevor takes the cube from the man with the ring. He fumbles
with the puzzle box in the darkness.

CU box.   It starts to move.

Trevor driving with Kristy, She's going down on him while
he's driving.


<b>                      KIRSTY
</b>             Okay pull over.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>                 (looking at his watch)
             But... I thought...

Trevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>                 (through clenched teeth)
<b>             PULL OVER NOW.
</b>
The car comes to a stop.

Trevor gets the goods while he watches himself in the rear
view mirror.

Someone approaches. Trevor zips up, pulls Kristy up out of
his lap. Its a cenobite.

Trevor screams and opens the door of the car to make a
frantic exit. He dive out onto the pavement and looks back.
All is quiet. He's alone a quiet road.

He stands up and into an eerie world of slow motion . Trevor
looks up the road and back to find-

A beautiful vision of Allison walking toward him. Walking
gracefully, she approaches Trevor. Raises her hand to his
face. Trevor smiles, then slowly looks back towards the car.

Inside the car he see's Kristy playing with the puzzle box.
Trevors calls out to her.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Kristy noooo!

And he makes a move toward the car, as the box comes to life.
This stops Trevor in his tracks, and he looks toward Allison.
Who is now PINHEAD.

<b>                    PINHEAD
</b>          There is no reprieve for you. Not even in
          her. She's only a vision I'm afraid.

Tervors looks dumbfounded.

                    PINHEAD (cont'd)

           The truth hurts doesn't it?

<b>END FLASHBACK
</b>
<b>INT. PUB - DAY
</b>
Trevor raises his head from the bar. The beers are there but
Bret is gone. Trevors stares at himself in the mirror
opposite the bar. He looks like shit. He thinks hard about
the flashback.

Out the door he goes.

<b>EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT
</b>
-Trevor's holding the phone up to his ear agitated beyond
belief. He'd pace if he could. Instead he just fumes.

<b>                       TREVOR

             out of that place five times in the last
             month...! Well good day to you too
             asshole!

-CLOSE UP on Trevor's hand searching through the D's in the
white pages. He slams the book shut in frustration.

-He's on the phone again.

<b>                       TREVOR (CONT'D)

             H-hello?

Trevor SLAMS the phone down and touches his head again. He
looks at his hand. The blood is gone. But the headache is
back. Its crippling at this point. He's at his wits end. He
reaches into his pocket and finds Pages card. Maybe as a last
resort?

THE PHONE RINGS. IT RINGS AGAIN. Trevor presses his palm
against his eye. Trevor picks up the phone.

<b>EXT. SAGE'S BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor is out of breath as he walks up to the last resort.
The entrance to Sage's building. The front door is locked. He
presses a three digit code on the alarm box. RING. RING. The
phone picks up. He's deperate.

<b>                    SAGE'S VOICE

<b>INT. SAGE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor's head hits the pillow on the acupuncture table.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          The feeling is very distinct. It's like
          somebody stuck a shard of glass through
          my eye and it's embedded halfway into my
          brain.

Sage nods, patient look on her face.

<b>                    SAGE
</b>          Trevor your body has been completely
          healed. All the nerve endings have

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.

<b>                    SAGE
</b>          You are physically better. It's your soul

Sage grabs a bunch of needles from the table.

<b>                    SAGE (CONT'D)
</b>          My teacher told me once there's a
          puncture point on your body that can lock
          your soul within it, even after you're
          dead. So that when you die you're trapped
          inside your body, watching it corrode for

             process. That's what we need to do now.
             Heal your soul. And to do that I you have

             hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I

Trevor closes his eyes

<b>A MONTAGE

of Sage dimming the lights so that the room is nice and
dark... placing needles into Trevor's body... his
shoulders... his chest... his neck... his legs... his face...

Trevor finally opens his eyes to find...

She holds up a small chunk of ice and begins rubbing it on
Trevor's chest. He catches his breath at the cold and begins
to shiver.

<b>INT. CAR - DAY

Trevor wakes up shivering. He is in the passenger seat, head
resting against a baby blanket. A hand touches his...

"Honey what's wrong? Honey?"

<b>INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

Trevor's eye rivet open again. A PARAMEDIC is snapping his
fingers in front of them. Another paramedic is readying a
hypodermic.

<b>                       PARAMEDIC
</b>             Can you hear me? Just nod.

<b>                       PARAMEDIC (CONT'D)
</b>             You know what day it is?

down Dr. Ambrose.

Dressed in janitorial garb, Trevor bursts open the stairwell
door and comes out on the roof.

An OLD MAN in a johnnie is sitting in one of the chairs not
too far away. An oxygen tube trails from his nose to an
oxygen tank at his feet.

The old man lights a fresh cigarette with the one he's just
finished.

Trevor turns to go back and THERE'S ALLISON standing in the
doorway.

<b>INT. BUS - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor sits at the front of an empty bus rubbing his head. He
stares at the spot where the creepy old lady knitting the
baby's bootie used to sit. He looks under the seat. There is
nothing there.

The HYDRAULICS HISS as the bus comes to a stop.

<b>                    BUS DRIVER
</b>          This is it mister.

Trevor gets up and hurries off giving the driver a cursory
glance. The driver doesn't look at Trevor as he speaks.

Trevor EXITS the bus.

<b>EXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT

Trevor steps out of the bus and faces the ROMAN CATHOLIC
CATHEDRAL. He ascends the steps.

<b>INT. CONFESSIONAL - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor sits in the booth across from the tiny screen, behind
which is a VERY TIRED PRIEST who is still in his pajamas.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          I don't know what I'm doing here. I'm not
          even Catholic. I just had to tell
          somebody. It's like, ever since my wife
          died I don't know what I've actually done
          or what I've imagined. But I do know if
          one tenth of what's happening to me is
          reality... I've done some really awful
          things in my life. Things that I've... I
          guess I've blocked out...

<b>                    PRIEST
</b>          What things do you think you've done?

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>          Wow. Let's see. So many sins so little
          time. For starters I was responsible for
          the death my wife who by the way was
          carrying my unborn child. That was so I
          could collect her eight million dollar
          estate. I think I killed several women I
          was having mindless sex with behind her
          back.

             But I did those murders just for the hell

             kind of deal with the devil and now he's
             come to collect my soul. Only he's
             decided to mess with my head first. How

<b>                       PRIEST

             are very distraught over your wife's
             death and rightfully so. You did the
             right thing by confessing to me here
             tonight. And you should keep praying for
             the wisdom that will set your soul at
             ease. That being said, you are still in a
             highly emotional state right now. It
             might do you some good to get some
             professional help. Confess to them the
             way you confessed to me. In time you'll
             probably find that the real killer has
             already been caught. Or better yet...
             that these murders never happened at all.

             Maybe this will make things easier to
             understand. A man goes to sleep every
             night and has recurring dream that he's a
             butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if
             he might actually be a butterfly who
             dreams he's a man. And at the end of the
             day does it even matter? All these events

The Priest begins to chuckle ominously.

Resisting the urge to scream Trevor bolts out of the
confessional...

<b>INT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor rushes out of the confessional. THE CATHEDRAL BELL
begins to CLANG. Eardrums getting battered by the RINGING
Trevor blocks his ears and rushes toward the exit-

-coming face to face with a gargoyle blocking his path.

over the bell.

Pinhead opens his cloak revealing the darkness within. To
Trevor's shock his sucked right into this void inside
Pinhead.

<b>INT. CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH, BULLPEN - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor is thrust into the interior of his office building.
Everyone's gone for the day. The only light is coming in from
streetlights outside. Trevor races past the cubicles running
out into a hallway.

He looks down one end then the other... where he sees an
office light is on. He cautiously approaches the office.

He looks inside.

<b>INT. GWEN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Gwen's hacked up body is strewn about the office. Her arms
are atop the filing cabinet. Legs under her desk. Ass on the
copier.

Trevor hears someone coming. He looks down the hall to see A
FLASHLIGHT BEAM TURN THE CORNER, blinding him. It's bearer
begins running toward Trevor.

Trevor bolts the other direction heading for the exit. He
pushes the door open and slams it behind him only he's not
still outside yet...

<b>INT. TAWNY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Tawny lies on the bed, dead, tongue sticking out of her neck,
ribcage violated.

Trevor hears someone coming toward the bedroom can see the
flashlight beam jittering as its bearer approaches.

Trevor rushes toward the window, opens it and leaps out onto
the fire escape.

<b>EXT. APT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor's about to climb down the fire escape when he is
bathed in the flashlight's beam from inside. Trevor looks
down and sees a garbage dumpster full of trash bags below. He
jumps.

Trevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster. He
climbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can. He races
down the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same
time.

Hearing footsteps from behind Trevor turns to see:

The Stranger in the Window not half a block behind Trevor,
keeping Trevor's pace. Then... Trevor stops. And turns.

The Stranger stops as well. This has never happened before.
Trevor shouts down the empty street.

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)

His voice echoes off the darkened buildings.

The Stranger stands there. Trevor begins walking toward him,
blood in his eyes. The Stranger backs away.

Trevor bolts into a run and the Stranger takes off running

The stranger darts into an alley.

Trevor runs into the alley, seeing no signs of the stranger.
The end of the alley is pitch black.

Trevor hears something at the end of the alley. He grabs a

Something GLISTENS in the dark just before the razor sharp

             her. Every single day. While you were out
             fucking your concubines. Every day I felt
             more and more bad for her, man. And hated

Trevor is absolutely speechless.

             I wanted to kill you. Even before that
             little accident I decided to do it on the
             day we'd set aside for her.

Bret presses the blade against Trevor's neck a little harder,
drawing a rivulet of blood.

<b>                       BRET (CONT'D)
</b>             But now that ain't gonna happen either. I
             fell in love with Kirsty Trevor. The day
             she died it was like my soul had been
             ripped from my body. Not just because I
             lost someone I loved. It's because the
             child inside her... was mine.

Bret then puts the knife to his neck.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>             No!

Bret drags the knife across his own jugulars slicing them
open. Blood pours out of his smiling mouth. Then something
really weird happens. Cuts begin to open up all over Bret's
face and his hands. Blood pouring to the ground in buckets.

Bret lifelessly falls into the pool of blood... Before he can
process what's just happened, Trevor hears a NOISE behind him
and turns to see... several of those slithering sewer
monsters coming toward him, surrounding him.

And behind them, SEVERAL SILHOUETTED FIGURES walking slowly
toward him. We don't need three guesses to figure out who
they are... CENOBITES.

Panicking Trevor reaches down and grabs the knife out of
Bret's hand and readies himself for the inevitable attack
when-

-the BLINDING LIGHT FROM A POLICE car illuminates the alley.
First Trevor notices the sewer monsters are gone.

<b>INT. POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor's nose has been bleeding. His eye is black and blue
his lip cut. Trevor looks out the window. The streets are
deserted, foreign.

Trevor looks at the rear view mirror. The cop staring back at
him averts his gaze. Trevor thinks he sees something crawl
into the cop's eye.

Lange sits next to the cop, staring back at Trevor. He takes
out his antihistamine and sprays some up his nose.

<b>INT. POLICE STATION LOBBY - NIGHT

The doors burst open and the two cops, Lange escorts Trevor

The lobby is entirely deserted. Trevor looks around. There
are cups of coffee sitting on desks, jackets thrown over
backs of chairs. Signs of a recently bustling workplace that
has vacated.

strapped to some odd looking electrical contraption.

Trevor looking in and SLAMS the door shut.

The trio comes to the line up room.

<b>INT. LINE UP ANTEROOM - NIGHT

Trevor is shoved into the cramped booth-like room with four
other strange looking MEN who all stare at him. Silence for a

opens.

The door to the room opens again and Trevor turns, leading
the other men back through the anteroom.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
The cops hustle Trevor out into the hallway. The next door
down opens and out come two more detectives and... TAWNY'S
BOYFRIEND, the brute, looking fit to be tied. He sees Trevor
and fills with rage.

<b>                       BRUTE
</b>             I hope they fry your ass mutherfucker!

He lunges at Trevor. It takes the detectives he's with and
two more cops to keep him from pummeling Trevor. As Trevor's
lead away the brute begins to sob uncontrollably.

Lange stands, squirting antihistamine in his nose. He nods at
Trevor and WALKS OUT. No sooner has the door closed when it
opens again and Givens walks IN. Givens gets right in
Trevor's face.

little insanely.

<b>INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Still handcuffed Trevor is escorted toward the detention area
by the cops in the sunglasses. He's silently praying he'll
wake up from this one somehow. No such luck. Trevor and the
cops round a corner and there's Lange running up to them.

             finally found the body. Just need you to
             ID it for us.

             yards from where the car had landed. Like
             somebody put it there while we weren't
             looking.

The elevator doors open and they get in.

<b>INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
It's a long ride down. Nobody speaks.

Trevor looks at the cops in the sunglasses. One of them takes
his pair off. His eye sockets are empty. We can see brain.

The cop cleans his shades then his mouth smiles at Trevor
before he puts the sunglasses back on.

Finally the doors open. Lange unlocks Trevor's handcuffs and
the cops push him out the door into a dark corridor.

<b>INT. DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>
Trevor looks back to see Lange and the cops staring back at
him.

<b>                       LANGE
</b>             Just keep walking Trevor. You can't miss
             it.

One of the cops waves bye-bye to him. And with that the
elevator doors shut.

Trevor turns around and faces the long corridor. He begins
his hike towards its end where an ominous set of double doors
awaits.

He arrives at them and pushes them open.

<b>INT. MORGUE - NIGHT
</b>
As soon as the doors open fluorescent lights flicker overhead
illuminating two walls of metal drawers and between them: a
large slab of marble upon which rests a human form covered
with a sheet. Trevor ENTERS.

He makes his way toward the body and stares at it.

A low WHEEZING noise coming from a dark corner just beyond
the slab distracts him. Trevor looks and freezes when he
sees:

THE GOAT laying on the floor in a pool of blood. It's still
breathing. One of the goat's slatted eyes is staring at
Trevor as if begging for mercy. A STRANGE RIPPING NOISE is
heard. The goat MEWLS in pain then its eye rolls up. Dead.

The animal's body begins to quiver as a tiny wound on its
back widens spitting out streams of blood.

Trevor begins to back away as the wound stretches open,
giving birth to a rising form...

PINHEAD. He rises completely from the goat, stepping out of
the wound. He is red with blood for a second. Then his skin
and robe absorb the blood like a sponge. Pinhead approaches
Trevor blocking him from the body on the slab.

             Like the women you slept with behind your

          good to pass up. A tribute to the
          resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on
          protecting its spawn. The deal we were
          offered was this: three more souls in
          exchange for the life of the unborn child
          inside Kirsty. The three souls had
          already been picked out. Needless to say
          we were very impressed.

The lights dim. Drawers behind Pinhead begin to open. We see
Gwen's body, Tawny's, Sage's, Bonnie's.

The lights flicker overhead, reddening with each strobe.
Hundreds of those little sewer monsters come slithering out

Kirsty gives her late husband a parting glance. Ambrose
covers Trevor's body and looks OFF CAMERA.

          of town. Figures you'd find his body the
          minute I decide to go off somewhere.

<b>                    LANGE
</b>          Well you made it down here that's the
          important part. Thank you for your
          patience Mrs. Gooding.

She nods teary eyed. She slides the paperwork across his desk
and gets up to leave.

<b>                    LANGE (CONT'D)
</b>          One last thing... When they found him he
          was holding something. Not to get too
          graphic but they had to wrench it from
          his hand.

Lange reaches under his desk then stands revealing:

THE CUBE inside a ziploc bag. Lange and Kirsty exchange a
knowing glance.

<b>                    LANGE (CONT'D)
</b>          Figured you might want it.

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>          Of course. That was my... last
          anniversary present to him.

<b>                    LANGE
</b>          A token to remember him by now. Goodbye
          Mrs. Gooding.

She takes the cube.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             Thank you detective.

Lange takes out his nasal sprayer as she walks OUT. She
closes the door behind her and Lange looks up at the closed
door. He sticks the sprayer up his nose.

<b>INT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Kirsty walks toward the exit. On her way she passes a trash
can. She discretely tosses the cube into it and rubs her
hands together.

<b>EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY
</b>
The birds are chirping. The sun is shining. Kirsty Gooding
walks out the door and takes a breath of fresh air. She skips
down the steps of the police station toward the street. She
stops in the middle of the sidewalk looking both ways.

A SHADOW COMES up behind her. It's the STRANGER Trevor had
seen out his window. He grabs her shoulder startling Kirsty.
She turns to see LARRY ELLIS, shit-eating grin on his face.
He's holding an eight month old BABY. The one he was drawing.

<b>                       LARRY
</b>             Looking for someone, Kirsty?

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>                 (taking the baby)
             You bet I was.

Kirsty plants a multitude of smothering kisses on the
laughing child as A NANNY comes up behind Larry pushing a
stroller. Kirsty gently places the baby in it.

<b>                       KIRSTY (CONT'D)
</b>                 (to Nanny)
             Okay we're on our way. Remember her-

<b>                       NANNY
</b>             Lactose intolerance. I've stocked the
             fridge with Lactaid.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             See you in a couple of weeks. You've got
             my cell number right?

The Nanny pushes the stroller away, nodding, waving good-bye.
Larry smiles as he watches the baby go.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                        LARRY
</b>             Daisy is getting so big.
                 (beat)
             I still can't believe HE was her father.

Kirsty smiles to herself.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             Counselor can we not mention HIM anymore.
             Can we just start spending HIS money
             instead.

They walk slowly toward the curb.

<b>                       LARRY
</b>             I've always wanted to go to Madagascar.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             You mean the place with bats?

<b>                       LARRY
</b>             They're called flying lemurs.

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             Yeah that sounds like a real blast...

They put their arms around each other.

                       KIRSTY (cont'd)
             I've been thinking about it. This has to
             have been the best eight months of my
             life.

Larry sees a cab and rushes out to hail it.

<b>                       LARRY (CONT'D)
</b><b>             TAXI!
</b>
Something out the corner of her eye scares Kirsty. She turns
to see Lange standing there.

<b>                       LANGE
</b>             You forgot something.

Lange holds up the cube she tossed out. Kirsty's expression
falls. But... how...?

<b>                       KIRSTY
</b>             Oh. Thank you.

Kirsty takes the cube.



<b>                                                        (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED: (2)
</b>

<b>                    LANGE (CONT'D)
</b>          No Mrs. Gooding.

Lange turns and Kirsty's shock there's Givens' face... on the
back of Lange's head!

<b>                       GIVENS
</b>          Thank YOU.

Givens smiles at her then walks away. She slowly walks toward
the cab where Larry has opened the door for her.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>          After you my dear.

<b>INT. CAB - DAY
</b>
Kirsty slides into the cab looking at the cube in despair.
Larry slides in after her.

<b>                    LARRY
</b>              (to the cabbie)
          Airport please.

He grabs Kirsty's knee. She just stares at the cube.

                       LARRY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
          What's up?

Larry looks down at the cube. It has magically risen from her
palms and begun to rearrange itself in that way we've come to
know and love so well.

The cabbie, looking back at the sight, slowly slides the
window between the driver and passenger compartments shut.

<b>                    KIRSTY
</b>          Time, Larry. Time's up.

<b>EXT. CAB - DAY
</b>
As the cab drives off into traffic we see LIGHT FLICKER from
within it. The cab passes a cathedral. Its BELL BEGINS TO
<b>TOLL.
