Harold Chasen (Bud Cort) is a young man obsessed with death.
He regularly stages elaborate fake suicides, attends funerals, and drives a hearse, all to the chagrin of his socialite mother (Vivian Pickles).
[6]

At another stranger's funeral service, Harold meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman who shares Harold's hobby of attending funerals.
He is entranced by her quirky outlook on life, which is bright and excessively carefree in contrast with his own morbidity.
The pair form a bond, and Maude slowly shows Harold the pleasures of art and music (including how to play banjo), and teaches him how to "[make] the most of his time on earth".
[6] Meanwhile, Harold's mother is determined, against Harold's wishes, to find him a wife to settle down with.
One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed dates by appearing to commit gruesome acts such as self-immolation, self-mutilation, and seppuku.

As they become even closer their friendship soon blossoms into genuine and strong romance, and Harold announces that he will marry Maude, resulting in disgusted outbursts from his family, psychiatrist, and priest.
Maude's 80th birthday arrives, and Harold throws a surprise party for her.
As the couple dances, Maude tells Harold that she "couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell".
Confused, he questions Maude as to her meaning, and she reveals that she has purposely taken an overdose of sleeping pills and will be dead by midnight.
She restates her firm belief that eighty is the proper age to die.

Harold rushes Maude to the hospital, where she is treated unsuccessfully and dies.
In the final sequence, Harold's car is seen going off a seaside cliff, but after the crash, the final shot reveals Harold standing calmly atop the cliff, holding his banjo.
After gazing down at the wreckage, he dances away, picking out on his banjo Cat Stevens' "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out".
