     FADE IN:

1     INT. THE CHASEN'S DEN - DAY

     The CAMERA is at floor level. A young man enters but we
     see only his shoes and the cuffs of his pants. We TRACK
     with him as he walks across the room and stops at a record
     player. Pause. We HEAR a record drop and begin playing
     a light classical melody. The SUPERIMPOSED TITLES BEGIN.
     After a moment the feet move off and we TRACK with them,
     past a low table, and around a couch to the window curtains.
     The feet pause there for a moment. A piece of heavy
     window cord drops INTO FRAME. We FOLLOW as it is dragged
     along to the low table. Then the feet move over to a large
     ornate desk. The cord is pulled up OUT OF FRAME. Pause.
     The feet walk over to a chair by the wall. It is picked
     up, carried to the center of the room, and carefully
     placed. Pause. The feet get up onto the chair and the
     CAMERA RISES to their level. They shuffle about for a
     moment. At an appropriate musical break the CREDITS STOP.
     Suddenly the feet knock over the chair and drop into
     space. They kick about for a bit, then go slack and still.
     The FINAL CREDITS are SUPERED OVER the suspended appendages
     while the music comes to a lilting conclusion. As we HEAR
     the record player turn itself off, the CAMERA BEGINS a
     half circle tour around the hanging feet and stops at the
     heels. Pause. Outside we HEAR a woman's footsteps
     approaching and we change focus as the door to the den
     opens. Through the blurred hanging feet we see a tall,
     middle-aged, fashionably dressed woman enter and we PAN
     with her as she walks to the desk. This is MRS. CHASEN.
     She seems rather tired and preoccupied as she begins to
     remove her long white gloves. Slowly the CAMERA BEGINS a
     vertical rise up the side of the hanging corpse until we
     are watching Mrs. Chasen over his left shoulder. The rope
     and his stretched neck frame the right side of the SCREEN.
     We hold. Mrs. Chasen puts down her gloves and looks up.
     (NOTE: THE ABOVE IS ALL ONE CONTINUOUS SHOT.)

                              CUT TO:


2     INT. DEN - DAY

     CLOSEUP of Mrs. Chasen as she first sees the body. She is
     slightly startled.


3     INT. DEN - MRS. CHASEN'S POV - DAY

     A long shot of the room where HAROLD, a young man of about
     twenty, hangs suspended from the ceiling with the curtain
     rope tied about his grotesquely broken neck.


4     INT. DEN - MEDIUM SHOT - MRS. CHASEN - DAY

     She stares at the body for several beats and then with
     weary exasperation sits down at the desk and dials the
     telephone. As she waits for an answer, she looks up at the
     hanging body.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          I suppose you think this is very
          funny, Harold.


5     CLOSEUP HAROLD

     The rope chokes his throat; his eyes bulge; his tongue
     hangs out.


6     MED. SHOT - MRS. CHASEN

     Her party answers and she speaks into the phone.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Hello. Fay, darling. Be a dear
          and cancel my appointment with
          Rene this afternoon. Yes, I know
          he'll be furious, but I've had
          the most trying day, and with
          guests coming this evening...
          Would you? Oh, that's sweet.
          Tell him I promise to be in
          Tuesday... for a rinse. Thank
          you, Fay. You're a darling. Yes.
          Yes. Bye.

     She replaces the receiver, stands up, takes her purse and
     gloves, and leaves the room, saying:

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Dinner at eight, Harold...

     At the door she stops and turns.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          ... And try to be a little more
          vivacious.


7     CLOSEUP HAROLD

     Quick cut of his ashen face as we HEAR the door close.


8     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

     Mrs. Chasen is seated at the head of the table entertaining
     eight to ten guests.

     They are all in evening clothes and are laughing as Mrs.
     Chasen in a dress of white ostrich feathers continues a
     witty story.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Needless to say, the first time it
          happened I was absolutely abashed.
          I was so shook I needed three
          tranquilizers to calm me down.
          Well, you can imagine. Suicide
          notes all over the house - "Goodbye,"
          "Farewell," "Arrivederci." Other
          children pretend to run away from
          home, but Harold - he's so dramatic.

     Everyone laughs. The CAMERA BEGINS PULLING BACK and
     PANNING past the guests till we come to Harold sitting
     morosely at the other end of the table. He listlessly toys
     with his food as his mother continues.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Of course, Harold's father had a
          similar sense of the absurd. I
          remember once in Paris he stepped
          out for cigarettes and the next I
          hear he's arrested for floating
          nude down the Seine - experimenting
          in river currents with a pair of
          yellow rubber water wings. Well,
          that cost quite a little bit of
          "enfluence" and "d'argent" to
          hush up, I can tell you. Harold,
          dear, stop playing with your food.
          Don't you feel well?

                    HAROLD
               (looks up and
               pauses)
          I have a sore throat.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Well, I want you to go to bed
          directly after dinner. You know
          how susceptible you are to colds.
          Harold has always been a delicate
          child. Even as a baby he seemed
          to be abnormally prone to illness
          - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...


9     CLOSEUP - HAROLD

     He begins eating as his mother goes on.

                    MRS. CHASEN (o.s.)
          I remember when we were in Tokyo
          I had to call my brother Victor
          at the embassy for a doctor. He
          was serving there as Army attaché...

                              FADE OUT.


     FADE IN:

10     INT. MRS. CHASEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Mrs. Chasen sitting before her vanity table, humming to
     herself as she readies herself for bed. She wears a night-
     gown, a cover for her hair, and she has just finished
     putting on several different face creams. She gets up,
     walks over to the bathroom, and opens the door. Blood is
     everywhere -- on the walls, the floor, the mirror - and in
     the tub is Harold, his throat slit and his wrists dripping
     blood onto the razor on the tile floor. The effect is one
     of instant shock. Mrs. Chasen screams and backs up in
     horror. Sobbing hysterically, she clutches her robe about
     her and rushes from the room crying.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Oh! No! Oh! No! I can't stand
          it. My God! This is too much.
          This is too much to bear!...


     The CAMERA WATCHES Mrs. Chasen run off and then swings back
     to Harold in the tub.


11     CLOSEUP - HAROLD

     We hold on his wretched face as his mother's hysterical
     cries are heard in the background. Harold moves his head
     and listens. He breaks into a sly, satisfied grin.


12     INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Harold is lying on a couch, perfectly relaxed. The
     PSYCHIATRIST, less so, is seated by him.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Tell me, Harold, how many of
          these, eh, suicides have you
          performed?

                    HAROLD
               (pause)
          An accurate number would be
          difficult to gauge.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          And why is that?

                    HAROLD
          Well, some worked out better than
          others - some had to be abandoned
          in the planning stages - do you
          include the first time? - then
          there's the question of maiming...

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Just give me a rough estimate.

                    HAROLD
          Well, a rough estimate... I'd say
          fifteen.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Fifteen.

                    HAROLD
          A rough estimate.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          And were they all done for your
          mother's benefit?

                    HAROLD
               (thoughtful pause)
          I wouldn't say "benefit."

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          No, I suppose not. How do you
          feel about your mother?


13     INSERT - STOCK

     A giant steel ball on a demolition crane crashes into a
     brick wall collapsing it with much noise and dust.

                              DISSOLVE TO:


14     EXT. THE CHASEN POOLSIDE - DAY

     Mrs. Chasen decked out in a fashionable black bikini, crazy
     glasses, and an enormous sun hat, walks down the garden
     steps to the pool. Over this and the end of the above we
     HEAR her voice.

                    MRS. CHASEN (v.o.)
          Hello, Fay, darling. Be an
          absolute dear and cancel my
          appointment with Rene this afternoon.
          Oh, I know, but Wednesday morning
          would be so much more convenient.
          Oh, you are an angel. Yes. Yes.
          Bye.

     Mrs. Chasen has now reached the poolside. As she walks
     around it we PAN with her and discover Harold, fully
     clothed, floating face downward on the still surface. Mrs.
     Chasen does not see him and walks into the pool house.


15     INT. POOL HOUSE - DAY

     Mrs. Chasen walks down the steps of the pool house and over
     to the bar. Behind the bar is an underwater viewing
     window into the pool. She stops and looks up through the
     window.


16     MRS. CHASEN'S POV

     Through the window we see Harold, drowned and bug-eyed,
     floating on the surface.


17     MED. SHOT - MRS. CHASEN

     Mrs. Chasen sighs, yanks a cord, and the venetian blinds
     come noisily down cutting off Harold from view.


18     INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Harold is lying on the couch.

                    HAROLD
               (a reasoned
               assessment)
          I don't think I'm getting through
          to Mother like I used to.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Does that worry you?

                    HAROLD
               (pause)
          Yes. It does.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Why?

                    HAROLD
          I put a lot of effort into these
          things.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Ah, yes.

                    HAROLD
          And a lot of time.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          I'm sure. But what else do you
          do with your time? Do you go to
          school?

                    HAROLD
          No.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          What about the draft?

                    HAROLD
          My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor.
          He's in the Army and he fixed it up.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Oh. Well, how do you spend your
          day?

                    HAROLD
          You mean when I'm not working on a...

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Yes. What kind of things do you do?


19     EXT. AUTOMOBILE JUNKYARD - DAY

     Cranes, auto smashers, bulldozers, and mountains of rusting
     cars and other junk. Very noisy and very fast cut. A
     little essay on destructive machinery at work with Harold
     looking on in rapture.


20     INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          I see. Junkyards. What is the
          fascination there?

                    HAROLD
          I don't know.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Is it the machines? The noise?
          The people?

                    HAROLD
          No. It's the junk. I like to
          look at junk.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          What else do you like?

     Harold pauses.


21     INSERT - STOCK

     A giant steel ball crashes into a building. We watch it
     fall noisily into dust and rubble.


22     INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          That's very interesting, Harold,
          and I think very illuminative.
          There seems to be a definite pattern
          emerging.
               (taking copious notes)
          Your fondness for useless machines
          and demolitions seems indicative
          of your present emotional state,
          your self-destructive urges and
          your alienation from the regular
          social interaction. What do you
          think? And of course this pattern
          once isolated can be coped with.
          Recognize the problem and you are
          half way on the road to its
          solution. But tell me, what do
          you do for fun? What activity
          gives you a different sense of
          enjoyment than the others? What
          do you find fulfilling? What
          gives you that certain satisfaction?

                    HAROLD
          I go to funerals.


23     EXT. CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY

     showing a small group of mourners around a grave. A nearby
     bench by a tree is empty. The coffin is slowly being
     lowered into the ground.


24     EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

     CLOSER SHOTS of the mourners sobbing and the priest pray-
     ing. We come to Harold who has a look of gentle fascina-
     tion. The service is concluding. Harold looks up across
     the grave. A hundred yards away on the cemetery bench
     sits an old woman eating a tangerine. This is MAUDE.
     Harold stares at her. She seems to be having some kind of
     happy picnic. She looks over towards him. He quickly
     returns his attention to the burial.


25     EXT. CHASEN HOME - DAY

     Mrs. Chasen opens the front door and is saying farewell to
     two lady friends, the same kind of chic sophisticates as
     she is. Just then a hearse pulls into the driveway,
     passes them, and parks by the garage. The two women are
     somewhat stunned. Harold gets out of the hearse and goes
     into the backyard. The two women look to Mrs. Chasen for
     some explanation. Mrs. Chasen smiles lamely.


26     INT. CHASEN'S DEN - DAY

     Mrs. Chasen is addressing a seated and mute Harold.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Why you purchased that monstrous
          thing is totally beyond me. You
          can have any car you want - a Porsche,
          a Jaguar, a nice little MG roadster
          - but that ugly, black horror is an
          eyesore and an embarrassment.
          Really, Harold, you are no longer
          a child. It's time for you to
          settle down and stop flitting away
          your talents on these amateur
          theatrics - your little
          "divertissements" - no matter how
          psychologically purging they may
          be. I don't know what to do.


27     INSERT - CLOSEUP OF UNCLE VICTOR - LEFT PROFILE

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          I'd put him in the Army, Helen.


28     INT. CHASEN'S DEN - DAY

     Mrs. Chasen continues.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Go have a talk with your Uncle
          Victor. Perhaps he can fathom you.
          After all, he was General Bradley's
          right hand man.


29     INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     UNCLE VICTOR, a bluff, hearty, totally military man, is a
     one star general with an amputated right arm. Harold sits
     before him.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Harold, your mother has briefed me
          on your situation and there is no
          doubt in my mind of the requisite
          necessary action. If it was up to
          me I'd process your file and ship
          you off to boot camp tomorrow.
          Your mother, however, is adamant.
          She does not want you in the Army
          and insists on my holding on to
          your draft records. But what do
          you say, Harold?
               (he begins a
               selling job)
          It's a great life. Action! Adventure!
          Advising. See war - firsthand! Plenty
          of slant-eyed girls. It will make a
          man out of you, Harold. You'll travel
          the world. Put on the uniform and
          take on a man's job. Walk tall! -
          with a glint in your eye, a spring
          in your step, and the knowledge in
          your heart that you are -
               (he gestures to a
               poster of bullet-
               blazing Marines)
          - working for peace, and - are
          serving your country.

     He stops before a poster of Nathan Hale with a noose about
     his neck.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
               (continuing)
          Like Nathan Hale. That's what this
          country needs - more Nathan Hales.

     He pulls his lanyard, activating some weird mechanism which
     snaps up his empty sleeve into a natty salute. A pause.
     The sleeve smartly refolds and he turns to Harold.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
               (softly)
          And, Harold, I think I can see a
          little Nathan Hale in you.


30     INT. CHASEN'S DEN - DAY

     Mrs. Chasen is going out, but she comes in to talk to Harold.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          I only have a few minutes, Harold,
          but I do want to inform you of my
          decision. There is no doubt that
          it is time for you to settle down
          and begin thinking about your
          future. You have led a very
          carefree, idle, happy life up to
          the present - the life of a child.
          But it is time now to put away
          childish things and take on adult
          responsibilities. We would all
          like to sail through life with
          no thought of tomorrow. But that
          cannot be. We have our duty. Our
          obligations. Our principles. In
          short, Harold, I think it is time
          you got married.


31      INT. CHURCH - DAY

     PAN DOWN from the stained glass window of a church. The
     organ is playing softly. The PRIEST, a silver haired man
     rapidly approaching dotage, is in the pulpit.

                    PRIEST
          And so dear brethren, let us pray
          to the Lord, King of Glory, that
          He may bless and deliver all souls
          of the faithful departed from the
          pains of hell and the bottomless
          pit, deliver them from the lion's
          mouth and the darkness therein,
          but rather bring them to the bliss
          of heaven, the holy light, and
          eternal rest.

     During the above we PULL BACK to reveal an open coffin and
     a church spreckled with a few mourners in black. Con-
     spicuous in an empty pew is Harold.

     The priest goes to the altar and mumbles the dull ritual.
     The small congregation responds. Harold sits quietly
     enjoying it all.

                    VOICE (o.s.)
          Psst!

     Harold, startled, looks over to his left.


32     HAROLD'S POV

     A pixiesque old woman, somewhat eccentrically dressed, is
     smiling at him. It is Maude again.


33     CLOSEUP HAROLD

     Frowning slightly, Harold turns back front.

                    MAUDE
          Psst.

     Harold looks back.


34     HAROLD'S POV

     Maude gives him a coquettish wink.


35     CLOSEUP HAROLD

     Harold is slightly shocked. He returns his attention to
     the altar.


36     MED. SHOT - PRIEST

     The priest moans on.


37     MED. SHOT - HAROLD

     Harold sits attentively.

                    VOICE (o.s.)
          Psst!

     Harold, startled, looks over his right shoulder and sees
     Maude kneeling in the pew behind him. She speaks with a
     slight British/European accent.

                    MAUDE
          Like some licorice?

     She offers some.

                    HAROLD
          Eh, no. Thank you.

                    MAUDE
          You're welcome.
               (gesturing to
               the deceased)
          Did you know him?

                    HAROLD
          Eh, no.

                    MAUDE
          Me neither. I heard he was eighty
          years old. I'll be eighty next
          week. A good time to move on,
          don't you think?

                    HAROLD
               (trying to
               ignore her)
          I don't know.

                    MAUDE
          I mean, seventy-five is too early,
          but at eighty-five, well, you're
          just marking time and you may as
          well look over the horizon.


38     MED. SHOT - ALTAR

     The priest finishes the prayers and exits. The casket is
     closed and the pallbearers take it out the side door. The
     few mourners follow.

     Maude is now sitting next to Harold.

                    MAUDE
          I'll never understand this mania
          for black. I mean no one sends
          black flowers, do they? Black
          flowers are dead flowers and who
          would send black flowers to a
          funeral? It's change!
               (fluttery laugh)
          How absurd.

     Her eye catches a dour portrait of the Blessed Virgin and
     Child on a pillar. With one swoop she takes a felt pen
     from Harold's breast pocket and draws on the painting a
     bright and cheery smile.

     Harold is stunned.

                    MAUDE
          There, that's better. They never
          give the poor thing a chance to
          laugh. Heaven knows she has a lot
          to be happy about. In fact...
               (she looks thought-
               fully around the
               church)
          - they all have a lot to be happy
          about. Excuse me.


40     INSERTS

     The faces of four somber statue saints.

                    MAUDE (v.o.)
          An unhappy saint is a contradiction
          in terms.


41     INT. AT THE CHURCH DOOR

     An anxious Harold stands while Maude puts the top back on
     his pen. Maude smiles and gestures at a crucifix.

                    MAUDE
          And why do they keep on about
          that? You'd think no one ever
          read the end of the story.

     She exits grandly with Harold's pen. Harold follows.


42     INSERTS

     FOUR QUICK CUTS of the saints' faces. They all have
     delightfully ridiculous smiles drawn on their faces.


43     CLOSEUP - PRIEST

     In the same rhythm we have a FIFTH CUT - the returning
     priest who is dropped dead by what he sees.

44      EXT. CHURCH STEPS - DAY

                    MAUDE
          It's a question of emphasis, you
          might say. Accentuate the positive,
          so to speak.

                    HAROLD
          Eh, could I have my pen back now,
          please?

                    MAUDE
          Oh, of course. What is your name?

                    HAROLD
          Harold Chasen.

                    MAUDE
          How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie
          Chardin, but you may call me Maude.

                    HAROLD
          Nice to meet you.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, thank you. I think we shall
          be great friends, don't you?

     Maude takes a great ring of keys from her purse, selects
     one of them, and opens the door of the car at the curb.

                    MAUDE
          Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?

                    HAROLD
               (quickly)
          No, thank you. I have my car.

                    MAUDE
          Well then, I must be off.
               (she gets in)
          We shall have to meet again.

     She revs up the motor and looks over at Harold.

                    MAUDE
          Do you dance?

                    HAROLD
          What?

                    MAUDE
          Do you sing and dance?

                    HAROLD
          Eh, no.

                    MAUDE
          No.
               (she smiles)
          I thought not.

     With a great screech of burning rubber Maude drives down
     the street just as the priest comes up to Harold. They
     both watch her squeal around the corner.

                    PRIEST
               (totally mystified)
          That woman... She took my car.


45     INT. CHASEN DEN - DAY

     Harold is sitting in a chair. His mother enters and sits
     down at the desk.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          I have here, Harold, the forms sent
          out by the National Computer Dating
          Service. It seems to me that as
          you do not get along with the
          daughters of my friends this is the
          best way for you to find a
          prospective wife.

     Harold starts to say something.

                    MRS. CHASEN
               (continuing)
          Please, Harold, we have a lot to
          do and I have to be at the
          hairdresser's at three.
               (she looks over
               the papers)
          The Computer Dating Service
          offers you at least three dates
          on the initial investment. They
          screen out the fat and ugly so
          it is obviously a firm of high
          standards. I'm sure they can
          find you at least one girl who
          is compatible. Now first, here
          is the personality interview which
          you are to fill out and return.
          There are fifty questions with
          five possible responses to check...
          "A - Absolutely Yes, B - Yes,
          C - Not sure, D - No, E -
          Absolutely No." Are you ready,
          Harold?

          The first question is "Are you
          uncomfortable meeting new people?"
          Well, I think that's a "yes."
          Don't you agree, Harold? Even an
          "Absolutely yes." We'll put down
          "A" on that. Now, number two.
          "Do you believe it is acceptable
          for women to initiate dates with
          men?" Well, absolutely. Mark "A"
          on that. "Three - Should sex
          education be taught outside the
          home?" I would say no, wouldn't
          you, Harold? Give a "D" there.

     Mrs. Chasen continues filling out Harold's questionnaire
     without hardly ever even looking over for his reaction.
     He sits there, watching.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          "Four - Do you often invite friends
          to your home?" Now, you never do,
          Harold. Absolutely no. "Five -
          Do you enjoy participating in clubs
          and social organizations?" You
          don't, do you? Absolutely no.
          "Six - Do you enjoy spending a lot
          of time by yourself?" Absolutely
          yes. Mark "A." "Seven - Should
          women run for President of the
          United States?" I don't see why
          not. Absolutely yes. "Eight -
          Do you have ups and downs without
          obvious reason?" You do, don't
          you, Harold? Absolutely yes.
          "Nine - Do you remember jokes and
          take pleasure in relating them to
          others?" You don't, do you, Harold?
          Absolutely no. "Ten - Do you
          often get the feeling that perhaps
          life isn't worth living?" Hmm.
          What do you think, Harold?

     Harold looks blankly back at his mother.

                    MRS. CHASEN
               (continuing)
          "A"? "B"? We'll put down "C" -
          "Not sure." "Eleven - Is the
          subject of sex being over-exploited
          by our mass media?" That would
          have to be "Yes," wouldn't it?
          "Twelve - Do you think judges favor
          some lawyers?" Yes, I suppose they
          do. "Thirteen - ....

     Harold sits passively in his chair. Slowly he draws a
     revolver from his pocket. As his mother rattles on he very
     deliberately loads the bullets one by one into the chamber.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          ... Is it difficult for you to
          accept criticism?" Nooo. We'll
          mark "D." "Fourteen - Do you
          sometimes have headaches or back
          aches after a difficult day?" Yes,
          I do indeed. "Fifteen - Do you go
          to sleep easily?" I'd say so.
          "Sixteen - Do you believe in capital
          punishment for murder?" Oh, yes.
          "Seventeen - Do you believe churches
          have a strong influence to upgrade
          the general morality?" - yes, again.
          "Eighteen - In your opinion are
          social affairs usually a waste of
          time?" Heavens, no! "Nineteen -
          Can God influence our lives?" Yes.
          Absolutely yes. "Twenty - Have you
          ever crossed the street to avoid
          meeting someone?" Well, I'm sure
          you have, haven't you, Harold?
          "Twenty-one - Would you prefer to
          be with a group of people rather
          than alone?" That's you, Harold.
          "Twenty-two - Is it acceptable for
          a schoolteacher to smoke or drink
          in public?" Well, with reservation.
          Mark "B." "Twenty-three..."

     Having finished loading the gun, Harold cocks it and,
     looking at his mother, slowly lifts it up.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          ... Does your personal religion
          or philosophy include a life after
          death?" Oh, yes, indeed. That's
          "Absolutely." "Twenty-four - Did
          you enjoy life when you were a
          child?" Oh, yes. You were a
          wonderful baby, Harold. "Twenty-
          five..."

     The gun is pointing at his mother. Slowly Harold turns it
     till it is pointing directly into his face. He pulls the
     trigger. A burst of blood and a loud EXPLOSION.

     He and the chair are blown over backward OUT OF FRAME.
     SOUNDS of crashing furniture and breaking china. Mrs.
     Chasen remains impervious to it all.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          ... "Do you think the sexual
          revolution has gone too far?" It
          certainly seems to have. "Twenty-
          six...

     The last crash - a tottering lamp falls. Mrs. Chasen looks
     up peeved.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Harold! Please!
               (beat)
          "Should evolution be taught in our
          public schools?!"


46     EXT. GRAVEYARD DRIVE - DAY

     A long line of black limousines follow a hearse in a funeral
     procession. At the tag of the line is another hearse --
     Harold's.


47     EXT. AT THE GRAVESITE - DAY

     PAN around the sorrowing faces. STOP at Harold. CONTINUE
     past him 180 degrees and STOP at Maude. She is directly
     across the open grave from Harold. She tries to get his
     attention.

                    MAUDE
          Psst! Psst!

     Harold looks up. Maude gives him a friendly wink, and a
     kind of "How do you do?" smile. Harold is horrified. The
     priest looks up from his praying. It is the same priest
     as before. He looks over at Maude. Maude suddenly over-
     come by sorrow backs away from the people.

                              DISSOLVE TO:


48     EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY

     Harold is walking by the road. The funeral in the back-
     ground is over but we see the priest coming toward him.

                    PRIEST
          Eh, my boy. A moment, please.
          Who was that old lady waving to
          you earlier?

     Just then Maude drives up in Harold's hearse. She stops.

                    MAUDE
          Hello, Harold. Can I give you a
          lift?

     Harold is surprised. He goes over to the hearse.

                    PRIEST
          Ah! There you are, madam. Were
          not you the lady who drove my car
          off yesterday?

                    MAUDE
          Was that the one with the St.
          Christopher medal on the dashboard?

                    PRIEST
          Yes.

                    MAUDE
          Then I suppose it was me. Get in,
          Harold.

     Harold decides not to argue. He gets in.

                    PRIEST
          Were you also the one who painted
          the statues?

                    MAUDE
               (brightly)
          Oh, yes. How did you like that?

                    PRIEST
          Well, I didn't.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, don't be too discouraged.
          For aesthetic appreciation -
          always a little time.

                    PRIEST
          But wait...

     Maude waves and drives off with her usual screeching start.


49     INT. HAROLD'S HEARSE - DAY

     Harold is sitting in the front seat, wanting to say some-
     thing but also trying to hold on. Maude drives like a
     racing car driver, fast and risky, but with complete self-
     assurance.

                    MAUDE
          What a delight it is, Harold, to
          bump into you again. I knew we
          were going to be good friends the
          moment I saw you. You go to
          funerals often, don't you?

     Harold is more intent on Maude's maneuvering of his car
     than on conversation.

                    HAROLD
          Yes.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, so do I. They're such fun,
          aren't they? It's all change.
          All revolving. Burials and births.
          The end to the beginning and the
          beginning to the end -
               (she makes a screeching left-
               hand turn)
          - the great circle of life. My,
          this old thing handles well. Ever
          drive a hearse, Harold?

                    HAROLD
               (petrified)
          Yes.

                    MAUDE
          Well, it's a new experience for me.
               (she makes a screech-
               ing right-hand turn)
          Good on curves. Shall I take you
          home, Harold?

                    HAROLD
               (managing to speak)
          But this is my car.

                    MAUDE
          Your hearse?

                    HAROLD
          Yearse!

                    MAUDE
          Oh.


50     EXT. ROADSIDE - LONG SHOT - DAY

     of the car coming to a screeching halt.


51     INT. CAR - DAY

                    MAUDE
               (brightly)
          Then you shall take me home.


52     INT. CAR - DAY

     SAME ANGLE as 49 but this time Harold is driving and Maude
     sits beside him.

                    MAUDE
          And so just before he left for the
          monastery in Tibet, Big Sweeney
          gave me his keys.

     She is showing Harold her ring of car keys.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          Of course, I've had to make some
          additions for the new models, but
          not as many as you might think.
          Once you have your basic set it's
          then only a question of variation.

                    HAROLD
          And you get into any car you want
          and just drive off?

                    MAUDE
          Not any car. I like to keep a
          variety. I'm always looking for
          the new experience, like this one.
          I liked it.

                    HAROLD
          Thank you. But when you take these
          cars don't you think you are
          wronging the owners?

                    MAUDE
          What owners, Harold? We don't
          own anything. It's a transitory
          world. We come on the earth with
          nothing, and we go out with nothing,
          so isn't "ownership" a little
          absurd?

                    HAROLD
          Still, I think you'd upset
          people and I'm not sure that's
          right.

                    MAUDE
          Well, if some people are upset
          because they feel they have a hold
          on some things, then I'm merely
          acting as a gentle reminder - I'm
          sort of breaking it easy -- Here
          today, gone tomorrow, so don't get
          attached to things. Now, with that
          in mind, I'm not against collecting
          stuff...


53     INT. MAUDE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Maude and Harold enter.

                    MAUDE
          ... I've collected quite a lot of
          stuff in my time.

     We see Maude's main room filled with all kinds of eccentric
     memorabilia, from a mounted swordfish to an ivory Buddha.
     It is dominated by a large canopied bed like something from
     a Wagnerian opera. Other features are a large fireplace,
     a baby grand piano, expensive paintings on the walls, a
     tall wooden sculpture, and a Japanese type eating area with
     satin cushions.

                    MAUDE
          It's all memorabilia, but incidental
          and not integral, if you know what
          I mean.

                    HAROLD
               (looks around amazed)
          It's very interesting.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, look! The birds.

     She goes to the window and works a unique pulley device that
     delivers seed to the bird table in the back yard.

                    MAUDE
          This is my daily ritual. I love
          them so much. The only wild life
          I see anymore. Free as a bird!
               (fluttery laugh)
          You know, at one time I used to
          break into pet shops and liberate
          the canaries, but I gave it up
          as an idea before its time. The
          zoos are full and the prisons
          overflowing.

          My, my. How the world so dearly
          loves a cage.
               (she looks out
               another window)
          And there's Madame Arouet,
          cultivating her garden.

     She waves at the black dressed old woman diligently hoeing
     vegetables in the backyard. The old woman does not
     notice Maude.

                    MAUDE
               (sighs)
          She's very sweet, but so old-
          fashioned. Please sit down, Harold.
          I'll put on the kettle and we'll
          have a nice hot cup of tea.

                    HAROLD
          Thank you, but I really have to
          go.

                    MAUDE
          But it's oat straw tea. You've
          never had oat straw tea, have you?

                    HAROLD
          No.

                    MAUDE
          Well then.

     The argument is over.

                    HAROLD
          Thank you, but it's an appointment.
          I really shouldn't miss it.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, at the dentist's?

                    HAROLD
          Sort of.

                    MAUDE
          Well, then, you must come back
          and visit.

                    HAROLD
          All right.

                    MAUDE
           My door is always open.

                    HAROLD
           All right.

                    MAUDE
           Promise?

     He turns at the door and half smiles.

                    HAROLD
           Promise.


54     INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Harold is on the couch. The psychiatrist sits behind him.

                     PSYCHIATRIST
           Harold?

     Harold is day dreaming.

                     PSYCHIATRIST
           Harold?

                    HAROLD
               (comes to)
           Huh?

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          You don't seem to be listening.
          I asked do you have any friends?

                    HAROLD
          No.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          None at all?

                    HAROLD
          Well, maybe one.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Would you care to talk about
          this friend?

                    HAROLD
          No.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          Is this a friend you had when
          you were away at school?

                    HAROLD
           No.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
                (things are
               getting difficult)
           I see.
               (he tries a new
               attack)
          Were you happy at school, Harold?

                    HAROLD
           Yes.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           You liked your teachers?

                    HAROLD
           Yes.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           Your classmates?

                    HAROLD
           Yes.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           Your studies?

                    HAROLD
           Yes.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           Then why did you leave?

                    HAROLD
           I burnt down the Chemistry building.

     The psychiatrist gets up and rather anxiously paces about.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           We are not relating today, Harold.
          I sense a definite resistance.
          A lack of true and helpful
          communication. I find you a very
          interesting case, Harold, but
          this reluctance of yours is
          detrimental to the psycho-analytical
          process, and can only hinder the
          possibility of effective treatment.
          Do you understand?

                    HAROLD
           Yes.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           Very well.
               (he sits)
          Now your mother tells me she is
          arranging several dates for you
          with some young ladies. How do
          you feel about that?


55     STOCK INSERT

     A giant steel ball crashes into a brick wall, demolishing
     it.


56     INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           I see. Tell me, Harold, do you
          remember your father at all?

                    HAROLD
           No.
               (pause)
          I'd have liked to.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           Why?

                    HAROLD
          I'd have liked to talk to him.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           What would you say?

                    HAROLD
                (pause)
           I'd show him my hearse. And my
          room, and stuff.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
           What kind of stuff?

59     INT. HAROLD'S ROOM - NIGHT

     All the lights are on showing a room cluttered with books,
     guns and swords on the walls, small bits of odd machinery,
     a chemistry workbench, a school pennant, some trophies,
     some models, a chess set, etc.

                    HAROLD (v.o.)
          Oh, all my things - incidental but
          not integral, if you know what I
          mean.

     We PAN over individual items - the chemistry set, pool
     floats, a small oxygen cylinder, the rope and body harness
     he used to hang himself in the first scene, a large bottle
     of Max Factor blood, a portrait of Lon Chaney as "The
     Phantom of the Opera."

     We come to a silver serving dish with a large silver cover
     over it. A hand comes into frame and removes the cover.
     On the dish is Harold's severed head. The hands pick up
     the head. We TILT UP and see it is Harold. He takes the
     dummy head over to his dresser, combs the hair and picks
     off the latex blood, and then takes it to the center of the
     room, where a headless dummy sits in a chair. Harold screws
     the head onto the dummy. It doesn't fit very well. He
     fiddles with it a moment but he is not satisfied. He goes
     to his closet and looks into a box of tools and things.
     He takes a meat cleaver out but he is still looking for
     something else. There is a knock on the door and Mrs.
     Chasen in evening clothes enters. Harold turns to come out
     of the closet but he hears his mother addressing the dummy.

                     MRS. CHASEN
           Now listen, Harold, I have here the
          three girls sent out by the Computer
          Dating Service.

     She shuffles through three IBM cards in her hand.

                     MRS. CHASEN
                (continuing)
           I've phoned them up and invited
          each of them to have lunch with
          us before you take them out. The
          first one is coming tomorrow at
          one. Luncheon at two.

     Harold stands with the meat cleaver in his hand behind the
     closet door. He listens blankly.

                    MRS. CHASEN
               (still talking to
               the dummy)
          Now I want you to act like a
          gentleman and make this girl
          feel at home.

          Well, I'm off to the ballet with
          the Fergusons. I only hope they
          can maneuver round that great black
          thing in the driveway.
               (she pauses)
           You look a little pale, Harold.
                (she opens the door)
           You get a good night's sleep. After
          all you want to look your best for
          tomorrow.
               (she exits)

     Harold hears the door shut. He ponders his fate for a
     moment. He leans around the door and looks at the dummy.
     He thinks. He gives it up. He goes back in the closet
     to find whatever he was looking for.


60     INT. CHASEN'S FRONT LOBBY - DAY

      Mrs. Chasen opens the front door, revealing a cute, blond,
     typical American co-ed. This is CANDY GULF.

                    CANDY
          Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen.
          Come in.

     Candy comes in and Mrs. Chasen closes the door.

                     MRS. CHASEN
               (continuing)
           Harold is out in the garden.
          He'll be in in a moment. Let's
          go into the den.


61     INT. CHASEN'S DEN - DAY

     Candy and Mrs. Chasen enter.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          You are at the University, Candy?

                    CANDY
          Yes, I am.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          And what are you studying?

                    CANDY
          Poli. Sci. With a home ec minor.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Eh, Poli Sci?

                     CANDY
           Political Science. It's all about
          what's going on.

     They walk to the window.

                     MRS. CHASEN
           Oh, there's Harold now.

     Candy and Mrs. Chasen look out the French window. They
     wave. Harold waves back and leaves. Candy and Mrs. Chasen
     sit down. Candy faces the window; Mrs. Chasen has her
     back to it.

                     CANDY
           He seems very nice. Is Harold
          interested in, eh, what's going
          on? I think it's such a super
          thing to study. And then, of
          course, I can always fall back
          on home ec.

                     MRS. CHASEN
           Yes, that's good planning. Tell
          me, are you a regular, Candy, in
          this computer club?

     We see out the window that Harold has come back. He carries
     a large can marked Kerosene. Candy sees him but returns
     her attention to answering Mrs. Chasen.

                    CANDY
          Heavens no. I don't have to
          worry about dates. You see,
          the other girls in my sorority,
          well, we decided that somebody
          should try it, so we drew
          straws and I lost.
               (little giggle)
           But I am looking forward to
          meeting Harold.

     She looks beyond Mrs. Chasen, out the window. She is a
     little nonplussed. Harold is pouring the kerosene all over
     himself.

                    MRS. CHASEN
           I think I should mention, Candy,
          that Harold does have his eccentric
          moments.

                     CANDY
                (never let it be
               said that she
               isn't a good sport)
          Oh, yes? Well, that's all right.
          I've got a brother who's a real
          cut-up, too. I'll never forget the
          time we had this old TV set with
          no parts in it. Well, Tommy stuck
          his head behind it and started
          giving a newscast before the whole
          family. We were all hysterical.
          And here's little Tommy pretending
          to be Walter Cronkite.

     She looks back at Harold out the window. He is ablaze.
     Her mouth falls open.

                     MRS. CHASEN
           Yes. I'm sure it must have been
          very funny.

     Candy jumps up, pointing out the window behind Mrs. Chasen.

                     CANDY
           Har -- Haro -- Haroldddd!!!

     Mrs. Chasen rises, slightly disturbed but used to odd
     behavior.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Yes, dear. Here is Harold now.

     Harold enters from the side door.

                    MRS. CHASEN
               (continuing)
           Candy, this is Harold.

     Candy is momentarily stunned. Harold nods his greetings.

                     MRS. CHASEN
           Candy was just telling a funny
          story about Walter Cronkite.

     Candy begins hysterical babbling and collapses.


62     INT. MAUDE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     The front door opens slowly and Harold enters.

                    HAROLD
          Maude. Maude. Anybody home?

     He gets no answer and steps into the room. He looks over
     the fireplace, where a furled umbrella is hung up like a
     rifle. Nearby he sees a glass cabinet full of sea shells
     and glass work. He walks over to a large table and is
     puzzled by the odd-shaped, machine-like boxes on top. He
     looks over at the wood sculpture, a highly polished work
     with very smooth curves and holes. Instinctively he puts
     out his hand to touch it, but decides he shouldn't. He
     walks over to the piano and examines the silver frames
     standing on it. They have no photographs in them and this
     interests him. He goes to the window. Over his shoulder
     we see MADAME AROUET hoeing in her vegetable patch.


63     EXT. THE BACK YARD - DAY

     A MEDIUM SHOT of Madame Arouet. She is dressed in the
     black peasant's dress of Southern France. She is thin and
     wrinkled and wears a large straw sun hat. She is con-
     tinually working. Harold comes up to her.

                    HAROLD
          Excuse me, have you seen Maude?

     Madame Arouet looks up. She doesn't comprehend.

                    HAROLD
          Maude. Do you know where she is?

     Still no understanding.

                    HAROLD
          Maude?

                    MADAME AROUET
          Ah! Maude.

     She points to the building next door.

                    HAROLD
               (nodding)
          Oh, thank you. Thank you very
          much. Merci.

     He goes off toward the building. Madame Arouet continues
     hoeing.


64     CLOSEUP - MADAME AROUET

     She looks up from her work and watches Harold. There is a
     strange sadness in her old weathered face - time lost,
     pleasures past over, the resignation to a lifetime of work.
     She turns back to her garden.


65     INT. GLAUCUS'S STUDIO - DAY

     Harold comes through the door, sees where he is at, and
     becomes embarrassed.

                    HAROLD
          Oh. Excuse me.


66     HAROLD'S POV - AN ARTIST'S STUDIO

     The first thing we notice is the large block of ice in the
     center of the room - seven to eight feet tall - and
     through it, as if looking through the glass on a shower
     door, we can see a naked female body posing as Venus. The
     sculptor, GLAUCUS, a frail, little, white-haired old man,
     dressed in winter clothing, turns from the ice with a
     chisel and hammer in his gloved hand.

                    GLAUCUS
          What do you want?

                    HAROLD
          I'm sorry. I was looking for
          Maude.

     The nude figure behind the ice moves and we see her head
     over the top. It is Maude.

                    MAUDE
          Harold?

                    HAROLD
          Maude???!


67     INT. MAUDE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     Harold sits in a chair, brooding. Maude is in her kitchen
     alcove.

                    MAUDE
          How about some ginger pie?

                    HAROLD
          Eh, fine.

                    MAUDE
          I'll heat some up. My, it's nice
          to see you again, Harold. How's
          your hearse?

                    HAROLD
          Oh, it's fine. Fine.

                    MAUDE
          She seemed yare to me.

     Maude lays out the table. Harold gets up. He has some-
     thing on his mind.

                    HAROLD
               (nonchalantly)
           Do you often model for Glaucus?

                    MAUDE
          Heavens no! I don't have the time.
          But I like to keep in practice
          and poor Glaucus occasionally needs
          his memory refreshed as to the
          contours of the female form.
               (she stops)
          Do you disapprove?

                    HAROLD
          Me! No. Of course not.

                    MAUDE
               (she wants
               the truth)
          Really. Do you think it's wrong?

                    HAROLD
               (thinks, decides,
               and reports his
               conclusion)
          No.
               (he smiles)

                    MAUDE
          Oh, I'm so happy you said that
          because I wanted to show you my
          paintings. This is the "Rape of
          Rome" and, of course, there in
          the corner is quite a graphic
          depiction of Leda and the Swan.

     Harold looks at the corner of the painting and then back at
     Maude.

                    MAUDE
               (coquettishly)
          A self-portrait.
               (she walks on)
          But over here is my favorite. It's
          titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath
          and an Elephant." Do you like it?

                    HAROLD
          Yes. Very much.

                    MAUDE
          It was my last. I then became
          infatuated with these -- my
          "Odorifics."

     She points to the odd-shaped boxes with the tubes and
     handles attached to them.

                    MAUDE
          Give the nose a treat, I thought.
          Have a kind of olfactory banquet!
          So I began first on the easiest -
          roast beef, old books, mown grass,
          then I went on to these -
               (she reads the
               labels on the
               boxes)
          "An Evening at Maxim's." "Mexican
          Farmyard." Here's one you'd like.
          "Snowfall on 42nd Street." Put
          it on.

     She helps him put on the oxygen-type mask.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          Now I'll pump it up...
               (she does so)
          ... and you just turn the handles.
               (he does)
          Okay. What do you smell?

                    HAROLD
          Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...
               (gradually becoming
               more excited)
          ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts!
          ... Snow!

                    MAUDE
          It goes on and on.

                    HAROLD
          That's really great.

     He takes it off.

                    MAUDE
          Thank you. I thought of continuing
          - graduating to the abstract and
          free-smelling - but then I decided
          to switch to the tactile.

     She gestures at the wood sculpture.

                    MAUDE
          What do you think?

                    HAROLD
          Oh. Eh, I like it.

                    MAUDE
          No, you have to touch it.
               (she demonstrates)
          You have to run your hands over it,
          get close to it, really reach
          out and feel. You try it.

     Harold tries. He gingerly moves his hand over a rather
     sensuous curve.

                    MAUDE
          That's right. How's the sensation?

     A low RISING WHISTLE is heard.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, that's the kettle.
               (she goes to
               kitchen)
          Go ahead, Harold. Stroke, palm,
          caress, explore.

     Harold watches Maude leave the room. He hears her invita-
     tion and looks at the sculpture. A battle is going on
     inside him. ("Go ahead touch it! - Better not!") Maude
     begins humming in the kitchen. She won't be out for a while.
     Harold begins moving his hand over the polished wood. His
     face is expressionless, but he moves his body closer and
     his hand becomes more daring. He brings his other hand
     onto the sculpture. He is enjoying the sensations. He
     looks at the large hole before him. His hand moves around
     it. ("Go ahead - Better not!") His eyes scan the room.
     Suddenly he sticks his head in the hole, pulls it out,
     steps back quickly, and looks over to the kitchen. Maude
     is still out there humming. Harold relaxes, straightens
     his suit, looks at the sculpture, and braves a short smile.

     Maude enters with the tea.

                    MAUDE
          Here we are, Harold. Oat straw
          tea and ginger pie.

                    HAROLD
          Certainly a new experience for me.

                    MAUDE
          Wonderful! Try something new each
          day. After all, we're given life
          to find it out. It doesn't last
          forever.

     They sit down at the table.

                    HAROLD
          You look as if you could.

                    MAUDE
          Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be
          eighty on Saturday?

                    HAROLD
          You don't look eighty.

                    MAUDE
          That's the influence of the right
          food, the right exercise, and the right
          breathing.
               (she gestures)
          Greet the dawn with the Breath of
          Fire!
               (the demonstration
               leaves her a
               little winded)
          Of course, there's no doubt the
          body is giving out. I'm well into
          autumn. I'll have to be giving
          it all up after Saturday. Sweeten
          the tea with honey, Harold. It's
          delicious.

                    HAROLD
          That's a nice teapot.

                    MAUDE
          Sterling silver. It was my dear
          mother-in-law's, part of a dinner
          set of fifty pieces. It's one of
          the few things that survived.
               (pause)
          Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell
          me about yourself, Harold.
               (she settles back
               with her tea)
          What do you do when you aren't
          visiting funerals?


68     EXT. DEMOLITIONS - DAY

     Shots of falling buildings. The giant demolition ball
     swings left and right knocking mighty holes in brick walls
     and sending them crumbling to earth with deafening noise.


69     EXT. DEMOLITION - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

     Harold and Maude watch, in the background, an old building
     collapse into rubble. After the noise abates Maude turns
     to Harold.

                    MAUDE
          Yes. There is definitely a certain
          attraction.


70     EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

     A giant crane comes crashing into the hood of a car.
     The car is picked up and dropped on a conveyor belt which
     hauls it up to the crusher. Despite the terrible din
     Harold and Maude watch with rapt attention.


71     EXT. JUNKYARD DISTRICT - LONG SHOT - DAY

     Harold and Maude are sitting on a hill picnicking. They
     are looking at the junkyard operation in the distance.
     They chew for a while then Maude offers Harold a raw carrot.
     She chews on one herself.

                    MAUDE
          Well, it's all very thrilling,
          of course, but I ask you, Harold...
          Is it enough?

                    HAROLD
          What do you mean?

     Maude smiles.


72     EXT. A LARGE VEGETABLE FIELD - DAY

     The CAMERA is at a LOW LEVEL. We see long rows of young
     plants that stretch into the distance. We PAN across the
     field into two giant CLOSEUPS of Harold and Maude. They
     are lying on the ground looking intently at one little
     plant. Maude looks over to Harold.

                    MAUDE
          I love to watch things grow.


73     EXT. FLOWER FARM - DAY

     SHOTS of flowers growing, all different varieties, in
     clusters, in pots, on vines, in greenhouses, in large
     fields.

     Maude and Harold are walking down a row of flowers.

                    MAUDE
          They grow and bloom, and fade, and
          die, and some change into something
          else. Ah, life!

     They stop by some flowers.

                    MAUDE
          I should like to change into a
          sunflower most of all. They are
          so tall and simple. And you,
          Harold, what flower would you
          like to be?

                    HAROLD
          I don't know. Just one of those.
               (he gestures)


74     HAROLD'S POV

     We see a large field of daisies stretching to the hills.


75     EXT. BY THE DAISY FIELD - DAY

     Harold and Maude look out at it.

                    MAUDE
               (a little perturbed)
           Why do you say that?

                    HAROLD
               (softly)
          Because they are all the same.

                    MAUDE
          Oooh, but they are not. Look.

     They bend down to see some close ones.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          See - some are smaller, some are
          fatter, some grow to the left,
          some to the right, some even have
          some petals missing - all kinds
          of observable differences, and we
          haven't even touched the bio-
          chemical. You see, Harold, they're
          like the Japanese. At first you
          think they all look alike, but
          after you get to know them you see
          there is not a repeat in the bunch.
          Each person is different, never
          existed before and never to exist
          again. Just like this daisy -
               (she picks it)
          - an individual.

     They stand up.

                    HAROLD
          Well, we may be individuals all
          right but -
               (he looks out
               at the field)
          - we have to grow up together.

     Maude looks up. She is very struck by what Harold said.
     She speaks very softly and we see she has tears in her eyes.

                    MAUDE
          Yes, that's very true. Still I
          believe much of the world's
          sorrow comes from people who know
          they are this -
               (she holds
               the daisy)
          - yet let themselves be treated -
               (she looks out
               at the field)
          - as that.


76     EXT. THE FIELD - DAY

     Thousands and thousands of daisies wave gently in the
     breeze.


77     EXT. ROAD BY THE FLOWER FARM - DAY

     A large black Continental apparently out of control
     crashes through the flower farm fence, swerves onto the
     road, and zigzags away at top speed before finally
     straightening out.


78     INT. CONTINENTAL - DAY

     Harold is petrified. Maude is driving. She looks over at
     him and explains.

                    MAUDE
          Ha! Power steering.


79     EXT. ROAD IN TOWN - DAY

     The Continental speeds by.


80     INT. CONTINENTAL - DAY

     Harold has somewhat recovered.

                    HAROLD
          Boy, Maude. The way you handle
          cars. I'd never handle a car
          like that.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, it's only a machine, Harold.
          It's not as if it were alive,
          like a horse or a camel. We may
          live in a machine age, but I
          simply can't treat them as equals.
               (she looks over
               at the radio)
          Of course, the age has its
          advantages.

     She turns it on. Music plays softly.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          The universal language of mankind.
               (she begins
               humming along
               with the tune)
          What music do you like, Harold?

                    HAROLD
          Well...

     Harold is suddenly thrown against the door as Maude makes
     a fast U-turn.


81     EXT. BEFORE THE COURTHOUSE PARK - DAY

     We see the Continental turn across the street, drive up
     onto the sidewalk, and stop as it bumps into a telegraph
     pole.


82     MED. SHOT OF THE CAR

     Maude gets out, walks around the car, and opens Harold's
     door. Harold, very shaken, gets out.

                    HAROLD
          What happened?

                    MAUDE
               (she points)
          Look.

                    HAROLD
          What?

                    MAUDE
          Over there by the courthouse.

                    HAROLD
          What is it?

                    MAUDE
          That little tree. It's in trouble.
          Come on.

     Maude walks over to the courthouse. Harold, not wanting to
     be left with the crashed car, quickly follows.


83     EXT. BY THE COURTHOUSE - DAY

     They come to a little tree growing in the garden.

                    MAUDE
          Look at it, Harold. It's
          suffocating. It's the smog.
          People can live with it, but
          it gives trees asthma. They
          can't breathe. See the leaves
          are all brown. Harold, we've
          got to do something about this
          life.

                    HAROLD
          But what?

                    MAUDE
          We'll transplant it. To the
          forest.

                    HAROLD
          But we can't just dig it up!

                    MAUDE
          Why not?

                    HAROLD
          But this is public property.

                    MAUDE
          Exactly.

     She's ready to dig.

                    HAROLD
          Don't you think we should get some
          tools, maybe?

                    MAUDE
          Yes, you're right. We'll go see
          Glaucus. Come on.

                    HAROLD
          Oh, wait, Maude. Look!

     Harold points and we see that two COPS have stopped and are
     checking out the Continental on the sidewalk.

                    MAUDE
               (nonchalantly)
          Oh, the police. Come on.


84     EXT. BY THE CONTINENTAL - DAY

     The police are looking around. Maude boldly walks by.
     Harold tags reluctantly along.

                    MAUDE
          Good afternoon, Officer. Bit
          of trouble here?

                    OFFICER
               (tips his hat)
          Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some
          trouble parking.

                    MAUDE
          Well, it's a tricky turn.

                    OFFICER
               (not understanding
               but amiable)
          Eh, yes, ma'm.

                    MAUDE
          Tell me --
               (points to car
               in front)
          -- is that car parked all right?

                    OFFICER
          Oh yes. That's fine.

                    MAUDE
          Well, thank you. Eh, officer,
          you might turn off the radio.
          Saves the battery.

     Maude and Harold walk off to the car in front. The officer
     turns off the radio. He looks up. Maude has opened the
     door of the car in front with her ring of keys. She waves
     to him.


85     CLOSEUP - THE OFFICER

     He tips his hat and waves back. He is smiling as we hear
     the engine start. The smile drops as we hear Maude's
     screeching start.


86     INT. GLAUCUS'S STUDIO - NIGHT

     Maude and Harold enter. The block of ice in the center of
     the room is now five to six feet tall and melting rapidly
     into the large trough in which it stands. Around the studio
     on the walls and benches are every conceivable hand tool -
     sculpting tools, gardening tools, construction tools, etc.
     On a raised platform in one corner covered with rugs and
     cushions and skins, lies Glaucus, bundled up in a parka
     and snoring horribly. In his gloved hands he holds a
     hammer and an ice pick.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, my. We're too late.

                    HAROLD
          Is he all right?

                    MAUDE
          He's fallen asleep, as usual.

     She covers him with a rug.

                    MAUDE
                (continuing)
          We'll come back in the morning.

                    HAROLD
          What is that he's working on?

                    MAUDE
          An ice sculpture. It's Venus -
          the Goddess of Love, the completion
          of which is his unfulfilled dream.

                    HAROLD
          It is kind of rough.

                    MAUDE
          He's never finished one yet. He
          has around him every kind of hand
          tool known to man, but the poor
          dear has difficulty staying awake.

                    HAROLD
          Look, the ice is melting.

                    MAUDE
          Yes.

     They both stand and stare.

                    MAUDE
          That's one of the drawbacks of
          the medium.


87     INT. MAUDE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Harold and Maude sit before the fire. They have just
     finished dinner.

                    MAUDE
          A little after-dinner liqueur,
          Harold?

                    HAROLD
          Well, I really don't drink...

                    MAUDE
          Oh, it's all right. It's organic.

     She pours.

                    HAROLD
          Thank you.

                    MAUDE
               (offering)
          Some nuts? Some licorice?
          It has no nutritional value but
          then consistency is not really a
          human trait.

                    HAROLD
          Thank you.

     He chews the licorice. He gestures above the fireplace.

                    HAROLD
                (continuing)
          What's that?

                    MAUDE
          My umbrella?
               (fluttery laugh)
          Oh, that's just a relic. I found
          it when I was packing to come to
          America. It used to be my defense
          on picket lines and rallies and
          political meetings - being dragged
          off by police or attacked by thugs
          of the opposition.
               (fluttery laugh
               as she remembers)
          A long time ago.

                    HAROLD
          What were you fighting for?

                    MAUDE
          Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights.
          Justice. Kings died and kingdoms
          fell. I don't regret the kingdoms
          - what sense in borders and nations
          and patriotism - but I do miss the
          kings. When I was a little girl
          I was taken to the palace in
          Vienna, to a garden party. I can
          still see the sunshine, the
          parasols, and the flashing
          uniforms of the young officers.
          I thought then I would marry a
          soldier.
               (fluttery laugh)
          Later, Frederick would chide me
          about it.
               (with a twinkle)
          He was so serious. A doctor at
          the University. And in the
          government.

     Suddenly she gets quiet.

                    MAUDE
          But, that was all... before...

     Maude stares into the fire. She suddenly seems very small
     and fragile. Harold notices the change that has come over
     her and is not sure what to say.

                    HAROLD
          So you don't use the umbrella
          any more?

     She looks at him and says softly:

                    MAUDE
          No.

                    HAROLD
          No more revolts.

                    MAUDE
               (sparks back to
               her old self)
          Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't
          need a defense anymore. I embrace!
          Still fighting for the Big Issues
          but now in my small, individual way.
          Shall we have a song?

                    HAROLD
          Well, I don't...

                    MAUDE
          Oh come on. I'll teach you.

     She goes to the piano, sits down, and plays. It is a fast,
     delightful song and she sings it with zest.

                    MAUDE
          Come on, Harold, join in the
          chorus.

     Beside her Harold hesitatingly sings along. The o.s.
     orchestra has joined in, enabling Maude to leave the piano
     and get up and dance. She capers in true old vaudeville
     fashion. As the song continues we go into a MONTAGE and
     see Maude dance as she sings in various locales - the beach,
     the forest, the fields, the hills, finally returning to
     her room to join up with Harold for a socko finish.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, that was fun. Let's play
          something together.

                    HAROLD
          But I don't play anything.

                    MAUDE
               (a bombshell!)
           Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone
          should be able to make some music.
          Why, it's life! - Rhythm and
          harmony - That's the cosmic dance.
          Come with me.

     She goes over to a large cupboard and opens both doors.
     It is full of all kinds of musical instruments. She ferrets
     about for a while and pulls out a banjo.

                    MAUDE
          Here we are. Just the thing.

     She shows him a chord and how to strum. - "Your fingers
     here... etc." He does it a few times.

                    MAUDE
          That's right. But be impulsive!
          Be fanciful! Let the music flow
          out of you as freely as though
          you were talking. Okay?
               (she sits)
          From the top -- Let's jam!

     She swings into the chorus and Harold strums along. At the
     end she looks over at him beaming.

                    HAROLD
          Okay?

                    MAUDE
          Superb.


88     EXT. THE CHASEN'S BACKYARD - DAY

     Harold sits practicing his banjo. We barely recognize that
     he is playing Maude's Song. He hears his mother calling
     him and he quickly hides his banjo in a nearby flower pot.
     His mother enters.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Harold! Harold! Ah, there you
          are. I have a little present
          for you. A surprise. Come with
          me.

     They both go off toward the garage.


89     EXT. THE GARAGE AREA - DAY

     They both come around the corner and Mrs. Chasen gestures
     dramatically in front of her.

                     MRS. CHASEN
          There!


90     EXT. THE GARAGE AREA - THEIR POV - DAY

     We see a little green MG roadster. Harold comes up to it,
     suspecting something funny. He looks around for his
     hearse.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Isn't that darling? I had them tow
          off that black monstrous thing of
          yours and had them send this around
          instead. It's so much more
          appropriate for you, don't you
          think?

     Harold starts to say something.

                      MRS. CHASEN
               (continuing)
          One more thing, Harold. I've talked
          on the phone with your second
          computer date and she seems a very
          nice, quiet girl. Not at all
          hysterical like the first one.
          Nevertheless I want you to be on
          your best behavior when she comes
          tomorrow and make her feel at home.
               (she looks at the
               car before leaving)
          Cute little thing, isn't it? I
          like it very much.
               (she exits)

     Harold stands for a moment looking at the MG. He makes a
     decision.


91     QUICK SHOT

     Harold takes off his jacket.


92     QUICK SHOT

     Harold wheels to the car a large acetylene torch.


93     QUICK SHOT

     Harold pulls down a great welding mask over his head.


94     INT. GLAUCUS' STUDIO - DAY

     A brand new block of ice - eight to nine feet tall -
     stands in the trough in the center of the studio. Glaucus,
     spryly dressed for autumn, is chipping merrily away.

                     GLAUCUS
          Come in. Come in.

     Maude enters.

                    MAUDE
          Have you seen Harold?

                    GLAUCUS
          One moment.

     He makes a chip on the ice and stands back to examine it.
     He is satisfied. He turns to Maude, full of pep.

                    GLAUCUS
          Ah, Dame Marjorie. Greetings.
               (he kisses her hand)
          As Odysseus said to Penelope...

     Harold enters a little out of breath.

                    HAROLD
          Sorry I'm late.

                    GLAUCUS
          A rather free translation but
          nonetheless correct. Greetings
          to you too, my little one.
               (he gestures
               at the ice)
          Tell me, what do you see?

                    HAROLD
          A block of ice.

                    GLAUCUS
          Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.

                    HAROLD
          What do you see?

                    GLAUCUS
          I see the eternal goddess of
          beauty and love. I see Aphrodite.
          The consummate woman.

          Full of warmth and fire. Frozen.
               (to the ice)
          And it is I who shall set you free.

     He takes a small pneumatic drill and attacks the ice. He
     makes a little incision, puts it down, and steps back to
     observe. He wipes his brow.

                       GLAUCUS
          Each morning I am delivered of a
          new block of ice. Each evening
          my eyes grow weary, my hands hang
          heavy, and I am swept down Lethe
          to slumber -
               (slowly with
               feeling)
          - while my goddess, half-born,
          drips away - unseen, unsung, and
          unknown.

                    MAUDE
          May we borrow a shovel?

                    GLAUCUS
          Wait! Let me think. Do I need
          a shovel today? No! I need a
          blowtorch.
               (he gets a
               blowtorch)
          Take any shovel. You are welcome.

     Harold picks up a shovel.

                      MAUDE
          Thank you, Glaucus. We'll see
          you later. Come on, Harold.

     Harold and Maude exit.

                       GLAUCUS
          Farewell, my friends.
               (he fires the
               blowtorch)
          "Where'er he moved, the goddess
          shone before" - Homer!

     He approaches the ice.


95     EXT. HIGHWAY - LONG SHOT - DAY

     We PAN with a brown pick-up truck as it drives along. A
     small tree stands swaying in the back.


96     INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - ANGLE FROM SIDE - MED. SHOT - DAY

     Maude is driving. Harold sits beside her. The car is
     traveling from SCREEN LEFT to SCREEN RIGHT. Harold looks
     at Maude. She smiles. He smiles.


97     EXT. HIGHWAY - LONG SHOT - DAY

     Cop on a motorcycle watches Maude go by. He follows her
     and flags her down. She pulls the truck over to the side
     of the road.


98     EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY

     The cop gets off his motorcycle and comes over to the truck
     door.

                    COP
          Lady, you were going 70 miles
          an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could
          I see your license, please?

                    MAUDE
          Yes. Those little pieces of paper
          with your picture on it?

                    COP
          Yes.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, I don't have one.

                    COP
          Come again.

                    MAUDE
          I don't have one. I don't
          believe in them.

                    COP
          How long have you been driving?

                    MAUDE
          About forty-five minutes,
          wouldn't you say, Harold? We
          were hoping to start sooner but,
          you see, it's rather hard to find
          a truck.

                    COP
          Could I see your registration?

                    MAUDE
          I just don't think we have one,
          unless it's in the glove compartment.
          Could you look, Harold?

                    COP
          Isn't this your vehicle?

                    MAUDE
          No, no. I just took it.

                    COP
          Took it?

                    MAUDE
          Yes. You see I have to plant my
          tree.

                    COP
          Your tree.

                    MAUDE
          Well, it's not really mine. I
          dug it up in front of the courthouse.
          We're transplanting it. Letting
          it breathe, you know. But, of
          course, we would like to get it
          into soil, as soon as possible.

                    COP
          Lady, let me get this straight.

                    MAUDE
               (agreeing)
          All right, then, and we'll be off.
               (she revs up the motor)
          Nice chatting with you.

     Maude zooms off down the highway. The cop is left flabber-
     gasted. He races for his motorcycle. With SIRENS blazing
     he drives of to catch her.


99     INT. THE TRUCK - DAY

     Harold looks uneasily out the back window.

                     HAROLD
          I think he's following us.

                    MAUDE
          Is he? Ah, the police. Always
          wanting to play games. Well,
          here goes.

          Maude accelerates and zooms off.


100     EXT. THE HIGHWAY - DAY

     Maude careens down the highway dodging cars. The cop
     follows in hot pursuit. Suddenly Maude does a full left
     turn making a screeching half-circle and charging off down
     the highway in the opposite direction. Cars pull over out
     of her way. The cop does a similar U-turn and follows her.
     Maude immediately makes another U-turn and flies off down
     the highway in her original direction. The cop is taken
     unawares. Traffic around him is in total confusion. He
     dodges zigzagging cars, runs up onto the embankment, and
     stops.


101     INT. THE TRUCK - DAY

                      HAROLD
               (turns around
               badly shaken)
          He's stopped.

                    MAUDE
               (brightly)
          The old double U-turn. Gets
          them every time.


102     EXT. THE HIGHWAY - DAY

     The truck continues on its merry way.


103     EXT. A PLEASANT GLADE IN THE FOREST - DAY

     Maude and Harold have just finished planting the tree;
     Maude is putting the finishing touches around the trunk.
     She stands up.

                    MAUDE
          There. Oh, I like the feel of
          soil, don't you? And the smell.
          It's the earth. "The earth is
          my body. My head is in the stars."
               (little laugh)
          Who said that?

                    HAROLD
          I don't know.

                    MAUDE
          I suppose I did.
               (laughs)
          Well, farewell little tree. Grow
          up tall, and change, and fall to
          replenish the earth. Isn't it
          wonderful, Harold? All around us.
          Living things.


104     EXT. THE FOREST - DAY

     Harold and Maude are sitting in a tree.

                       MAUDE
          I come here as often as I can.
          It's exhilarating. What do you
          call it? Nature! Life! Soul!
          God! At any rate, it's here, and...

     We PULL BACK on the ZOOM and see they are sitting in the
     top branches of a very tall tree.

                    MAUDE
          ... we are part of it.


105     INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY

     SAME SIDE ANGLE AS SHOT 96, except now the truck is
     traveling from screen right to screen left. Maude is
     driving; Harold sits beside her. Maude looks at Harold.
     He smiles. She smiles.


106     EXT. THE HIGHWAY - LONG SHOT - DAY

     We see the truck, now without the tree, go driving down the
     road. We see the cop on the motorbike. It is the same
     one as before. He sees the truck, grits his teeth, and
     speeds on after it. With SIRENS blazing he signals Maude
     to pull well off the road, and around so that it is facing
     the fields. The cop gets of his bike and goes over to
     them.

                     COP
          Okay, lady. Out.

                    MAUDE
          Hello.

     She doesn't quite recognize him.

                    MAUDE
          Haven't we met before?

                    COP
          None of that, lady.

                    MAUDE
               (genuinely)
          Oh, well. Must have been your
          brother.

                    COP
          Out!

     Maude gets out.

                    MAUDE
          But there is a family resemblance.

                    COP
               (to Harold)
          You too, Buster. Stand over here.
          Lady, you're in a heap of trouble.
          I have you down here for several
          violations; speeding, resisting
          arrest, driving without a license,
          driving a stolen vehicle, possession
          of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?

                    MAUDE
          We planted it.

                    COP
          Is this your shovel?

                    MAUDE
          No.

                    COP
          Possession of a stolen shovel.

                    MAUDE
          Officer, I can explain.

                    COP
          Lady, resisting arrest is a
          serious criminal offense. Under
          the state criminal code, section
          545, paragraph 10-B...

                    MAUDE
          Oh, don't get officious. You're
          not yourself when you're officious.
          That's the curse of a government
          job.

                    COP
               (patiently)
          Lady, is it true you're driving
          without a license?

                    MAUDE
               (equally as
               patient)
          Check.

                    COP
          And that truck - is it registered
          in your name?

                    MAUDE
          Oh no! Not in my name.

                    COP
          Then whose name is it registered
          in?

                    MAUDE
          Well, I don't know. Do you know,
          Harold?

                    COP
          Where are the papers?

                    MAUDE
          I suppose they are in the truck.
          Are you going to take a lot of
          time with this?

                    COP
          Wait here.

                    MAUDE
          Because if you are...

                    COP
          Lady! Be quiet.

     The cop goes over to the truck. We FOLLOW him as he sits
     in the front seat, opens the glove compartment, and begins
     looking through some papers. Suddenly he hears the start
     of an engine. He looks up. Maude is on the motorcycle,
     revving it up, and motioning Harold to get on board.

                     MAUDE
          Grab the shovel, Harold.

     Harold hesitates. He looks over at the cop, who begins to
     get out of the truck. He makes up his mind, grabs the
     shovel, jumps on the seat behind Maude, and they both go
     careening off down the road. The cop takes out his gun.

                    COP
          Stop! Or I'll shoot!

      He fires several times.


107     CLOSEUP - MAUDE ON THE BIKE

     She hears the shots.

                    MAUDE
          Oh! It's just like the Resistance.

     She begins maneuvering the bike in defensive zigzag
     patterns.


108     LONG SHOT - THE HIGHWAY

     The cop, helpless, watches them disappear over the hill.


109     INT. GLAUCUS' STUDIO - NIGHT

     The ice block is as we saw it the first night - unfinished
     and melting. Glaucus, bundled up in his winter clothes,
     falters towards it with a heavy hammer and chisel. He is
     fighting off sleep as only a very old man can. He manages
     a blow on the ice and then shuffles back to see its
     effect. He mumbles all the time.

                    GLAUCUS
          The bitter dregs of Fortune's
          cup to drain - The Iliad...
          Almost finished... Gotta make
          it... Going to make it...
          Liberate Love... Set her free.

     He staggers to the statue and back again.

     Harold and Maude enter, laughing.

                       MAUDE
          Oh, those motorcycles are awfully
          chilly.

                    HAROLD
          Yeah. And it is cold in here.
          Hello, Glaucus.

                    GLAUCUS
          Cold... Yes... Yes... Gotta turn
          up the heat... Excuse me...

     He turns up the heat.

                     HAROLD
          Here's your shovel.

                    GLAUCUS
          What?... Oh yes... Shovel... Create
          ... Verily these issues lie in the
          lap of the gods... Iliad... Just
          sit down for a minute.

     Glaucus wanders over to his couch and sits, still mumbling.

                       GLAUCUS
          Not giving up... Just for a minute
          ... Then once more up the hill...

     Harold walks over to the ice sculpture.

                    HAROLD
          I think I see it.

                    MAUDE
          Yes. It's almost there.

     Glaucus, his eyes barely open, gets up and shuffles in
     place as if he is walking over to the statue. He works
     his tools in the air and then shuffles in place as if he
     is walking back. He examines his work. He sits.

                      GLAUCUS
          Yes... almost done... have a
          little rest. Not long... Just
          a little rest... then once more
          up the hill...

     He falls back slowly asleep.

                     HAROLD
          I think he's asleep.

     Glaucus pops up.

                     GLAUCUS
          Aha! Morpheus. I'll...

     He mumbles and makes an effort to raise his tools. His
     eyes close, but he is still fighting.

                      GLAUCUS
          Gonna make it... Gonna make it...
          Make it...

     He drifts back against the cushions still holding the tools
     in his hand. He is finally asleep.

     Harold and Maude have been watching Glaucus's gallant battle.
     Maude smiles and turns to go. Harold looks at the sculpture.

                     HAROLD
          The ice is melting.

                    MAUDE
          Yes.

                    HAROLD
          Don't you think we should turn
          off the heat?

                    MAUDE
               (brightly)
          Why? There'll be a new block of
          ice in the morning.


110     INT. MAUDE'S PLACE - NIGHT

     Maude and Harold are dressed in bright Japanese kimonos.
     They are relaxing on cushions in the Japanese nook after
     having just finished supper. Maude puffs pleasantly on a
     hookah.

                     HAROLD
          I like Glaucus.

                    MAUDE
          Yes, so do I. But I think he
          is a little... old-fashioned.
          Like a puff, Harold?

                    HAROLD
          Well, I really don't smoke.

                    MAUDE
          It's all right.
               (she offers him
               the hose)
          It's organic.

                    HAROLD
               (smokes)
          I'm sure picking up on vices.

                    MAUDE
          Vice? Virtue? It's best not to
          be too moral. You cheat yourself
          out of too much life. Aim above
          morality. As Confucius says,
          "Don't simply be good. Make good
          things happen."

                    HAROLD
          Did Confucius say that?

                    MAUDE
          Well --
               (she smiles)
          - they say he was very wise, so
          I'm sure he must have.

                    HAROLD
          You are the wisest person I know.

                    MAUDE
          Me!
               (she laughs and
               shakes her head)
          When I look around me I know I
          know nothing. I remember though,
          once long ago in Persia, we met a
           wise man in the bazaar. He was
          a professional and used to sell
          his wisdom to anyone willing to
          pay. His specialty for tourists
          was a maxim engraved on the head
          of a pin. "The wisest," he said,
          "the truest, the most instructive
          words for all men at all times."
          Frederick bought one for me and
          back at the hotel I peered through
          a magnifying glass to read the
          words - "And this too shall pass
          away."
               (fluttery laugh)
          Well, the wise man was right - if
          you remember that, you can't help
          but live life fully.

                    HAROLD
          Yes. I haven't lived.
               (he suddenly
               giggles)
          I've died a few times.

                    MAUDE
          What was that?

                    HAROLD
               (he is getting
               a little high)
          Died! Seventeen times - not
          counting maiming.
               (he laughs)
          Shot myself in the face once with
          a popgun and a pellet of blood.

                    MAUDE
               (laughing with him)
          How ingenious! Tell me about them.

                    HAROLD
          Well, it's a question of timing,
          and the right equipment, and plenty
          of patience... You really want to
          hear about this?

                    MAUDE
          Of course.

                    HAROLD
               (he smiles)
          Okay.

     Partly because of the pot, but mostly because he has found
     a friend, Harold opens up for the first time in his life.
     As he gets into the story he tells it with such animation
     and delight that we are amazed at all the fun and zest he
     has kept locked up inside him.

                    HAROLD
          Well, the first time it wasn't
          even planned. It was when I was
          at boarding school and they were
          getting ready for the school
          Centennial Celebration and they
          put all the fireworks and food
          and stuff in this room in the
          West Wing. Well, on the floor
          above they had the Chemistry Lab
          and I had to stay in and clean
          it up. So I thought I'd do a
          little experimenting. I got all
          this stuff out and began mixing
          it up. It was very scientific.
          I was measuring the amounts.
          Well, suddenly there was this big
          fizzing sound and this white kind
          of porridge stuff began erupting
          out of the beaker, and moving along
          the desk and falling onto the floor.
          It was making an awful mess. So I
          got the hose to try to spray it
          into the sink. I turned on the
          water and - POW! There was this
          massive explosion. Knocked me down.
          Blew out the floor. Boards and
          brick and flames leaping up. Singed
          my hair. Smoke everywhere. I got
          up, then this sound like bombs
          going off. It was the fireworks
          in the room below. And all this
          stuff came flying out the hole.
          PACHAU! Skyrockets and pinwheels.
          And fire balls all whizzing and
          bouncing. And I was just standing
          there stunned - I couldn't believe
          it - just watching - being pelted
          by all these little pellets - turns
          out to be the goddamn popcorn spewed
          up from below. The whole place was
          a crazy inferno with the rockets
          and everything, and I couldn't get
          to the door. But behind me was
          this old laundry chute, so I
          hopped in that and slid down that to
          the basement. When I got outside
          I saw that the whole top of the
          building was on fire and, of course,
          it was pandemonium with people
          running around and fire alarms
          ringing. So I decided to go home.
          When I get there my mother is having
          this big party so I creep up the
          back stairs to my room. Then there
          is this ring on the doorbell. It's
          the police. I creep over to the
          banister to see what they say, and
          they tell my mother that I had
          been killed in a fire at school.
          Well, everyone got very quiet.

     Harold has calmed down and speaks in a matter of fact way.

                    HAROLD
               (continuing)
          People were whispering and looking
          at my mother.

          I tried leaning forward to see her
          face but I couldn't.
               (slowly)
          She began to sway. She put one
          hand to her forehead. With the
          other she reached out, as if groping
          for support. Two men rushed to her
          side and then - with a long, low
          sigh - she collapsed in their arms.
               (pause)
          I decided then I enjoyed being
          dead.

     Maude doesn't say anything for a moment. Then she speaks
     softly.

                       MAUDE
          Yes. I understand. A lot of people
          enjoy being dead. But they are not
          dead really. They're just backing
          away from life.
               (with a twinkle)
          They're players - but they sit on
          the bench. The game goes on before
          them. At any moment they can join
          in.
               (she jumps up
               and shouts)
          Reach out! Take a chance! Get
          hurt maybe. But play as well as
          you can.
               (she leads a
               cheer before
               the stands)
          Go team, go! Give me an "L."
          Give me an "I."  Give me a "V."
          Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!
               (she sits down
               by Harold, quietly
               composed)
          Otherwise you'll have nothing to
          talk about in the locker room.

                    HAROLD
               (smiles)
          I like you, Maude.

                    MAUDE
               (smiles)
          I like you, Harold.
               (pause)
          Come, I'll teach you to waltz.

     Music comes in from nowhere. Harold joins Maude and,
     though they both realize how ridiculous they look waltzing
     in kimonos, they begin to dance, and thoroughly enjoy it.

     We go into a MONTAGE as they dance together, similar to
     the one Maude danced alone. They dance on the beach, the
     forest, the fields, the hills, and end up back in her
     apartment for the courtly finale.


111     EXT. THE CHASEN'S BACK YARD - DAY

     Mrs. Chasen and EDITH FERN come out of the house and walk
     toward the garage area. Edith, the second computer date,
     is short, mousy, and looks like a female Don Knotts.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          This way, Edith. Harold is out
          by the garage. He has a new car
          and he has been tuning it up.
          He's very mechanical.

                    EDITH
          What kind of a car is it?


112     EXT. THE GARAGE AREA - DAY

     They come around the corner.

                       MRS. CHASEN
          It's a little MG roadster...

        She stops dead in her tracks at what she sees.


113     MRS. CHASEN POV

        Harold is putting the final polish on the car. The car,
     however, has changed. It is now black, with a squared-off
     top, a long back, black velvet curtains, and silver trim.
     As Edith says...

                    EDITH
          Oh. It looks like a hearse.
               (a pause)
          Very nice. Compact.

                    MRS. CHASEN
               (continuing despite
               the blow)
          Edith, I'd like you to meet my
          son, Harold. Harold, this is
          Edith... eh?

                    EDITH
          Fern. I'm very pleased to make
          your acquaintance.

     Harold nods a greeting and they shake hands.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Harold, I think you should go and
          wash up and meet us in the den.
          And remember what I said to you.
          Let's make Edith feel at home.


114      INT. CHASEN'S DEN - DAY

        Edith and Mrs. Chasen are seated having coffee.

                       MRS. CHASEN
          And what do you do, my dear?

                    EDITH
          I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed
          and Grain.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          How interesting.

                    EDITH
          Not very.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Oh. Well, what is it exactly
          that you do?

                    EDITH
          I'm in charge of all the invoices
          for the southwest. We supply,
          for example, most of the egg
          farmers in Southern California.
          So you can imagine.

      She sips her coffee.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Yes.

      She sips hers. Harold enters.

                       MRS. CHASEN
          Here's Harold now. No, don't
          get up.

      Edith sits. Harold sits. A pause.

                       MRS. CHASEN
               (continuing)
          Edith was just telling me about
          her job.

                    EDITH
          I'm a file clerk.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Yes. Henderson Feed and Grain.

                       EDITH
               (corrects her)
          Harrison. Harrison Feed and
          Grain... At Hamilton and Fourth...
          I'm in charge of the invoices...
          And I type up the schedule for
          the trucking fleet...

                    MRS. CHASEN
          She supplies the whole southwest
          with chicken feed.

                    EDITH
               (modestly)
          Well, not all the southwest.
          Although we do have a large
          business... Barley was very big
          last week...  Fifteen hundred...

        Harold pulls out a meat cleaver. His left hand rests on
     the table. With one great swoop he cuts it of at the
     wrist. Calmly he puts his amputated arm in his lap as
     Edith pauses in her story. Mrs. Chasen rolls her eyes
     and sighs. Edith loOkS at the bloody hand on the table
     and cannot continue.

                    EDITH
          ... bushels.

        She begins violent retchings and tumbles forward to the
     floor.

     Harold looks over at Mrs. Chasen.

116      EXT. LONG SHOT - THE MEADOW - DAY

     Harold and Maude have just finished having a picnic.


117     MEDIUM SHOT - THE MEADOW - DAY

     Maude is putting the things away. Harold lies on his back
     and looks at the sky.

                    HAROLD
          Look at that sky.
               (pause)
          It's so big.

                    MAUDE
          It's so blue.

                    HAROLD
          And beyond the blue is the blackness
          of the cosmos.

                    MAUDE
          Spreckled with uncountable stars.
          The stars are shining right now.
          We just can't see them. Just
          another instance of all that's
          going on that is beyond human
          perception.

                    HAROLD
               (he sits up)
          Maude, do you pray?

                    MAUDE
          Pray? No.
               (pause)
          I communicate.
               (she smiles)

                    HAROLD
               (smiling)
          With God?

                    MAUDE
          With Life.

     They look at each other and smile.

                    HAROLD
          This is really nice. Makes me
          feel like a kid. I want to do
          somersaults .

                    MAUDE
          Well, why don't you?

                    HAROLD
          No. I'd feel stupid.

                    MAUDE
          Harold, everyone has the right to
          make an ass out of themselves.
          You just can't let the world judge you
          too much.

        Harold shrugs "Okay." He does a somersault in the grass.
     He laughs.

                     HAROLD
          Want to join me in some cartwheels?

                    MAUDE
          No. I feel more like - yodeling.

                    HAROLD
          Yodeling?

        Maude YODELS. Loud and long. Harold joins in. Their
     combined voices ECHO across the valley and FADE OUT as
     we:

                               DISSOLVE TO:


118      EXT. THE BEACH AT SUNSET

     The sun sits on the horizon. We PULL BACK to include
     Harold and Maude sitting on a rock and looking out at
     the reddening clouds and sea.

                    MAUDE
               (poetically)
          It's sinking, Harold. Going
          over the horizon - where we are
          all going to go. It's getting
          dark. "Let each man hold on to
          his candle and get a light
          where'er he can."

                    HAROLD
          Where's that?

                    MAUDE
               (breaking the mood)
          From the guys who got the matches,
           of course.
               (she laughs)

                    HAROLD
               (smiling)
          Boy! It sure has been a wonderful
          day. And you - you are beautiful.

      He takes her hand and kisses it.

                       MAUDE
          Oh, Harold. You make me feel
          like a schoolgirl.

                    HAROLD
          Shall I drop by tomorrow?
               (remembers)
          Oh, I have a luncheon date. With
          this girl.

                    MAUDE
          Oh.

                    HAROLD
          I've never met her. My mother set
          it up.

                    MAUDE
          Well, be kind. I've lived a long
          time, Harold, seen evil as well as
          good, and it has been my experience
          that kindness...

     As Maude is talking and looking out to sea, Harold looks
     down at her hand in his. She is not wearing a long-sleeved
     dress and we see a number tattooed on her skin: P-876954.
     Maude doesn't notice but Harold is visibly shocked.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          ... is what the world sorely lacks.
          Oh, look!

     Maude points and Harold looks out to sea.


119     THEIR POV

        A sea gull flies across the reddening sky.


120     TWO SHOT

      Harold still holds Maude's hand.

                       MAUDE
          Dreyfus once wrote that on
          Devil's Island he would see the
          most glorious birds. Many
          years later in Britanny he
          realized they had only been sea
          gulls.

     She smiles at Harold and looks back out to sea.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          To me they will always be -
          glorious birds.

     Harold keeps looking at Maude. The sun on the horizon
     begins slowly to sink.


121      INT. CHASEN'S DEN - DAY

      Mrs. Chasen is talking to Harold.

                       MRS. CHASEN
          Harold, I cannot impress upon
          you too strongly the importance
          of this meeting. She is the
          last girl. The Computer Dating
          Company was reluctant to send
          anyone in view of what they've
          heard. Fortunately, I was able
          to demand they stand by their
          original agreement. But kindly
          remember this is your third
          and final chance.

      The doorbell rings.

                       MRS. CHASEN
          Here she is, now. Please try
          to take this seriously, if not
          for your sake, at least for hers.

     Mrs. Chasen leaves. Harold grits his teeth, and breathes
     deeply. He is going to try. He goes to a mirror and
     straightens his tie.  He hears approaching voices and he
     turns to greet them.

     Mrs. Chasen enters with SUNSHINE DORE, a stringy, long-
     haired actress. Harold goes up to meet her.

                    MRS. CHASEN.
          Harold, I'd like you to meet
          eh, Sunshine Dore. Sunshine's
          an actress.

                    SUNSHINE
          I like to think so.

                    HAROLD
          How do you do?

                    SUNSHINE
          Can't complain.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Well, I'll leave you two alone
          for a moment. I have to call
          my hairdresser. I'll bring back
          some drinks. Harold, perhaps
          Starlight would like a cigarette.

                    SUNSHINE
          Eh, Sunshine.

                    MRS. CHASEN.
          Oh, yes, of course.

     She exits.

                    HAROLD
          Would you like a cigarette?

                    SUNSHINE
          No, thank you. They stain my
          fingers.

      Pause.

                    HAROLD
          Is Sunshine your real name?

                    SUNSHINE
          Well, actually, it was the name
          of my drama teacher - Louis
          Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard
          of him. He was such an influence
          on the development of my instrument.
          That means my body - in theatre
          talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood
          I felt the need to express the
          emerging me in a new form, so I
          took on "Sunshine."
          Dore is my real name... Well,
          Dore, actually. My, what a
          lovely place you have here.

     She goes to the piano.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          Do you play?

                    HAROLD
          No. I'm learning the banjo.
          Do you?

                    SUNSHINE
          Oh, I studied the guitar. I had
          to give it up. Gave me calluses
          on my fingers. As an actress I
          can't afford to have a tarnished
          instrument.

     She picks up a photograph.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          Oh, is this your father?

                    HAROLD
          No. My uncle.

                    SUNSHINE
          Oh, he's in the Army. I do so
          like the military, don't you?
          Those uniforms make men look so
          virile. I did "What Price Glory?"
          in summer stock. I played
          Charmaine - with a French accent.

     She goes over to the mantelpiece.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          Oh, what a wonderful collection
          of knives. May I see them?

     Harold gives up trying.

                    HAROLD
          Certainly.

      He takes one off the wall.

                    HAROLD
               (continuing)
          This one is particularly
          interesting. It's a hari-kari
          blade.

                    SUNSHINE
          Ohhh. What's hari-kari?

                    HAROLD
          An ancient Japanese ceremony.

                    SUNSHINE
          Like a tea ceremony?

                    HAROLD
          No. Like this.

     With gusto he plunges the knife into his belly. He drops
     to his knees bleeding profusely. He continues the upper-
     cut and sidecut gouging with appropriate Oriental screams.
     He stops and tumbles forward - lifeless.

       Sunshine stands in awe.  She slowly bends down.

                    SUNSHINE
          Oh, that was marvelous, Harold.
          It had the ring of truth.
          Harold... Who did you study with?
          ... Oh, I'm sorry. I don't want
          to break into your private moment.
          I know how exhausting true emotion
          can be. I played Juliet at the
          Sunshine Playhouse. Louie thought
          it was my best performance.

     She goes into Juliet.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          What's here? A cup, closed in
          my true love's hand? Poison, I
          see, hath been his timeless end.
          Oh churl! Drink all, and left
          no friendly drop to help me after?
          I will kiss thy lips.

     Harold opens his eyes. He can't believe this.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          Happily some poison yet doth
          hang on them - to make me die
          with a restorative .

     She kisses Harold, who immediately kneels up.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          Thy lips are warm!

     Harold, startled, knocks over an ashtray.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          Yea, noise? Then I'll be brief.
          Oh happy dagger!...

     She takes stunned Harold's dagger, pressing the blade
     back and forth in the handle to see how it operates.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          ... Oh happy dagger! This is
          thy sheath.

     She stabs herself between the breasts.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          There rest--

     She staggers to the couch, clutching the dagger.

                    SUNSHINE
               (continuing)
          - and let me die.

      She collapses and expires.

     Harold gets up. He has never seen anything like it.
     He wanders around the couch as if he was looking at
     an idiot.

     Mrs. Chasen enters with a tray full of drinks, sees
     Sunshine dead on the couch, and drops them all with
     a loud crash. She looks over at a bewildered Harold.
     Summing up the situation, she flings out an accusing
     arm.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Harold! That was your last date!

        Mrs. Chasen stands before a seated Harold looking like a
     queen about to proclaim banishment. (As we DOLLY into
     her during her speech, we hear the hint of a DRUM ROLL.)

                    MRS. CHASEN
          In view of your recent actions,
          Harold, I find you have left me
          with no recourse but to listen to
          the solution proposed by your
          uncle. Consequently, I have
          instructed him to take the necessary
          measures for you to be forthwith
          inducted into the service, and, for
          your own good, to take up active
          duty with the United States Army.

     Harold is thunderstruck - and scared.

        Maude is hoeing weeds in Madame Arouet's garden. Madame
     Arouet is working in the back. Harold comes up to Maude.

                    HAROLD
          Maude, I must speak to you.

                    MAUDE
          What is it, Harold?

                    HAROLD
          They're going to draft me. In
          the Army. I'm going to be sent
          away.

                    MAUDE
          But they can't do that. You
          haven't even got the vote.

                    HAROLD
          But they have.

                    MAUDE
          Well, don't go.

     She obviously is not perturbed about Harold's plight and
     seems more interested in gathering weeds.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          Perhaps war is part of the human
          condition. But it shouldn't be
          encouraged. Bring over that
          wheelbarrow, will you please?

     Harold goes to get the wheelbarrow.

                    HAROLD
          But they'll put me in jail.

                    MAUDE
          Really. Just put it there,
          Harold.

        Harold puts down the wheelbarrow and Maude starts forking
     the weeds into it.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          They'd put you in jail, eh? Well,
          historically you'd be in very
          good company.
               (she laughs)
          That's what my husband used to
          say when we were in the French
          Underground dealing with the
          Gestapo. Would you like to do a
          little raking?
               (she wipes
               her brow)
          Work, I'm told, done with no
          selfish interest, purifies the mind.
          You sink your separate self and
          become one with the universal self.
          On the other hand, senseless labor
          is a bloody bore and should be
          scrupulously avoided.

                    HAROLD
               (very concerned)
          Maude, do you think you can
          help me?

                    MAUDE
          What? With your skill and my
          experience... I think we can come
          up with something.


127D      INT. UNCLE VICTOR'S CAR - DAY

     Uncle Victor and Harold are seated in the back of the
     General's military limousine. As they ride along, Uncle
     Victor is being very expansive. Harold is being unusually
     attentive.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Harold, I want you to look at me
          like your father in this matter.
          We'll spend the day just getting
          to know each other. Now, I know
          that you have no great desire to
          join the Army. Hell, I felt the
          same way myself when I started
          out. But believe me, Harold, once
          you get to know it, you'll love
          it. It's a great life. Look at
          me. A chauffeur. Respect. Money
          in the bank.
               (he looks at
               his empty
               sleeve)
          It has its drawbacks. Like
          anything else, I suppose. But
          the Army takes care of you. You
          join up, and you've got a buddy
          for life.


127E     EXT. A LARGE CITY PARK - DAY

      The General and Harold have left the car and are walking
     along the path.  There are not many people about, mostly
     mothers with small children.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Good idea of yours to come out
          here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.

                    HAROLD
          Thank you, Uncle.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Call me "sir," Harold. First thing
          you learn in the Army - an officer
          deserves your respect.

                    HAROLD
          Yes, sir.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Perfectly lovely. You know, this
          is what we're defending. Everything
          that's good and beautiful in the
          American way of life. Oh, there's
          some nut peace petitioner over there.
          Let's go off this way. Those crazy
          Commie bastards. I don't know why
          we tolerate 'em. Parasites.

     Harold looks over toward the peace petitioner.

                    HAROLD
          Yes, sir.


127F     EXT. A TRAIL IN THE PARK - DAY

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Let's examine the facts on it. I
          say this country has been too harsh
          in its outright condemnation of war.
          I say you can point to many material
          advantages brought about by a crisis
          and conflict policy. Hell, World
          War II gave us the ballpoint pen.
          That's common knowledge.

                    HAROLD
          During wartime the national suicide
          rate goes down.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Is that a fact? Well, that fits
          in right along with everything I've
          been saying. War is not all black.

                    HAROLD
          War is not all black.

     The trail splits in a fork. Harold, it seems, subtly
     leads the General to take the right. They walk on.


127G     EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE PARK - DAY

     The General and Harold sit on a bench overlooking a
     reservoir.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          And so I ask you - why the hell did
          we give up on the Germans? Those
          damn politicians in Washington
          chalked them up on our side and the
          wars ever since have been a national
          disgrace. Hell, look at history.
          The two best wars this country has
          fought were against the Jerries.
          Now I say, get the Krauts on the
          other side of the fence where they
          belong, and let's get back to the
          kind of enemy worth killing and the
          kind of war this whole country can
          support.

                    HAROLD
               (admiringly)
          Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.

      They get up to go.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Well, Harold, I've always been a man
          who speaks his mind. It's hurt me.
          I'm not liked in Washington. I know
          that. But I do have friends in high
          places.

     They walk off toward the reservoir.


127H     EXT. BY THE RESERVOIR - DAY

        They are seated under a tree, close to the dam.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          They came at me from all sides,
          hundreds of 'em. We kept firing -
          Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the
          grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw
          the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe
          said, and kept right on feeding me
          bullets.  Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat!  They
          kept falling, but they kept coming.
          Bullets whizzing all around me.
          Zot! Joe falls back with a neat
          red hole in his head. I thought I
          was done for. But I kept firing.
          Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought
          kept me going. Kill! Kill! For
          Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the
          guys. Kill! - a blinding flash.
          I wake up on a stretcher. "Did
          we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes,
          sir," he said, and I slipped into
          unconsciousness.

                    HAROLD
          Jeez! That's a great story,

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Well, you'll soon have stories like
          that to tell of your own.

                    HAROLD
          You think so, sir?

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Sure. Be able to tell your children.
          Something for them to look up to. Be
          proud of.

                    HAROLD
          I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew
          it could be so exciting.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          It's the greatest excitement in the
          world.

                    HAROLD
               (pensively)
          To pit your own life against another.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          That's right.

                    HAROLD
          To kill. The taste of blood in
          your mouth.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          The moment of truth.

                    HAROLD
               (holding an
               imaginary rifle)
          Another man's life in your sights.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Yes.

                    HAROLD
               (he fires)
          ZAT!

      Harold begins going into a state of catatonic excitement.

                    HAROLD
          Will they really teach me to shoot?

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.

                    HAROLD
          And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Oh sure.

                    HAROLD
          How about hand-to-hand combat?

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Yes.

                    HAROLD
          To strangle someone. Choke him.
          Squeeze out his life between your
          hands.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Eh?

                    HAROLD
          How about to slit his throat?

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Well, I don't...

                    HAROLD
          I'd like that. You could see the
          blood squirt out.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Harold, I think you're getting
          carried away here.

                    HAROLD
          Sir, how about souvenirs?

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Souvenirs?

                    HAROLD
          Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp,
          privates.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Harold!

                    HAROLD
          What's the chance of getting one
          of these?

     He pulls out a shrunken head.

                    HAROLD
               (continuing)
          Boy, to think I could maybe make
          my own.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Harold! That's disgusting!

                    MAUDE'S VOICE
          It certainly is.

     They both look up. Maude is standing by the tree with
     her umbrella and a large peace sign. The General gets
     up.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Who are you?

                    MAUDE
          I am petitioning for peace and I
          came over here to speak...

                    HAROLD
               (jumping up)
          Parasite!

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Harold!

                    HAROLD
          Crazy parasite! Commie bastard!
          Get out of here.

                    MAUDE
          Don't you talk to me like that, you
          little foul mouth degenerate!
               (to General)
          Really, sir, I thought that you at
          least...

                    HAROLD
          Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember
          Nathan Hale, right, sir?

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Harold, calm down! This is...

                    HAROLD
          She's a Commie pig. We're going
          to nail every last one...

                    MAUDE
          Don't you advance on me.

                    HAROLD
          ... of you. You'll all end up
          like this.

     He holds out the shrunken head at her.

                    MAUDE
          Filth! Filth!

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Lady, please. Harold...

                    HAROLD
               (shaking the head)
          Just like this.

                    MAUDE
               (throwing away her sign)
          Give me that.
               (she grabs the head)
          I'm going to throw it in the sewer
          where it belongs.

                    HAROLD
               (stunned)
          She took my head.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Stay where you are, Harold .

                    HAROLD
          She took my head.

                    MAUDE
          Keep away from me, you twisted
          pervert!

                    UNCLE VICTOR
          Lady, please. Give back the head
          and let's have no trouble.

     Harold makes a grab for the head and Maude conks him
     with her umbrella. She turns and runs. Harold picks
     up the peace sign and wielding it like a club follows
     her.

                    HAROLD
          I'll kill her. I'll kill her.

     Maude runs out on the edge of the dam, right past a
     sign saying "Danger - No Trespassing." The water is
     churning below, making a deafening racket. Harold follows
     her. The General runs after him. Maude beats off
     Harold with her umbrella. The General joins the fray
     and most of the blows fall on him. Much ad-libbing.
     Despite only having one arm the General manages to
     pull the sign away from Harold and throw it over the
     dam. It is quickly churned up by the treacherous
     water. Harold is holding Maude's umbrella. Maude is
     gamely trying to hold on to it and at the same time keep
     hold of the shrunken head. The General joins the tussle
     for the umbrella. Furious ad libs as they scuffle.
     The General finally wrenches it free. A pause. Harold
     looks at Maude's position, standing next to the General.
     He reaches over and pulls the General's lanyard. The
     empty sleeve comes flying up for a salute, knocking Maude
     over the dam and into almost certain death amid the
     rushing water below.

     A long pause. The two look down but there is no sign
     of Maude.

        The General, his empty sleeve still at salute, looks
     around him. He can't believe it. Such a tragedy.
     Over nothing. It all happened so fast. How did it
     ever get so out of control? He looks over to Harold
     for some answers. Harold looks up.

                    HAROLD
          I lost my head.


127I     CLOSEUP - UNCLE VICTOR

     On his face the shocking revelation that his nephew
     is a mental deficient.


127J     QUICK CUT MONTAGE

     Very fast shots of - The General's limousine taking off.
                    - Some hands rubber-stamping a file.
                    - The file closed and thrown into an
                      "Out" box
                    - The file being filed in a drawer.
                    - The drawer being slammed shut.


127K      EXT. THE AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

        Three dancing skeletons cackle uproariously. They are
     afixed to dungeon-like doors. Suddenly the doors fly
     open and a little cart carrying Harold and Maude comes
     bursting out. They are laughing.


127L     EXT. LONG SHOT OF THE HAUNTED HOUSE - NIGHT

        Harold and Maude get out of the little cart and walk
     toward the camera.

                    HAROLD
          That wasn't very scary.

                    MAUDE
          No. It had nothing on this afternoon.

                    HAROLD
          Oh, you weren't scared.

                    MAUDE
          Scared? Swimming underwater with
          that oxygen device of yours. I
          was petrified.

                    HAROLD
          Come on, you loved it. It was a
          new experience.

     They both laugh.

                    HAROLD
               (continuing)
          How about some candy floss?

                    MAUDE
          Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration
          without it.


128      EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

        Harold and Maude are walking down the fairway, eating
     candy floss and obviously enjoying themselves very much.


129     EXT. SHOT OF FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT


130      EXT. SHOT OF ROLLER COASTER - NIGHT


131     EXT. SHOT OF MERRY-GO-ROUND - NIGHT


132     INT. PENNY ARCADE ON THE PIER - NIGHT

     Harold and Maude are playing the hand-operated "soccer
     game." Maude puts her whole self into it, cheering
     enthusiastically for every goal she makes.

     People around her, particularly a STAID BANKER and his
     SOCIETY WIFE, look on from their rather dull pursuits.
     In fact, it seems that Harold and Maude are the only
     ones having any fun.

                              DISSOLVE TO:


133     TIME LAPSE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

     Maude and an ITALIAN GROCER have taken on the banker and
     his wife. The latter pair have really entered into the
     spirit of fun and are playing the game with joyous zest.
     A crowd around the table cheers the players on and, as
     is expected, Maude is the center of their delight.


134     INT. PENNY ARCADE - NIGHT

        Back by the wall Harold looks at the group around Maude
     with open admiration. He turns to the machine by him,
     drops in a penny, and begins stamping out something in
     metal.

     Maude and the group play and laugh on in the background.


135     EXT. THE END OF THE PIER - NIGHT

        Harold and Maude walk slowly to the edge.

                    HAROLD
          You sure have a way with people.

                    MAUDE
          Well, they're my species.

      They both laugh and stop at the edge. On the shore -
     the lights of the amusement park. Out in front of them
     - the black ocean and the stars.

                    HAROLD
          Look at the stars.

                    MAUDE
          Yes. They're old friends.

                    HAROLD
          Do you think there is any life
          up there?

                    MAUDE
          I don't know. Perhaps.

                    HAROLD
          Science thinks there isn't.
          That we are all alone in the
          universe.

                    MAUDE
          We are alone - you and me and
          everybody. But we can look at
          those stars and maybe someone
          down the beach or across the
          sea in China is looking at them,
          too. Someone we don't know
          and most likely will never see
          - that someone is breathing
          along with us. And the star-
          gazers of the past - from
          peasant to princes - and the
          star-gazers of the future -
          all of us breathing and looking
          up there. We are alone - but
          look at the stars and never
          feel lonely.

                    HAROLD
          You should have been a poet.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, no. But I should have
          liked to have been an astronaut.
          A private astronaut able to
          just go out and explore. Like
          the men who sailed with Magellan,
          I want to see if we really can
          fall off the edge of the world.
               (fluttery laugh)
          What a joke it will be if like
          them I -

     She makes a circle with her arm.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          - end where I began.

                    HAROLD
          Maude.

                    MAUDE
          Yes.

                    HAROLD
          Here.

     He gives her the little piece of metal.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, a gift.

     She reads it.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          "Harold loves Maude."

      She looks up. Harold is blushing.

                    MAUDE
               (softly)
          And Maude loves Harold.

     They both smile at each other.

                    MAUDE
          Ohhhhh! This is the nicest
          present I've received in years.

     She kisses it and tosses it happily into the ocean. She
     turns back to Harold. His face is one of disbelief. He
     looks out to the ocean and then back to Maude. He begins
     to form the word "Why?"

                    MAUDE
          So I'll always know where it is.

     Harold accepts that. Women, after all, are strange
     creatures. Maude smiles.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          Come. Give me your arm. Let's
          go see the fireworks .

     Harold offers his arm and they walk off down the pier.


136     EXT. THE NIGHT SKY

      The beautiful burst of a skyrocket.


137      INT. MAUDE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

        Harold and Maude sit at the piano. They are playing in
     duet the Love Waltz that they danced to. At the con-
     clusion they congratulate themselves delightedly. Harold
     gestures to the top of the piano.

                    HAROLD
          Why are there no photographs
          in these frames?

                    MAUDE
          I took them out.

                    HAROLD
          Why?

                    MAUDE
          They mocked me. They were
          representations of people I
          dearly loved yet they knew
          these people were gradually
          fading from me, and that in
          time all I would have left would
          be vague feelings - but sharp
          photographs! So I tossed them
          out. My memory fades, I know.
          But I prefer pictures made by
          me with feeling, and not by
          Kodak with silver nitrate.

                    HAROLD
          I'll never forget you, Maude.
               (pause)
          But I would like a photo of
          you.

      She laughs.

                    MAUDE
          Well, let me see.

     She goes to the end of the bed and from beneath it, pulls
     out an old box. She opens it and looks about.

                    MAUDE
          I have something somewhere.
          Let me see.

     She takes out some papers.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          Oh, yes. Here. Take this.

     She pulls a photo from a document and hands it to Harold.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          It's off my American visa.

     They both sit on the edge of the bed. The fire burns
     in the fireplace in front of them.

                    HAROLD
          It looks like you. Thanks.

                    MAUDE
          Harold, that picture is almost
          twenty-five years old.

                    HAROLD
          You haven't changed a bit. I'll
          put it in my wallet.

     He drops a cardboard clipping and hurriedly retrieves it.

                    HAROLD
          Oh, you're not supposed to see
          that.

     He turns away and puts them both in his wallet.

                    HAROLD
               (continuing)
          It's part of a surprise I'm
          planning for tomorrow night.
          It's going to be really...
               (he turns around)
          Maude, you're crying.

     She holds the visa in her hand.

                    MAUDE
          I was remembering how much this
          meant to me. It was after the
          war... I had nothing... except
          my life. How different I was
          then - and yet how the same.

                    HAROLD
          You've never cried before. I
          never thought you would. I
          thought, despite anything, you
          could always be happy.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, Harold. You are so young.

     She strokes his hair. The tears continue to fall.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          What have they taught you?
          Yes. I cry. I cry for you.
          I cry for this.
               (the visa)
          I cry at beauty - a first snow,
          a rose, a sunset.

     As she talks through her tears, Harold is very moved.
     He takes her hand.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          I cry when a man tortures his
          brother... when he repents and
          begs forgiveness... when
          forgiveness is refused... and
          when it is granted. To cry is
          to laugh. To laugh is to cry
          ... a uniquely human trait.
          And the main thing in life, my
          dear Harold, is not to be
          afraid to be human.

     They sit facing each other on the end of the bed. We
     see from the bed the fire glowing behind them. Harold
     brushes the tears from her eyes. He leans forward and
     kisses her lightly on the lips.

     They part for a moment. Then both lean forward and
     kiss again, break and fall back onto the bed and OUT
     OF CAMERA. The CAMERA ZOOMS SLOWLY FORWARD into the
     fire. HOLD.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

138     THE NIGHT MONTAGE - WITH MUSIC

     A lot of the sequence is soft focus, blurred edges, and
     supered with colored carnival lights.

     The images are not meant to appear overtly sexual but
     rather - lyrically sensual - and fun!


139     HAROLD AND MAUDE

     together in a Ferris Wheel as it begins to rise to the
     heights.


140     HAROLD AND MAUDE ON A MERRY-GO-ROUND

     holding hands across the aisle as their horses alternately
     go up and down.


141     HAROLD AND MAUDE

     on a roller coaster as it speeds around a curve and
     plunges downhill. As it speeds around another curve
     we burst into:


142     FIREWORKS

     A hundred skyrockets bursting in air, with much NOISE.
     The noise fades.


143     HAROLD AND MAUDE

     lying on the grass, looking up at the fireworks reflected
     in their faces. Their heads are nestled against each
     other's shoulders. They look at each other and smile.
     Harold lifts his outside arm and lays it around his head.
     Maude puts her outside hand in his. They hold this
     position and stare into each other's eyes, as the CAMERA
     BEGINS A VERTICAL RISE.

                              DISSOLVE BACK TO:


144     THE FIRE IN MAUDE'S APARTMENT

     at the same CAMERA POSITION that we went out on. The
     fire is now out. The grate is cold. It is daylight.

     We HEAR a cock crow.


145     INT. MAUDE'S APARTMENT - DAY

        TIGHT SHOT of a hand picking cigarette ash into an ash-
     tray. We PAN over and see that it is Harold sitting up
     in bed, bare-chested, casually smoking. He takes a deep
     drag and blows the smoke out in a manner that is decidedly
     sexual. He smiles and looks down to his left.

     We PAN OVER to include Maude lying beside him, the covers
     demurely pulled up to her chin. She catches Harold's
     smile and blushes coyly.


146     INT. CHASEN'S DEN - DAY

      Mrs. Chasen is on the phone.

                       MRS. CHASEN
          Fay, darling, I know Rene will
          be furious but if you knew what
          I've had to put up with in the
          last couple of days...

     Harold enters.

                    HAROLD
          Mother.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Not now, Harold...
               (into the phone)
          You can't put me down for Monday?

                    HAROLD
          Mother.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Harold, please! I'm on the
          phone.

                    HAROLD
          Mother. I'm going to get
          married.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Fay, I'll call you back.
               (she hangs up)
          What did you say?

                    HAROLD
          I'm getting married.

                    MRS. CHASEN
               (pause)
          To whom?

                    HAROLD
          To a girl. Here.

     He takes his wallet with the series of photos on it,
     flips to one, and hands it to Mrs. Chasen. She looks
     at it for a moment. She looks up.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          I suppose you think this is
          very funny, Harold.

                    HAROLD
          What?

                    MRS. CHASEN
          A sunflower?

     She hands Harold back the wallet. It is indeed the
     picture of a large sunflower, clipped from a dealer's
     catalog. Harold, a little ruffled, finds the correct
     photo of Maude and hands it to his mother.

     Mrs. Chasen examines it. She squints her eyes to clear
     her vision and looks again.

                    MRS. CHASEN
               (in a strained voice)
          You can't be serious?


147      CLOSEUP - HAROLD

     He smiles proudly.


148      INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

     Mrs. Chasen is lying on the couch. She turns to the
     psychiatrist.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          He's serious.


149      INT. UNCLE VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

     Uncle Victor sits at his desk. A picture of the Presi-
     dent of the United States is over his right shoulder.
     He is addressing the camera as the President addresses
     the nation.

                    UNCLE VICTOR
               (a painful confrontation)
          Harold, your mother has spoken to me
          about your marriage plan, and though
          normally I have nothing against
          marriage, I don't think this is eh...
          quite normal. Now, I don't want to
          remind you of the unpleasant incident
          that occurred the other day. I think
          it is best if we consider that
          forgotten. But I do think that it
          would be wisest for you not to leave
          the house or indulge in any kind of
          activity that would be newsworthy.
          This marriage would attract attention,
          and, frankly Harold, I don't think you
          need a wife. You need a nurse.


150     INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

        The psychiatrist sits at his desk. A picture of Sigmund
     Freud is over his right shoulder. He too seems to be
     addressing the nation.

                    PSYCHIATRIST
          There's no doubt, Harold, this
          impending marriage adds another
          chapter to an already fascinating
          case. But let us examine it, and
          I think you'll realize there is a
          simple Freudian explanation for
          your romantic attachment to this
          older woman. It is known as the
          Oedipus Complex, a very common
          neurosis, particularly in this
          society, whereby the male child
          subconsciously wishes to sleep
          with his mother.

          Of course, what puzzles me,
          Harold, is that you want to
          sleep with your grandmother.


151      INT. PRIEST'S OFFICE - DAY

        It is the same little old priest we have met earlier.
     He sits at his desk and addresses the camera like a TV
     audience. A picture of the Pope is over his right
     shoulder; a picture of Jesus Christ over his left.

                    PRIEST
               (very reasoned and slow)
          Now, Harold, the Church has
          nothing against the union of
          the old and the young. Each
          age has its own beauty. But a
          marital union is concerned with
          the conjugal rights. And the
          procreation of children. I
          would be remiss in my duties if
          I did not tell you that the
          idea of --
               (he swallows)
          - intercourse - the fact of
          your young, firm --
               (growing
               disturbed)
          -- body commingling with the
          withered flesh, sagging breasts,
          and flabby buttocks - makes me --
               (falls apart)
          - want to vomit.


152     INT. CHASEN'S DEN - CLOSEUP - HAROLD - DAY

                       HAROLD.
          But you didn't ask if I love
          her.


153      INSERTS - THREE FAST CLOSEUPS

       of Uncle Victor, the psychiatrist, and the priest, as
     they register a chagrined reaction to Harold.


154      INT. CHASEN'S DEN - DAY

        The CLOSEUP HAROLD in Shot 152 is PULLED BACK to include
     Mrs. Chasen.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Love? Love? What do you know
          about her? Where does she come
          from? Where did you meet her?

                    HAROLD
          At a funeral.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Oh... That's wonderful... I
          get an eighty-year-old pallbearer
          for a daughter-in-law! Be
          reasonable, Harold! You're
          dealing with your life! What
          will people say?!

                    HAROLD
          I don't care what people say.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          You don't care! "Miss Shroud
          of 1890 Weds the Boy of a
          Thousand Deaths!" Listen to me...

      Harold gets up to go.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          What are you doing, Harold?
          You can't leave me.

     She follows him to the door.

                    MRS. CHASEN
               (continuing)
          Where are you going?

     He turns at the door.

                    HAROLD
          I'm going to marry the woman
          I love.

                    MRS. CHASEN
          Harold!

      A pause.

                    MRS. CHASEN
               (continuing;
               quietly)
          This is insane.

                    HAROLD
          Perhaps it is.

     He leaves.


155     INT. MAUDE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

       In the hallway Harold and Maude are giggling as Harold
     finishes putting a blindfold around Maude's eyes.

                    HAROLD
          I hope that isn't too tight.
          Okay. Here we go.

     He opens the door leading her by the hand.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, I love surprises! Makes me
          feel so - chiffon!


156     INT. MAUDE'S APARTMENT - THE MAIN ROOM

     The door opens and Harold leads in Maude. He stands
     Maude in front of the CAMERA and with theatrical bravado
     removes the handkerchief. She blinks and looks around.
     A radiant joy fills her face.


157     MAUDE'S POV

        The room is filled with over a hundred sunflowers.
     Hanging over the fireplace is a banner saying:

               "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAUDE"


158     MED. SHOT - HAROLD AND MAUDE

                    MAUDE
          Oh, Harold, it is dazzling.
          They are all so... so beautiful!

     Harold begins humming the Love Waltz.

                    HAROLD
          This way, m'lady.

     He dances Maude over to the table.

                    HAROLD
               (continuing)
          Supper for two.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, you've thought of everything.
          And champagne.

                    HAROLD
               (imitating her)
          It's all right. It's organic.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, Harold.
               (fluttery laugh)

                    HAROLD
          For you.

     He hands her a single daisy in a vase. Maude takes out
     the daisy and smiles.

                    HAROLD
               (continuing)
          And after dinner, one more
          surprise....

     He puts a tiny ring box on the table.

                    HAROLD
               (continuing)
          ... which I hope will make
          you very happy.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, I am happy, Harold.
          Ecstatically happy. I couldn't
          imagine a lovelier farewell.

                    HAROLD
          Farewell?

                    MAUDE
          Why yes. It's my eightieth
          birthday.

                    HAROLD
          But you're not going anywhere, are you?

                    MAUDE
          Oh yes, dear. I took the pills
          an hour ago. I should be gone
          by midnight.


159     CLOSEUP - HAROLD

      He can't believe it.


160     CLOSEUP - MAUDE

     She smiles.


161     CLOSEUP - HAROLD

      He believes it.

                               QUICK CUT TO:


162      EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT

      With SIRENS WAILING, an ambulance tears around a corner.
     Cars pull over as it speeds down the street.


163     INT. THE AMBULANCE - NIGHT

        Maude is lying down. She holds the daisy in her hand.
     She would be perfectly happy but for her concern over
     Harold, who is highly overwrought and crying desperately.

     He is kneeling beside her. The SIRENS WAIL loudly
     outside.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.
               (fluttery laugh)
          So unnecessary.

                    HAROLD
          Maude, please. Don't die.
          I couldn't bear it. Please,
          don't die.

                    MAUDE
          But, Harold, we begin to die
          as soon as we are born. What
          is so strange about death? It's
          no surprise. It's part of
          life. It's change.

                    HAROLD
          But why now?

                    MAUDE
          I thought eighty was a good
          round number.

      She giggles.

                    MAUDE
               (continuing)
          I feel giddy.

                    HAROLD
          But Maude, you don't understand.
          I love you. Do you hear me?
          I've never said that to anyone
          in my life before. You're the
          first. Maude. Please don't
          leave me.

                    MAUDE
          Oh, Harold, don't upset
          yourself so.

                    HAROLD
          It's true. I can't live without
          you.

                    MAUDE
               (smiles warmly)
          "And this too shall pass away."

                    HAROLD
          Never! Never! I'll never forget
          you. I wanted to marry you.
          Don't you understand! I love
          you. I love you!

                    MAUDE
          Oh! That's wonderful, Harold.
          Go - and love some more.


164      EXT. THE PARKING LOT OF HOSPITAL EMERGENCY - NIGHT

       The ambulance SCREAMS in and stops. The two attendants
     open up the back. They slide Maude onto a gurney and
     wheel her toward the door.

                    HAROLD
          Hold on, Maude! Hold on!
          We'll be there soon. Please,
          just hold on.

     He runs ahead.

                    MAUDE
          Hold on?  Hold on?
               (fluttery laugh)
          Oh, Harold, how absurd.

     Harold goes to push open the doors. They open auto-
     matically. Maude is wheeled through.


165     INT. AT THE EMERGENCY RECEIVING DESK - NIGHT

        A feisty, old, redheaded NURSE is explaining operations
     to a rather simpleminded STUDENT NURSE.

     A GANGLING INTERN with horn-rimmed glasses looks on.

     Maude enters on the gurney. The ambulance men move
     off to the back counter and talk as they fill out their
     forms.

     Harold is almost hysterical.

     Maude, on the other hand, is very calm. She holds the
     daisy and hums to herself Maude's Song.

     (NOTE: This scene goes very fast with much of the
     dialogue dovetailed and ad libs overlapping in the
     background.)

                    HAROLD
          Please. There's been an
          accident, an overdose of pills.
          We've got to see a doctor. It's
          an emergency.

                    HEAD NURSE
          All right, now go ahead and
          get the particulars.

                    STUDENT NURSE
          Eh, what's your name?

                    HAROLD
          It's not me. It's her.

                    HEAD NURSE
          It's better to begin by asking
          last name first, then first
          name, then middle name or
          initial, if any. It saves
          time.

                    STUDENT NURSE
          What is your last name?

                    MAUDE
          Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But
          you may call me Maude.

                    HAROLD
          Please! She has got to see a
          doctor right away.

                    HEAD NURSE
          Young man, perhaps you ought to
          wait in the waiting room.

                    STUDENT NURSE
          How old are you?

                    MAUDE
          Eighty. It's my birthday.

                    STUDENT NURSE
          Oh, many happy returns.

                    MAUDE
          No. I don't think so.

                    HAROLD
          You don't understand. She's
          taken an overdose of pills two
          hours ago. She hasn't got much
          time.

     The intern creeps round from behind.

                    INTERN
          Could I have your signature on
          this? It's just a formality.

                    MAUDE
          Delighted! I like your hair so
          much.

     She signs.

                    INTERN
          It's in case of damage claims,
          you know, so we - the hospital
          - won't be responsible for...

                    HEAD NURSE
               (to student nurse)
          Always use a ballpoint pen.
          It's more efficient.

                    HAROLD
          Please, don't you realize?
          She is dying.

                    MAUDE
          Well, not dying, actually.
          I'm changing. You know, like
          from winter to spring. Of
          course, it is a big step to
          take.

                    INTERN
          Not that anything regrettable
          is going to happen. It's just
          regulations .

                    HEAD NURSE
          Well, then, perhaps you'd
          better skip the preliminaries
          and get to the important section.

                    STUDENT NURSE
          All right. Ah, what is your
          Social Security number?

                    INTERN
          Purely a legal safeguard.
          Nothing personal, you understand.

                    HEAD NURSE
          No. Ask about the insurance.
          The hospital insurance.

                    STUDENT NURSE
          Do you have any insurance?
          Blue Cross? Blue Shield?

                    MAUDE
          Insurance against what?

                    STUDENT NURSE
          No insurance.

      She notes it down.

                    HAROLD
          This is madness.

                    HEAD NURSE
          I'm sorry but there is always
          a two-hour wait for the
          psychiatrist.

                    INTERN
          It's nothing personal. It's
          my job.

     A DOCTOR and TWO NURSES enter.

                    DOCTOR
          What's the trouble?

                    HEAD NURSE
          An overdose of drugs .

                    STUDENT NURSE
          Do you have a welfare plan at
          your place of employment?

                    MAUDE
          I'm retired.

                    HAROLD
          Doctor, please. She has taken
          these pills. You've got to
          do something .

                    DOCTOR
          All right. Take her in there.

     They start wheeling her away.

                    INTERN
          It's nothing personal.

                    STUDENT NURSE
          And who's the next of kin?

                    MAUDE
          Humanity...

     She holds the daisy in her hand. She waves to Harold
     as they push her through the doors.

                    MAUDE
          Farewell, Harold. It's been
          all such fun.

     The doors swing shut. She is gone. Harold stands alone.

                              DISSOLVE TO:


166     INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT TO DAY

     CAMERA LOCKED DOWN. Harold sits on a couch. To his
     right is a window, to his left a chair and a lighted
     lamp. He waits.

                              SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


167     SHOT

     Harold sits in the chair. He waits.

                              SLOW DISSOLVE TO:


168      ANOTHER ANGLE

     Harold stands by the window. It is dawn. The lights
     go out. It is daylight. We HEAR the laughter of a
     baby.


169     CLOSEUP - HAROLD

     He is looking out the window.


170     HAROLD'S POV

        Down on the lawn we see a MOTHER playing with her BABY.
     He is squealing with delight as she lifts him high into
     the air again and again.


171      EXT. THE HOSPITAL LAWN - CLOSEUP - DAY

     of the mother and the laughing baby.


172      THEIR POV

     We see Harold standing forlorn at the window.


173      ANOTHER ANGLE

     The doctor comes up to speak to him. The doctor shakes
     his head.


174      THEIR POV

     Harold turns back to the window. The doctor leaves.
     All the time the baby is laughing.


175     CLOSEUP - HAROLD

        We see Harold through the window screen. He is crying.

     He can HEAR the baby's laughter. He turns and walks away.


176     INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

     Harold is crying. He walks down the hospital corridor.


177     HIS POV - THE MATERNITY WARD

     He passes the maternity ward. Laughing parents pointing
     at screaming infants. Their noise overrides the
     laughing baby and joins the rising intensity of the
     MUSIC.


178     BACK TO HAROLD

     Harold walks faster. His face is drawn with pain and tears.

     We TRACK before him. He looks left and sees:


179      A WOMAN

     in a room, delirious with pain.


180      A MAN

     in disheveled pajamas walks from his room like a
     bewildered child, dribbling food down his front.


181      BACK TO HAROLD

     He keeps walking fast. He looks right and sees:


182     A FAMILY GROUP

     who have just been told of a death. They cry in each
     other's arms.

     A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY confused, looks up at them, and
     begins to sob.

                              QUICK CUT TO:


183     EXT. A SEA CLIFF ROAD - DAY

     Harold's mini hearse swerves around the corner at high
     speed. Dust rises and tires screech.

        On the TRACK the crying has stopped but the MUSIC is
     building to a new climax.

                              CUT TO:


184     INT. HAROLD'S HEARSE - DAY

     Harold, ignoring the tears rolling down his cheeks,
     grips the wheel hard and drives like a man with an
     unrelenting purpose.


185     EXT. THE ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF

     We see them from the car window.


186     ANGLE - THE CAR

     dangerously close to the edge.


187     CLOSEUP - HAROLD

     He seems possessed.


188       LOW ANGLE SHOT FROM THE FRONT BUMPER OF THE CAR

     The road rushes past as we maneuver around treacherous
     curves.


189     EXT. THE ROCKS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CLIFF


190     CLOSEUP - HAROLD

     He makes a sudden right-hand turn and drives out on a
     promontory toward the sea.


191     LOW ANGLE SHOT FROM THE FRONT BUMPER OF THE CAR

     We see dirt and grass race beneath us -

     We bump over rocks -


192     ANGLE

     We see the edge.


193     ANOTHER ANGLE

     We reach the edge of the cliff - we plunge off into
     space....


194     EXT. THE PROMONTORY - EXTREME LONG SHOT - DAY

        The little hearse falls from the cliff, crashing at the
     bottom, and bursting into flame.


195      EXT. ON TOP OF THE CLIFF - DAY

     We look down at the burning vehicle. We HOLD and watch
     it burn.


196     LONG SHOT

     Gradually the fire dies down.

     Suddenly we hear the fumbled pluckings of Maude's Song
     on a banjo. It stops.


197     PANNING SHOT

     We PAN up left and there is Harold as large as life.
     He takes a look over the cliff.


198     HIS POV

     His hearse is still quietly burning.


199     BACK TO HAROLD

     He wipes his nose with the back of his hand and tries
     again on the banjo.

     He barely gets the melody started before he is lost.
     Summoning up all his concentration, he tries again, and
     this time he manages to get the fingering right. He
     continues playing and turns away from the edge.


200     EXT. TRACKING SHOT IN FRONT OF HAROLD - DAY

     He started slow but now he is gradually beginning to
     play the song in its original upbeat tempo. He gets
     better and better at it. The song is very catching
     and Harold's tear-stained face registers what could
     be a smile. He walks by the CAMERA and we turn with
     him, and HOLD.

     A full orchestra joins in the playing and we watch
     Harold amble down the road, strumming along, until he
     is only a small figure in the distance.

                              FADE OUT.




                    THE END
