A burn victim, a nurse, a thief, and a sapper find themselves in each others company in an old Italian villa close to the end of World War II.
Through flashbacks, we see the life of the burn victim, whose passionate love of a woman and choices he made for her ultimately change the lives of one other person in the villa.
Not only is this film a search for the identity of the English patient, but a search for the identities of all the people in the quiet old villa.
