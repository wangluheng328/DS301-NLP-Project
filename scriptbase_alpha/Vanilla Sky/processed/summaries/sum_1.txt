David Aames takes all he has for granted; his wealth, his inherited publishing company, his good looks - his relationships.
Especially his relationships.
It catches up to him when a friend/sometimes sex-partner can't see their relationship the way he sees it.
From that point, the movie takes a Lynchian twist that ultimately and literally pulls us into Aames' tortured psyche.
