Edward is a rich, ruthless businessman who specializes in taking over companies and then selling them off piece by piece.
He travels to Los Angeles for a business trip and decides to hire a prostitute.
They take a liking to each other and he offers her money if she'll stay with him for an entire week while he makes the "rich and famous" scene (since it doesn't do for a man of his stature to be alone at society parties and polo matches).
Romantic comedy (and complications) ensue.
