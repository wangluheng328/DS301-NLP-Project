                           Ethan Coen, Joel Coen, and Sam Raimi

                                   September 1992 Draft

<b>

</b>
               No image. A bleak WIND MOANS. HOLD.

               With a STINGING CHORD we --

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT (CIRCA 1958)
</b>
               Lights twinkle. Snow falls. The WIND MOANS.

               After a beat, the voice of an elderly black man:

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         The's right... New York.

               We are TRACKING HIGH THROUGH the night sky. From the streets 
               far below we hear the sounds of TRAFFIC muffled by the falling 
               snow, and the DISTANT sound of many VOICES SINGING.

               We are DRIFTING AMONG the buildings; the tops of skyscrapers 
               slip by left and right.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         It's 1958 -- anyway, for a few mo' 
                         minutes it is. Come midnight it's 
                         gonna be 1959. A whole 'nother 
                         feelin'. The New Year. The future...

               The SINGING, a little MORE AUDIBLE, but still not close, is 
               "Auld Lang Syne."

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Yeah ole daddy Earth fixin' to 
                         start one mo' trip 'round the sun, 
                         an' evvybody hopin' this ride 'round 
                         be a little mo' giddy, a little mo' 
                         gay...

               We are MOVING IN TOWARDS a particular skyscraper. At its top 
               is a large illuminated clock.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         Yep...

               We hear a SERIES OF POPPING sounds.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...All over town champagne corks is 
                         a-poppin'.

               A big band WALTZ MIXES UP on the track.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Over in the Waldorf the big shots 
                         is dancin' to the strains of Guy 
                         Lombardo... Down in Times Square the 
                         little folks is a-watchin' and a-
                         waitin' fo' that big ball to drop...

               The LOMBARDO MUSIC gives way to the CHANTING of a distant 
               CROWD: "Sixty! Fifty-nine! Fifty-eight!"

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...They all tryin' to catch holt a 
                         one moment of time...

               The CHANTING has MIXED back DOWN AGAIN TO leave only the 
               WIND. Still TRACKING IN TOWARD the top of the skyscraper, we 
               begin to hear the TICK of its enormous CLOCK. The clock reads 
               a minute to twelve. Above it, in neon, a company's name: 
               "HUDSUCKER INDUSTRIES." Below it, in neon, the company's 
               motto: "THE FUTURE IS NOW."

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...to be able to say -- 'Right now! 
                         This is it! I got it!' 'Course by 
                         then it'll be past.
                              (more cheerfully)
                         But they all happy, evvybody havin' 
                         a good time.

               We are MOVING IN ON a darkened penthouse window next to the 
               clock. The window starts to open.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Well, almost evvybody. They's a 
                         few lost souls floatin' 'round out 
                         there...

               A young man is crawling out of the window onto the ledge.  
               With the opening of the window, "AULD LANG SYNE" filters out 
               with greater volume.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...This one's Norville Barnes.

               The man gingerly straightens up on the ledge. He is perhaps 
               in his late twenties. He wears a leather apron. Printed on 
               the apron: "HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future is Now."

               He looks with nervous determination into the void.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Let's move in for a closer look.

               The CAMERA obliges. We TRACK IN SLOWLY, ENDING VERY CLOSE.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...That office he jes stepped out of 
                         is the office of the president of 
                         Hudsucker Industries. It's his 
                         office...

               Norville sways in anguish as the TICKING of the CLOCK grows 
               louder and the WIND blows in his face.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...How'd he get so high? An' why is 
                         he feelin' so low? Is he really gonna 
                         do it -- is Norville really gonna 
                         jelly up the sidewalk?

               Norville is tensing his body, peering out over the ledge, 
               preparing to make a swan dive into oblivion -- but the 
               CAMERA'S continued MOVEMENT is LOSING him FROM FRAME.

               We are MOVING IN ON the enormous CLOCK, whose MECHANICAL 
               THRUM becomes very loud indeed.

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Well the future, that's something 
                         you can't never tell about...

               The second hand of the clock is nearing the twelve -- bare 
               seconds to midnight. Distant CHANTING from Times Square MIXES 
               UP: "Nine! Eight! Seven!"

<b>                                     NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>                         ...But the past... That's another 
                         story...

               The sign is over a ground floor office; an exterior clock 
               shows 9:00. A curtain is just being pulled open in its picture 
               window to reveal a great job board. It is like the departures

               vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug 
               into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads,

               His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. He idly stirs 
               his coffee with his spoon.

               He takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down 
               on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change,

               Hudsucker looks up from his watch, smiles, runs his palms 
               back over his fringe of hair.

               Hudsucker pulls his sleeve cuffs to expose just the right 
               amount under the suit.

               large picture window. He rises to his feet, slowly and 
               deliberately, and rubs his palms together.

               He swings his chair out.

               his nose.

               We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.

               SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall middle-
               aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a 
               commanding presence.

               He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his 
               knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in.

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board members' 
               heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately 
               for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader. 
               Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers.

               Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair.

               He reaches over to pluck the smoking cigar from the suicide's 
               ashtray.

               The other board members unfreeze, their worst fears confirmed.

               Kloppitt, Jr.

<b>                                     NORVILLE

                         He was on, uh...

               He is COASTING ACROSS the "K" mail slots, finally COMES TO 
               Max Kloppitt, Sr. His hand moves to the next slot, Max 
               Kloppitt, Jr. This slot is half the size of all the others. 
               The envelope will not fit in.

               He frowns.

               He is about to fold the envelope, but notices something 
               stamped in red on its face. DO NOT FOLD.

               Norville frowns. As he stares at the envelope, we see 
               envelopes swishing across the f.g., whipping one by one in 
               rapid succession, left to right.

               An old man sitting at the adjacent shelf, sorting mail.

               Without ever even looking up, with a constant high-speed 
               back and forth flicking of his right hand, he is whisking 
               pieces of mail one by one out of the pile of mail in his 
               left hand.

               As his letters fly furiously but neatly into their mail slots.

<b>               NORVILLE

               He raises his voice over the mailroom din:

</b>                         Say, what do you do when the envelope 
                         is too big for the slot?

               The ANCIENT SORTER considers this as he continues whisking 
               his mail.

               Norville takes out a pencil and writes on the face of the 
               envelope:

                         sweet baby...

               Norville is taking an envelope from his pocket and handing 
               it to the Ancient Sorter.

                         secret...

               The Ancient Sorter is pulling a ragged piece of paper from 
               the envelope. On the paper is a crudely-drawn circle.

                         Yessir, this is my ticket upstairs.

               The Ancient Sorter looks questioningly from the circle to 
               Norville.

                         ...You know, for kids!

               The Ancient Sorter nods with feigned understanding as Norville 
               takes the paper back.

               Mail carts and other paraphernalia are abruptly swept out of 
               the crowded aisle to form a clear path running down to an 
               elevator in the b.g.

               With a SIREN SOUND, a light above the elevator goes on.

               The elevator door sweeps open. It reveals a wall into which 
               a four-foot high hinged door is set.

               This door swings open and an old dwarf emerges: Old man 
               HUTCHINSON, the boss of the mailroom. He emerges from the 
               blinding light of the interior of the elevator.

               He is holding aloft a letter.

               He takes loping drawf strides down the aisle.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE

               The Ancient Sorter is leaning over to whisper into Norville's 
               ear.

               Norville looks over his shoulder, but the Ancient Sorter has 
               disappeared.

               As he points, the people around Norville shrink away.

               DRAMATIC TRACK IN ON Norville. As Hutchinson talks, he thrusts 
               the blue letter into Norville's face. Norville looks at it 
               with terrific apprehension. As Hutchinson's speech ends, we 
               are TIGHT ON Norville's sweating face.

               ROCKETING OPEN. We MOVE IN ON the young elevator operator 
               who leers INTO CAMERA. He wears a brass-buttoned uniform, 
               white gloves and a pillbox hat. The name BUZZ is stitched 
               onto his breast pocket.

               As Norville enters the elevators:

                         the fuzz...

               He lifts his pillbox hat to reveal a white crewcut, then 
               lets the elastic chin strap snap the cap back down onto his 
               head.

<b>                                     BUZZ
</b>                         ...I make the elevator do what she 
                         duzz!

               He holds out his hand but as Norville reaches to shake it he 
               snaps it away and pats down his crewcut:

<b>                                     BUZZ
</b>                         ...Hang it up to dry.

               He cackles and powers the ELEVATOR into GEAR. Norville's 
               knees buckle under a huge upward surge; Buzz is accustomed 
               to it.

                         up to the top floor and thirty seconds 
                         to get down?

               With a powerful DOWN-SHIFTING SOUND, Buzz brakes the elevator 
               to a sharp halt. Norville continues upward with the inertia, 
               painfully smacking his head against a corner of the elevator.

               Buzz opens the door and a couple of people enter.

                         step to the rear; here comes 
                         gargantuan Mr. Grier.

               An obese MAN enters, smoking a cigar:

               Buzz has already thrown the doors shut and sent the elevator 
               into its power-rise. Norville, bracing himself now, sinks 
               only a little under the G-force.

               He turns to look at Norville.

                         blue letter?!

               All heads in the elevator turn, aghast, to look, and those 
               near Norville shrink away.

               The ELEVATOR SCREAMS into overdrive and we:

               The door sweeps shut. Norville looks nervously around.

               Behind him the elevator doors suddenly open again.

               The elevator doors slam shut and we hear its ENGINES SCREAM 
               as it power-dives away.

               Norville turns toward the executive offices.

               Plush, thick-carpeted silence.

               Norville starts walking.

               A SCRAPING SOUND stands out in the high-powered executive 
               quiet. Norville looks to one side.

               A workman in painter's overalls squats in front of a pair of 
               heavy oak doors. With a razor blade he is scraping off the 
               name "WARING HUDSUCKER."

<b>                                     NORVILLE
</b>                         ...Mr. Mussburger's office?

               The scraper looks sullenly over his shoulder at Norville.

               With a jerk of his thumb he indicates the direction.

               Norville enters the adjacent office.

<b>               OUTER OFFICE
</b>
               Two secretaries are in Mussburger's outer reception office. 
               The first is a filing secretary who stands frozen in the 
               f.g., her hand poised over an open drawer to deposit a folder, 
               as she stares at Norville with an amused and supercilious 
               sneer which stays pasted on throughout.

               The second secretary -- the RECEPTIONIST -- is seated behind 
               a desk in the b.g. that flanks the door to Mussburger's 
               private office. The Receptionist sits with her hands clasped 
               on the desk, staring at Norville with the hunch-shouldered 
               down-from-under look of a patient vulture.

<b>                                     RECEPTIONIST

               The filing secretary sneers.

               She opens an enormous leather-bound book with yellowed crinkly 
               pages.

               A low, unearthly WAIL fills the room, the sound of a million 
               souls moaning in purgatory.

               The Receptionist looks up.

<b>               FAST TRACK IN ON SNEERING FILE SECRETARY

               who is no longer sneering. Her mouth is stretched wide as 
               she wails and her finger points...

<b>               FAST TRACK IN ON BLUE LETTER
</b>
               that Norville holds innocently at his side.

<b>               BACK TO TRACK IN ON WAILING SECRETARY
</b>
               As her wail becomes deafening and we TRACK INTO her mouth 
               and the SCREEN GOES BLACK and:

<b>               CLICK
</b>
               The blackness and the wailing are both cut short by the sound 
               of a DOOR OPENING. We are:

<b>               INT. MUSSBURGER'S OFFICE
</b>
               its door swinging open to admit Norville.

               In the b.g., in the outer office, we can see the filing 
               secretary leaning back motionless in a chair with a damp rag 
               draped across her forehead. The Receptionist is fanning her 
               with a towel.

               The door closes behind Norville.

               We hear a rhythmic CLICK-CLICK-CLICK and the HUM of 
<b>               VENTILATION.
</b>
<b>               NORVILLE'S POV
</b>
               Across miles of carpet is a huge executive desk, behind which 
               is a large executive chair facing the window. From above the 
               back of the chair cigar smoke wreathes up. A telephone cord 
               snakes around to the man sitting in the chair, hidden from 
               us. On the desktop is a perpetual motion machine of large 
               swinging ball bearings. Click-click-click.

               A TICKERTAPE MACHINE occasionally BURPS information in the 
               far corner of the office.

               A huge MECHANICAL ARM -- the sweep second hand of the 
               Hudsucker clock on the facade of the building -- RUMBLES by 
               immediately outside the window, describing an arc that throws 
               a moving shadow across the office.

                         he's ambitious, too hard to control...

               He swivels around to face Norville, who stands deferentially 
               at the door. Still listening at the phone, Mussburger waves 
               Norville forward.

               Norville clears his throat.

</b>                         Well, sir. I've got something for 
                         you from the mailroom, but first if 
                         I could just take a minute or so 
                         from your very busy time...

               He reaches into his mailroom apron and hands a scrap of paper 
               across the desk to Mussburger, who stares, frozen, at 
               Norville, making no move to take the paper.

<b>                                     NORVILLE

               Norville, undaunted, holds up the paper since Mussburger 
               will not take it. Mussburger doesn't even look at it; his 
               eyes are locked on Norville's. Mussburger smolders.

<b>                                     NORVILLE

                         years...

               Mussburger's burning eyes finally shift momentarily to look 
               at the crudely drawn circle; he looks back incredulously at 
               Norville.

<b>                                     NORVILLE

                         it's at least twice that, but I gotta 
                         tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this

               Sudden quiet.

               With one last click the perpetual motion ball bearings 
               abruptly stop.

               As Mussburger's eyes burn in on him, Norville stands mute 
               and paralyzed.

               His eyes locked on Norville's, Mussburger circles the desk. 
               He stands toe-to-toe with Norville.

               He thrusts his face into Norville's, whose head moves 
               reflexively back. Mussburger's nose is almost touching 
               Norville's, his eyes are burning, searching, studying, 
               evaluating.

               Finally he draws his head back.

               With one hand he thrusts his cigar into Norville's gaping 
               mouth. With his other hand he raises Norville's chin so that 
               his teeth clench it.

<b>                                     MUSSBURGER

               He steps back, eyes still on Norville.

               He jerks his thumb over his shoulder, indicating his chair 
               behind the desk.

<b>                                     MUSSBURGER

               Norville, his lips puckered around the unaccustomed ciger, 
               looks bemusedly from the chair to Mussburger.

<b>                                     MUSSBURGER

               Norville's eyes squint against the cigar smoke wreathing 
               from between his teeth. Mussburger seems to relax.

               Norville, squinting against the cigar smoke, pulls the cigar 
               out of his mouth as he doubles forward, feet still up, groping 
               for a place to set down the cigar. He sets it blindly on a 
               loose stack of papers.

               Norville runs across the office to a large water cooler.

</b>                         I'll take care of it. Just get out!

               Mussburger plucks the cigar off the contract and tosses it 
               into a wastebasket. He pats the fingertips of one hand against 
               his tongue and then efficiently pats out the crinkling orange 
               circle on the top sheet of the contract.

               At the other end of the office, Norville is wrapping his 
               arms around the glass water tank, which he pulls off its 
               base. He runs back across the vast expanse of office toward 
               the desk, hugging the water tank whose WATER GLOOB-GLOOBS 
               out its open bottom and splashes down onto his pumping knees.

               As he reaches the desk, the near-empty tank is now light 
               enough for him to hoist with one arm, which he does, and 
               cups his other hand under it to catch its last glub of water. 
               He tosses the TANK to the floor where --

               CRASH -- it SHATTERS, and stands looking about for a place 
               to dump his handful of water.

               He is reacting to the wastebasket on his side of the desk, 
               which Mussburger cannot see.

               It is sprouting flame, at which Norville ineffectually flecks 
               his remaining drops of water.

<b>                                     MUSSBURGER
</b>                         Now out of here! Out!

               Norville is already running to the window, which he runs 
               both palms over, desperately seeking a way to open it.

               The windows do not open. Norville furiously stomps on the 
               flames in the wastebasket and -- his foot sticks.

               Further stomping only makes the flaming wastebasket roar up 
               and down with his foot.

</b>                         Right away, buster! Out of my office!

               Norville has dropped to the floor, trying to wrench the 
               flaming wastebasket off his leg.

               Norville finally succeeds in getting the flaming wastebasket 
               off his foot. Now the problem is what to do with it.

<b>                                     MUSSBURGER

               Norville picks up the flaming trash receptacle.

               He winds up and throws it through the closed window.

               The GLASS SHATTERS and the flaming basket plummets to 
               oblivion.

               With the picture window broken a FEROCIOUS DRAFT ROARS through 
               the penthouse office.

               Mussburger lunges for the contracts as they are sucked out

               He runs, jumps onto the sill, grabs -- his fist clenches 
               around one wafting page -- he is about to fall --

               PULL BACK to reveal that the frozen picture is the newspaper 
               photo on the front page of the Manhattan Argus.

               Its headline reads: UNTRIED YOUTH TO HELM HUDSUCKER.

               The subhead reads: Stockholders Wary. The sub-subhead reads: 
               Meteoric Rise From Mailroom.

               The article is under the byline of Amy Archer.

               CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that we are looking at the 
               newspaper OVER someone's SHOULDER. The person swivels around 
               and away -- his face now TO us, we see that it is Norville 
               looking at the newspaper. He throws his head back and laughs 
               merrily.

               As he laughs -- thwock -- a steaming towel is thrown onto 
               his face and he continues to swivel. CONTINUED PULL BACK 
               REVEALS that he is in a barber chair.

               His head drops back and OUT OF FRAME as the swiveling chair 
               is cranked down, but immediately -- still spinning --

               -- his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again.

               Still laughing, Norville is now freshly shaven and has a 
               slicked-back haircut, heavy with pomade.

               CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that the paper is lying on a 
               chair. Norville's mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to 
               cover it.

               PAN TO where the apron was tossed from. Norville stands on a 
               tailor's stage, laughing, as the tailor, also laughing, takes 
               his measurements. Norville in shirtsleeves, boxer shorts, 
               hose stockings and garters.

               The tailor rises, laughing merrily, throwing up his arms and 
               spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape.

               Norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide.

               PAN UP FURTHER to reveal that the machine is in Mussburger's 
               office. At the far end of the room, behind his desk, 
               Mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper.

               TRACK IN TOWARDS him.

               On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing; outside his 
               window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock rumbles 
               by, sweeping a shadow across the floor. Evil prevails.

               As Mussburger opens the newspaper, the CONTINUED TRACK IN 
               shows its front page headline: HUD STOCK DIPS. Subhead: Just 
               Good Is He?

               COMES TO LIFE and Norville unfreezes, laughing.

               We are now TRACKING BACK FROM him. He sits behind a huge oak 
               desk, newly coifed and tailored.

               The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the OFFICE

               TRACK BACK CONTINUES THROUGH the large elegant office, leaving 
               Norville looking quite small IN LONG SHOT.

               His LAUGHTER ECHOES in the bright bare office.

               Norville's laughter is just winding down, leaving him 
               exhausted, as if he has been laughing nonstop for several 
               days. He finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye.

               A cigar ENTERS FRAME in the f.g., then the face of the man

</b>                         ...How're you this fine morning, 
                         sir?

               Norville has been worriedly patting at his pockets since the 
               mention of the blue letter.

<b>                                     NORVILLE
</b>                         That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. 
                         I never did give you that--

</b>                         Right away, Mr. Mussburger sir.

               As he talks, Mussburger pats at his suit pocket, takes out a 
               cigar, inspects it.

</b>                         Well I'm starved. I understand it'll 
                         be quite an affair this afternoon, 
                         and the executive roast tom turkey 
                         at the Bohemian Grove redefines the 
                         word superb.

               He puts the cigar in his mouth and Buzz's hand is right there 
               with a lighter.

               Buzz turns to Norville. He is puzzled but trying to hide it:

               is already striding through the lobby; Norville has to lope 
               to catch up.

</b>                         Say, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid! Shouldn't 
                         we be a little bit concerned with 
                         the downward spiral of our stock 
                         these last few days? I mean, you're

                         of Business Administration they told 
                         us --

               Mussburger gives an artificially hearty laugh and claps 
               Norville on the shoulder.

                         in a period of transition for the 
                         more nervous element to run for cover.

<b>               EXT. SIDEWALK
</b>
               Norville is still loping behind Mussburger, trying to keep 
               up with his long strides.

</b>                         Thank you, Sid, but the reason I 
                         mention it is, it would require such 
                         a small capital investment -- again,

               him.

               SCREEEECH -- the CAR pulls away. Norville is left talking to 
               himself on the empty sidewalk.

<b>               INT. COFFEE SHOP
</b>
               A cheap coffee shop a half-flight down from the street.

               We are LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the coffee shop counter. 
               In the middle b.g., Norville sits dejectedly stirring a cup 
               of coffee.

               Behind him, THROUGH the window wells, we see the back and 
               forth feet of pedestrians bustling by on the sidewalk.

               In the extreme f.g. sit two steaming mugs of coffee.

               They belong to two VETERANS of the coffee shop, who, from 
               O.S., narrate the scene.

               He gives a low whistle under his breath as a woman enters 
               from the street and hesitates by the door, looking around. 
               Still attractive but looking somewhat down-at-the-heels, it 
               is Amy Archer.

</b>                         She's looking for her mark.

               The woman's eyes settle on Norville, and she heads for the 
               empty stool next to his.

<b>                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

</b>                         She sits down.

               The woman says something to the counter waitress, who exits.

               She is holding her wallet upside down.

</b>                         The mark notices.

               Beat. Norville, however, is not noticing: He is staring 
               intently at his coffee spoon, his hat pushed back on his 
               head, his other hand propping up a cheekbone; the woman's 
               presence does not seem to have registered yet.

               The woman starts crying.

</b>                         He notices.

               As the woman cries, she accidentally-on-purpose jostles 
               Norville and he finally does indeed notice.

<b>                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)
</b>                         He's concerned.

               The woman mouths words at Norville who reacts sympathetically 
               and waves his hands at the waitress.

<b>                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)
</b>                         She explains her perdicament, and...

                         ...entuh the light lunch.

               The waitress is entering to set a plate in front of the woman.

               The woman continues to talk to Norville, smiling wanly at 
               him.

<b>                                     VETERAN #2 (O.S.)

</b>                         ...Her mother needs an operation...

</b>                         No, Bennie: Lumbago.

               Veteran #1's enunciation of "lumbago" falls into perfect 
               sync with the woman's moving lips.

               Norville is listening sympathetically, but he suddenly notices 
               his watch.

<b>                                     VETERAN #1 (O.S.)

                         She's losing him, Bennie.

               Norville is rising to his feet.

               As Norville turns to leave:

</b>                         How does she pull this out?

               She puts the back of her hand dramatically to her forehead.

                         She is!

               And indeed she does: Faint dead away, falling backwards on 
               the stool, so that Norville has no choice but to catch her.

               Norville holds her awkwardly, looking around for help.

               A WAITRESS enters extreme f.g. to BLOCK OUR VIEW of the 
               swooned woman and the embarrassed Norville. The Waitress is 
               FACING the CAMERA and the two O.S. Veterans; the CROPPING 
               gives us only her torso and the steaming pot of coffee she 
               holds.

               Back of the Waitress's torso in f.g.; on either side beyond 
               her, the two Veterans are looking up at her O.S. face. They 
               sport extremely bored expressions, topped by "cabbie" caps.

<b>               INT. NORVILLE'S OFFICE
</b>
               Looking at its frosted-glass door; the sign painter is just 
               finishing lettering in: NORVILLE BARNES, President.

               The sign painter makes way as we see Norville's shadow 
               approaching; even from inside the room we can hear that he 
               is WHEEZING HEAVILY. He is apparently carrying the girl, 
               cradled in his arms. He tries to reach down to get the 
               doorknob; can't manage it; turns to press his back against 
               the door and get the knob with his other hand.

               The door opens as Norville swings around to enter. He is 
               wheezing like a gas pipe about to explode.

               He swings around to kick the door shut. We see that the 
               lettering on the door is now terribly smudged; we also see, 
               in wet ink, on the seat of Norville's pants: senraB ellivroN 
               tnediserP.

               Weakly, still cradled in Norville's arms:

<b>                                     AMY
</b>                         I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. 
                         It was just that horrible little 
                         elevator boy...

<b>                                     NORVILLE
</b>                         Not at all. You're light as a feather.

</b>                              (pointing languorously)
                         The couch, please.

               Still wheezing horribly, Norville staggers over to the couch 
               and deposits her gently on it. He straightens up and looks 
               at her.

<b>               NORVILLE'S POV
</b>
               She is smiling wanly AT the CAMERA. The entire IMAGE PULSATES 
               as the blood pounds behind Norville's eyeballs.

               We hear the LOUD, RASPING of his BREATH, resonating inside 
               his head. Amy is talking but her voice is barely audible, as 
               if coming from a long way away.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE
</b>

</b>                         Just a minute.

               He perches drunkenly on the edge of the couch and puts his 
               head between his knees, still fighting for breath.

<b>                                     AMY
</b>                         I don't know what came over me. I 
                         suppose it was the shock of eating 
                         after so long without; the enzymes 
                         kicking in after so long, or whatever. 
                         But then you couldn't possibly know 
                         what it is to be tired and hungry...

               Speaking into his knees as he wheezes:

<b>                                     NORVILLE
</b>                         Hungry, anyway.

<b>                                     AMY
</b>                         I don't want to bore you with all 
                         the sordid details of my life; it's 
                         not a happy story...

               Norville rises and starts putting throw pillows behind her 
               head.

<b>                                     AMY
</b>                         ...Suffice it to say that I'm jobless --

                         thank you -- take care of me; and 
                         that had you not come along at just 
                         exactly the moment that you did --

               She screams, staring down at the couch.

               Norville jumps, startled, then looks where she is looking.

               On the white sofa cushion where he had been sitting is 
               printed, in wet ink, right side around: NORVILLE BARNES, 
               President.

<b>                                     AMY

                         president here!

               Norville stares dumbfounded at the sofa cushion. When the 
               nickel finally drops, he spins around to try to look at the 
               seat of his pants.

               Distracted but still modest:

<b>                                     NORVILLE
</b>                         Oh, it's nothing really. Just 
                         determination and hard work...

               He unbuckles his trousers.

<b>                                     NORVILLE

               Buzz enters holding a brown paper bag.

               He freezes, taking in the scene: Amy reclining on the couch; 
               Norville standing in front of her with his pants around his 
               ankles, still breathing heavily; the bottle of whiskey in 
               his own hand.

<b>                                     NORVILLE

                         Thank you, Buzz, just leave it on 
                         the desk.

               Leering:

</b>                         Happy days, buddy...

               As he turns to leave:

</b>                         ...and I'll tell your secretary you're 
                         not to be disturbed. Yowzuh!!

               He snaps the elastic strap under his chin.

               After the doors shut behind Buzz:

                         aspirations, anxious to make my way 
                         in the world --

               Norville pours a glass of whiskey and brings it over to her.

               He crosses back to the desk.

</b>                         Only to have that belief, that 
                         unsullied optimism, dashed against 
                         the marble and mortar of the modern 
                         work place --

               Norville takes a cigarette from a large wood cigarette box 
               on the desk and sticks it in his mouth.

<b>                                     NORVILLE

                         work and ye shall prosper -- these 
                         were the watch words of my education, 
                         the ethics of my tender years --

<b>               OVER NORVILLE'S SHOULDER
</b>
               He has been pushing the box towards her. The box tilts lazily 
               forward and then disappears over the far lip of the desk. We 
               hear the THUD of the BOX landing amid the pitter-patter of 
               cigarettes raining onto the carpet.

               Amy's brow crinkles. Continuing:

               He tosses back his drink, gags, looks at Amy with his eyes 
               bulging.

<b>               HIS POV
</b>
               Once again her IMAGE PULSATES. There is a ROARING SOUND and 
               an AIRY STEAM WHISTLE as she silently moves her lips.

<b>                                     NORVILLE
</b>                         He waves his arms and talks with a 
                         thick rasp as he staggers to his

               He staggers out a side door.

               On his exit Amy leaps to her feet and scurries over to his 
               desk. At the top of her voice:

               She throws open the top desk drawer. Inside two lonely lead 
               pencils roll through the otherwise empty drawer.

               Amy expertly flips a cigarette into her mouth and strikes a 
               match off the desktop.

               Amy throws open another drawer, empty except for an 
               appointment book. As she hurriedly flips through page after 
               blank page an arctic WIND WHISTLES emptiness. One page only 
               has a notation: 11:45. Address Wilkie Grammar School Junior

               She hastily stubs out her cigarette and waves her hand to 
               disperse the smoke.

<b>                                     AMY

               She scurries back across the room as we hear the FAUCET BEING 
               TURNED OFF: she re-strikes her languid pose on the couch 
               just as the washroom door opens.

               Norville gapes, one hand pressing a dripping rag to his 
               forehead.

<b>                                     NORVILLE

               Norville starts making pumping motions with his fists and 
               loud syncopated grunting noises. Amy gapes at him.

               He starts singing, off-key:

                         Once 'The Munce' is done with you!'

               Amy lamely fakes singing along, coming in louder on the last, 
               obvious rhyme. Norville jumps an octave on it; she quickly 
               follows sit, also pumping her fists.

               As Norville crosses his hands and locks thumbs in front of 
               his nose to make bird wings of his extended fingers:

                         call you 'Miss' because you seem to 
                         have 'missed' the boat completely on 
                         this one! How on earth would you 
                         know whether I'm an imbecile when 
                         you don't even have the guts to come 
                         in here and interview me man to man! 
                         No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, 
                         make it 'common decency.' These wild 
                         speculations about my intelligence --

                         would be better suited to the pages

                         see fit to publish this letter! But 
                         I doubt it. I most seriously doubt 
                         it. As I doubt also that you could 
                         find a home at Amazing Tales, a

               He whips the cover sheet off a display pad resting on an 
               easel to reveal a large piece of graph paper with a circle 
               rendered onto it.

               Amy looks, puzzled, from the circle to Norville's proudly

               Of the executive floor. A security man walks down the hall, 
               whistling, swinging a ring of keys. After he passes the door

               It is big and dim, several stories high, with spiral 
               staircases reaching into, and catwalks criss-crossing, the 
               gloom above. It is filled with contraptions -- works, cogs, 
               gears. There is no window, but on what would be the window 
               wall there is an enormous iron ring with a metal rod sweeping 
               an interior circle. It is the backside of the great Hudsucker 
               clock.

               Amy gazes about. She crosses to a door opposite the one she 
               entered from.

                         you bein' an embecile? What the hell 
                         is ailin' ya?! A week ago my stock 
                         was worth twice what it is now! I'm 
                         considering dumping the whole shootin'

               Norville gives him a forced but hearty laugh of reassurance.

               He starts peeling off his tuxedo jacket:

               His WIFE, a small wiry woman, steps in as Mussburger starts 
               dragging Norville away.

               As he reluctantly starts shrugging back into the jacket:

               As they make their way through the room Norville is mopping 
               at his brow with a handkerchief.

<b>                                     NORVILLE
</b>                         I'm sorry, Sid, I thought maybe if I 
                         showed him the long view we might --

               Thump! Dabbing at his brow, Norville has walked square into 
               the back of a debonaire man holding a martini.

               The drink sloshes and the man turns testily to face him.

<b>                                     MUSSBURGER
</b>                         Norville, this is Thorstensen 
                         Finlandsen, who heads a radical 
                         splinter group of disgruntled 
                         investors.

               Norville nervously pumps Findlandsen's hand.

<b>                                     NORVILLE
</b>                         Hello, Mr. Finlandsen, so sorry to

                         uh, pleased to make your --

               Findlandsen raises his hand to look quizzically at Norville's 
               handkerchief which he now holds himself, apparently having 
               been given it during the handshake.

               He hands it back to Norville.

<b>                                     NORVILLE
</b>                         Thank you, sir...

               He stuffs it nervously into his outside breast pocket as 
               Findlandsen stares at him. Mussburger stands watching in the 
               executive at-ease, hands dug into his pockets.

<b>                                     NORVILLE

                         you'll find under our strong new 
                         leadership...

               As Norville's hand drops from his breast pocket the 
               handkerchief, perhaps caught on his sleeve, whips out of the 
               pocket and follows his hand down.

               Findlandsen looks down and Norville follows his look, and 
               stoops BELOW FRAME to retrieve the hanky.

               Findlandsen leans quizzically forward and peers down at 
               Norville, who continues, O.S.

                         upward...

               In rapid fire, Norville straightens up into -- crunch -- 
               Findlandsen, whose head snaps back, eyes rolling, a hand 
               pressed to his nose, drink sloshing; Norville, one hand 
               pressed to the back of his own head and the other wildly 
               waving his hanky for balance, takes a staggering step forward 
               onto the toe of an elegantly-gowned MRS. FINDLANDSEN.

</b>                         Ahhh!

               There is a drum roll and, as the lights dim:

               grabs the large old-fashioned microphone in front of the 
               band and grins.

                         unforgettable Mister Vic... Tenetta!

               Vic Tenetta takes the microphone from the Emcee who backs 
               away, applauding as Tenetta starts to croon. He wears a white 
               dinner jacket. His jet black hair sweeps out over his forehead 
               in a roguishly pompadoured mat; one forelock droops and 
               bounces across his forehead.

               In the b.g., brilliantly spotlit, Vic Tenetta continues his 
               song.

               We are on a FULL SHOT of the back of a man who stands facing 
               the twinkling cityscape, but in an odd, leanedback posture, 
               with one hand reaching up to his hidden face, his other hand 
               pressed against the small of his back, like a man with a

                         Perhaps we met once, a chance 
                         encounter in a forest glade. I must 
                         have been an antelope or an ibex. 
                         What times we must have had -- 
                         foraging together for sustenance, 
                         picking the grubs and burrs from one 
                         another's coats. Or perhaps we simply 
                         touched our horns briefly and went 
                         our separate ways...

               The little boy looks at it, steps inside it, raises it to

               With the sound of a SQUEEGEE being drawn across glass, 
               Addison, still frozen, slides down the window, hits the floor, 
               and falls stiffly back like a fallen tree.

               Mussburger sits up and sticks a cigar into his mouth.

<b>               NORVILLE'S OFFICE
</b>
               A small chamber orchestra, the musicians in tails, sit playing 
               "Eine Kleine Nachtmusik". Norville, eyes closed, reclines in 
               his desk chair, one uniformed woman stooping in front of 
               him, manicuring his nails, another, behind, massaging his 
               temples. A tailor is pinning up his pant cuffs.

               A French sculptor wearing a white smock, a beret, and a goatee 
               squints at Norville and chisels at a block of marble with a 
               stone chisel and hammer.

               A GOON sits off to one side, hat insolently atop his head, 
               reading the funny papers.

               At length Norville stirs, opens his eyes, sits bolt upright, 
               batting away the hands of the manicurist and temple-massager.

               The musicians' playing dribbles away to silence.

               All sit frozen. You could hear a pin drop.

               Eyes narrowed, he gazes off into space, squinting for his 
               idea.

               A straight pin is rolling across the top -- it drops off --

               The musicians resume playing. Everyone else resumes work. 
               The INTERCOM BUZZES and a female voice announces:

                         forgotten what made your ideas 
                         exciting for you in the first place --

               This was addressed to the chamber orchestra, whose playing 
               dribbles off. They look inquisitively at Norville, then rise 
               to pack up their instruments and sheepishly leave the office.

               personnel file.

               A hand brings INTO FRAME another picture of her -- this one 
               a newspaper clipping. She stands on a podium accepting an 
               award; standing behind her are middle-aged identical triplets. 
               The caption says, "Amy Archer of the Manhattan Argus Receives 
               Pulitzer Prize."

               We are in Mussburger's office. Mussburger is seated at his 
               desk looking at the file picture and clipping; the sign 
               letterer/scraper is leaning over his shoulder, having just 
               put them down.

               After a beat, a woman ENTERS against the unblemished white 
               background, dressed in a flowing white dance robe, trailing 
               a long, diaphanous veil. She performs a flowingly sensuous 
               dance moderne; the MUSIC is a sensuous saxophone solo with 
               lasciviously bending blue notes.

               After the woman has been dancing for several beats Norville 
               enters, dancing after her, pursuing her. He is wearing a 
               coatless suit, his sleeves rolled up, his thin tie loosened.

               The woman dances around him, letting her diaphanous veil 
               trail sinuously around his body.

               We hear an ECHOING voice:

               He opens his eyes and looks stuporously about.

               Buzz is grinning down at him in his little pillbox elevator 
               cap.

               The easel displays an oversized sheet of graph paper.

               Onto it has been rendered a top view, which is a perfect 
               circle, and a side view, which is a vertical line.

               Norville gazes stupidly at the circle.

               We PULL BACK FROM the flame of Sid Mussburger's oversized 
               lighter as he finishes lighting a cigar.

               The headline, in screaming nine-point type:

               Next to the picture of Norville is the subhead: Idea Man a 
               Fraud.

               Next to the sub-subhead is a picture of Buzz in his elevator-
               operator's pillbox hat: Stole Hoop Idea from Genius Elevator 
               Jockey Clarence "Buzz" Gunderson.

               but still hearing his LAUGHTER.

               We are TRACKING IN TOWARD the back of Aloysius, the sign 
               painter, who is stooped in front of the door. He looks back 
               over his shoulder, leering PAST the CAMERA, to reveal his 
               work: Under PRESIDENT Norville's name has been scraped away,

               He pushes past the sign painter.

<b>               INT. OFFICE
</b>
               Dark and empty. Norville is peeling off his coat as he 
               staggers over to the closet.

               We can hear DISTANT REVELRY and the STRAINS of "AULD LANG

</b>
               Norville has pulled his old mailroom apron from the closet 
               and is putting it on: HUDSUCKER MAIL ROOM/The Future Is Now.

               Norville looks at the door.

               THROUGH the glass we see the tail of the last R of 
               "Mussburger" being painted into place.

               Norville throws open the window.

               He climbs out.

</b>
               Norville, back against the wall, looks cautiously down.

               We hear DISTANT CHANTING:

</b>
               A sickening drop. Receding snowflakes. On the street far, 
               far below, a lone car's headlights cut through the falling 
               snow.

               We are FLOATING IN; it is the SHOT with which the movie began. 
               The sweep second hand of the Hudsucker Clock is approaching 
               the 12 of midnight, the New Year. In sync with the clock the 
               CHANTING continues:

               We have COME IN CLOSE ON Norville. A lone tear runs down his

               BONG! The toll is right at Norville's ear. Startled, he 
               reaches up to press hands against his ears. Distantly:

               He can't stand it. Whimpering, hands to his ears, he edges 
               his way back toward the window.

               The open window at a steep angle. Someone inside slides it 
               shut.

               His gesticulation and a shuffle step upset his balance -- he 
               trips -- falls -- catches the ledge --

               He is hanging onto the icy ledge by his fingertips. His feet 
               dangle away. Snow falls.

               Looking STEEPLY UP.

               Its second hand is making its descent.

               Falling.

               Laughing.

</b>
               Descending.

<b>               NORVILLE
</b>
               Falling, turning lazily in the air -- and suddenly, with a 
               great moaning sound -- he stops, suspended in mid-air, head 
               down, feet in the air.

               It is much like the freeze frame on Waring Hudsucker that 
               the title of the film was supered over.

               He waves his arms, to no effect, looks around.

<b>               PEOPLE IN STREET
</b>
               Frozen in attitudes of laughter, celebration. Snow sifts 
               silently down around their motionless bodies.

</b>
               In his office, frozen with an idiotic laugh pasted to his 
               face.

<b>               HIS PERPETUAL MOTION BALLS
</b>
               Frozen, one ball swung out but suspended, hanging at the 
               apex of its arc. Outside the great arched window, snow falls.

<b>               NORVILLE
</b>
               He alone can move, but doesn't fall. He looks awkwardly about, 
               his body in a dive-bomber attitude, canted steeply down.

               The broom handle has been jammed between two cogs, stopping 
               them. We PULL BACK ALONG the handle to reveal Moses, who has 
               thrust it there, and who now TURNS back over his shoulder to 
               address the CAMERA.

               Twisting back to look up over his shoulder; there is a DISTANT -- 
               very distant -- SINGING.

<b>               HIS POV

               Looking up the length of the Hudsucker Building. Someone or 
               something wrapped in white is flying toward us, coming down 
               from the stars.

               We can make out a male voice, accompanied by STRUMMING:

               He gapes.

<b>               ANGEL
</b>
               -- For it is an Angel, arrives. He is a balding man, wearing 
               rimless glasses, in a white robe, large feathery wings 
               sprouting from his back and beating heavily until he comes 
               to rest, in midair. He puts aside the harp he has been 
               strumming on a nearby windowsill.

               Presenting himself, he spreads his arms and stamps his forward 
               foot, forgetting that there is nothing beneath his foot to 
               stamp. He lurches forward, momentarily losing his balance.

</b>                         ...Wooooo!

               He rights himself. The halo spinning lazily over his head 
               has been jarred askew. With a flick of his forefinger he 
               rights it.

               He pats at his robe, produces a white cigar.

               He casually flicks his thumb out of his fist, lighting it. 
               He lights the cigar off his thumb, takes a puff.

               Pain reminds him that he has forgotten to extinguish his 
               flaming thumb, which he now waves frantically about.

                         guarding what was timeless inside of 
                         myself, I let the hubbub of earthly 
                         commerce erode my character, and 
                         dissolve my better self. How is it 
                         that some manage to preserve 
                         themselves where I have failed? 
                         Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if 
                         others love you, you may more securely 
                         love yourself -- but I am alone. I 
                         loved a woman once, Sid, as you well 
                         know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady, 
                         an angel who in her wisdom saw fit 
                         to choose you instead of I...'

               Norville is interrupted by loud blubbering. He looks up.

               Hudsucker is weeping loudly into a white handkerchief.

               He saws at his nose, gives it a loud honk, and urgently 
               quavers in a voice strangled with emotion:

               his way back to the heavens.

               Moses pries the broom handle loose from the Great Gear.

               FROM a tavern sign that says ANN'S 440, DOWN TO the front

               Sitting halfway down the bar is Amy, staring morosely into a 
               coffee cup. AT the CUT we are TRACKING BACK, PULLING AWAY 
               FROM her.

               Norville enters, comes up next to her and makes the Go Eagles 
               sign, hooking his thumbs in front of his nose and spreading 
               his fingers.

               Two familiar voices narrate the scene, sounding a little 
               tipsy:

<b>                                     LOU (O.S.)
</b>                         What the heck's he doin', Benny?

               Amy looks at Norville, startled. After a moment she 
               reciprocates the sign.

               Norville and Amy embrace.

               Our PULL BACK ENDS LOOKING ACROSS an elbow of the bar, TOWARDS 
               Norville and Amy, now in WIDE SHOT. Resting on the bar in 
               the extreme f.g. are two champagne glasses, half-full of 
               fizzing champagne.

               Norville and Amy kiss.

               In a quavering voice:

               Lou also is beginning to sound choked up:

</b>                         It is beautiful, Benny.

               Almost weeping as Norville and Amy continue their embrace:

<b>                                     BENNY (O.S.)
</b>                         ...It's the most beautiful t'ing I

               A BARTENDER ENTERS to BLOCK our VIEW of Norville and Amy.

               He is youngish, with a beat goatee, wearing dungarees and a 
               sweatshirt with cut-off sleeves. He looks to either side at 
               Benny and Lou.

               We see Benny and Lou are sitting side by side at the bar.

               Lou wears a fake whispy beard and white eyebrows and a long 
               flowing robe; he holds a fake scythe. On the bar next to him 
               sits a large hourglass.

               Benny is wearing nothing but an oversized diaper, a baby 
               bonnett and a sash across his hairy chest and thick belly 
               that says "1959."

               He chucks himself in the heart, cocks his head and sucks in 
               air, then blows it back out.

               an easel: Under the heading BRAND NEW is a large circle. The 
               side view is a flat line.
