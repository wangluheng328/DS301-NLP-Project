A two-segment story that follows young men from the start of recruit training in the Marine Corps to the lethal cauldron known as Vietnam.
The first segment follows Joker, Pyle and others as they progress through the hell of USMC boot-camp at the hands of the colorful, foul-mouthed Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.
The second begins in Vietnam, near Hue, at the time of the Tet Offensive.
Joker, along with Animal Mother, Rafterman and others, face threats such as ambush, booby traps, and Viet Cong snipers as they move through the city.
