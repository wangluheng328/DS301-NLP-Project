During the Vietnam War private 'Joker' -the narrator, a future author- and his class are put through the US Marine indoctrination and training under DI Gunnery Sergeant Hartman's verbally and physically abusive, sex-obsessed style.
It's all far worse for fat simpleton Pyle, who keeps doing everything wrong, even when gentle Joker is appointed his personal tutor, until peer pressure becomes group bullying.
On their last day at Paris Island, when everyone graduates, the psychological time-bomb explodes.
Only intellectual Joker isn't assigned to jungle duty but as military war correspondent.
He's unwilling to play the deceptive propaganda game and violence catches up even in the 'safe' city Hue.
