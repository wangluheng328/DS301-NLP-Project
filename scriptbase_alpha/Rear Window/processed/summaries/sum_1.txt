Photagrapher L.B.
"Jeff" Jeffries is confined to his small apartment with a broken leg.
To pass the time, he watches the goings-on of his motley assortment of neighbors - a frustrated yet fun-loving composer, a middle-aged couple with a small dog, a dancer who seems to enjoy practicing her routines while scantily clad, a pair of reclusive newlyweds, a lonely woman who seems to live in a fantasy world, and a salesman and his invalid wife.
One day the wife inexplicably disappears, and the salesman starts doing things that lead Jeff to suspect that he may have murdered her.
Unfortunately, he has no proof and no one seems to believe him.
Eventually, however, things start falling together in a way that make it look like Jeff might just be right after all.
Finally, his girlfriend Lisa and his nurse Stella come up with a plan to catch the killer red-handed.
But doing so could put all of their lives in danger.
