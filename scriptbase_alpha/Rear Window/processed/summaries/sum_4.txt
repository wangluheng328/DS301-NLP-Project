In New York, the daring photographer L. B. Jefferies has been confined to his small apartment for five weeks in a wheelchair with one broken leg.
He snoops his neighbors from his rear window to kill time and he is aware of the personal dramas of some of them.
His fancy girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont is pressing him to marry her but he believes she will not fit and feel comfortable with his brash lifestyle.
When the invalid wife of the salesman Lars Thorwald vanishes, Jeff believes the man might have killed his wife.
He tells his concerns to Lisa and to his nurse Stella and the women agree with his observations, but his friend Detective Thomas J. Doyle finds reasonable explanation for each remark.
However, Lisa decides to go further in her investigation, getting closer to the suspect.
