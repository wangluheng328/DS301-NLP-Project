Major Vic Deakins and Commander Riley Hale are training and combat partners and good friends.
One day, they receive orders to perform another training exercise with a stealth bomber armed with real nuclear missiles.
Then, in a flash, Deakins turns on Hale and crashes the bomber.
The next morning, a team of soldiers, lead by a man named Emmitt Kelly, search for the lost Nuclear missiles.
But, Kelly then kills off his own team and takes the missiles to Deakins.
What Deakins is planning to do is demand the government to give him a promotion and money.
But, it wasn't long at all before hale regained consciousness.
He must stop Deakins from using the nuclear missiles to blow up the west with a help of a park ranger Teresa Charmichile.
