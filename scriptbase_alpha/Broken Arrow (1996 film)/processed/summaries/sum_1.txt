Major Vic Deakins and Captain Riley Hale are Air Force pilots sent on a mission to fly a B-3 bomber carrying two live nuclear warheads to test for radiation emissions over a desert in Utah.
The mission is messed up when Vic tries to kill Riley, and the airplane crashes in the desert.
The warheads were made to survive crashes.
Before the crash, Vic and Riley parachuted off of the airplane.
Vic and his right hand man Emmitt Kelly (Howie Long) steal the two warheads, and they plan to detonate the two warheads in Salt Lake City unless they receive $250,000,000 from the government.
Lost in the desert, Riley is found by park ranger Terry Carmichael, who decides to help him find Vic and Emmitt.
Terry and Riley soon discover that Vic plans to send the warheads to Salt Lake City on a train, but Vic has only one warhead to use after one of the warheads explodes inside of an abandoned copper mine that Vic was using as a hideout.
Then Terry and Riley discover that Vic is actually sending the remaining warhead to an even bigger target -- Denver, Colorado, not Salt Lake City.
Can they stop the train before it reaches Denver?
