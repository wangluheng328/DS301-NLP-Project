In 14th Century Scotland, William Wallace leads his people in a rebellion against the tyranny of the English King, who has given English nobility the 'Prima Nocta' - a right to take all new brides for the first night.
The Scots are none too pleased with the brutal English invaders, but they lack leadership to fight back.
Wallace creates a legend of himself, with his courageous defence of his people and attacks on the English.
