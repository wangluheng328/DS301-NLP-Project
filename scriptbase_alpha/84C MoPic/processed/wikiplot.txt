The film is created as a mock-up documentary of a Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) mission during the Vietnam War.
The point of view is from a camera following a LRRP team on a five-day patrol deep in "Indian Country" (territory controlled by the North Vietnamese).
The cameraman is nicknamed "MoPic" by the team, because of his alphanumeric military occupational specialty, 84C20, Motion Picture Specialist.
The supposedly routine mission, however, goes wrong and eventually turns into a struggle for survival.
