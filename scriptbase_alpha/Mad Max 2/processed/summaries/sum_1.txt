A former police officer is now a lone wanderer, traveling through a devastated Australia after a nuclear war looking for now-priceless petrol.
He lives to survive and is none too pleased when he finds himself the only hope of a small group of honest people running a remote oil refinery.
He must protect them from the bike gang that is terrorizing them whilst transporting their entire fuel supply to safety.
