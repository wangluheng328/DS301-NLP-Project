Tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples lead to a war in Rwanda, where corruption and bribes between politicians are routine.
Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), the manager of the Sabena owned HÃ´tel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana (Okonedo), is Tutsi.
His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently Georges Rutaganda (Kae-Kazim), a friendly goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal anti-Tutsi militia.
