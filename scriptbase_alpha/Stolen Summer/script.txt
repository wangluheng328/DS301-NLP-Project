               FADE IN:

               EXT. O'MALLEY FRONT YARD - MORNING

               MARGARET O'MALLEY, an auburn haired, sunburned 38-year old 
               mother of eight, stands outside next to the running station 
               wagon. Two children sit in the front seat while three are 
               crammed into the back seat.

               Margaret is waiting on her two youngest boys to fill the two 
               way back seats that face backwards. KATIE, 4 years old, with 
               strawberry blond hair, rosy cheeks, and a pot belly, sticks 
               her head out the window.

                                     KATIE
                         Mom, I told them to be ready by nine 
                         twenty. They just donÂ’t listen.

               Margaret ignores Katie. Katie pops back into the car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PETE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               PETE, 7 years old, who looks like a poster boy for Ireland, 
               lays on his stomach in front of the board game "All Star 
               Baseball". He spins the dial. The dial lands on nine, which 
               is the number that coincides with a strikeout. SEAMUS, nine 
               years old, blondish brown hair, white skin, crystal blue 
               eyes, angelic smile, jumps to the air in celebration.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Another comeback stopped.

                                     PETE
                         Reggie Jackson stinks!

                                     SEAMUS
                         We gotta get going. Mom's gonna freak.

               Seamus heads for the door.

                                     PETE
                         What should we tell her?

               Seamus looks back at Pete. Pete's hand me down plaid pants 
               barely fit him and fall as he stands up.

                                     SEAMUS
                         You couldn't find your belt.

               Seamus takes off down the stairs. Pete, with one hand holding 
               up his pants, follows him down the stairs. Seamus runs out 
               the front door and past his mom.

                                     MARGARET
                         Why are you late?

               Seamus, never breaking stride, climbs into the station wagon 
               through the back window.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Pete couldn't find his belt.

               Pete runs past his mother.

                                     MARGARET
                         Why are you late?

                                     PETE
                         Seamus lost my belt.

               Pete never breaks stride. He jumps into the back of the 
               station wagon. Margaret turns and walks to the car with the 
               kind of steam that only eight kids in 18 years can produce. 
               She opens the car door, sits down, calmly puts the car in 
               reverse, and turns her head for the reverse shoulder check. 
               And then all hell breaks loose. Margaret screams at the top 
               of her lungs.

                                     MARGARET
                         God gives you 168 hours in a week. 
                         Can you not give him one full hour 
                         back? Is that too much to ask?

               Katie at four years doesn't understand rhetorical questions.

                                     KATIE
                         I've been ready for three hours.

               EDDIE, 14, brown curly hair, brown eyes, athletic, is at the 
               point in his life when he realizes he has more answers than 
               his mom.

                                     EDDIE
                              (to Katie)
                         Shut up you kiss ass.

               Margaret, with no hesitation, stops the car and smacks Eddie 
               across the face. Eddie winces while TOMMY, 17, also dark 
               haired and dark eyed, laughs. Margaret puts the car in drive 
               and cruises down the street like one big, happy family. WE 
               FOLLOW the camera through the front of the car to the back.

               PATRICK, 18, blondish brown curly hair and green eyes, holds 
               MOLLY, six months old, in the front seat. Car seats have yet 
               to be invented.

               MARY, 17, auburn haired like her mother and Tommy's twin, 
               sits behind the driver seat because she has learned the long 
               hand of Margaret's wrath cannot reach her in that seat. Tommy 
               reads Eddie the Bazooka Joe joke from his gum wrapper and 
               the two laugh. In the back seat facing out, Pete and Seamus 
               sit. Seamus holds electronic football in his hand and the 
               electronic sound of electronic football players running 
               reverberates throughout the car. WE GO TIGHT on PETE.

                                     PETE (V.O.)
                         My dad is a fireman.

               WE PULL BACK and see all of the kids hang out the window and 
               wave at JOE, 40, who is Dark Irish, handsomely weathered, 
               and happy to be at work when his wife takes the kids to 
               church. WE GO TIGHT on JOE as he waves back to the kids.

                                     JOE
                              (sarcastic to fellow 
                              firemen)
                         I wish I could be with them more.

                                     PETE (V.O.)
                         And my mom?

               WE GO TIGHT on MARGARET.

                                     PETE (V.O.)
                         And my mom? She's a part time cook, 
                         maid, and nurse. But her full time 
                         job? She's a front line sergeant in 
                         God's army.

               Pete screams as Seamus scores another touchdown on electronic 
               football.

                                     EDDIE
                         Goddammit, would you two shut up 
                         with that game!

               Katie puts her hand over her mouth with the sound of the 
               swearword.

               Tommy prepares for battle by holding back his laughter. 
               Margaret erupts.

                                     MARGARET
                         The lord's name in vain? Son of a 
                         bitch.

               At forty miles an hour in front of the firehouse Margaret 
               lunges her open fist into the backseat and starts swinging 
               like a tornado.

               Kids scurry, hoping to avoid the path of the tornado. The 
               wagon swerves into the other lane. Joe and his buddies watch 
               from their lounge chairs outside the firehouse. He takes a 
               swig from a plastic cup.

                                     JOE
                         Dying in a fire sometimes doesn't 
                         sound so bad.

               The station wagon pulls up to church and the children jump 
               out like clowns from a small car. Margaret drives off as the 
               children exit the station wagon. Patrick lifts Katie up to 
               the basin of holy water.

               Katie splashes water on her forehead and makes a sign of the 
               cross.

               Patrick, annoyed, puts her down and points his finger at 
               her. He gently touches the water with his index and middle 
               finger and slowly makes the sign of the cross. Katie shakes 
               her head in agreement.

               Seamus dips his hand in the water and fake sneezes on Pete. 
               Pete punches him in the shoulder. Margaret walks in and 
               proceeds to lead her ducklings down the aisle as the heads 
               in church turn to watch.

               Each kid genuflects, some better than others, and sit. Pete 
               sits between Seamus and Patrick. He looks at Margaret. She 
               smiles and winks at him. Pete looks up to the life-size Jesus 
               hanging high behind the altar. WE SLOWLY go TIGHT on JESUS 
               hanging on the cross.

                                     PETE (V.O.)
                         My cousins' families are similar to 
                         mine. Except some of the dads are 
                         cops. In my world, there's Irish 
                         Catholics, and then there's everybody 
                         else. The only part of this picture 
                         that doesn't fit for me is Jesus. 
                         From what I've learned, and according 
                         to my brother Seamus I've learned 
                         shit, that's why I'm in second grade, 
                         but from what I've learned, Jesus is 
                         not Irish Catholic. My dad says that's 
                         only a technicality, like Knute 
                         Rockne, but, still, Jesus is not 
                         Irish Catholic. He is Jewish. I don't 
                         know any Jewish people, they don't 
                         go to Holy Cross, but if I ever meet 
                         a Jewish person, my mom says my job 
                         would be to convert them to 
                         Catholicism. So they could go to 
                         heaven. I have decided this summer, 
                         the summer of 1976, I will help a 
                         Jewish person get to heaven. It will 
                         be my holy quest.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KEENEY/JONES FUNERAL HOME - A FEW DAYS LATER

               REVERSE CAM - Looking out through Jesus's eyes. A WAKE. An 
               Irish wake. Two little boys approach the casket. They kneel 
               in front of the casket. Seamus looks at Pete. Pete's eyes 
               are wide in anticipation. Seamus nudges Pete. Pete nudges 
               Seamus back. Seamus makes the sign of the cross and Pete 
               copies him. The two stand and walk away. WE FOLLOW them 
               through the crowd. The boys continue to walk through the 
               crowd but WE STOP at a circle of men holding drinks.

               JOE, holding a Rum and Coke, is talking out the side of his 
               mouth.

                                     JOE
                         So? What do I do? Go up to Aunt 
                         Maggie. Hey Aunt Maggie, did I mention 
                         Uncle Jim owed me a nickel?

               The other men laugh. Joe's fat brother, ROGER, answers as if 
               he's Jim's wife. He pulls out a coin

                                     ROGER
                         I know things are tight, Joe, but 
                         this is cheap. Even for you.

               Roger hands Joe the nickel.

                                     JOE
                         Well, we'll call it even. That idiot. 
                         You know if he was up a nickel with 
                         the book, he would have lived to 
                         collect.

               The men laugh heartily.

                                     JOE
                         A new way to fend off death. Be up 
                         money with your bookie.

                                     ROGER
                         May old Uncle Jim be in heaven thirty 
                         minutes before the devil knows he's 
                         dead.

                                     JOE
                         He might need more time. What if the 
                         devil has extradition rights?

               All of the men laugh. A man hands Joe a drink. He finishes 
               the drink in his right hand as he accepts the fresh drink in 
               his left hand.

               Seamus and Pete come running back through the crowd. Margaret, 
               standing with four women and smoking, calls them over.

                                     MARGARET
                         Did you pray for your great uncle's 
                         soul?

               Pete looks at Seamus. Seamus looks down at Pete. Pete looks 
               up at his mom.

                                     PETE
                         We didn't know his soul.

               The women laugh.

                                     WOMAN
                         Cause he didn't have one.

                                     MARGARET
                         Go back up there and pray to Jesus 
                         for the soul of your Uncle Jim. He 
                         needs your prayers.

                                     PETE
                         So I've heard. But Mom, how do we 
                         know our prayers will help Old Uncle 
                         Jim get to heaven?

                                     MARGARET
                         Faith. Now go ahead.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Mom, we can't go back up there. We 
                         already prayed to Jesus for his soul.

               Mom looks at Pete for affirmation. Pete looks up to Seamus. 
               He looks back up to Mom.

                                     MARGARET
                         Did you pray to Jesus?

               Pete looks at Seamus. Seamus gives him that scared look of 
               having to look at that dead body up close again. Pete looks 
               at the dead body.

               He looks back at his mom. He nods his head in the affirmative.

                                     MARGARET
                         Well, nobody can have too many 
                         prayers. Go again.

               Pete and Seamus head toward the casket.

                                     PETE
                         How did she know I was lying?

                                     SEAMUS
                         You weren't convincing. And she's 
                         got some kinda built in lie detector.

                                     PETE
                         How many lies do we get till we go 
                         to hell?

                                     SEAMUS
                         Forty-seven.

                                     PETE
                         I don't think I have many left. And 
                         I got my whole life ahead of me.

                                     SEAMUS
                         That one doesn't count. You just 
                         nodded. Nodding up and down in China 
                         is like saying no.

                                     PETE
                         Things are upside down in China.

               Seamus begins to nod yes but changes it to a shake. Margaret 
               watches the boys as they approach the casket. The boys 
               approach the dead body.

                                     PETE
                         What's faith?

               Seamus's eyes are bugging out.

                                     SEAMUS
                         A word grown ups use when they don't 
                         have the answer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CLASSROOM - NEXT DAY

               WE GO TIGHT on an ELECTRONIC FOOTBALL GAME. WE HEAR the noises 
               of the game. WE PULL BACK to see Pete playing the game in 
               the back of the room. A nun stands at the front of the class 
               and is talking to the class.

                                     NUN
                         This summer, take time to reflect on 
                         your past year in the second grade. 
                         And how you can make third grade 
                         better.

               The electronic defense tackles Pete and makes a double click 
               noise.

                                     PETE
                         No!

                                     JIMMY
                         Yes!

                                     NUN
                         Mr. O'Malley? Do you disagree with 
                         me?

                                     PETE
                         No, Sister Leonora Mary. I agree.

               The bell rings. The kids scream with happiness. School's out 
               for the summer.

                                     NUN
                         See you at church. And next year in 
                         third grade.

               The boys run for the door.

                                     NUN
                         Mr. O'Malley, may I speak to you for 
                         a moment?

               The boys stop. Pete looks at them. The guys don't hesitate. 
               They run out of the room. Sister Leonora Mary and Pete are 
               alone.

                                     PETE
                         Yes, Sister Leonora Mary.

                                     NUN
                         How many times did I have to pull 
                         you by your ears to the front of the 
                         class and give you the ruler?

               Pete looks around for the answer.

                                     PETE
                         A lot!

                                     NUN
                         Probably too many times, don't you 
                         think?

               Pete nods.

                                     NUN
                         I don't enjoy having to do that, you 
                         know.

               Pete looks at the ground and scratches the back of his neck.

                                     NUN
                         I think this is an important summer 
                         for you. This is the summer that you 
                         can choose to keep following the 
                         devil's way, or create a new path 
                         toward Jesus. Which path do you want 
                         to take?

                                     PETE
                         The Jesus path.

                                     NUN
                         Good. I expect to see a difference 
                         in you next year.

                                     PETE
                         You will, Sister Leonora Mary. I've 
                         got a plan. A quest!

                                     NUN
                         Good! You may go. Enjoy your summer, 
                         I know you will.

                                     PETE
                         You too Sister Leonora Mary.

               Pete heads toward the door. He turns around.

                                     PETE
                         Do you know where I can find a 
                         synagogue?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SYNAGOGUE - LATE AFTERNOON

               Pete stops his bike outside the synagogue. He looks to the 
               top to see if there is a cross. No cross. A small family 
               walks out of the synagogue. The men wear yarmukles. Pete 
               stares at the yarmukles. He walks his bike to the door. He 
               tries to open the door and maneuver the bike through the 
               door. He is unsuccessful. A bearded, tiny gray man with 
               glasses opens the door. Rabbi Kenny Jacobsen smiles at the 
               young leprechaun.

                                     RABBI
                         May I help you, son of Saint Patrick?

               Pete looks at him weird but shrugs off the name calling. He 
               notices the rabbi wears a yarmukle also.

                                     PETE
                         Whadaya got on the top of your head?

                                     RABBI
                         It's a yarmukle.

                                     PETE
                         Doesn't really block the sun.

                                     RABBI
                         No but it covers bald spots.

               The rabbi leans over, takes off the yarmukle, and shows Pete 
               his bald spot.

                                     PETE
                         It does cover the bald spot. My old 
                         Uncle Jim could have used that.

                                     RABBI
                         So what can I do you for?

               Pete looks around.

                                     PETE
                         Jewish people go here?

               The rabbi nods.

                                     PETE
                         I'm looking to see if I can help 
                         Jewish people get to heaven.

                                     RABBI
                         A noble endeavor.

                                     PETE
                         A quest!

                                     RABBI
                         A noble quest! What can I do to assist 
                         your quest?

                                     PETE
                         Well, I just wanted to check out the 
                         synagogue. But there's no bike rack. 
                         Don't kids go here?

                                     RABBI
                         Yes. But not for school. How 'bout I 
                         hold onto your bike in the back of 
                         the Temple as you look around?

                                     PETE
                         Thanks.

               Pete enters the temple with Rabbi Jacobsen following him 
               with the bike. The place is round and expansive. Pete looks 
               around. After looking, Pete heads to the back of the temple 
               where the rabbi waits for him with his bike.

                                     PETE
                         No cross?

                                     RABBI
                         No cross.

                                     PETE
                         I find the cross fun to look at. 
                         Sometimes I think about climbing the 
                         wall at Holy Cross and unscrewing 
                         the nails, and letting him go. Makes 
                         mass go faster. You should think 
                         about putting in a cross.

                                     RABBI
                         I'll look into that. So what are you 
                         thinking?

                                     PETE
                         That this is where the quest starts.

                                     RABBI
                         Well, if I can be of service, you 
                         let me know. My office is just over 
                         there. I've got to get home to my 
                         family. I have a boy around your 
                         age. How old are you?

                                     PETE
                         Seven. Almost eight.

                                     RABBI
                         He's six. Almost seven.

                                     PETE
                         You can have a family?

                                     RABBI
                         Yes.

                                     PETE
                         Then what do they call you?

                                     RABBI
                         Well, my boys call me father. But my 
                         congregation calls me Rabbi. Rabbi 
                         Jacobsen.

               Rabbi Jacobsen puts his hand out. Pete shakes it.

                                     PETE
                         I'm Pete. Pete O'Malley. Nice to 
                         meet you Rabbi Jacobsen.

                                     RABBI
                         Nice to meet you.

               The rabbi and Pete head out of the temple.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN TABLE - LATER THAT NIGHT

               The O'Malley's sit at the dinner table. Three things are a 
               constant at the dinner table. Meat, potatoes, and chaos. 
               Katie starts to yelp.

                                     KATIE
                         Can I have your attention? Please. I 
                         got something to say. Please!

               Everyone at the table slowly quiets down.

                                     JOE
                         Better make this good Katie.

                                     KATIE
                         I will.

               The room is quiet. Katie looks at everyone.

                                     KATIE
                         Today. I was on my bike. And I pedaled 
                         my bike to the O'Connors. And I 
                         pedaled back. And it was sunny.

               Everyone stares at her.

                                     KATIE
                         That's it.

               Eddie shakes his head in amazement and grins.

                                     EDDIE
                         Katie, you need to come up with a 
                         more exciting story.

                                     KATIE
                         I will.

                                     EDDIE
                         You know, like maybe crash your bike, 
                         and get really bloody and do the 
                         wounded soldier back to the house.

                                     MARGARET
                         Eddie!

               The older kids laugh.

                                     PETE
                         Anyone know what a yarmukle is?

                                     JOE
                         A beanie?

               Patrick looks at Pete.

                                     PATRICK
                         Jewish people wear them. It's 
                         traditional headwear.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Like feathers for an Indian?

                                     PETE
                         What's it for?

                                     JOE
                         To hide their horns.

               The older kids laugh. Margaret winces.

                                     PETE
                         They got horns?

                                     MARGARET
                         No. They do not have horns. Joe, 
                         please. The young ones don't need 
                         this. Let's change the subject.

                                     JOE
                         Patrick, your Uncle Charlie says he 
                         could get you an interview over at 
                         the city planners office.

                                     PATRICK
                         No thanks.

                                     MARY
                         What about the fire department?

                                     JOE
                         That's always there. Well, kid, what 
                         the hell are you going to do?

               The kids react to the word hell.

                                     PATRICK
                         I've applied for some scholarships. 
                         I should hear about them soon. Until 
                         then, I can keep life guarding. Saving 
                         money.

                                     JOE
                         Life guarding? I've raised a 
                         professional lifeguarder. In Chicago. 
                         Work three months a year.

                                     EDDIE
                         And he doesn't even look like Sheila 
                         Moran in his suit.

               Tommy blushes.

                                     EDDIE
                         Sheila! Oh Sheila. Save me!

               Joe laughs.

                                     JOE
                         Don't let her old man catch her saving 
                         you.

                                     TOMMY
                         Eddie doesn't know what he's talking 
                         about. I don't like her.

               Mary speaks matter of factly.

                                     MARY
                         Francis Demos told me Sheila likes 
                         you so all you need to do is ask her 
                         out.

               Patrick gets up from the table as Tommy, Mary, and Eddie 
               continue to talk about Sheila Moran. Seamus is bent over 
               showing Pete where the horns protrude from the head. Katie 
               feeds the cocker spaniel her mashed potatoes under the table 
               while Molly drinks from the bottle in Nancy's arms. Joe 
               watches Patrick walk out of the room. He looks at Margaret 
               for some answer. Margaret shrugs her shoulders.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NEXT DAY

               Pete and Seamus walk down the tree lined city block in their 
               neighborhood. The two sip milkshakes.

                                     PETE
                         There's nothing better than a bubble 
                         gum milk shake. How come that girl 
                         looks at us so funny when we order 
                         it?

               Seamus shrugs.

                                     PETE
                         I mean, it's a two for one. Ice cream 
                         shake, and then the bubble gum sinks 
                         to the bottom, and when the shake's 
                         done, you got a whole pack of bubble 
                         gum to chew. All for the price of 
                         one shake.

               Seamus takes the lid off the cup and tries to finish the 
               shake in one big gulp. He succeeds. Seamus now chews on a 
               wad of gum. Pete and Seamus pass a lemonade stand.

               Ten cents a cup. Pete motions to the lemonade entrepreneurs 
               that his shake has bankrupt him for the day.

                                     PETE
                         You ever feel that there's more out 
                         there? Like there's more for you to 
                         do than just play ball and eat ice 
                         cream?

               Seamus shakes his head. He blows a bubble. Pete blows a 
               bubble.

                                     SEAMUS
                         You gonna play baseball at 11?

               Pete shakes his head.

                                     SEAMUS
                         You heading over to the synagogue?

               Pete nods. Seamus blows a bubble.

                                     SEAMUS
                         You know, this whole thing's kinda 
                         weird. You going there, the quest.

               Pete nods.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Well, at least you know it's weird.

               Pete and Seamus walk down the street in silence. Enjoying 
               another day without responsibility.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SYNAGOGUE - LATER THAT MORNING

               Pete knocks on the door of Rabbi Jacobsen's office.

                                     RABBI
                         Come in.

                                     PETE
                         Hey Rabbi Jacobsen, Pete O'Malley. 
                         We met the other day.

               The rabbi stands up from his desk. He puts his hand out. 
               Pete shakes it.

                                     RABBI
                         Mr. O'Malley. How are you today?

                                     PETE
                         I'm good thanks. Ready to start my 
                         quest. But I thought I might ask you 
                         for your permission first.

                                     RABBI
                         What are your plans?

                                     PETE
                         Sort of a "lemonade-free trip to 
                         heaven" stand.

               The rabbi chuckles. He stops.

                                     RABBI
                         Enterprising.

               Pete shrugs off that word.

                                     PETE
                         Yep. Jewish people gotta like 
                         lemonade?

                                     RABBI
                         Very much so. I believe Moses set 
                         one up at Mount Sinai.

               Again Pete shrugs off that statement.

                                     PETE
                         I figured I might set up the stand 
                         right at the door. And I'm not going 
                         to charge.

                                     RABBI
                         A future car salesman.

                                     PETE
                         Right. OK then. Thanks. I'll let you 
                         know how it goes.

                                     RABBI
                         You know, Jewish people believe in 
                         heaven. It's just that we believe 
                         it's not open yet.

                                     PETE
                         Well, maybe I can get the people 
                         that don't want to wait.

               The rabbi laughs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SYNAGOGUE - MINUTES LATER

               The rabbi walks back to the door. He turns back to look at 
               Pete taping the poster to the wall. FREE LEMONADE. FREE TRIP 
               TO HEAVEN.

               The rabbi laughs. He opens the door and heads into the 
               synagogue.

               Pete takes a seat at his stand.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SYNAGOGUE - HOURS LATER

               The rabbi watches Pete through a window in the synagogue. 
               Pete looks around. No business. He looks around again. He 
               pours himself a cup of lemonade and gulps it. He puts the 
               lemonade back in its place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SYNAGOGUE - END OF THE DAY

               The rabbi walks out to the stand. Pete looks dejected.

                                     RABBI
                         Rome wasn't built in a day, Pete.

               Pete doesn't understand.

                                     PETE
                         How do you make any money here? I'm 
                         free, and still nobody.

               The rabbi pats Pete on the top of the head.

                                     RABBI
                         I envy your youth. Come back tomorrow.

               Pete looks at all of his stuff.

                                     RABBI
                         I'll store your office right here 
                         inside the front door. For free.

               Pete smiles.

                                     PETE
                         You and I seem to be the only two on 
                         this block that care about free stuff.

                                     RABBI
                         Because we're the only two that 
                         realize that you can't buy what we 
                         have to offer. It's free.

               Pete and the rabbi place the desk, chair, and poster inside 
               the synagogue. Pete shakes the rabbi's hand and rides his 
               bike home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SYNAGOGUE - NEXT DAY

               Pete sits at his stand. The rabbi parks his car on the street 
               100 feet from Pete's stand. The rabbi doesn't want to block 
               Pete's storefront billboard. The rabbi steps out of his car. 
               His secretary, Julie, a pretty, voluptuous, middle aged woman 
               who obviously was waiting for the rabbi, walks out the door 
               and greets the rabbi. Pete watches her.

                                     JULIE
                         Rabbi Jacobsen, you've received six 
                         messages.

                                     RABBI
                         Door to door service. Julie, I don't 
                         pay you enough.

               Julie hands the rabbi his telephone messages. The rabbi reads 
               them and laughs.

                                     JULIE
                         Members of the congregation don't 
                         seem to think this stand is a laughing 
                         matter. It's against Judaism.

                                     RABBI
                         Most of the members don't seem to 
                         notice this temple, except during 
                         the high holidays or when they need 
                         something. Pete's giving us free 
                         advertising.

                                     JULIE
                         But he's advertising Christianity.

                                     RABBI
                         No, he's advertising thought. He's 
                         asking people to have a cup of free 
                         lemonade with him and maybe get some 
                         insight into how to get to heaven. 
                         Doesn't seem like this neighborhood 
                         cares about that. I wish a thousand 
                         Pete's opened up stands on this 
                         street.

               Seamus rides his bike up to the stand.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Hey.

                                     PETE
                         Hey.

               Seamus gets off his bike and pours himself a cup of lemonade.

                                     PETE
                         Don't pour it all.

               Seamus looks around. As if there was a public stampede for 
               Pete's lemonade. Seamus waves to Rabbi Jacobsen. The rabbi 
               walks toward the stand.

                                     PETE
                         Rabbi Jacobsen, this is my older 
                         brother Seamus. He's nine.

               The rabbi shakes Seamus's hand.

                                     RABBI
                         I'm Rabbi Jacobsen. I'm forty-four. 
                         How many are there?

                                     SEAMUS
                         Eight. But my oldest brother might 
                         go to college, so then there will be 
                         seven. And maybe we'll get his room.

                                     RABBI
                         Quite a flock.

                                     PETE
                         Got a dog too. Wanna cup of lemonade 
                         Rabbi?

                                     RABBI
                         No thanks.

                                     PETE
                         Mam?

                                     JULIE
                         No thank you.

                                     RABBI
                         Well, you keep up the...

                                     YOUNG BOY
                         Rabbi! Rabbi!

               A young boy comes running full speed around the corner.

                                     YOUNG BOY
                         Rabbi! Rabbi!

               The rabbi's face turns white.

                                     RABBI
                         What is it Steven?

               The sounds of fire engines roaring fill the air. A huge fire 
               engine turns the corner and races past.

                                     STEVEN
                         Rabbi, your house is on fire. Big 
                         fire!

               The Rabbi doesn't hear the last line. He takes off in a full 
               sprint back the way Steven came. Another fire engine races 
               past. WE FOLLOW the fire engine. WE PASS OVER THE TOP of the 
               FIRE ENGINE to the other side where JOE O'MALLEY hangs on. 
               WE FOLLOW THE FIRE ENGINE up the block where people stand 
               outside watching a house burn. The rabbi reaches the house 
               at the same time the fire engine does.

                                     RABBI
                         My boys! Where are my boys? David? 
                         Danny?

               The rabbi furiously searches the crowd. Joe O'Malley reaches 
               the rabbi. A quick exchange between the two. The rabbi takes 
               off toward the stairs of his house. Two other firemen catch 
               him and hold him back. Joe motions to the firemen to pull 
               him back and the rest of the crowd to the other side of the 
               street. He grabs a couple of other firemen who aim the hoses 
               at the front door. Joe runs into the house and disappears 
               into the smoke.

               A CLOSE SHOT on Pete and Seamus, who have been watching from 
               the corner. Mrs. Jacobsen arrives. The rabbi grabs her. Mrs. 
               Jacobsen starts to cry. Everyone watches for Joe to reappear 
               with two boys in hands. The firemen hose the flames. The 
               rabbi makes another run for the house, but this time policemen 
               hold him back. The rabbi goes limp as the two policemen hold 
               him up. The rabbi's eyes are fixated on the front door. Where 
               there is just smoke, the outline of Joe O'Malley appears. He 
               has a child, Danny, wrapped in a blanket in his arms. He 
               runs down the stairs and across the street. He hands the boy 
               off to the paramedics. Danny is suffering from smoke 
               inhalation but is OK. His parents surround him.

               The rabbi screams at Joe. Joe can only read his lips. David! 
               David! My other boy! David!

               Joe looks back at the house. The flames rage uncontrollably 
               and the other houses are now in danger of catching fire. The 
               rabbi grabs Joe by the shoulders and screams. This time Joe's 
               eyes are only on the fire. Joe takes off toward the house. A 
               firemen tries to stop him but Joe bounces off him like a 
               running back. As he reaches the front steps, an explosion 
               knocks him back ten feet and flames roar out the front door. 
               Firemen trample Joe as his coat catches on fire. They stamp 
               out the fire while they hold him down. Joe rolls over and 
               stares at the Jacobsens. Mrs. Jacobsen is hysterically crying 
               as the rabbi stares aimlessly. The rabbi turns slowly and 
               buries his wife's head in his chest. Danny, his youngest 
               son, stares over his oxygen mask and up at his parents. Joe 
               stands up and is escorted toward the ambulance as other 
               firemen storm the house with more hoses. A CLOSE SHOT of 
               PETE. His face is void of any emotion other than a look that 
               says he thought his dad was dead. A CLOSE SHOT of SEAMUS. 
               Tears stream down his face. As his dad clears the crowd and 
               reaches the ambulance on his own two feet, Seamus takes off 
               in a full sprint and covers the fifty yards in seconds. Pete 
               stands still.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Dad! Dad! Dad!

               Joe looks up and before he knows it Seamus is jumping into 
               his arms.

               Joe puts Seamus down instantly and starts to scream.

                                     JOE
                         What the hell are you doing here? 
                         Jesus Christ Seamus! Jesus Christ!

               Seamus's face turns white. Joe looks up and sees Pete standing 
               on the corner frozen.

                                     JOE
                         And you brought your brother?

               Joe slaps Seamus across the face.

                                     JOE
                         How many times have I told you not 
                         to chase fire engines! It's dangerous. 
                         You could have killed yourself and 
                         your brother. Go home! And wait for 
                         me in your room!

               Seamus turns around and walks toward Pete. Seamus reaches 
               Pete, who is still frozen. Seamus never looks up from the 
               pavement.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Come on.

               Pete looks at his dad, who now sits on the back of the 
               ambulance as paramedics care for him. Pete looks further at 
               Rabbi Jacobsen. Danny Jacobsen, six years old and bald, 
               catches Pete's eye. They look at each other. Pete turns and 
               walks away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FAMILY ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

               The O'Malley family sits around the TV and watches the news, 
               which is reporting live from the fire, which still simmers 
               in the background.

               WE GO UP THE STAIRS AND DOWN THE HALLWAY to Pete and Seamus's 
               room.

               They both sit on their beds staring quietly at the ceiling. 
               Seamus throws a tennis ball to himself. The front door opens 
               and screams of DAD fill the house. Pete turns and looks at 
               Seamus. Seamus fixates on the rotation of the ball as it 
               leaves his hand. He repeats this over and over. Joe enters 
               the bedroom and closes the door behind him.

               Pete and Seamus sit up. Joe grabs a chair and flips it around 
               so he's leaning forward on the back of the chair.

                                     JOE
                         How many times have I told you boys?

               Seamus begins to speak. Joe cuts him off.

                                     JOE
                         People die in fires. You don't chase 
                         fires, you run away from them. That 
                         family lost a ten year old boy in 
                         that fire today.

                                     PETE
                         Rabbi Jacobsen's son died?

               Joe nods.

                                     JOE
                         What were you two doing in that 
                         neighborhood?

               Pete and Seamus stay silent.

                                     JOE
                         You're both grounded. You can't leave 
                         this block. If I find either one of 
                         you outside this block or hear that 
                         either one of you left this block, 
                         you will get a whooping that you 
                         will still feel on your sixteenth 
                         birthday.

                                     SEAMUS
                         But the baseball field...

                                     JOE
                         That's it.

               Joe stands up and exits the room. Seamus gets off his bed 
               and grabs his glove. He starts to pound the ball into his 
               glove.

                                     PETE
                         I'm sorry. It's my fault.

               Seamus stares out the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BACKYARD - HOUR LATER

               Joe sits in the backyard alone on a lounge chair drinking an 
               Old Style beer. A floodlight illuminates the backyard. The 
               backdoor opens and shuts. Joe continues to stare out. Pete 
               grabs a chair, spins it around like his dad, and leans forward 
               on the back of the chair.

               Nothing is said for a few seconds as Pete stares out. Joe 
               doesn't look at Pete.

                                     JOE
                         What are you doing up?

                                     PETE
                         Couldn't sleep.
                              (Pause)
                         Dad, Seamus was only in the area 
                         because he was checking up on me.

               Joe takes a big sip from his beer.

                                     PETE
                         I'm on a quest. To meet a Jewish 
                         person and help them get to heaven.

               Joe takes another sip from his beer.

                                     JOE
                         Jewish people can't go to heaven.

                                     PETE
                         Mom says they can be converted. 
                         Through Jesus. I asked Father Kelly 
                         and he said that is the role of a 
                         good Christian.

               Joe takes another sip.

                                     PETE
                         So I've been going over to the temple 
                         on Oakley. Looking for Jewish people. 
                         I met Rabbi Jacobsen. He's like a 
                         priest over at the synagogue. He's 
                         been real nice. And I feel really 
                         bad for him now that his son has 
                         died.

               Silence.

                                     JOE
                         How old are you?

                                     PETE
                         Seven. And a half. You know.

                                     JOE
                         You should be playing baseball and 
                         going to the pool. And asleep by 
                         nine.

                                     PETE
                         Seamus was just seeing how things 
                         were going.

                                     JOE
                         Don't go to that synagogue anymore. 
                         You go to church. Let the Jewish 
                         people take care of themselves.

                                     PETE
                         But I'm on a quest.

                                     JOE
                         Not anymore. The Jews will be Jews. 
                         And Christians will be Christians. 
                         Don't try to change things at seven 
                         and a half.

               Pete stares out at the backyard.

                                     JOE
                         Get to bed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JOE'S BEDROOM - LATER

               Margaret lays in bed watching "The Tonight Show" when Joe 
               walks out of the bathroom. He jumps into bed and watches TV 
               with her.

                                     MARGARET
                         How bad was it?

               Joe shakes his head.

                                     MARGARET
                         Joe, I can't raise these kids alone 
                         and I've gained too much weight to 
                         find a new husband.

               Joe laughs and squeezes her stomach.

                                     JOE
                         Too much weight? You're skinnier and 
                         more beautiful than the first day I 
                         met you.

               Margaret laughs.

                                     MARGARET
                         Your charm worked on me when I was a 
                         teenager. I see what I see. Tell me 
                         about the fire.

                                     JOE
                         It was a fire. They're never good.

               Margaret knocks on the wall that the bed lays against. She 
               turns her head and faces the wall.

                                     MARGARET
                              (sarcastic to the 
                              wall)
                         Tell me about your day.
                              (As wall)
                         Well, it was a day like any other 
                         day. I stood firm, attached to the 
                         floor.

                                     JOE
                         Whaddaya want from me?

                                     MARGARET
                         Not the tough guy I'm being 
                         interviewed I did my job routine.

               Joe touches Margaret's stomach and rubs it.

                                     JOE
                         If you were skinnier when we met, I 
                         don't remember. And there's no way I 
                         liked it.

               Margaret pushes his hand away and rolls over. Joe twists the 
               pillow in half and stares at the ceiling.

                                     JOE
                         Did you know Pete was going to a 
                         synagogue to convert Jewish people?

               Margaret laughs.

                                     JOE
                         I'm not finding that as funny.

               Margaret rolls over and faces Joe.

                                     MARGARET
                         Pete is searching for meaning in his 
                         life.

                                     JOE
                         He's seven. Baseball is the only 
                         meaning in a seven year old's life.

                                     MARGARET
                         Some kids are destined for greater 
                         things than baseball.

                                     JOE
                         I don't know honey. Sounds like Pete's 
                         looking for a recipe to get beat up. 
                         I told him to leave those people 
                         alone. Don't let him go over there.

                                     MARGARET
                         I can't watch these kid's every move. 
                         Molly needs my constant attention. 
                         All I know is he walks out of the 
                         house in the morning, and when he 
                         comes back, he's clean and nobody's 
                         calling to say he was trouble.

                                     JOE
                         Now that's parenting 101. My kid's 
                         clean and nobody says he's trouble. 
                         Am I going to have to work and raise 
                         the kids?

                                     MARGARET
                         Don 't start with me Joe.

               Margaret rolls over. Joe spoons up against her.

                                     JOE
                         Maybe we should bring another kid 
                         into the world who's clean and doesn't 
                         cause any trouble?

                                     MARGARET
                         Well, if you're looking for my womb, 
                         I think it fell out over there when 
                         I was dusting. Have at it.

               Joe rolls back over and watches "The Tonight Show".

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FIREHOUSE - A FEW DAYS LATER

               Joe sits on a lounge chair outside of the firehouse with a 
               few other firemen playing cards. Roger, his brother and fellow 
               fireman, is studying the sports page.

                                     ROGER
                         The Sox hit lefties hard. Zisk loves 
                         lefties.

               No comments.

                                     ROGER
                         I think you gotta take the Sox tonight 
                         plus one fifty. They're a good bet. 
                         A buck to win a buck fifty.

                                     JOE
                         Why you try to convince us? You never 
                         bet against the Sox. Ever.

                                     ROGER
                         I like their lineup. It's explosive.

                                     JOE
                         You ever think about betting the 
                         other team. When you're betting, 
                         don't let your heart get in the way 
                         of a good decision.

                                     ROGER
                         Yeah, but when your heart and mind 
                         are in together, it's a sure bet.

                                     JOE
                         Funny how your heart and mind always 
                         say Sox.

                                     JACK
                         Gin!

               Joe throws his cards down.

                                     JOE
                         Shut the hell up Roger. Jack's 
                         crushing me cause of you.
                              (To Jack)
                         You should be a garbage man the way 
                         you pick up every card I throw. You 
                         do that to piss me off, Jack?

               Jack adds the score.

                                     JACK
                         I do it to win. Five hundred to two 
                         twenty. At a nickel a point. Fourteen 
                         bucks you owe me.

               Joe goes into his pocket and fishes out fourteen dollars. 
               Rabbi Jacobsen walks up the driveway with his son Danny. The 
               rabbi has two tinfoiled trays and Danny carries two bottles 
               of red wine.

                                     RABBI
                         Gentlemen.

               The men get quiet. Joe walks over to help the rabbi with the 
               trays.

               Roger takes the wine from Danny.

                                     RABBI
                         My wife, my son, and I wanted to 
                         thank you for your bravery and 
                         kindness.

               The rabbi looks down at Danny. Danny's White Sox hat covers 
               his bald head.

                                     DANNY
                         Thank you.

               The men, still quiet, nod. Jack takes a tray from Joe and 
               the other tray from the rabbi. Joe puts out his hand.

                                     JOE
                         Rabbi, Joe O'Malley. I'm sorry for 
                         your loss.

               The men nod in agreement.

                                     RABBI
                         Thank you. My son David was a good 
                         boy.

               The rabbi looks at the shiny red fire trucks.

                                     RABBI
                         He loved you firemen. Never understood 
                         why I couldn't be a fireman on the 
                         side and park the firetruck outside 
                         the house.

               The men laugh. Danny smiles. Joe nudges Roger and points to 
               his head. Roger nods knowingly and walks into the firehouse.

                                     RABBI
                         My wife figures the best way to thank 
                         a man is through his stomach. She 
                         baked some lasagna for all of you in 
                         appreciation.

                                     DANNY
                         It's real good.

               Joe looks at Danny.

                                     JOE
                         I bet it is.
                              (To Rabbi)
                         My guys love a good meal, but I wish 
                         your wife wouldn't have. We were 
                         just doing our job.

                                     RABBI
                         A heroic job you do. My wife wanted 
                         to thank you personally. My synagogue 
                         will want to thank you formally.

               Joe looks down. Not heroic enough to save your other son, 
               Joe thinks.

                                     RABBI
                         I don't know if you're allowed to 
                         drink red wine on the job, but lasagna 
                         just isn't as good without a fine 
                         wine.

                                     JACK
                         Nothing is as good without a fine 
                         wine.

               Roger comes back with a plastic firehat and button.

                                     ROGER
                         This is for you. A deputy fire chief.

               Danny takes off his White Sox hat and hands it to his dad. 
               He puts on the firehat.

                                     DANNY
                         Thanks.

                                     ROGER
                         You're welcome. You a big Sox fan?

                                     DANNY
                         Huge. Zisk crushes the ball.

                                     ROGER
                         Especially against lefties. You wanna 
                         check out the firetruck?

               Danny looks at his dad excitedly, His dad nods. Roger takes 
               Danny by the hand and walks back into the firehouse. The 
               other men follow.

               Joe stays out with Rabbi Jacobsen. The rabbi breaks the 
               silence.

                                     RABBI
                         It is Jewish custom to sit chiva at 
                         the house of the deceased. It is a 
                         sign of support to the family of the 
                         deceased.

                                     JOE
                         Like a wake.

                                     RABBI
                         Yes, like a wake. I know you are a 
                         busy man, but if you have time, I 
                         would be honored if you could stop 
                         by and sit for a few minutes with my 
                         family and friends.

                                     JOE
                         You bet.

                                     RABBI
                         Obviously, it is not at my home. But 
                         at my brothers on 2243 Damen.

                                     JOE
                         2243?

                                     RABBI
                         Anytime after seven PM all week.

               Danny is on the back of the truck.

                                     DANNY
                         Dad! Check me out!

                                     RABBI
                         Children realize life is about living. 
                         And death is about life. Do you have 
                         any children of your own?

               Joe laughs.

                                     JOE
                         Yep. I've got children all right. 
                         Eight.

                                     RABBI
                         Eight? A blessed man.

               Joe rolls his eyes as if the blessing isn't always so.

                                     RABBI
                         The O'Malley clan? By any chance, is 
                         a beautiful young redhead named Pete 
                         yours?

               Joe nods in embarrassment.

                                     RABBI
                         Your bravery has been passed on. 
                         He's the most earnest, delightful 
                         young man I have ever met.

                                     JOE
                         I found out he's been a nuisance at 
                         your temple and I've reprimanded 
                         him. He won't be bothering you 
                         anymore.

                                     RABBI
                         Your son is a welcome sight at the 
                         temple.

               Danny screams as he sits in the rear driving seat. Joe and 
               the rabbi look at Danny.

                                     JOE
                         Do you mind if I ask?

               Joe points to his head.

                                     RABBI
                         Luekemia. Chemotherapy.

                                     JOE
                         I'm sorry. So sorry.

                                     RABBI
                         God has a plan. A mysterious plan 
                         for my family.

               Joe and the rabbi watch Danny.

                                     RABBI
                         If you can find time, we would love 
                         to have you at my brother's house. 
                         Bring Pete. It would be good for 
                         everyone spirits to see a child so 
                         full of life like your son.

               Joe smiles.

                                     JOE
                         He's full of something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. O'MALLEY FAMILY ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

               Pete and Seamus lay on the floor playing "All Star Baseball". 
               Katie dances around to music from the record player. Baby 
               Molly sleeps in the crib. Patrick walks in the door with the 
               day's mail. Katie runs over and grabs the mail from him.

                                     KATIE
                         Getting the mail is my job.

               She punches him, hands over the mail to Katie, who takes it 
               over to the table. She rifles through the mail. Katie can't 
               read.

                                     KATIE
                         Bill! Bill! Bill! Looks like all 
                         bills.

               Katie gets up and starts to dance. Patrick sits down and 
               looks at the mail. A few pieces of official mail are addressed 
               to him. Patrick opens them up and reads them. Patrick crumples 
               the paper and leaves it on the table. He walks away from the 
               table.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. O'MALLEY KITCHEN - EARLY NIGHT

               The family sits at the dinner table. Tommy and Eddie are 
               missing from the table. The kids eat pot roast and roasted 
               potatoes.

                                     JOE
                         The boys game started at six?

                                     SEAMUS
                         Doubleheader. Uncle Roger, Billy, 
                         and Roger junior are going.

               Joe looks at Margaret. She nods.

                                     JOE
                         You finish your chores?

                                     SEAMUS
                         Yep.

               Joe nods. Pete looks at his dad.

                                     JOE
                         Rabbi Jacobsen invited you and me to 
                         a... a... chivas at his house.

                                     PETE
                         Rabbi Jacobsen? Chivas?

                                     JOE
                         Yep. Like a wake. I told him we would 
                         be there.

               Joe looks at Margaret. She smiles.

                                     PETE
                         How's he doing?

                                     JOE
                         It's gotta be tough.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah.

                                     JOE
                         We'll go and then catch the second 
                         game.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah. We'll do that.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Tell Rabbi Jacobsen I'm sorry for 
                         him.

                                     PETE
                         I will.

                                     JOE
                         You know he's got a boy your age. I 
                         met him today. He'll be there.

               Pete nods.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. O'MALLEY KITCHEN - AFTER DINNER

               Joe and Margaret still sit at the table. Joe drinks a beer 
               while Margaret drinks coffee. Mary rocks Molly. Seamus stands 
               at the sink scraping food and washing dishes. He hands them 
               to Pete, who stands on a stool and rinses the dishes. Pete 
               hands the dishes to Katie, who places the dishes in the 
               dishwasher.

                                     JOE
                         The rabbi's other kid has leukemia.

                                     MARGARET
                         We've been blessed. I don't know how 
                         we've been so lucky, but I'm not to 
                         question it.

                                     JOE
                         Stupid electrical wiring. Those damn 
                         old houses weren't built for modern 
                         wiring.

               Patrick walks by.

                                     JOE
                         Hey, lifesaver, why don't you sit 
                         down?

               Patrick takes a seat.

                                     JOE
                         So, your mother thinks you got some 
                         news?

               Patrick plays with his fork.

                                     PATRICK
                         Maybe I'll take a look at the job 
                         over at the city planners office.

               Joe pauses.

                                     JOE
                         It's a good job with nice benefits. 
                         I'll talk to Alderman McManus about 
                         it.

               Patrick stays silent.

                                     JOE
                         Well, don't go there with that 
                         attitude. The alderman's doing us a 
                         favor. So don't go acting like a 
                         punk.

               From the kitchen, Katie mimics her dad.

                                     KATIE
                         Yeah, don't go acting like a punk.

               Patrick stays silent.

                                     JOE
                         A lot of kids your age don't have a 
                         chance like this.

                                     PATRICK
                         A lot of kids my age go to college. 
                         Not to work.

                                     JOE
                         Yeah, and when they graduate, they're 
                         four years behind you in the working 
                         world. All they've learned from 
                         college is how to smoke pot and sleep.

                                     PATRICK
                         The good jobs nowadays require a 
                         college degree.

                                     JOE
                         A city job is a good job, and all it 
                         requires is hard work and a good 
                         attitude.

                                     PATRICK
                         The Irish way. Get a city job, work 
                         hard, have forty kids, retire on a 
                         crap pension in the same house you 
                         lived in all your life.

                                     JOE
                         You wanna be some hotshot bigshot, 
                         have one point two kids, live in the 
                         suburbs in a big house with no love 
                         to fill a closet, and retire to 
                         Florida to die like a raisin?

                                     PATRICK
                         Yeah, what if do?

                                     JOE
                         Then go ahead. Be like the Jews. 
                         Have no more than two kids because 
                         it's not economical to have more. 
                         Make every decision based on money. 
                         Raise your kids to base their life 
                         on the size of their wallet. Raise 
                         them to worship the almighty dollar, 
                         not God.

                                     PATRICK
                         No, Dad, I shouldn't raise my kids 
                         to base their worth on the size of 
                         their wallet when I can teach them 
                         to base it on how much booze they 
                         can handle without puking.

               Joe gets up and cracks Patrick. The kids run to their mom.

                                     JOE
                         You ungrateful, smartass prick. You 
                         got all the answers at eighteen, 
                         don't you?

                                     PATRICK
                         No, but maybe if I work a city fucking 
                         job, I'll have all the answers at 
                         forty.

               Joe cracks Patrick upside the head and knocks him over. The 
               kids scream. Patrick gets up. He thinks about charging his 
               dad, but decides to walk out of the kitchen and out of the 
               house. The kids cry. Margaret shakes her head. Joe finishes 
               his beer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. O'MALLEY STATION WAGON - AN HOUR LATER

               Pete and Joe drive in the wagon. The White Sox broadcast 
               blares from the radio. They drive in silence.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RABBI JACOBSEN'S BROTHER'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

               Pete and Joe enter the house. A lot of people sit quietly. 
               The rabbi's brother greets them.

                                     JEFFREY
                         I'm Jeffrey Jacobsen, Kenny's brother. 
                         We're glad you could make it.

               Pete hands Jeffrey some flowers. The room is void of any 
               flowers.

               Jeffrey looks around for a place to put the flowers.

                                     JEFFREY
                         I'll bring this in the kitchen.

               Thanks. Can I get you anything to drink?

                                     JOE
                         Scotch.

                                     JEFFREY
                         I'll check to see if I have any 
                         scotch. If not?

                                     JOE
                         A beer.

                                     JEFFREY
                         I'll check to see if I have any beer. 
                         If not?

                                     JOE
                         You know what, I'm fine.

                                     JEFFREY
                         You sure?

                                     JOE
                         Yeah, I'm sure. Thanks.

               Jeffrey looks at Pete.

                                     PETE
                         No thanks.

               People sit on the couch. A picture of David sits prominently 
               on the table. A handsome young boy. Joe works his way over 
               to Mrs. Jacobsen, who sits on the couch. Mrs. Jacobsen, a 
               pretty but plain dark haired woman, shakes Joe's hand.

                                     JOE
                         I am sorry for your loss, Mrs. 
                         Jacobsen.

                                     MRS. JACOBSEN
                         Thank you.

               Pete stands quietly next to his dad. A gentlemen gets up 
               from the couch facing Mrs. Jacobsen and motions for Pete and 
               Joe to sit. They sit. Small, quiet conversations take place 
               around them. Pete and Joe sit quietly. Rabbi Jacobsen enters 
               the room with Danny. He walks over to Joe, who has stood up 
               to greet the rabbi. Joe puts out his hand. The rabbi shakes 
               his hand, but also moves in to hug Joe. Joe moves in 
               unexpectedly for the hug. The rabbi picks up Pete and hugs 
               him. Pete laughs.

                                     RABBI
                         My family is grateful to you.

               Joe nods. Danny waves to Joe. Joe waves to him. Danny looks 
               at Pete.

                                     DANNY
                         You wanna check out my room that I'm 
                         sharing with my cousin?

               Pete looks at his dad. Joe gives him the OK. Pete and Danny 
               take off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DANNY'S ROOM - SECONDS LATER

               Danny shows Pete his autographed glove. Sandy Koufax!

                                     DANNY
                         My dad says it's rare cause Mr. Koufax 
                         rarely signed things.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah. Was he good?

                                     DANNY
                         I think so.

               Danny hands Pete another glove.

                                     DANNY
                         This was my brothers. You wanna play 
                         catch?

                                     PETE
                         In the house?

               Danny grabs a tennis ball.

                                     DANNY
                         Yeah. It's just a tennis ball.

                                     PETE
                         Sure.

               Danny fires a strike.

                                     PETE
                         How'd you lose your hair?

                                     DANNY
                         Leukemia. It's cancer. I take this 
                         medicine that makes me lose my hair.

                                     PETE
                         Does it hurt?

                                     DANNY
                         No. The hair just fell out. I used 
                         to have black hair.

                                     PETE
                         I've got red hair.

                                     DANNY
                         My friend Charlie's got red hair.

               They throw the ball back and forth.

                                     PETE
                         I'm sorry about your brother.

                                     DANNY
                         Thanks. You know, since my cancer, 
                         he didn't beat me up as much. We had 
                         fun together. Do you have any 
                         brothers?

                                     PETE
                         Four older brothers.

                                     DANNY
                         Wow. You must get your butt kicked?

               Pete nods.

                                     PETE
                         My older sister's worse. My brothers 
                         just punch me in the gut. She pulls 
                         my hair. That hurts. I wish I were 
                         bald then.

               Danny smiles.

                                     PETE
                         Was the fire scary?

                                     DANNY
                         I don't know what happened. David 
                         was watching cartoons in the TV room. 
                         I was upstairs playing baseball. And 
                         then I noticed a lot of smoke. I 
                         opened my door but there was a lot 
                         of fire. I tried to open my window, 
                         but I couldn't. I couldn't see the 
                         fire anymore because the smoke got 
                         so thick. And then your dad came in. 
                         He saved my life, I think. It was 
                         nothing like the fire drills you do 
                         in school.

                                     PETE
                         Where do you go to school?

                                     DANNY
                         Briarwood. How 'bout you?

                                     PETE
                         Holy Cross. Going into third grade.

                                     DANNY
                         I'm going into second. I missed a 
                         lot of first grade with all of the 
                         chemotherapy. That's what they call 
                         the cancer medicine.

               The boys throw the ball back and forth.

                                     PETE
                         What's it like to be Jewish?

                                     DANNY
                         I don't know. Good.

                                     PETE
                         I'm Catholic.

                                     DANNY
                         What's that like?

                                     PETE
                         Noisier.

                                     DANNY
                         Things are usually noisier around 
                         here. But everyone's really sad.

                                     PETE
                         My Uncle Jim died a few weeks ago. 
                         He was old. He was really my 
                         grandfather's brother, but we still 
                         called him Uncle Jim.

                                     DANNY
                         I got an uncle like that. Harvey.

                                     PETE
                         You would have thought my uncle's 
                         funeral was a birthday party.

                                     DANNY
                         Sounds like fun.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah it is. My mom says that people 
                         are sad because they love the person, 
                         but are happy cause they get to go 
                         to heaven. Jewish people can't go to 
                         heaven.

                                     DANNY
                         Why not?

                                     PETE
                         Cause they're Jewish. God doesn't 
                         let Jewish people in heaven.

               Danny's quiet.

                                     PETE
                         If you're interested, I think I can 
                         show you how to get to heaven.

                                     DANNY
                         Yeah?

                                     PETE
                         Yep. I would just have to convert 
                         you.

                                     DANNY
                         How do you do that?

                                     PETE
                         I don't know. I haven't converted 
                         anyone before.

                                     DANNY
                         What can I do in heaven?

                                     PETE
                         Anything you want. They call it 
                         paradise.

                                     DANNY
                         Sounds good. When can we start?

                                     PETE
                         Tomorrow.

                                     DANNY
                         I got my last chemotherapy treatment 
                         on Friday. So that gives us all week.

                                     PETE
                         Fine. Let's meet at your dad's 
                         synagogue.

                                     DANNY
                         OK.

               The boys toss the ball back and forth.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. O'MALLEY STATION WAGON - LATER

               Pete and Joe sit in the wagon.

                                     JOE
                         Danny's a good kid, huh?

                                     PETE
                         Yeah. His medicine makes him bald. 
                         But it doesn't hurt. I'm gonna convert 
                         him.

               Joe shakes his head.

                                     JOE
                         Leave him alone.

                                     PETE
                         He wants to.

                                     JOE
                         But his parents don't. Look, he's 
                         Jewish. His family's Jewish. If they 
                         wanted to be Christian, his parents 
                         would change.

                                     PETE
                         But it's a quest.

                                     JOE
                         The quest has been called off.

                                     PETE
                         I promised Danny. We're meeting at 
                         the synagogue.

                                     JOE
                         Well, I'm breaking that promise. You 
                         can't go converting Jewish kids the 
                         same way they don't go converting 
                         you.

                                     PETE
                         But he wants to.

                                     JOE
                         I said no. No more lip from you. Do 
                         not go to that synagogue and do not 
                         bother Danny or his family anymore. 
                         Do you understand me?

               Pete doesn't answer.

                                     JOE
                         Do you understand me? If I find out 
                         you've been going over there, you 
                         will get the spanking of a lifetime 
                         and be grounded until you're sixteen. 
                         Do you understand?

                                     PETE
                         Yes.

               The lights of the local baseball field illuminate the night. 
               Joe turns into the parking lot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SYNAGOGUE - NEXT DAY

               Danny, with his White Sox hat covering his bald head, stands 
               outside the synagogue. DIFFERENT SHOTS of Danny waiting. 
               Danny finally decides Pete is not showing up. He gets on his 
               bike and turns the corner back toward his uncle's house. As 
               he passes an alley, Pete pops out and almost scares Danny 
               off his bike. Pete sneaks back into the alley.

                         What are you doing?

                                     PETE
                         Our quest has to be done in secret. 
                         Our mission is now undercover.

                                     DANNY
                         Why?

                                     PETE
                         Cause.

                                     DANNY
                         What's our mission?

                                     PETE
                         To get you to heaven.

                                     DANNY
                         Right. How we gonna know I got to 
                         heaven?

                                     PETE
                         We'll just know.

                                     DANNY
                         So what are we gonna do?

                                     PETE
                         We got to set up some tests.

                                     DANNY
                         Like school.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah. But those tests aren't fun. 
                         What's the purpose of making it to 
                         heaven if the tests aren't fun?

                                     DANNY
                         Have you taken any of these tests?

               Pete thinks.

                                     PETE
                         Since I'm Catholic, I don't think I 
                         have to. It's just automatic.

                                     DANNY
                         That's cool.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah. But you know what. For my first 
                         communion next year, I have to 
                         complete first communion training.

                                     DANNY
                         What's communion?

                                     PETE
                         This piece of bread that is Jesus.

                                     DANNY
                         And you eat it?

                                     PETE
                         Yep.

                                     DANNY
                         Gross.

                                     PETE
                         I watch people eat it and they don't 
                         gross out. And my brothers say it 
                         tastes like wheat bread.

                                     DANNY
                         Not as good as white. So I should do 
                         the first communion training.

                                     PETE
                         I haven't done it yet, so I don't 
                         know what it is.

                                     DANNY
                         Darn.

                                     PETE
                         But we can make up our own.

               The kids think.

                                     DANNY
                         How about something like Bruce Jenner 
                         and a decathlon? Win the decathlon, 
                         go to heaven.

               Pete thinks.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah, something like that.

                                     DANNY
                         And then we should have a gold medal 
                         ceremony. Gotta have a medal.

                                     PETE
                         Communion can be your medal.

                                     DANNY
                         The Jesus wheat bread?

                                     PETE
                         Yeah.

                                     DANNY
                         I'd rather have a medal.

                                     PETE
                         We can talk about it later. Let's 
                         go, we can't be spotted.

                                     DANNY
                         Why can't we spotted?

                                     PETE
                         We're undercover.

                                     DANNY
                         Right.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATED TRAIN - MINUTES LATER

               Pete and Danny sit on the Elevated Train that runs from 
               Chicago's north side to its south side. Pete looks out the 
               window. They pass a car wash. Danny looks up and down the 
               aisle.

                                     DANNY
                         My parents don't let me on the El 
                         without them.

                                     PETE
                         Father Kelly always talks about a 
                         risk reward. I think you'll be OK if 
                         your parents find out. We'll just 
                         explain the risk was worth the reward.

                                     DANNY
                         Right.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OAK STREET BEACH - MINUTES LATER

               The beach is pretty full. Lake Michigan's waves crash weakly 
               against the rocks. Gymnastic rings are set up at the north 
               side of the beach along with an area filled with weights. 
               Elevated five feet above the beach is a paved area for runners 
               and bikers.

                                     PETE
                         If we see my sister, just start 
                         running.

                                     DANNY
                         How am I gonna know it's your sister?

                                     PETE
                         I'll be running.

                                     DANNY
                         Right.

               The boys look around. Two teenage girls in bikinis walk past 
               them.

               The boys smile. The girls smile back. Danny does his best 
               Fonz impression. Pete laughs.

                                     PETE
                         Bruce Jenner is faster, stronger, 
                         and can jump higher than anyone else. 
                         So that's how we should do this.

                                     DANNY
                         OK. I'm fast.

                                     PETE
                         But first, you need to be baptized. 
                         My baby sister just got baptized. We 
                         all got baptized. I don't remember 
                         mine, but I've seen pictures.

               Danny nods.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - MINUTES LATER

               Pete is trying to pick up Danny by his ankles. He lifts Danny 
               up and they both fall into the water. Pete, determined to do 
               it right, then grabs Danny by the ankles and lifts. Danny's 
               head, along with his shoulders, wade back and forth in the 
               water.

                                     PETE
                         Amen!

               Pete lets go of Danny's legs and Danny crashes completely 
               into the water. Pete falls in also. They both wipe away the 
               water from their faces.

                                     PETE
                         I think it would have been easier if 
                         you were a baby.

                                     DANNY
                         Let's get started. What should we do 
                         first?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OAK STREET BEACH - LATER

               A SERIES OF SHOTS. Pete counting as Danny runs toward him. 
               Danny hanging from a ring as Pete counts him down. Pete and 
               Danny talking to a man with weights. Danny trying to lift 
               the weight. He can't.

               Pete tries. He can't. They take off some of the weight. Danny 
               lifts the weight over his head. Danny climbs a small hill of 
               rocks. Pete waits for him at the bottom, about six feet below. 
               Danny jumps, hits the sand, and rolls.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OAK STREET BEACH - LATER

               Pete and Danny alternating turns drinking from a thermos.

                                     DANNY
                         Nine down. One to go.

                                     PETE
                         This one's gotta be tough.

                                     DANNY
                         Some of those were tough.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah, but the last one's gotta be 
                         real tough. Something that takes 
                         strength, speed, and courage.

                                     DANNY
                         I don't know.

                                     PETE
                         What can't you do well?

                                     DANNY
                         I'm not a strong swimmer.

               Pete looks out to Lake Michigan. A buoy signals the spot 
               where the lifeguards don't want you to swim past.

                                     PETE
                         Swim out to the buoy.

               Danny looks for the buoy.

                                     DANNY
                         I can't even see the buoy.

               Pete points to it.

                                     DANNY
                         I can't get there.

                                     PETE
                         You're going to have to if you wanna 
                         win the decathlon.

               Pete and Danny head toward the water.

                                     PETE
                         Look, I'm not asking you to do 
                         something I can't. When I was your 
                         age, I could swim to the buoy.

                                     DANNY
                         Do I have to get to the buoy and 
                         back under a certain amount of time.

               Pete looks at the buoy. He looks at Danny.

                                     PETE
                         What do you think?

                                     DANNY
                         No.

                                     PETE
                         Getting there and back is enough.

               Danny smiles.

                                     PETE
                         Don't worry. I'm here. And there are 
                         lifeguards everywhere.

               Danny starts swimming. He dips his head in the water and 
               slowly one arm dives in the water while one arm raises out 
               of the water. He brings his whole head out of the water to 
               breathe, dips his head in the water, and repeats the process. 
               Halfway to the buoy, he tries to pick his head up to see 
               where the buoy is. He begins to sink and panics. His arms 
               start to flail. Pete dives into the water as Danny turns his 
               body so he can float on his back. Pete reaches Danny and 
               grabs him.

                                     PETE
                         You OK?

                                     DANNY
                         I couldn't make it. And then I 
                         remembered what my swim teacher taught 
                         me about floating. But I don't think 
                         I could float there and back.

                                     PETE
                         No, I don't think so either. Can you 
                         make it back?

               Danny nods and rolls over to his front. Danny starts swimming 
               in and Pete follows him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EL TRAIN - MINUTES LATER

               Pete and Danny sit on the El. Danny's dejected.

                                     PETE
                         In one day you passed nine tests. 
                         God's gotta be happy with you.

                                     DANNY
                         Yeah, but I don't know how I'm gonna 
                         pass the last one. That's tough.

                                     PETE
                         Look, we got all week. Trust me. You 
                         can do it.

                                     DANNY
                         I hope so. I really want to go to 
                         heaven.

                                     PETE
                         You will. Do kids die from what you 
                         have?

               Danny nods.

                                     DANNY
                         The first time I took chemotherapy, 
                         two other boys and a girl took it 
                         with me. When they started me on it 
                         a second time, I was the only one. 
                         The others died.

                                     PETE
                         How do you know?

                                     DANNY
                         I asked. The nurses got all quiet. 
                         Grown ups always get quiet when they 
                         talk about death.

                                     PETE
                         Not at my uncle's funeral.

                                     DANNY
                         Sometimes I hear my parents talk 
                         about it late at night and they cry. 
                         I feel so bad. And now with my 
                         brother, my mom cries all day and 
                         night. I don't want her to be so sad 
                         if I die.

                                     PETE
                         No, I wouldn't want that either.

                                     DANNY
                         So if I can convince her that I'm 
                         going to paradise, maybe she won't 
                         be so sad.

               Pete nods. The boys look out the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - THE NEXT DAY

               Danny swims out toward the buoy. He doesn't make it. He floats 
               and waits for Pete. He follows Pete back to the shore.

                                     PETE
                         I don't understand. You look like 
                         you're going to get there, and then 
                         you don't.

                                     DANNY
                         I don't know.

                                     PETE
                         But you swim back to shore fine with 
                         me.

                                     DANNY
                         I know.

                                     PETE
                         So what is it?

                                     DANNY
                         I look up to see where the buoy is, 
                         and I can't see it. And then I start 
                         to realize how far out I am and...

                                     PETE
                         What if I go with you?

                                     DANNY
                         No. I gotta do it alone.

                                     PETE
                         Well maybe if you don't look up.

                                     DANNY
                         But then I don't know where I am.

                                     PETE
                         We'll figure this out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - NEXT DAY

               Danny puts on the goggles. But he still can't do it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OAK STREET BEACH - MINUTES LATER

               Pete puts on the goggles. He looks out toward the buoy.

                                     PETE
                         I can see fine.

               Pete hands the goggles to Danny. Danny puts them on and looks 
               toward the buoy.

                                     DANNY
                         I can see it from here. But when I 
                         get in the water, I can't see it and 
                         then everything starts getting really 
                         fast and I can't go any further.

               Pete plays with the sand. Danny scoops sand and throws it.

                                     PETE
                         Stand up.

               Danny stands. Pete raises Danny's hands over his head. Pete 
               then raises his hands over his head. He measures the 
               difference.

                                     PETE
                         You stay here and watch me swim to 
                         the buoy. I'll be right back.

               Pete swims out to the buoy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - MINUTES LATER

               Pete swims ashore.

                                     PETE
                         It took me fifty strokes there, and 
                         fifty five strokes back. One hundred 
                         and five strokes.

                                     DANNY
                         So?

                                     PETE
                         Your problem is when you look up and 
                         you can't see the buoy, you get scared 
                         and panic.

                                     DANNY
                         I don't get scared.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah you do.

                                     DANNY
                         No I don't.

                                     PETE
                         Listen. All you have to do is count 
                         your strokes. You don't need to look 
                         up. Can you count to fifty?

                                     DANNY
                         Yeah.

                                     PETE
                         Well, I'm a little bigger so it's 
                         going to take you a few more strokes. 
                         Can you count to sixty?

                                     DANNY
                         Yep.

                                     PETE
                         Well then, just count to sixty strokes 
                         and then swim back. It might take 
                         you a few more strokes on the way 
                         back.

                                     DANNY
                         I can do that. But I'm real tired 
                         and I need to get back for my 
                         treatment this afternoon.

                                     PETE
                         Right. Tomorrow. Tomorrow you complete 
                         the decathlon.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL - THAT AFTERNOON

               Danny sitting in a chair with IV's stuck in him. He's watching 
               the White Sox. Through the door window, a doctor speaks to 
               Rabbi Jacobsen and his wife.

                                     DOCTOR
                         This last treatment will weaken his 
                         immune system greatly. The red blood 
                         cells don't seem to be responding, 
                         so we upped the dosage.

                                     RABBI
                         What's the prognosis?

                                     DOCTOR
                         I don't know. If this treatment 
                         doesn't work, I don't think there's 
                         anymore we can do.

                                     MRS. JACOBSEN
                         Why? Isn't there a stronger dosage 
                         or more intensive treatment?

                                     DOCTOR
                         This is the most intensive treatment. 
                         And a stronger dosage would kill 
                         him.

               Mrs. Jacobsen goes to speak but the rabbi grabs her hand. He 
               squeezes it. The Jacobsen's enter the room.

                                     DANNY
                         The Sox are getting clobbered Dad.

                                     RABBI
                         They've been getting clobbered all 
                         my life.

                                     DANNY
                         Mine too.

               The rabbi squeezes his wife's hand.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SYNAGOGUE - NEXT MORNING

               Pete sits in the a doorway hidden from plain sight. The rabbi 
               walks up to Pete.

                                     RABBI
                         Danny told me I might find you here.

                                     PETE
                         I don't know how he knew I would be 
                         here.

               The rabbi smiles.

                                     RABBI
                         Danny wanted me to tell you that he 
                         wouldn't be able to complete the 
                         decathlon today.

               Pete stares at the Rabbi, hoping to be able to figure out 
               how much the rabbi knows.

                                     RABBI
                         You see, the medicine Danny's 
                         taking...

                                     PETE
                         Chemotherapy.

                                     RABBI
                         Yep. Chemotherapy. It zaps him of 
                         his strength. And weakens his ability 
                         to fight off disease.

                                     PETE
                         Sounds like bad medicine.

                                     RABBI
                         Yes it does. But that's how doctors 
                         fight cancer.

                                     PETE
                         My oldest brother wants to become a 
                         doctor. My mom always tells me to do 
                         my homework so I can be smart and 
                         become a doctor.

                                     RABBI
                         It's a noble profession.

                                     PETE
                         My dad thinks they play too much 
                         golf. And they charge like assholes.

                                     RABBI
                         I hate to disagree with your dad, 
                         but he probably wouldn't want you 
                         using that word.

                                     PETE
                         Seamus says you can use swear words 
                         if you're quoting someone.

                                     RABBI
                         Seamus sounds like a fine journalist. 
                         Is your oldest brother going to 
                         college to study medicine?

                                     PETE
                         No. He can't afford college.

                                     RABBI
                         Higher education is expensive. But 
                         worth it if you work hard.

                                     PETE
                         Rabbi, when do you think Danny will 
                         be better?

                                     RABBI
                         I did not study medicine in college, 
                         but even if I did, I don't think I 
                         could answer that. It's in God's 
                         hands now.

                                     PETE
                         Well, you're close with God. Hopefully 
                         that rubs off a little on Danny. I 
                         hope he gets better, we've got some 
                         unfinished business.

                                     RABBI
                         I hope so too. Praying for Danny is 
                         all we can do now.

                                     PETE
                         OK. I'll pray to Jesus, you pray to 
                         God, and hopefully somebody listens.

                                     RABBI
                         That's a deal.

               Pete jumps on his bike.

                                     PETE
                         See ya later Rabbi Jacobsen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOLY CROSS CHURCH - MINUTES LATER

               Pete sits by himself in a pew at church. Father Kelly, 71, 
               snow white hair, skin cancered face, cantankerous old man, 
               notices Pete and walks over.

                                     FATHER
                         Mr. O'Malley? Are you lost?

                                     PETE
                         Hey Father. No, I promised a friend 
                         I'd pray for him. He's sick.

                                     FATHER
                         Well, maybe I can say a prayer for 
                         him also.

               Father Kelly sits down next to Pete.

                                     PETE
                         His name's Danny. He's got cancer.

               Father Kelly does the sign of the cross. He closes his eyes. 
               Pete stares at him. Father Kelly opens one eye at Pete.

                                     FATHER
                         You finish your prayer?

               Pete nods.

                                     FATHER
                         Well, let me finish my prayers without 
                         you bothering me.

               Pete stands up and walks toward the altar. Father Kelly 
               watches him.

                                     FATHER
                         Where are you going?

                                     PETE
                         Just checking out how this place 
                         looks from your seat.

               Pete takes a seat in a chair to the left of the altar. Father 
               Kelly stands and walks toward the altar.

                                     FATHER
                         That's my seat. Don't mess it up.

                                     PETE
                         You get nervous with everyone looking 
                         at you?

                                     FATHER
                         I'm used to being looked at.

                                     PETE
                         You ever get nervous that you won't 
                         know what to say or you'll forget 
                         what you wanted to say?

                                     FATHER
                         No.

                                     PETE
                         How do you get paid?

                                     FATHER
                         That's between me and the IRS.

                                     PETE
                         Do you get the collection money?

                                     FATHER
                         No. Someone tell you I did?

               Pete shakes his head.

                                     FATHER
                         Do you need to get home?

               Pete shakes his head.

                                     PETE
                         Your job's to help people to get to 
                         heaven, right?

               Father Kelly nods.

                                     PETE
                         How do you know if you've done your 
                         job good?

                                     FATHER
                         Well. I pray that I do it well. Why? 
                         You have any complaints?

                                     PETE
                         You ever actually seen someone in 
                         heaven?

               Father Kelly shakes his head.

                                     PETE
                         Then how do you know if the people 
                         you're helping made it to heaven?

                                     FATHER
                         Faith.

                                     PETE
                         Faith?

                                     FATHER
                         Yep. Believing in something completely 
                         without actually having proof of it. 
                         Faith. I don't have any proof of 
                         heaven, but I have faith it exists.

                                     PETE
                         What's the best way to get to heaven?

                                     FATHER
                         By believing in Jesus and doing as 
                         he taught us.

                                     PETE
                         How do we know if we're doing that? 
                         Is there some test?

                                     FATHER
                         Life is a test.

                                     PETE
                         But then you need to die to figure 
                         out how you did on the test?

               Father Kelly laughs. He nods. He opens the altar and fills 
               the chalice with hosts.

                                     PETE
                         Don't you just once want to know if 
                         one of the people you prayed for 
                         made it to heaven?

                                     FATHER
                         In due time.

               Father Kelly finishes filling the chalice with bread.

                                     PETE
                         What's the purpose of communion?

                                     FATHER
                         To have a piece of Jesus be a part 
                         of us.

                                     PETE
                         Why do I have to wait till third 
                         grade for that? Wouldn't that help 
                         me now?

                                     FATHER
                         The Church believes that Catholics 
                         should fulfill a few requirements 
                         before they earn communion.

                                     PETE
                         Like passing a few tests?

                                     FATHER
                         Yes.

                                     PETE
                         So if I pass all the tests, I get to 
                         have communion.

                                     FATHER
                         Yes.

                                     PETE
                         Thanks Father. You've cleared up a 
                         few things for me.

               Pete runs off the altar.

                                     FATHER
                         Good, glad the grilling is over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. O'MALLEY KITCHEN TABLE - THAT NIGHT

               The family sits around the table.

                                     MARGARET
                         Rabbi Jacobsen wanted to see if he 
                         could stop by after work. I said 
                         fine.

               Pete's eyes light up but he doesn't want to say anything 
               that would get him in trouble.

                                     JOE
                         This gratitude stuff is becoming 
                         intrusive.

                                     MARGARET
                         If the only fault you can find with 
                         a person is that they go overboard 
                         with kindness and gratitude, I can 
                         live with that.

                                     KATIE
                         Me too.

                                     JOE
                         Yeah. Yeah.
                              (To Patrick's chair)
                         Where's knucklehead?

                                     KATIE
                         He said he'd be home late for dinner.

                                     JOE
                         Oh yeah. Did he say why?

                                     KATIE
                         He told me to mind my own business.

                                     JOE
                         He's probably sitting on his ass 
                         reading a book in that lifeguard 
                         tower. Where the others?

                                     SEAMUS
                         Tommy and Eddie have a game up north. 
                         Another doubleheader. And Mary's 
                         eating at a friends.

               The doorbell rings. Pete and Katie run to get it. Pete lets 
               Katie open the door. Rabbi Jacobsen stands with a tray of 
               rugala, a Jewish pastry.

                                     RABBI
                         Hello. I know Pete, and whom may I 
                         ask are you?

               Katie puts her hand out. The rabbi goes to shake her hand 
               but she put her hand out to take the tray.

                                     RABBI
                         This might be too big for you.

                                     KATIE
                         I handle bigger trays than that in 
                         the kitchen. How do you think I feed 
                         eight kids?

               The Rabbi nods and hands the dish to Katie. She carries it 
               into the kitchen.

                                     PETE
                         How's Danny doing?

                                     RABBI
                         He's doing better. Still not ready 
                         to play but he said to say hi and 
                         he'll stop by to see you when he can 
                         play again.

               Pete looks back to see if his dad heard that. He didn't.

                                     PETE
                         Come on in. We're just eating dinner.

               The rabbi follows Pete into the kitchen. Seamus sits eating 
               his potatoes. He stands up and shakes the rabbi's hand.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Rabbi Jacobsen.

                                     RABBI
                         Seamus. Nice to see you.

               Joe stands up and shakes the rabbi's hand. The rabbi walks 
               over and says hello to Margaret and pats little Molly on the 
               head.

                                     MARGARET
                         Would you like some dinner? There's 
                         plenty.

               The rabbi looks at the well sliced pieces of ham and huge 
               bowl of mashed potatoes.

                                     RABBI
                         No thank you. My wife knows when 
                         I've been eating other people's 
                         dinner. She considers it a form of 
                         adultery.

               Margaret laughs.

                                     MARGARET
                         How 'bout some coffee?

                                     RABBI
                         Sure.

               Katie stands up and walks toward the coffee pot.

                                     KATIE
                         Black? Cream? Sugar?

                                     RABBI
                         Two sugars. Thank you.

                                     KATIE
                         You're welcome.

                                     JOE
                         Please sit.

               The rabbi takes a seat at the table.

                                     JOE
                         How's your little boy?

                                     RABBI
                         Hanging in there, thank you. He just 
                         finished more treatment and hopefully 
                         this works.

                                     JOE
                         We hope so too.

               Margaret comes back with the rugala on a plate. Katie hands 
               the rabbi his coffee. Margaret takes a bite of the rugala.

                                     MARGARET
                         It's absolutely delicious.

               The rabbi takes a little.

                                     RABBI
                         She can't get mad at me if I'm eating 
                         her own stuff. Rugala, a Jewish 
                         pastry. My favorite.

               Margaret hands the rugala out to the boys and Joe. They're 
               all very happy.

                                     JOE
                         So what's going on?

                                     RABBI
                         Well, remember when I told you that 
                         my congregation will want to formally 
                         thank you for your bravery.

                                     JOE
                         There's no need, Rabbi. And that's 
                         the end of that.

                                     RABBI
                         Well, maybe Margaret and you would 
                         like to talk about it more in private?

               Joe looks at the boys. Seamus's busy eating his rugala and 
               Pete stares at the rabbi.

                                     JOE
                         That's OK.

                                     RABBI
                         Well, you personally showed bravery 
                         beyond the call of duty when you 
                         saved Danny, and if it weren't for 
                         the gas pipe blowing up, you were 
                         going back in against the wishes of 
                         your partners.

               Joe is embarrassed and quiet.

                                     RABBI
                         The firemen saved the fire from 
                         spreading and many of the people 
                         from my temple live in that 
                         neighborhood.

               Patrick enters the front door. He walks into the kitchen.

                                     MARGARET
                         Patrick, I would like you to meet 
                         Rabbi Jacobsen.

                                     RABBI
                         Patrick, your brother Peter has told 
                         me much about you. Nice to meet you.

               They shake hands.

                                     PATRICK
                         Nice to meet you, Rabbi. I'm sorry 
                         for your loss.

                                     RABBI
                         Thank you. Well, Patrick, I was just 
                         telling your father that my temple 
                         would like to say thank you to him. 
                         And it might interest you.

               Patrick sits down.

                                     RABBI
                         Pete has told me of your wish to go 
                         to college and study medicine.

               Patrick looks at Pete. Joe looks at Pete. Pete knows his 
               dad's look is not the same as Patrick's and Pete looks down.

                                     RABBI
                         My temple gives educational 
                         scholarships to deserving students, 
                         and the scholarship board has 
                         recommended Patrick for a full 
                         scholarship to a state university.

               Patrick's jaw drops. Margaret sits shocked and Joe stands 
               up.

                                     JOE
                         Rabbi Jacobsen, that is an extremely 
                         kind offer, but one that we cannot 
                         accept.

               Patrick looks at Joe and tears form in his eyes.

                                     RABBI
                         It would mean a lot to our 
                         congregation and personally to my 
                         family if you would accept it.

                                     JOE
                         Other men risked their lives that 
                         day and every other day.

                                     RABBI
                         We understand that. But, to be frank, 
                         it's more personal than say giving 
                         the fire department a sculpture in 
                         gratitude. Your fire chief approved 
                         it.

                                     JOE
                         You spoke to my boss?

                                     RABBI
                         Yes. We wanted to make sure it was 
                         within the rules. The scholarship 
                         board can only grant one scholarship, 
                         and when Pete told me of Patrick's 
                         desire, I recommended Patrick.

                                     JOE
                         I imagine they want to give it to 
                         him in a big ceremony?

                                     RABBI
                         Yes, I would imagine so. I think it 
                         would be a good public gesture.

                                     JOE
                         Free publicity for the temple.

               Patrick stands up at that last comment.

                                     MARGARET
                         Joe!

                                     JOE
                         Rabbi, thank you for stopping over. 
                         My son Pete has a big mouth, and my 
                         family doesn't need your handouts. 
                         We thank you for your kindness.

                                     PATRICK
                         You can't do this to me.

                                     JOE
                         You will shut your mouth.

               The rabbi stands from the table. He thanks Margaret and Katie 
               for the coffee.

                                     RABBI
                         I did not mean to cause any harm.

                                     MARGARET
                         Rabbi, you have been anything but 
                         harmful. Thank you.

               The rabbi pats Pete and Seamus on the head. He heads for the 
               door.

                                     RABBI
                         Mr. O'Malley. I did not intend for 
                         this to be thought of as a handout 
                         or a payout. But I did hope it would 
                         serve as a steppingstone for our two 
                         communities to come together. Have a 
                         good night.

               The rabbi walks out the front door.

                                     PATRICK
                         You're so proud that you won't let 
                         me accept it.

                                     JOE
                         You have done nothing to deserve it. 
                         It's a publicity stunt.

                                     MARGARET
                         It is not a publicity stunt. It is 
                         returning an act of kindness with an 
                         act of kindness.

                                     PETE
                         Dad, the rabbi is the nicest man in 
                         the world.

               Joe looks at Pete furiously.

                                     JOE
                         You have a big mouth. You tell the 
                         rabbi that we don't have enough food 
                         to eat? Maybe he'll set up a food 
                         drive for our family?

                                     PETE
                         I never said that. We talk a lot.

                                     JOE
                         I thought I told you to leave those 
                         people alone?

               Pete stays quiet.

                                     JOE
                         You've been going to the temple?

               Pete puts his head down.

                                     JOE
                         You disobeyed my orders.

                                     PETE
                         I was on a quest. To get Danny to 
                         heaven. And we're almost there.

                                     JOE
                         On a quest for heaven? By disobeying 
                         me, all you have done is put yourself 
                         on the road to hell. Go to your room 
                         and don't come out 'till I tell you 
                         to.

                                     MARGARET
                         Joe!

               Pete starts to cry.

                                     PETE
                         I was just trying to do the right 
                         thing.

                                     JOE
                              (To Margaret)
                         He disobeyed my word.
                              (To Pete)
                         The right thing? You're not even 
                         eight. You don't know what the right 
                         thing is. You know what I tell you, 
                         and what your mother tells you. Jewish 
                         people believe in their own thing. 
                         They do not go to heaven. And neither 
                         do Christians who disobey their 
                         fathers. Now get upstairs. Now!

               Pete walks up the stairs. Joe walks into the kitchen and 
               grabs a beer. Patrick follows him.

                                     PATRICK
                         I'm going to see the rabbi myself 
                         and work out a deal.

                                     JOE
                         Over my dead body. Do you understand 
                         it's not about you? It's not about 
                         kindness. It's about good publicity. 
                         The Jews help out a poor Irish 
                         Catholic family and they get on the 
                         news and the people think, how nice 
                         is it that the Jews share their money.

                                     PATRICK
                         Why are you so cynical? You're too 
                         proud to take a handout?

                                     JOE
                         Too proud? Maybe a little pride 
                         wouldn't hurt you. Instead of sitting 
                         there with your hand out, maybe if 
                         you took pride in a little hard work, 
                         you'd understand.

                                     PATRICK
                         There you go again. I work hard. My 
                         dad worked hard. You will work hard. 
                         I will work hard. At school. To get 
                         a good job.

                                     JOE
                         Bullshit! We are not discussing this 
                         anymore tonight. I didn't spend my 
                         day at the beach. I'm tired!

               Patrick begins to speak. Joe gets in his face and puts his 
               finger in Patrick's face.

                                     JOE
                         No more! No more!

               Patrick storms out of the kitchen. He stops to look at his 
               mother, who holds Molly in her arms.

                                     PATRICK
                         How can you just stand there? You're 
                         married to an asshole and you just 
                         stand there like this innocent 
                         bystander.

               Joe rushes into the living room.

                                     JOE
                         You will not speak to your mother 
                         like that. Get the hell out of my 
                         house.

                                     PATRICK
                         Your house? Who wants your house? Or 
                         your bullshit rules.

               Joe holds his ground though he wants to whack Patrick. Patrick 
               walks out the front door. Seamus still sits at the table 
               eating pastries.

               Joe walks out of the living room. Margaret, with tears 
               beginning to form in her eyes, looks at Seamus. Seamus shrugs 
               his shoulders, takes a bite of his pastry, and stands up. He 
               puts his arms out to take Molly from her arms.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Mom. You know how after you send me 
                         to my room, you come into my bedroom 
                         and we talk? I think Dad needs you 
                         to talk to him.

               Margaret hands Molly to Seamus and kisses him on the forehead. 
               She enters the kitchen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

               Joe sits in his lounge chair drinking a beer and looks out 
               at the sun setting. Margaret pulls up a chair next to him.

                                     JOE
                         Honey, I know what you're going to 
                         say. And my decision about the 
                         scholarship is final.

               Margaret stares at the sunset.

                                     MARGARET
                         You know, when Father Murphy married 
                         us...

                                     JOE
                         Don't start with this crap.

               Margaret stops.

                                     MARGARET
                         Father Murphy said...

                                     JOE
                         Father Murphy was an idiot.

               Margaret grabs the beer right out of Joe's hand. She throws 
               it against the fence.

                                     MARGARET
                         I have got something to say and you 
                         will not interrupt me until I am 
                         finished.

               Joe shrugs but realizes this isn't the time to fight her.

                                     MARGARET
                         We agreed on a partnership. And our 
                         partnership has been for you to 
                         provide for the family while I raise 
                         the family. But somewhere along the 
                         line, this partnership has gotten 
                         out of whack. You come home, the 
                         house is clean, your food is hot, 
                         and your kids are behaved. You then 
                         bark orders at these children like a 
                         drill sergeant.

                                     JOE
                         Cause they need discipline.

                                     MARGARET
                         I am not finished. Trust me, these 
                         kids are disciplined. You think I 
                         run this house without discipline? 
                         Joseph, the older ones, they need 
                         more guidance than sterness. We've 
                         done our work with them, they now 
                         need to feel they can bounce things 
                         off us.

                                     JOE
                         That's a bunch of crap. You think I 
                         bounced things off my dad? Hell no.

                                     MARGARET
                         You hated your dad growing up.

                                     JOE
                         Yeah, he was an asshole, but I 
                         respected him. And looking back, he 
                         did a great job.

                                     MARGARET
                         But looking back is too late. It 
                         would be nice for Patrick to feel 
                         close enough to you so that he could 
                         tell you his dreams, tell you that 
                         even though he doesn't want to grow 
                         up to be you, that you are still his 
                         hero.

                                     JOE
                         That's bullshit.

                                     MARGARET
                         Everything is not bullshit. I will 
                         not allow you to take away the chance 
                         for Patrick to pursue his dream. The 
                         rabbi is being generous and you think 
                         it reflects poorly on you.

                                     JOE
                         That's not...

                                     MARGARET
                         Yes it is. You can't afford to put 
                         your children through college, so 
                         you've decided that college is bad. 
                         You know what, I agree college is a 
                         waste of time for most kids. But not 
                         Patrick. He wasted his first few 
                         years of high school, but the last 
                         two years he has worked his butt off 
                         and he generally loves to learn. 
                         That's what college is all about.

                                     JOE
                         How do you know what college is about?

                                     MARGARET
                         Just because I didn't go doesn't 
                         mean I didn't think about it. But I 
                         fell in love, had babies, and haven't 
                         regretted one thing about the last 
                         nineteen years. Until now! You will 
                         not squash your children's dreams 
                         because they aren't your dreams.

                                     JOE
                         It's not about dreams, it's about 
                         what's right. If Patrick really wanted 
                         college, he could have gotten better 
                         grades and earned a scholarship.

                                     MARGARET
                         He didn't take school seriously. 
                         Why? Cause he thought it was a waste 
                         of time because he would work for 
                         the city whether he got A's or C's. 
                         But one day he woke up and decided 
                         that not doing his best was not the 
                         O'Malley way. And he learned that 
                         from his father. And he's got nothing 
                         but A's that day forward. And he 
                         will do the same in college. From a 
                         scholarship that he accepts from 
                         Rabbi Jacobsen, or so help me God, 
                         Joe, the only thing colder than your 
                         food when you get home will be your 
                         bed.

               Margaret stands up and walks back into the house. Joe is 
               alone looking at a sun that has set in the sky.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM - NEXT DAY

               Pete sits on the floor alone playing the board game "All 
               Star Baseball". He's busy spinning when Seamus enters.

                                     SEAMUS
                         You can't play that game alone.

                                     PETE
                         You wanna play?

                                     SEAMUS
                         No.

                                     PETE
                         So I gotta play alone. I'm crushing 
                         you.

                                     SEAMUS
                         How can you be crushing me?

                                     PETE
                         I picked one team for me and one 
                         team for you.

               Seamus grabs the circular cards and looks at the teams.

                                     SEAMUS
                         You've got Babe Ruth, Lou Gerhig, 
                         and Reggie Jackson. I've got nobody.

                                     PETE
                         I gave you Harmon Killebrew. And 
                         Reggie strikes out all the time 
                         anyway.

                                     SEAMUS
                         These teams are unfair.

                                     PETE
                         Then we can redraft.

               Seamus grabs his bat and glove.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Maybe later.

                                     PETE
                         How long do you think Dad will ground 
                         me?

                                     SEAMUS
                         Who knows. Today's only the first 
                         day. Definitely longer than one day.

               Seamus walks out of the bedroom and down the stairs. Katie 
               is dancing in the living room. Seamus walks out the front 
               door. Danny is standing at the door. He's sweaty and his 
               White Sox hat is cockeyed.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Hey. How you doing?

                                     DANNY
                         Good thanks. Is Pete home?

                                     SEAMUS
                         Yep. Upstairs. First room on the 
                         right. Take it easy.

               Danny enters the house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PETE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Pete spins. The spinner lands on nine, which indicates a 
               strikeout.

               Pete laughs. Pete talks as if he's announcing the game.

                                     PETE
                         Another strikeout for Seamus's team.

               Pete's team, trying to be the first team ever in the history 
               of baseball to go undefeated, comes to bat with a thirteen 
               run lead. (other announcer voice) Jack, they're not only 
               undefeated, but they've ten run ruled every team they've 
               played. (back to original announcer voice) Good point, 
               Charlie.

               Danny enters the bedroom. Pete looks at him. He runs to the 
               door, looks out in the hallway, pushes Danny inside the room, 
               and shuts the door.

                                     PETE
                         What are you doing here?

                                     DANNY
                         We've got to complete the decathlon.

                                     PETE
                         We can't. You gotta get outta here.

                                     DANNY
                         We have to. I know I can do it.

                                     PETE
                         I'm grounded forever because of you. 
                         If my dad saw me with you, I'd be 
                         grounded to infinity.

                                     DANNY
                         I'd be grounded to infinity if my 
                         parents knew I was here. They think 
                         I'm napping.

                                     PETE
                         I can't.

                                     DANNY
                         I might not have another chance for 
                         awhile. I heard my mom talking to 
                         the doctor this morning. I think 
                         they're going to put me back in the 
                         hospital.

                                     PETE
                         Listen. I'm not going to disobey my 
                         dad again.

                                     DANNY
                         You told me about risk/reward. The 
                         risk is worth it.

                                     PETE
                         No it's not.

                                     DANNY
                         Yes it is. I gotta be able to tell 
                         my parents I'm going to heaven. They 
                         need to know I'm happy in paradise.

                                     PETE
                         You wanna know the truth?

               Danny nods.

                                     PETE
                         You can't go to heaven. It's out of 
                         bounds, off limits, to Jews. There's 
                         nothing you can do.

               Danny shakes his head.

                                     DANNY
                         But you said.

                                     PETE
                         I was wrong. The only thing that I 
                         did was put myself on the road to 
                         hell with you.

               Danny screams.

                                     DANNY
                         No, you said if I finish the 
                         decathlon, I'm going to heaven.

               Pete grabs Danny.

                                     PETE
                         You gotta go home. You're going to 
                         get me into trouble, and then I'm 
                         going to hell for sure.

               Danny opens the door and leaves the bedroom. Pete lays down 
               on the floor.

                                     PETE
                              (announcer)
                         That was a brief rain delay. Pete's 
                         team comes to bat.

               Pete places a circular card into the spinner. He can't 
               position the card into the spinner. He throws the game across 
               the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OAK STREET BEACH - AN HOUR LATER

               It is overcast at the beach with the usual Chicago wind 
               whipping off the waves of Lake Michigan. The beach is quiet, 
               with just a few people running and biking. Danny puts on his 
               goggles. The waves are a little rougher today. He walks into 
               the water. He dives in. Like a windmill, his arms splash in 
               and out of the water.

                                     DANNY
                         One. Two. Three. Four.

               Danny continues to count his strokes. He breaks through the 
               initial group of waves, but beyond the waves the water is 
               choppy. The lifeguard in the tower looks out toward the lake. 
               From his view, Danny is not visible. Danny's head barely 
               bobs out of the water as he swims.

                                     DANNY
                         Fifty five. Fifty six. Fifty seven. 
                         Fifty eight. Fifty nine. Sixty.

               Danny looks up to see where the buoy is. He takes in some 
               water. He thinks he sees the buoy but takes in more water. 
               He flips to his back and floats. He coughs up what water he 
               can. When he calms down, he turns his head slowly to check 
               for the buoy. He sees it not too far off in the distance. He 
               flips himself over, takes a little water, and begins to swim 
               toward the buoy. He counts his strokes.

                                     DANNY
                         Sixty one. Sixty two. Sixty three. 
                         Sixty four. Sixty five. Sixty six. 
                         Sixty seven. Sixty eight. Sixty nine. 
                         Seventy. Seventy one.

               Danny's hands grasp the buoy. He looks up at the buoy. The 
               water splashes off the buoy onto Danny. Danny flips over and 
               floats on his back. A big smile crosses his face.

                                     DANNY
                         Seventy one strokes. And a little 
                         more on the way back. I can do it.

               Danny floats on his back. He turns over and begins to swim 
               toward the shore.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. O'MALLEY HOUSE - A FEW NIGHTS LATER

               Pete walks down the stairs. Joe passes the stairs on the way 
               to the front door. He looks at Pete but doesn't say anything. 
               Joe walks out the front door. Pete heads toward the kitchen. 
               Patrick runs past Pete and also heads out the front door. 
               Mary takes a crying Molly out of the kitchen. Margaret cleans 
               off Molly's high chair.

                                     PETE
                         Hey Mom.

                                     MARGARET
                         Hi honey.

                                     PETE
                         Where are Dad and going?

                                     MARGARET
                         They have some business to take care 
                         of.

                                     PETE
                         Patrick's getting a job?

               Margaret bends down and fixes Pete's hair.

                                     MARGARET
                         Always so busy worrying about everyone 
                         else's business. That's from my side 
                         of the family, you know?

                                     PETE
                         Yeah. Dad tells me I get a lot from 
                         your side of the family.

                                     MARGARET
                         That's right. Your sweetness, your 
                         humor, and definitely your nose.

                                     PETE
                         So you think Dad will end my 
                         grounding?

                                     MARGARET
                         Are you sorry for disobeying your 
                         dad? And lying to your mom?

                                     PETE
                         It wasn't really a lie. I told you I 
                         was going out to play.

                                     MARGARET
                         But you forgot to mention you were 
                         going to Lake Michigan and swimming 
                         with Danny.

               Pete nods.

                                     PETE
                         I'm sorry. It's just... it was a 
                         quest... and on a quest you have to 
                         take risks.

                                     MARGARET
                         Lying to your mother is not a risk. 
                         It's wrong.

                                     PETE
                         I know. Can you talk to Dad and put 
                         a good word in for me?

               Margaret nods. Pete slowly heads out of the kitchen.

                                     MARGARET
                         How did your quest end up?

                                     PETE
                         Not good. I had to give it up.

                                     MARGARET
                         You know, the way you went about 
                         your quest was wrong, sneaking to 
                         the beach and such, but the quest 
                         itself, it was good.

                                     PETE
                         But Dad said...

                                     MARGARET
                         Sometimes, even dad's are wrong.

                                     PETE
                         Easy for you to say. He can't ground 
                         you.

                                     MARGARET
                         Don't give up your quest.

                                     PETE
                         How do you know the quest is good?

                                     MARGARET
                         I have faith.

               Pete nods and walks out of the kitchen.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SYNAGOGUE - MINUTES LATER

               Rabbi Jacobsen sits at his desk. He is hurriedly shuffling 
               papers when he hears a knock at his door.

                                     RABBI
                         Come on in.

               Joe and Patrick enter the rabbi's office. The rabbi stands 
               up but is not his usual effusive self.

                                     RABBI
                         I'm glad you came to see me but when 
                         we spoke before, I thought I would 
                         have time to talk. My wife called 
                         and told me I am needed at the 
                         hospital.

                                     JOE
                         Is everything OK?

               The rabbi shakes his head.

                                     RABBI
                         Danny's not doing well.

                                     JOE
                         I am sorry.

                                     PATRICK
                         I'm sorry.

                                     RABBI
                         I assume you want to talk about the 
                         scholarship?

               Patrick nods.

                                     JOE
                         It seems. I think. It's an opportunity 
                         for my son.

                                     RABBI
                         It will open doors for Patrick that 
                         would be closed in today's society 
                         without a degree.

                                     JOE
                         I just can't...

               Patrick interrupts.

                                     PATRICK
                         We know it will and if the offer is 
                         still there, I would love a chance 
                         at it.

               The rabbi grabs his briefcase.

                                     RABBI
                         Patrick, the scholarship is yours. 
                         You will make us all proud.

                                     PATRICK
                         Thanks. Thank you.

                                     JOE
                         You better get going. We better get 
                         going. I hope everything gets better 
                         with Danny.

                                     RABBI
                         Thank you.

               The rabbi shows Joe and Patrick the door. The three exit the 
               office and then the synagogue. They talk for a few more 
               seconds and then part ways.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. O'MALLEY STATION WAGON - MINUTES LATER

               Joe and Patrick listen to the White Sox game on the radio.

                                     JOE
                         Luckily, the Cubs stink, or else a 
                         lot of White Sox fans would be 
                         flocking north.

                                     PATRICK
                         Never. There will be peace in Ireland 
                         before a Sox fan becomes a Cub fan.

               Joe laughs.

                                     JOE
                         You're probably right. And that's 
                         the way it should be.

               They listen to the game. A White Sox batter strikes out with 
               the bases loaded.

                                     JOE
                         But they sure do test our loyalty.

                                     PATRICK
                         I'm gonna work my ass off, Dad. I'm 
                         not going to be some pot smoking, 
                         sleep 'till noon college slacker. 
                         I'm gonna do it right.

               Joe nods.

                                     JOE
                         I know.

               The two sit in silence as they drive home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

               Pete is sitting on his bed tossing a tennis ball to himself. 
               Joe walks in.

                                     JOE
                         Pedro.

                                     PETE
                         Hey Dad.

               Joe motions for the ball. Pete tosses it to him. Joe throws 
               it back.

                                     JOE
                         Seamus said there's a big game over 
                         at Holy Cross and they could probably 
                         use another player.

                                     PETE
                         So can I go?

                                     JOE
                         Yep.

               Pete jumps up from the bed.

                                     PETE
                         Sorry Dad. I won't disobey you again.

               Joe puts out his hand and Pete shakes it.

                                     JOE
                         I saw Rabbi Jacobsen last night. I 
                         guess Danny's back in the hospital.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah, Danny thought they might put 
                         him back in there. I hope he's doing 
                         all right.

                                     JOE
                         It's tough. What he's got. It's tough 
                         on a kid. And the family.

                                     PETE
                         I'll pray for him.

                                     JOE
                         That would be nice.

                                     PETE
                         I'll see you later Dad.

               Pete walks out of the room.

                                     JOE
                         Pete?

               Pete pops his head back in.

                                     JOE
                         The rabbi also told me to tell you 
                         that Danny completed the decathlon. 
                         Seventy-one strokes there, eighty-
                         six back.

               Pete's face lights up with a smile.

                                     PETE
                         No way?

               Joe nods.

                                     PETE
                         I do it in fifty-five strokes.

                                     JOE
                         That's good.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah, but for his age and size, 
                         seventy-one strokes is great. He 
                         finished the decathlon!

               Pete walks out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CHURCH STREET - MINUTES LATER

               Pete rides his bike down the street toward the park. Holy 
               Cross Church is attached to Holy Cross Elementary which is 
               attached to Holy Cross Field, where the baseball field is 
               located. Pete rides by the church and looks up at the big 
               cross at the top of church. He rides toward the field and 
               sees some of the boys playing catch while others sit on the 
               bench and eat sandwiches. Seamus screams to Pete.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Hurry up!

               Pete waves to the guys. He gets to the field and hops off 
               his bike.

               He walks over to the bench where some guys are eating lunch. 
               The corners of Jimmy Burns's lips are covered with jelly.

                                     JIMMY
                         Pete, you missed the first game. 
                         Your brother's team won again. Are 
                         you going to start playing with us 
                         again.

                                     PETE
                         Yep.

                                     JIMMY
                         The quest over?

               Pete nods. Kevin Muldoon pulls out a ham sandwich on wheat.

                                     KEVIN
                              (To Jimmy)
                         Trade you my ham and cheese sandwich 
                         for your other peanut butter and 
                         jelly sandwich?

                                     JIMMY
                         What's your ham sandwich on?

                                     KEVIN
                         Wheat. Got extra mayo.

                                     JIMMY
                         I hate wheat. Tastes like a sandwich 
                         on communion bread. Gross.

               Pete ears perk up at the sound of communion. He looks up at 
               the cross hanging high above the church. He takes off in a 
               full sprint for his bike. He jumps on it and heads toward 
               the church.

                                     SEAMUS
                         Where you going?

                                     PETE
                         To finish the quest!

               Pete doesn't look back. He rides to the church, jumps off 
               his bike, and runs into the church. The church is empty. 
               Pete runs to the altar and grabs the communion chalice. He 
               takes one, looks at it, and puts it in his pocket. He then 
               takes another one just in case something happens to the first. 
               He puts the second communion host in his other pocket. Father 
               Kelly enters the altar from the hallway attached to the altar.

                                     FATHER
                         Mr. O'Malley? Stealing communion?

               Pete stops dead in his tracks. He slowly turns and faces 
               Father Kelly.

                                     PETE
                         Father Kelly.

                                     FATHER
                         What are you doing? Tell me you're 
                         not hungry?

               Pete laughs.

                                     PETE
                         No Father, I'm not hungry. I hear 
                         this stuff isn't good anyway.

                                     FATHER
                         I wish we'd change bread distributors, 
                         but that's neither here nor there. 
                         What are you doing?

                                     PETE
                         I've got a friend who really needs a 
                         piece of Jesus.

               Father Kelly looks perplexed.

                                     PETE
                         Ya see, he's really sick and in the 
                         hospital.

                                     FATHER
                         We have people that give communion 
                         to the sick in the hospital.

                                     PETE
                         But they can't give it to him.

                                     FATHER
                         Why?

                                     PETE
                         He's not Catholic and he's only six.

                                     FATHER
                         Well, that poses a problem. Communion 
                         is for Christians who have earned 
                         the right to receive Jesus and are 
                         of age.

                                     PETE
                         He's earned the right. He passed the 
                         tests.

                                     FATHER
                         What tests?

                                     PETE
                         Tests we made up to see if he's worthy 
                         of Jesus. And he is Father Kelly, 
                         he's as worthy as any Catholic I 
                         know. And just because he's not old 
                         enough, well that's not fair, because 
                         he may not live long enough to be 
                         old enough, and if Jesus didn't want 
                         him to have a piece of him only 
                         because he wasn't old enough, well, 
                         that doesn't seem like anything that 
                         sounds like the Jesus I know.

               Father Kelly stands speechless.

                                     FATHER
                         Go give your friend the host. May 
                         God bless him. And you.

                                     PETE
                         Thanks Father. You too.

               Pete runs out of the church and onto his bike. WE FOLLOW him 
               as he rides a few blocks to the hospital. He enters the 
               hospital and goes to the front desk.

                                     PETE
                         Danny Jacobsen?

                                     NURSE
                         Room 4104. Fourth floor.

               Pete runs to the elevator, jumps in, and gets off on the 
               fourth floor.

               He looks at the sign that points rooms 100-115 is to the 
               right. Pete turns the corner toward room 104. The hallway is 
               empty. Room 115 on the right. Room 114 on the left. And the 
               rooms descend in order as you walk the hallway. The hallway 
               turns into another hallway to the left. Pete turns the corner 
               and sees Rabbi Jacobsen in the hallway with many friends and 
               relatives. Pete walks closer and the sound of crying fills 
               the hallway. Pete starts to run. Rabbi Jacobsen sees Pete as 
               Pete pushes through the crowd. The rabbi makes his way to 
               Pete. Pete stops before the Rabbi, who's eyes are red and 
               cheeks are tear stained.

                                     PETE
                         Rabbi? Rabbi? I need to see Danny.

               The rabbi starts to cry. He opens his arms for Pete.

                                     PETE
                         Rabbi! No! Rabbi! I need to see him. 
                         I've got his communion. Right here.

               Pete pulls out the communion from his pocket.

                                     PETE
                         See! Danny earned it! He passed the 
                         decathlon.

                                     RABBI
                         Danny passed on. He's no longer in 
                         pain.

                                     PETE
                         No! No! He didn't get his medal!

               The rabbi hugs Pete. Pete starts to cry. Harder. And harder. 
               In the rabbi's arms. The rabbi holds Pete tight. Pete breaks 
               away and runs into the room. Nurses attend to the equipment 
               in the room.

               Danny lays on the bed with a sheet over his body. The rabbi 
               comes into the room.

                                     PETE
                         I promised Danny, rabbi. I promised 
                         him.

                                     RABBI
                         He told me.

                                     PETE
                         The prize for finishing the decathlon 
                         was a piece of Jesus. So he could go 
                         to heaven.

                                     RABBI
                         He told me. He wanted to thank you. 
                         He told me that he'll see you in 
                         heaven some day.

                                     PETE
                         But he can't go without eating this. 
                         Rabbi! He can't go!

               Pete moves toward the bed. A nurse blocks him. The rabbi 
               gently grabs Pete. Pete starts to cry. The rabbi carries 
               Pete out of the room. The rabbi whispers in Pete's ears.

                                     RABBI
                         God will let him into heaven, Pete. 
                         Danny has a good soul, and God will 
                         let him into heaven.

               The rabbi holds Pete in his arms outside of the room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - TWO WEEKS LATER

               Pete takes a stick and cleans out the dirt in his cleats 
               while he sits on the bench.

                                     COACH
                         All right, guys, we need baserunners. 
                         Three runs to tie, four to win. Let's 
                         go get 'em.

               The players scream. Jimmy Burns pulls his hat backwards.

                                     JIMMY
                         Rally cap! Rally cap!

               The players turn their caps inside out and backwards. In the 
               stands behind the players, the fans, mainly parents, cheer. 
               Joe sits with Margaret.

                                     JOE
                         Last chance. I can't believe their 
                         not beating this team.

               Rabbi Jacobsen and his wife spot Joe in the stands. They 
               wave to him and climb the stands. Joe and Margaret move down 
               to make room for the Jacobsens. Joe shakes the rabbi's hand 
               and Mrs. Jacobsen.

                                     JOE
                         We're down three runs.

               The rabbi nods.

                                     MARGARET
                         We're very sorry for your loss.

                                     MRS. JACOBSEN
                         Thank you. The flowers you sent were 
                         lovely.

               A player comes to the plate.

                                     RABBI
                         I called your house and your daughter 
                         Mary said you'd be here.

                                     JOE
                         Yep. Can't miss a game.

                                     RABBI
                         Nope.

               A base hit. The fans cheer. Another player walks to the plate.

                                     RABBI
                         How's Pete doing?

               Joe shrugs his shoulders.

                                     MARGARET
                         He loved Danny. But he's a kid. They 
                         move on better than we do.

                                     RABBI
                         We can learn a lot from our children.

               The next batter pops out to second base. Another batter steps 
               to the plate.

                                     RABBI
                         We sent the check for the University 
                         of Illinois. This is the receipt.

               The rabbi hands Joe the receipt. The batter singles to left 
               field.

               The rabbi pulls out another document.

                                     RABBI
                         And this is the legal document that 
                         explains our legal responsibility. 
                         Thirty pages to pretty much say we 
                         pay room, board, and tuition as long 
                         Patrick maintains a three point oh 
                         grade point average.

               Joe accepts the document and shakes the rabbi's hand. The 
               batter grounds out. Two out. Another batter walks to the 
               plate. Pete puts on a helmet and stands on deck.

                                     JOE
                         Patrick will meet every requirement. 
                         This I know.

                                     RABBI
                         Me too.

                                     JOE
                         Thank you. Are you sure you don't 
                         want to do this in front of cameras?

                                     RABBI
                         You didn't rush my burning house so 
                         you could get your picture on the 
                         front page.

                                     JOE
                         I looked around for the cameraman. I 
                         couldn't find him.

                                     RABBI
                         A selfless act deserves a selfless 
                         act in return.

                                     JOE
                         Thank you.

                                     RABBI
                         Thank you.

               Ball four! The batter walks to first base as the other base 
               runners advance one base. Bases loaded. Down three runs. Two 
               outs. Last inning. Pete pops the weight off of his bat and 
               heads toward the plate. He looks into the stands and sees 
               the Jacobsens sitting with his parents. He smiles. Before he 
               steps to the plate, Pete closes his eyes. He opens his eyes 
               and steps to the plate. The pitcher winds up and throws the 
               ball. Pete swings with all of his might and connects. The 
               runners are off with the crack of the bat. The ball sails in 
               the air and toward center field. Deep center field. The crowd 
               stands as Pete puts his head down and runs toward first base.

               The center fielder speeds after the sailing ball. Pete rounds 
               first base and looks up. The center fielder dives as the 
               ball looks like it is out of his reach. The ball hits the 
               outer web of his glove and stays there miraculously like a 
               snowcone. Out! The center fielder caught the ball and the 
               visiting crowd erupts. Pete falls between first and second 
               base and the home crowd lets out an audible groan.

               The visiting team runs out to center field to congratulate 
               the center fielder, who stands, shows the ball, and smiles 
               wildly as his teammates tackle him. Jimmy Burns walks over 
               to Pete and helps him up.

               Joe watches wide eyed from the stands a Margaret covers her 
               face in disbelief. The rabbi pats Joe on the back. Pete walks 
               back to the bench as his teammates and coaches console him. 
               Pete looks up into the stands quietly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BALLPARK - MINUTES LATER

               Pete walks out to the stands where his parents and the 
               Jacobsens wait for him. Margaret wants to hug him but knows 
               that a hug from Mom in public is not what he wants. He looks 
               to her wide eyed and she smiles.

                                     MARGARET
                         You gave it your best shot.

                                     PETE
                         Yep.

               Joe pats him on the back.

                                     JOE
                         You gave that ball a ride, son. I've 
                         never seen you hit a ball so well.

               Pete nods. Rabbi Jacobsen puts his hand out. Pete shakes it.

                                     RABBI
                         Nice try, Pete. Nice try.

                                     PETE
                         Thanks Rabbi. Hi, Mrs. Jacobsen.

               Mrs. Jacobsen smiles and hugs Pete. Pete looks at his mom 
               and she gives him the OK sign. Pete hugs Mrs. Jacobsen.

                                     MRS. JACOBSEN
                         I baked you some of that rugala you 
                         liked so much. It's in the car.

               Pete smiles.

                                     MARGARET
                         I'll come with you to get it. I'd 
                         love to know your recipe.

               Margaret and Mrs. Jacobsen walk toward the parking lot. 
               Another parent walks over to talk to Joe. Pete stands alone 
               with the rabbi.

                                     PETE
                         How's everything going?

                                     RABBI
                         Well. And with you?

                                     PETE
                         I really thought I hit that one over 
                         his head for a grand slam.

                                     RABBI
                         You will.

                                     PETE
                         You know how you said Danny was in 
                         heaven?

               The rabbi nods.

                                     PETE
                         He's not.

               The comment staggers the rabbi. Joe looks over.

                                     PETE
                         I prayed to Danny before I hit that 
                         ball. I prayed to him in heaven to 
                         help me hit a grandslam.

               The rabbi nods.

                                     PETE
                         He's not in heaven to answer my 
                         prayers, rabbi. I thought you should 
                         know.

                                     RABBI
                         Peter, our prayers are not answered 
                         in our time, but in God's time.

                                     PETE
                         No. Rabbi. Danny said he would answer 
                         my prayers to let me know he was in 
                         heaven. I gave him two weeks till I 
                         prayed. He didn't answer my prayer.

               The rabbi is visibly hurt. Joe walks over.

                                     JOE
                         Everything OK?

               The rabbi nods.

                                     RABBI
                         Yes. I better get going. I have temple 
                         in a few hours. It was nice to see 
                         you.

               The rabbi turns and walks toward the parking lot. Joe looks 
               at Pete.

               Pete turns and walks toward the bench where some of the 
               players are still sitting. Joe watches the rabbi walk to the 
               parking lot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT, O'MALLEY BACKYARD - LATER

               Pete stands in the backyard throwing the ball to the dog. In 
               the background, in the kitchen, Joe hands Patrick the legal 
               document stating the rules of the scholarship. Patrick hugs 
               his dad. Joe pats Patrick on the back. He lets go and Patrick 
               bear hugs Margaret. The dog returns the ball and drops it at 
               Pete's feet. He bends down to pick up the ball and throws it 
               again. The dog chases after the ball.

               Joe walks outside. Pete turns.

                                     PETE
                         Hey Dad.

               The dog returns the ball. Pete picks it up.

                                     JOE
                         Let's see your arm.

               Pete tosses the ball. The dog chases after it. Joe catches 
               it.

                                     JOE
                         Nice throw.

               Joe looks at the rubber ball.

                                     JOE
                         What'd you say to Rabbi Jacobsen?

                                     PETE
                         Not much.

               Joe tosses the ball. Pete catches it.

                                     JOE
                         You must have said something.

                                     PETE
                         I told him Danny wasn't in heaven.

               Pete throws Joe the ball.

                                     JOE
                         How do you know?

                                     PETE
                         I prayed to Danny to let me hit a 
                         grandslam. I didn't.

               Joe hands the dog the ball and walks closer to Pete. He sits 
               down in the lounge chair and motions for Pete to sit down 
               next to him.

                                     JOE
                         Your brother Patrick is going to 
                         college.

                                     PETE
                         I know. He's so excited.

                                     JOE
                         I never went to college.

                                     PETE
                         Why not?

                                     JOE
                         Cause I couldn't afford it. And I 
                         got a good job. And then I started a 
                         family. And I had to take care of my 
                         family

                                     PETE
                         That sounds good.

                                     JOE
                         It is good. And you know what I've 
                         learned?

                                     PETE
                         Huh?

               The dog drops the ball at Joe's feet. Joe picks it up and 
               tosses it softly in the air to Pete.

                                     JOE
                         I've learned that you take care of 
                         family. No matter what your 
                         differences are. You're family. And 
                         taking care of them is a dad's job.

               Pete nods. He tosses the ball and the dog chases it.

                                     JOE
                         You know Jesus is Jewish?

                                     PETE
                         Yep.

                                     JOE
                         And you know God is Jesus' father?

                                     PETE
                         Uh-huh.

                                     JOE
                         So God's probably Jewish too.

                                     PETE
                         OK.

                                     JOE
                         What I'm getting at, and I'm just 
                         thinking aloud, but if God is any 
                         kind of father, do you think he would 
                         turn his back on his own people, the 
                         Jewish people, and not let them back 
                         into his house?

               Pete shakes his head.

                                     JOE
                         Of course he wouldn't. Just like I 
                         wouldn't turn my back on you or any 
                         of your brothers or sisters. Dads 
                         take care of their family.

                                     PETE
                         So what are you saying?

               Joe laughs.

                                     JOE
                         I'm saying, maybe Danny is in heaven. 
                         Even though he's Jewish. I'm saying 
                         maybe when they say the kingdom of 
                         heaven can only be reached through 
                         Jesus, maybe what they really mean 
                         is heaven can be reached through 
                         being a good person just like Jesus. 
                         An Eskimo at the North Pole, who 
                         never heard of Jesus, who's been a 
                         good person all his life, shouldn't 
                         he be allowed into heaven?

                                     PETE
                         Yes. But...

                                     JOE
                         But what?

                                     PETE
                         But then there's no need for me to 
                         listen to the nuns at school anymore.

               Joe laughs.

                                     JOE
                         You're not going to get out of 
                         Catholic school that easily. You 
                         still have to listen to them.

                                     PETE
                         But they're wrong.

                                     JOE
                         They're not wrong. They're just 
                         teaching one way to get to heaven.

                                     PETE
                         Sister Leonora Mary says there is 
                         only one way.

                                     JOE
                         Well then, you and I will have to 
                         keep a secret from Sister Leonora 
                         Mary.

               Pete laughs. The dogs brings back the ball and drops it at 
               Pete's feet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SYNAGOGUE - LATER

               Joe and Pete enter the synagogue. Rabbi Jacobsen stands at 
               the pulpit and he is speaking to a quarter full audience. 
               Pete grabs a yarmukle and puts it on his head. He looks at 
               his dad to do the same thing.

               His dad, reluctantly, puts on a yarmukle. The two take a 
               seat in the back row. The rabbi finishes speaking and the 
               people disperse. Pete waits for them all to pass the last 
               row when he stands up. Rabbi Jacobsen has his back to Pete 
               as he gives instructions to his assistant. Pete heads toward 
               the altar as Joe stays in the pew.

                                     PETE
                         Rabbi Jacobsen.

               The rabbi turns. He smiles at Pete. He notices Joe in the 
               back and waves to him. Joe gestures back.

                                     RABBI
                         You cleaned up well from your game. 
                         What can I do for you?

                                     PETE
                         Do you have a moment to talk?

                                     RABBI
                         Sure.

                                     PETE
                         You know how I had my quest to get a 
                         Jewish person to heaven?

               The rabbi nods.

                                     PETE
                         Did you realize that my quest is 
                         just like your quest as a rabbi, 
                         it's just that I called mine a quest 
                         and you call yours a job.

                                     RABBI
                         I didn't realize that but it seems 
                         to be true.

                                     PETE
                         Well, my quest ended with Danny.

               The rabbi nods.

                                     PETE
                         But your quest never ends cause it's 
                         your job.

                                     RABBI
                         I think you're right.

                                     PETE
                         Well I learned something on my quest 
                         that might help you on your quest.

                                     RABBI
                         What did you learn?

                                     PETE
                         I learned that just saying you believe 
                         or just praying to Jesus isn't how 
                         you get to heaven.

                                     RABBI
                         No?

                                     PETE
                         Nope. Jesus is only a symbol, like a 
                         letter or a number. You could really 
                         use anyone's name just so long that 
                         the person's name symbolized being 
                         good.

                                     RABBI
                         That is interesting.

                                     PETE
                         Yeah. I thought you might think so. 
                         My dad says I better stick to praying 
                         and acting like Jesus because the 
                         nuns wouldn't understand as well as 
                         you and him do.

               The rabbi looks up and smiles at Joe. Joe waves back.

                                     PETE
                         But, my dad and I think if the Jewish 
                         people don't want to copy the 
                         Christians by praying to Jesus, you 
                         guys can make up your own name to 
                         pray to.

                                     RABBI
                         Do you have a suggestion for a name 
                         that I can bring to my congregation?

                                     PETE
                         Danny.

               The rabbi's eyes fill with tears and he puts his arms out 
               for Pete.

               Pete hugs him. And the rabbi squeezes tight. Pete lets go.

                                     PETE
                         I thought that might help you in 
                         your job. On your quest.

                                     RABBI
                         Thank you. It will.

                                     PETE
                         I'll see you later.

               Pete turns and walks toward his dad, who stands at the back 
               of the temple. Pete turns back to the rabbi.

                                     PETE
                         I almost forgot to tell you the most 
                         important thing.

                                     RABBI
                         What's that?

                                     PETE
                         That Danny is in heaven.

                                     RABBI
                         How do you know?

                                     PETE
                         Faith.

               Pete smiles and turns around. He walks to his dad and Pete 
               and his dad walk out of the temple together.

                                         THE END
