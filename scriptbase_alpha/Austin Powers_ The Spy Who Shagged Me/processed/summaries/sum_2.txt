Dr.
Evil returns from space just as British spy Austin Powers learns on his honeymoon that his wife is a fembot in Evil's control.
Back on the singles scene, Powers discovers he's impotent because Evil has used a time machine to return to the late 60s and steal his libido.
British intelligence also has a time portal, so Powers goes back to 1969 to recapture his mojo and, teaming with agent Felicity Shagwell, to stop another Evil plot to take over the world, this time with a "laser" beamed from the moon.
Subplots involve Evil's son Scott's discovery of who his mother is, Evil's affection for a clone one-eighth his size, and the machinations of an obese Scot named Fat Bastard.
