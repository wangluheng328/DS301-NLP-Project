<title>FEAR &amp; LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS</title>

<pre>





<b>              FEAR &amp; LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS
</b>
                           by

              Terry Gilliam &amp; Toy Grisoni
<b>
</b>


<b>BLACK SCREEN
</b>
A desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind
comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters
singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of
anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after
another on the screen.

In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title
FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A
beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:

TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself
       Gets rid of the pain
       Of being a man."
       Dr. Johnson

The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            We were somewhere around Barstow on
            the edge of the desert when the
            drugs began to take hold.

<b>AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</b>
A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black
screen.

<b>EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
</b>
<b>AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</b>
THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred
miles an hour.  THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.

<b>AT THE WHEEL
</b>
<b>STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,
</b><b>BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.
</b>
<b>BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND
</b><b>WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY
</b><b>UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.
</b>
The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths
up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            I remember saying something like:
            "I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe
            you should drive..."

GONZO starts shaving.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            2.
</b>

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Suddenly there was a terrible roar
            all around us and the sky was full
            of what looked like huge bats, all
            swooping and screeching and diving
            around the car...

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The
reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close
to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!

<b>AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            ... and a voice was screaming: Holy
            Jesus!  What are these goddamn
            animals?

<b>CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -
</b>
DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.
GONZO casually looks over...

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            What are you yelling about?

DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench
makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Never mind.  It's your turn to drive.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            No point mentioning these bats.  I
            thought.  The poor bastard will see
            them soon enough.

DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,
frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A
MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles
through the impressive stash.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            We had two bags of grass, seventy-
            five pellets of mescaline, five
            sheets of high powered blotter
            acid, a salt shaker half full of
            cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi-
            colored uppers, downers, screamers,
            laughers... Also a quart of tequila,
            a quart of rum, a case of beer, a
            pint of raw ether and two dozen
            amyls.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            3.
</b>

DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the
SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with
another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives
back into the car.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Not that we needed all that for the
            trip, but once you get locked into
            a serious drug collection, the
            tendency is to push it as far as
            you can.

THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,
weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A
<b>BAT?
</b>
<b>EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
</b>
<b>IN THE RED SHARK
</b>
GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a
lousy driver.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            The only thing that really worried
            me was the ether.  There is nothing
            in the world more helpless and
            irresponsible and depraved than a
            man in the depths of an ether binge.
            And I knew we'd get into that
            rotten stuff pretty soon.

The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape
recorder.

<b>                         RADIO NEWS
</b>            An overdose of heroin was listed as
            the official cause of death for
            pretty 19 year old Diane Hanby
            whose body was found stuffed in a
            refrigerator last week...

GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET
JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He
sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.
The RED SHARK fishtails.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            "One toke over the line, sweet
            Jesus."
<b>
</b><b>                                                            4.
</b>

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (muttering to himself)
            One toke.  You poor fool.  Wait
            till you see those goddamn bats.

<b>UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD
</b>
A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a
thumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down
the road...

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Let's give that boy a lift.

GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side
of the road.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            We can't stop here - this is bat
            country!

GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The
HITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.

<b>                         HITCHHIKER
</b>            Hot damn!  I never rode in a
            convertible before!

Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the
sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-
NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Is that right?  Well, I guess
            you're about ready, eh?

The HITCHHIKER hesitates.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            We're your friends.  We're not like
            the others.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (hissing sharply)
            No more of that talk or I'll put
            the leeches on you.

DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.

<b>EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
</b>
The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED
SHARK screams down the road.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            5.
</b>

GONZO sings along to the tape player.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out
and taking his chances.

DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear
view mirror.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            How long could we maintain, I
            wondered.  How long before one of
            us starts raving and jabbering at
            this boy?  What will he think then?
            This same lonely desert was the
            last known home of the Manson family.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling
down GONZO's neck.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Would he make that grim connection
            when my attorney starts screaming
            about bats and huge manta rays
            coming down on the car?

DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with
the words, sometimes not.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            If so - well, we'll just have to
            cut his head off and bury him
            somewhere.  Because it goes without
            saying that we can't turn him loose.
            He'd report us at once to some kind
            of outback Nazi law enforcement
            agency, and they'll run us down
            like dogs...

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (out loud to himself)
            Jesus!  Did I say that?

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Or just think it?  Was I talking?
            Did they hear me?

<b>                         GONZO
</b>                   (reassuringly to HITCHHIKER)
            It's okay.  He's admiring the shape
            of your skull.

DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER
giggles nervously.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            6.
</b>

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Maybe I better have a chat with
            this boy I thought.  Perhaps if I
            explain things, he'll rest easy...

The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs
into the back seat.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            That's good.  Because I want you to
            have all the background.  This is a
            very ominous assignment -- with
            overtones of extreme personal
            danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!
            This is important, goddamnit!  This

The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.

<b>                         GONZO

</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Our vibrations were getting nasty --
            but why?  Was there no communication
            in this car?  Had we deteriorated
            to the level of dumb beasts?

The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.

</b><b>                                                            7.

            I want you to understand that this
            man at the wheel is my attorney!
            He's not just some dingbat I found
            on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I
            think he's probably Samoan.  But it
            doesn't matter, does it?  Are you
            prejudiced?

<b>                         HITCHHIKER

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            I didn't think so.  Because in
            spite of his race, this man is
            extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I
            forgot all about this beer.  You
            want one?
                   (HITCHHIKER shakes
                   his head)
            How about some ether?

<b>                         HITCHHIKER
</b>            What?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Never mind.  Let's get right to the
            heart of this thing.  Twenty-four
            hours ago we were sitting in the
            Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills
            Hotel...

<b>INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY
</b>
A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE
through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They
are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL
BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore
Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED
<b>VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            ... in the patio section, of
            course, drinking Singapore Slings
            with mescal on the side, hiding
            from the brutish realities of this
            foul year of Our Lord, 1971.

The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and
shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank
top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious
conversation.
<b>
</b><b>                                                            8.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            I'm telling you, the Salazar story
            is getting too complicated.  The
            weasels have started closing in.

The DWARF sneers.

<b>                         DWARF
</b>            Perhaps this is the call you've
            been waiting for all this time,
            sir...

DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...

DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A
<b>MOVIE SPY.
</b>
<b>                         DWARF
</b>            That was headquarters.  They want
            me to go to Las Vegas at once and
            make contact with a Portuguese
            photographer named Lacerda.  He'll
            have the details.  All I have to do
            is check into my sound proof suite
            and he'll seek me out.

GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            God hell!  I think I see the
            pattern!  This one sounds like real
            trouble!  You're going to need
            plenty of legal advice before this
            thing is over.  As your attorney I
            must advise you that you'll need a
            very fast car with no top and after
            that, the cocaine.  And then the
            tape recorder, for special music,
            and some Acapulco shirts...
                   (GONZO tucks his
                   khaki undershirt into
                   his white
                   bellbottoms -- he
                   means business!)
            This blows my weekend, because
            naturally I'll have to go with
            you -- and we'll have to arm
            ourselves.

</b><b>                                                            9.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Why not?  If a thing's worth doing,
            it's worth doing right.

DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them
with the (very large) check in his hand.

They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it
swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            I tell you, my man.  This is the
            American Dream in action!  We'd be
            fools not to ride this strange
            torpedo all the way to the end.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind
            of story is this?

<b>EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY
</b>
DUKE and GONZO emerge.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            The Mint 400!  The richest off-road
            race for motorcycles and dune-
            buggies in the history of organized
            sport!
                   (handing parking
                   ticket to Valet)
            -- a fantastic spectacle in honor
            of some fatback grossero who owns
            the luxurious Mint Hotel in the
            heart of downtown Vegas... at least
            that's what the press release says.

Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They
jump in.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            We're going to have to drum it up
            on our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.

And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-
bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.

<b>EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY
</b>
The PINTO races through shot.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Getting hold of the drugs and
            shirts had been no problem...
<b>
</b><b>                                                           10.

<b>EXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY
</b>
The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back
window full of Hawaiian shirts.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
</b>            ... but the car and tape recorder
            were not easy things to round up at
            6:30 on a Friday afternoon in
            Hollywood.

<b>INT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY
</b>
TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile
as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four
Singapore Slings.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            O.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.
            We'll be there in thirty minutes.
                   (to DUKE -- hand over
                   the PHONE)
            I finally located a car with
            adequate horsepower and the proper
            coloring.
                   (into PHONE)
            What?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has
            a major credit card!  Do you
            realize who the fuck you're talking
            to?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Don't take any guff from these
            swine.
                   (GONZO slams the
                   phone down)
            Now we need a sound store with the
            finest equipment.  Nothing dinky.
            One of those new Belgian Heliowatts
            with a voice-activated shotgun
            mike, for picking up conversations
            in oncoming cars.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            We won't make the nut unless we
            have unlimited credit.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            We will.  You Samoans are all the
            same.  You have no faith in the
            essential decency of the white
            man's culture.

<b>EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK
</b>
The PINTO races down street.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            The store was closed, but the
            salesman said he would wait, if we
            hurried...

<b>EXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK
</b>
They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE
<b>BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            But we were delayed en route when a
            Stingray in front of us killed a
            pedestrain.

Directly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered
corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.

<b>EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT
</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            We had trouble, again, at the car
            rental agency.

Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with
satisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out
a clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.

<b>                         AGENT
</b>            Say... uh... you fellas are going
            to be careful with this car, aren't
            you?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Of course.

DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the
gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.

<b>                         AGENT
</b>            Well, good god!  You just backed
            over that two foot concrete abutment
            and you didn't even slow down!
            Forty-five in reverse!  And you
            barely missed the pump!

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            No harm done.  I always test the
            transmission that way.  The rear
            end.  For stress factors.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           12.
</b>

GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box
of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.

<b>                         AGENT
</b>            Say.  Are you fellows drinking?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Not me.  We're responsible people.

He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The
AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            There's another worrier.  He's
            probably all cranked up on speed.

<b>EXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
STRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted
figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            We spent the rest of that night
            rounding up materials and packing
            the car.  Then we ate some mescaline
            and went swimming.

The surf crashes in the distance...

<b>EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT
</b>
DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself
float up through the silvery bubbles...

<b>DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING
</b><b>MOONLIT SURF.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Our trip was different.  It was to
            be a classic affirmation of
            everything right and true in the
            national character; a gross,
            physical salute to the fantastic
            possibilities of life in this
            country.  But only for those with
            true grit...

<b>EXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY
</b>
DUKE's intense face.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            ...and we're chock full of that!
<b>
</b><b>                                                           13.

<b>                         GONZO

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            My attorney understands this
            concept, despite his racial handicap.
            But do you?!

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            He said he understood, but I could
            see in his eyes that he didn't.  He
            was lying to me.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            My heart!

GONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and
screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.

<b>                         GONZO (CONT'D)
</b>            Where's the medicine?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            The medicine?  Yes, it's right here.

DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Don't worry, this man has a bad
            heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we
            have a cure for it.

DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO
falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The
HITCHHIKER looks petrified.

<b>                         GONZO

            Henry.  I've known him for years
            but he ripped us off -- and you
            know what that means, right?

GONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.

<b>                         GONZO (CONT'D)

GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.

</b>            It was absolutely imperative that

            Otherwise, we might have to pay for
            our suite.

GONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off
and the powder swirls away on the wind.

<b>                         GONZO

DUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a
buckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the
TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.

DUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the

AROUND -- absolutely no success.

intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.

<b>                         GONZO

jowls and fangs.

DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.

DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED
into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND
<b>GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)

GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...
as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to
keep him in his line of vision.

Looking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the

DUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,
filthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him --
talking a foreign language.

In a sudden rush the PRESS CROWD make for the door taking
DUKE with them.

<b>EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds...

A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR
AWAY.  A great cloud of dust goes up -- obscuring the RACERS
as they disappear into the desert...

A moment...

DUKE heads for the bar along with the REST.  It's packed.
Drinks are ordered.

A shout from outside the tent goes up:

<b>                         VOICE OFF

The CROWD rushes for the door.  DUKE gets swept along.

            due to go off 10 at a time every 2

DUKE hits the bar.

A middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar.

</b>            Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it?
            Last night I was home in Long Beach
            and somebody said they were runnin'
            the Mint 400 today, so I says to my
            old lady, "Man, I'm goin'." So she
            gives me a lot of crap about it, so
            I start slappin' her around, and
            the next thing you know two guys I
            never seen before are beating me
            stupid.

<b>                         VOICE OFF

Outside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking
up more clouds of dust.

<b>                         HOODLUM
</b>            Then they gave me ten bucks, put me
            on a bus, and when I woke up here I
            was in downtown Vegas, and for a
            minute all I could think was, "O
            Jesus, who's divorcing me this
            time?" But then I remembered, by
            God!  I was here for the Mint 400.
            And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful
            to be here.  Just wonderful to be
            here with you people.

A silence.  A MAGAZINE REPORTER lunges across the bar --

LACERDA downs his drink -- hurries out through the crowd and
out into the cloud of dust.

<b>EXT. DESERT - DAY

Nothing.  Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST.

Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits.
The RIDER staggers off his bike.  The PIT CREW gas it up and
sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.

DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            By 10 they were spread out all over
            the course.  It was no longer a
            race, now it was an Endurance
            Contest.  The idea of trying to
            "cover this race" in any
            conventional press sense was absurd.

A HORN HONKS.  A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.  LACERDA
hangs out of the window.

<b>                         LACERDA
</b>            It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in!

DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.

The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...

We hear music and voices singing:

<b>                         BATTLE HYMN
</b>            "...As we go marching on
            When I reach my final campground,

            And the Great Commander asks me..."
            [What did he ask you, Rusty?]
            "Did you fight or did you run?"

A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.  DUKE
coughs, chokes, drinks beer.

<b>                         BATTLE HYMN
</b>                   (continuing)
            [And what did you tell them,
            Rusty?]
            "We responded to their rifle fire
            with everything we had..."

The sound of gun shots...

A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE
RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.  The radio blares:
<b>"THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."
</b>
The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING
EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.  A slant-eyed
Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and
stripes.  A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.  They
yell over the roaring engines.

<b>                         DUNE BUGGY DRIVER
</b>            Where's the damn race?

</b>            Beats me.  We're just good patriotic
            Americans like yourself.

DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.  In
response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his
grip on an automatic weapon.

<b>                         DUNE BUGGY DRIVER

</b>            The sporting press.  We're

The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            If you want a good chase, you
            should get after that skunk from
            CBS News up ahead in the black jeep.
            He's the man responsible for that
            book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON.

<b>                         DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1

And they ROAR away.

<b>                         LACERDA
</b>            No, no -- we have to go on.  We

DUKE gets out of the Bronco.

<b>                         DUKE

After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver
roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            It was time.  I felt, for an
            Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole
            scene.  The race was definitely
            under way.  I had witnessed the

Reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in front of the

</b>            Ah, devil ether.  It makes you
            behave like the village drunkard in
            some early Irish novel... total
            loss of all basic motor skills;
            blurred vision, no balance, numb
            tongue --
                   (throws away kleenex)
            The mind recoils in horror, unable
            to communicate with the spinal
            column.  Which is interesting,
            because you can actually watch
            yourself behaving in this terrible
            way, but you can't control it.

DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care-
taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            You approach the turnstiles and
            know that when you get there, you
            have to give the man two dollars or
            he won't let you inside... but when
            you get there, everything goes wrong.

<b>THE ETHER KICKS IN:
</b>
DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES,
GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING
CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets.

</b>            Some angry Rotarian shoves you and
            you think: What's happening here?
            What's going on?  Then you hear
            yourself mumbling.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (mumbling)
            Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of
            mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My
            name is Brinks; I was born... Born?

The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS
swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly
locked in a death battle.

All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES

Something causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks
on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to
move out of the way.

GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths.
One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A
FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE.

            Come on, Doc -- lets go downstairs
            and gamble.

GONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the
turntable.

DUKE carefully steps off the turntable.

GONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and
confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.

DUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps
going around.

The BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them.

DUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the
bar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves
GONZO from behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream.
DUKE approaches him with his hands in the air.  Smiling.

GONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched,
looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?

</b>            OK.  You stay here and go to jail.
            I'm leaving.

DUKE walks fast towards the stairs.  GONZO catches up with
him.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Did you see that?  Some sonofabitch
            kicked me in the back.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Probably the bartender.  He wanted
            to stomp you for what you said to

closes.

GONZO stops laughing.

</b>            One of the things you learn, after
            years of dealing with drug people,
            is that you can turn your back on a
            person, but never turn your back on
            a drug.  Especially when it's
            waving a razor-sharp hunting knife
            in your eyes.

He walks to the bathroom and opens the door.

<b>INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.
Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A
large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The
shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER
PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over
the sink.

DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED

</b>

<b>                         DUKE

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit."
            I want a rising sound.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in
            two hours and then they're going to
            come up here and beat the mortal
            shit out of you with big saps.
            Right there in that tub.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            I dig my own graves.  Green water

</b>            OK.  But do me one last favor, will
            you.  Can you give me two hours?
            That's all I ask -- just two hours
            to sleep before tomorrow.  I
            suspect it's going to be a very
            difficult day.

He switches on the tape. "WHITE RABBIT" begins to build.

<b>                         GONZO

DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and
leaves, closing the door behind him.

DUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.
Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.

DUKE stares down at GONZO.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Not me.  It would blast you through
            the wall -- stone dead in ten

                   (holds the PLUGGED IN
                   TAPE/RADIO over the tub)
            Let me make sure I have it all
            lined up.  You want me to throw
            this thing into the tub when "WHITE

GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think

            get one of the goddamn maids to do
            it.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Are you ready?

He switches "WHITE RABBIT" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS
AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.

Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a
good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when "WHITE
RABBIT" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.

<b>GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            There's no choice.  I wouldn't dare

            around with a head full of acid and
            wanting to slice me up with that

<b>                         GONZO
</b>                   (mumbles)
            Who said anything about slicing you
            up?  I just wanted to carve a
            little Z on your forehead.  Nothing

GONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (menaces him with the MACE)
            Get back in that tub.  Eat some

            some grass, shoot some smack --
            shit, do whatever you have to do,
            but let me get some rest.

GONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Hell, yes.  You really need some

GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair
up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next
to the clock.

DUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He
collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)

            Just another ugly refugee from the
            Love Generation.

The WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his
face.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL
<b>BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            My attorney had never been able to

            by former drug abusers -- that you
            can get a lot higher without drugs
            than with them.  And neither have
            I, for that matter.

The pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL
LIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the
foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior
of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.

<b>INT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT

A slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the
action is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            I recall one night in the Matrix.
            There I was -- a victim of the Drug
            Explosion.  A natural street freak,
            just eating whatever came by.

A ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The
sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.

<b>                         ROAD-PERSON

            All I need is a place to cook.

The camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.

<b>INT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a
HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            I decided to eat only half at first.
            Good thinking.  But I spilled the
            rest on the sleeve of my red
            Pendleton shirt.

DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the
door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in
slow-motion.

<b>                         MUSICIAN

            Well, all this white stuff on my
            sleeve is LSD.

The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A
long pause.

Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-
cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.
We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the
men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...
sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The
STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            With a bit of luck his life was

            Pendleton shirts are getting
            incredible kicks from things he'll
            never know.

                   (he gets up, pours

            Has it been five years?  Six?  It
            seems like a lifetime -- the kind
            of peak that never comes again.
            San Francisco in the middle sixties
            was a very special time and place
            to be a part of.  But no
            explanation, no mix of words or
            music or memories can touch that
            sense of knowing that you were
            there and alive in that corner of
            time and the world.  Whatever it
            meant.

DUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.

            and beautiful wave...

<b>DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE
</b><b>NEVER SEEN BEFORE.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            So now, less than five years later,
            you can go up on a steep hill in
            Las Vegas and look west, and with
            the right kind of eyes you can
            almost see the high water mark --
            that place where the wave finally
            broke and rolled back.

</b><b>                                                           52.
</b>

The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.
Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi
shouting "WOODSTOCK ÜBER ALLES!"

<b>INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
DUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.

<b>INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN
</b>
A harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking
like shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            The decision to flee came suddenly.
            Or maybe not.

DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of
fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.

<b>                         BELL BOY
</b>            Room service!

The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already
stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Maybe I'd planned it all along --
            subconsciously waiting for the
            right moment.  The bill was a
            factor, I think.  Because I had no
            money to pay for it.

DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Our room service tabs had been
            running somewhere between $29 and
            $36 per hour, for forty-eight
            consecutive hours.  Incredible.
            How could it happen?

DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED
LUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --
empty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            But by the time I asked this
            question, there was no one around
            to answer.

DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           53.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            My attorney was gone.  He must have
            sensed trouble.

<b>EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY

GONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of
brand-new fine cowhide luggage.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Panic.

<b>INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY
</b>
DUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --
leaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both
ways, then hurries away down the corridor.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            It crept up my spine like first
            rising vibes of an acid frenzy.
            All these horrible realities began
            to dawn on me.

<b>INT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY
</b>
An anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the
elevator descends.  He searches his pockets...

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Here I was, alone in Las Vegas,
            with this goddamned incredibly
            expensive car, completely twisted
            on drugs, no cash, no story for the
            magazine.  And on top of everything
            else I had a gigantic goddamn hotel
            bill to deal with.

DUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.

The door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN
<b>HANDCUFFS.
</b>
DUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors
close.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            I didn't even know who had won the
            race.  Maybe nobody.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           54.
</b>

<b>INT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
</b>
DUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering
MANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (muttering to himself)
            How would Horatio Alger have
            handled this situation?

<b>EXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY
</b>
Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN
with a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves
at the CAR BOY.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Stay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a
            relatively respectable citizen -- a
            multiple felon, perhaps, but
            certainly not dangerous.

The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The
back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint
400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O CONT'D)
</b>            Luckily, I had taken the soap and
            grapefruit and other luggage out to
            the car a few hours earlier.  Now
            it was only a matter of slipping
            the noose...

DUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!

<b>                         CLERK'S VOICE
</b><b>            MR. DUKE!
</b>
DUKE freezes.

<b>                         CLERK'S VOICE
</b>            Mr. Duke!  We've been looking for
            you!

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            The game was up!  They had me.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (to himself)
            Well, why not?  Many fine books
            have been written in prison.

</b><b>                                                           55.
</b>

Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK
arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS
<b>HAND.
</b>
<b>                         CLERK
</b>            Sir?
                   (thrusts out a TELEGRAM)
            This telegram came for you.
            Actually, it isn't for you.  It's
            for somebody named Thompson, but it
            says 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does
            that make sense?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (barely able to speak)
            Yes... It makes sense.

DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.

The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous
stash inside.

<b>                         CLERK
</b>            I checked the register for this man
            Thompson.  We don't show him but I
            figured he might be part of your
            team.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            He is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to
            him.

He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.

SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word
or two.

<b>                         CLERK
</b>            What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's
            signature on the telegram from Los
            Angeles.  When we knew he was right
            here in the hotel.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            You did the right thing.  Never try
            to understand a press message.
            About half the time we use codes --
            especially with Dr. Gonzo.

<b>                         CLERK
</b>            Tell me.  When will the doctor be
            awake?
<b>
</b><b>                                                           56.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (tenses)
            Awake?  What do you mean?

DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.

<b>                         CLERK
</b>                   (uncomfortably)
            Well... the manager, Mr. Heem,
            would like to meet him.  Nothing
            unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet
            all our large accounts... put them
            on a personal basis... just a chat
            and a handshake, you understand.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Of course.  But if I were you, I'd
            leave the Doctor alone until after
            he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very
            crude man.

DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.

<b>                         CLERK
</b>            But he will be available?  Perhaps
            later this morning?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Look.  That telegram was all
            scrambled.  It was actually from
            Thompson, not to him.  Western
            Union must have gotten the names
            reversed.  I have to get going.  I
            have to get out to the track.

<b>                         CLERK
</b>            There's no hurry!  The race is over!

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (taking off)
            Not for me.

He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.

<b>                         CLERK
</b>            Let's have lunch!

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Righto!

<b>EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY
</b>
DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           57.

A "YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS" sign flashes past.

Bob Dylan plays: "Memphis Blues Again -- "Aaww, Mama, can
this really by the end...?"

A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Jesus, bad waves of paranoia,
            madness, fear and loathing --
            intolerable vibrations in this
            place.  Get out!  The weasels were
            closing in.  I could smell the ugly
            brutes.  Flee!

DUKE drives fast.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Do me one last favor Lord: just
            give me five more high-speed hours
            before you bring the hammer down;
            just let me get rid of this goddamn
            car and off of this horrible desert.

A sign flashes "YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE."

A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.

<b>                         DUKE (CONT'D)
</b>            You evil bastard!  This is your
            work!  You'd better take care of
            me, Lord... because if you don't
            you're going to have me on your
            hands.

The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Few people understand the psychology
            of dealing with a Highway Traffic
            Cop.  Your normal speeder will
            panic and immediately pull over to
            the side.  This is wrong.

DUKE floors the gas pedal.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            It arouses contempt in the cop heart.

<b>THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                           58.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Make the bastard chase you.  He
            will follow.  But he won't know
            what to make of your blinker signal
            that says you're about to turn right.

DUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            This is to let him know you're
            looking for a proper place to pull
            off and talk.

<b>AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.
</b>
DUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            It will take him a moment to
            realize that he is about to make
            180 degree turn at speed... but you
            will be ready for it, braced for
            the G's and the fast heel toe work.

The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.

<b>EXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY
</b>
The patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE
stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>            Just what the FUCK did you think
            you were doing?!

DUKE smiles.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>            May I see your license.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Of course, officer.

DUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer
can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            I knew I was fucked.

The COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for
DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           59.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>            Could I have that, please?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Why not?  It was getting warm anyway.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --
glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars
of soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>            You realize...

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I
            understand that.  I knew it was a
            crime but I did it anyway.  Shit,
            why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>            That's a strange attitude.

He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>            You know -- I get the feeling you
            could use a nap.  There's a rest
            area up ahead.  Why don't you pull
            over and sleep a few hours?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            A nap won't help.  I've been awake
            for too long -- three or four
            nights.  I can't even remember.  If
            I go to sleep now, I'm dead for
            twenty hours.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>            Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes
            into my book, as of noon, is that I
            apprehended you... for driving too
            fast, and advised you to proceed no
            further than the next rest area...
            your stated destination, right?
            Where you plan to take a long nap.
            Do I make myself clear?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            How far is Baker?  I was hoping to
            stop there for lunch.
<b>
</b><b>                                                           60.
</b>

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>            Not my jurisdiction.  The city
            limits are two point two miles
            beyond the rest area.  Can you make
            it that far?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            I'll try.  I've been wanting to go
            to Baker for a long time.  I've
            heard a lot about it.

The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.

<b>                         HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
</b>            Excellent seafood.  With a mind
            like yours, you'll probably want to
            try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic
            Diner.

The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.

<b>EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY
</b>
DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            I felt raped.  The Pig had done me
            on all fronts, and now he was going
            off to chuckle about it -- on the
            west side of town, waiting for me
            to make a run for L.A.

DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he
signals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn
he sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn
their eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER
drops his thumb.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Great Jesus, it's him.

DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE
<b>WAY HE CAME.

<b>EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in

</b>            This was a superior machine -- ten
            grand worth of gimmicks and high
            price special effects.  The rear

            and there was a certain bent appeal

            burn on one Las Vegas hotel and
            then just wheeling across town and
            checking into another.

The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately
attended by impressed MINIONS.

THE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all
dressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,
Arnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.

Ahead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.
The POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,
weeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.

<b>                         POLICE CHIEF

            I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the
            "late list." Your reservations were
            transferred to the... ah...
            Moonlight Motel, which is out on
            Paradise Boulevard...

<b>                         POLICE CHIEF

<b>                         CLERK

The POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...

</b>            Listen, you fuzzy little shithead --
            I've been fucked around, in my
            time, by a fairly good cross-
            section of mean-tempered rule-crazy
            cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck
            you, officer, I'm in charge here,
            and I'm telling you we don't have
            room for you."

DUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I
            wonder if maybe I could just sort
            of slide through and get out of
            your way.  Name's Raoul Duke --
            Raoul Duke.  My attorney made the
            reservation.

DUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE
goes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he
was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The
CLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.

<b>                         CLERK
</b>            Certainly, Mr. Duke!

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            My bags are out there in that white
            Cadillac convertible.  Can you have
            someone drive it around to the room?

ALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild
            Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and
            a night's worth of ice delivered to
            my room, please?

<b>                         CLERK

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Well, thank you.

DUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the
elevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of
beer and toasts them.  The doors close.

<b>INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.

A 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.

GONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a
drug-addled grin on his face.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            You degenerate pig!

<b>                         GONZO

LUCY eyes DUKE venomously.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!
            Remember what happened at the
            airport!  No more of that, okay?

LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his
arm round her shoulder.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Lucy... this is my client.  This is
            Mr. Duke, the famous journalist.
            He's paying for this suite, Lucy.
            He's on our side.

DUKE flops onto the sofa.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves
            artists.

DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of
artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in
charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.

<b>                         GONZO

            down here from Montana just to give
            these portraits to Barbra.  We're
            going over to the Americana Hotel

DUKE's voice rises above GONZO.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            I desperately needed peace, rest,
            sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on
            this.  Finding my attorney on acid
            and locked into some kind of

            You know, those little blue barrels.

GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.

</b>            Listen, she's running away from
            home for something like the fifth

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            She's perfect for this gig.  These
            cops will go fifty bucks a head to
            beat her into submission and then
            gang fuck her.  We can set her up
            in one of these back street motels,
            hang pictures of Jesus all over the
            room, then turn these pigs loose on
            her... Hell she's strong; she'll
            hold her own.

GONZO's face twitches badly.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick
            but I never expected to hear you

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            I figure she can do about four at a
            time.  Christ, if we keep her full
            of acid that's more like two grand

            to a Vegas hotel room and savagely
            penetrated every orifice in her
            body with his throbbing,
            uncircumcised member.

GONZO starts crying.

<b>                         GONZO

            got two hundred dollars.  And we

            in Montana, where she lives, and

</b>            It just occurred to me, that she
            has no witnesses.  Anything that
            she says about us is completely

DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Hotel Americana?  I need a
            reservation.  For my niece.  Listen,
            I need her treated very gently.
            She's an artist, and might seem a
            trifle highstrung...

In the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the
door.

<b>                         GONZO

The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps
LUCY and her paintings from the car.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Lucy was a potentially fatal
            millstone on both our necks.  There
            was absolutely no choice but to cut
            her adrift and hope her memory was
            fucked.

GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --
waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting
to come down...

GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands
together as if washing his hands of the situation.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Well that's that.  Take off slowly.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            I gave the cabbie an extra ten
            bucks to make sure she gets there

            there myself in an hour, and if she
            wasn't, I'd come back out here and
            rip his lungs out.

            restaurant and eat some red salmon.
            I feel a powerful lust for red

The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The
sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson
tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.

GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth
with a towel.

A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles
distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.

At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI
wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name
tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.

GONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,

DR. BLUMQUIST -- a "drug expert" -- takes the stage.

<b>                         DR. BLUMQUIST
</b>            We must come to terms with the Drug

</b>            The reefer butt is called a "roach,"

</b>            It was clear that we had stumbled
            into a prehistoric gathering.

<b>                         DR. BLUMQUIST
</b>            Now, there are four states of being
            in the cannabis, or marijuana,
            society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and
            Square.  The square is seldom if
            ever cool.  He is not "with it,"
            that is, he doesn't know "what's
            happening." But if he manages to
            figure it out, he moves up a notch
            to "hip."

DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.

<b>                         DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)
</b>            And if he can bring himself to
            approve of what is happening, he
            becomes "groovy." After that, with

DUKE heads for the exit.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Never mind, it's absolutely pure.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Jesus... what kind of monster
            client have you picked up this time?
            There's only one source for this
            stuff -- the adrenaline gland from
            a living human body!

GONZO turns to smile at DUKE.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            I know, but the guy didn't have any
            cash to pay me.  He's one of these
            Satanism freaks.  He offered me
            human blood -- said it would take
            me higher than I've ever been in my
            life.
                   (laughs -- struts
                   round DUKE -- eyes
                   bright with expectation)
            I thought he was kidding, so I told
            him I'd just as soon have an ounce
            or so of pure adrenochrome -- or
            maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland
            to chew on.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            I could already feel the stuff
            working on me -- the first wave
            felt like a combination of mescaline
            and methedrine -- maybe I should
            take a swim, I thought...

DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Yeah, they nailed this guy for
            child molesting.  He swore he
            didn't do it. "Why should I fuck
            with children?" he says. "They're
            too small." Christ, werewolf is
            entitled to legal counsel.  I
            didn't dare turn the creep down.
            He might have picked up a letter
            opener and gone after my pineal
            gland!

<b>GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Why not?  We should get some of
            that.  Just eat a big handful and
            see what happens.

<b>                         GONZO

<b>                         DUKE

GONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...
towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...

</b>            Jesus, that stuff got right on top

<b>INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
Darkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- "Put the
lime in the coconut and mix em all up..."

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            What kind of rat-bastard psychotic
            would play that song -- right now,
            at this moment?

DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,
awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been
there days -- months.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            When I came to the general back
            alley ambiance of the suite was so
            rotten, so incredibly foul.  How
            long had I been lying there?  Hours?
            Days?  Months?  All these signs of
            violence.  What had happened?

DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE
SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving
whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights
replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,
pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered
on a shattered mirror.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            There was evidence in this room of
            excessive consumption of almost
            every type of drug known to
            civilized man since 1544 AD.

DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --
HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            But what kind of addict would need
            all these coconut husks and crushed
            honeydew rinds?  Would the presence
            of junkies account for all these
            uneaten french fries?  These
            puddles of glazed ketchup on the
            bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all
            this booze?  And these crude
            pornographic photos smeared with
            mustard that had dried to a hard
            yellow crust...

DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT
RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.

</b><b>                                                           91.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            These were not the hoof prints of
            your normal god-fearing junkie.  It
            was too savage, too aggressive.

<b>QUICK FLASHBACK:
</b>
<b>GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:

DUKE stares at the smashed mirror.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            Grim memories and bad flashbacks.

In the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN

DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.

The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.

DUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out
of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE
<b>SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...
</b>sleeping on the sofa.

The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.

A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO
grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is
muffling her screams with an ice bag.

<b>                         MAID

            She must have used a pass key.  I

as GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.

A grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.

DUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: "Awwww,
mama... can this really...be the end...?"

<b>EXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY
</b>
The WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            There is a definite obligation,
            when you boom around Vegas in a
            white Coupe de Ville, to maintain a
            certain style.

DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping
basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They
send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.

The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather
at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with
junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.

DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects
a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO
pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering

DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS
<b>OFF.
</b>
<b>EXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY
</b>
<b>THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO
</b>looks wildly around.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are
            we doing out here on this
            godforsaken road?

GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT
<b>RUNWAY.
</b>
<b>                         GONZO
</b>            The airport is over there!

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Never missed a plane yet.

DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the
WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING,
HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight
up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER
A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the
<b>RUNWAY.
</b>
GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He
throws a worried look at DUKE.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            I'll drop you right next to the
            plane.

They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET
<b>ENGINE SCREAM.
</b>
<b>                         GONZO
</b>            No!  I can't get out!  They'll
            crucify me.  I'll have to take the
            blame!
<b>
</b><b>                                                          106.
</b>

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (irritatedly)
            Ridiculous!  Just say you were
            hitchhiking to the airport and I
            picked you up.  You never saw me
            before.  Shit, this town is full of
            white Cadillac convertibles.  I
            plan to go through there so fast
            that nobody will even glimpse the
            goddamn license plate.  You ready?

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Why not?  But for Christ's sake,
            just do it fast!

<b>EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY
</b>
DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO
<b>JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.
</b>
DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Hey!

GONZO stops -- turns.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Don't take any guff from those
            swine.  Remember, if you have any
            trouble you can always send a
            telegram to the Right People.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Yeah... Explaining my Position.
            Some asshole wrote a poem about
            that once...

GONZO pauses.

<b>                         GONZO
</b>            Probably good advice, if you have
            shit for brains.

GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT
<b>TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND
</b><b>LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            There he goes -- one of God's own
            prototypes -- a high powered mutant
            of some kind never even considered
            for mass production.  Too weird to
            live and too rare to die.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          107.
</b>

DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH
<b>THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.
</b>
<b>INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT
</b>
On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find
DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his
typewriter.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            We are all wired into a survival
            trip now.  No more of the speed
            that fueled that 60's.  That was
            the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.
            He crashed around America selling
            "consciousness expansion" without
            ever giving a thought to the grim
            meat-hook realities that were lying
            in wait for all the people who took
            him seriously...

DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly
rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT
<b>IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE
</b>            All those pathetically eager acid
            freaks who thought they could buy
            Peace and Understanding for three
            bucks a hit.  But their loss and
            failure is ours too.  What Leary
            took down with him was the central
            illusion of a whole life-style that
            he helped create...

<b>RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30
</b><b>FEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE
</b><b>CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...
</b>
<b>                         DUKE
</b>            ... a generation of permanent
            cripples, failed seekers, who never
            understood the essential old-mystic
            fallacy of the Acid Culture: the
            desperate assumption that somebody...
            or at least some force -- is
            tending the light at the end of the
            tunnel.

<b>HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX
</b><b>SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON
</b><b>SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT
</b><b>LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                          108.
</b>

<b>EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE
DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out
of the back seat as he takes a bump.

<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            There was only one road back to L.A.
            US Interstate 15, just a flat-out
            high speed burn through Baker and
            Barstow and Berdoo, then on to the
            Hollywood Freeway straight into
            frantic oblivion: safety, obscurity,
            just another freak in the Freak
            Kingdom.

DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING
facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon
sign that flashes beer.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Ahhh.  Wonderful.

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.

<b>INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY
</b>
DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all
about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON
<b>WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE
</b>RAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD
MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden
bar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.

<b>                         PROPRIETOR
</b>            What'll you have?

DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (doubtfully)
            Ballantine Ale...?

THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND
<b>RELAXES.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Hard to find it served like this
            anymore.

As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE
<b>AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY
</b>PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack
reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.
<b>
</b><b>                                                          109.
</b>

<b>                         PROPRIETOR
</b>            Where ya comin' from, young man?

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            Las Vegas.

<b>                         PROPRIETOR
</b>            A great town, that Vegas.  I bet
            you had good luck there.  You're
            the type.

<b>                         DUKE
</b>            I know.  I'm a triple Scorpio.

<b>                         PROPRIETOR
</b>                   (trustingly)
            That's a fine combination.  You
            can't lose.

A LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS
REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...
<b>KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (caught off guard... muttering)
            Oh, my God!...

<b>                         PROPRIETOR
</b>                   (not understanding)
            This is my granddaughter...

<b>                         DUKE
</b>                   (recovering)
            Don't worry...
                   (leans forward in confidence)
            ... and I'm actually the District
            Attorney from Ignoto County.
                   (winks)
            Just another good American like
            yourself.

<b>A MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.
</b>
Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the
back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.

<b>WHO FEELS ASHAMED.
</b>
DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.

<b>EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY
</b>
A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.
Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...
<b>
</b><b>                                                          110.
</b>

A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.

Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags
step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...

DUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the
trembling dash... DUKE catches it...

<b>ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...
</b>
<b>DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --
</b><b>TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE
</b><b>            HOLY SHIT!!!
</b>
DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT
<b>THE MARINES.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE
</b><b>            GOD'S MERCY ON YOU SWINE!
</b>
<b>DUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS
</b><b>IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE
</b><b>CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!
</b>
<b>AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</b>
The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.

<b>EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY
</b>
DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!

<b>DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.
</b>
<b>                         DUKE (V/O)
</b>            My heart was filled with joy.  I
            felt like a monster reincarnation
            of Horatio Alger... a man on the
            move... and just sick enough to be
            totally confident.

The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.

<b>AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
</b>
