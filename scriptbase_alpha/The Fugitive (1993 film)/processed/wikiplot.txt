Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford), a surgeon in Chicago, arrives home one night to find his wife Helen (Ward) fatally wounded by a one-armed man.
Although Kimble struggles with the killer, the assailant escapes.
The lack of evidence of a break-in, his being the beneficiary of Helen's lucrative life insurance, and a misunderstood 9-1-1 call, result in his conviction of first degree murder.
On his way to death row aboard a bus, his fellow prisoners attempt an escape.
The pandemonium results in a number of dead and wounded, causing the bus to fall down a ravine and into the path of an oncoming train.
Kimble escapes the destructive collision and flees the scene.
Deputy U.S.
Marshal Samuel Gerard (Jones), and his colleagues Renfro (Pantoliano), Biggs (Roebuck), Newman (Wood) and Poole (Caldwell), arrive at the crash site and formulate a search plan to apprehend the escaped convicts.
Kimble sneaks into a hospital to treat his wounds and alter his appearance.
He eludes the authorities and makes a getaway.
Kimble is eventually cornered by Gerard at the leading edge of a storm drain flowing into a dam.
Kimble leaps from the viaduct into the raging water and escapes.
