<b>				THE FUGITIVE
</b>
					 by

			      Jeb Stuart and David Twohy











<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
<b>	EXT. CHICAGO - AERIAL - NIGHT
</b>
<b>	CREDITS BEGIN OVER:
</b>
	Snow swirls around the tall buildings of downtown Chicago.

<b>	EXT. CHICAGO HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
	Cars, taxis, limos line the street. A cab pulls up and MAN 
	in tuxedo moves into:

<b>	INT. CHICAGO HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	THROUGH arriving guests we PICK UP the Man climbing stairs 
	to the ballroom.

<b>	ANGLE - COAT CHECK
</b>
	The Man hands his coat to coat check woman and thanks her. 
	When he turns we get our first view of DR. RICHARD KIMBLE, 
	a tall, athletic man, with a trim beard.

	He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated 
	ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical
	fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and 
	sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the 
	models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.

	A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND 
<b>	AID FOUNDATION"
</b>
	Kimble is handed a glass of champagne, which he promptly 
	sets on another waiter's passing tray.

<b>				ROBERTS (V.O.)
</b>		Richard...

	DR. ROBERTS, a large surgeon, pulls Kimble over to a group
	of surgeons gathered around a bar. Smoking cigars.

<b>				ROBERTS
</b>		Cancun. Nat just talked everybody 
		into it...

	A hospital equipment rep, NAT, is buying drinks.

<b>				KIMBLE 
</b>		So, what's the deal? If the hospital 
		buys ten new -

<b>				NAT
</b>		No, no, no, no strings attached, Dr. 
		Kimble. Industrial Hospital Supply 
		has no ulterior motives.

<b>				KIMBLE 
</b>		On the house, huh?
			(to bartender)
		Tonic water with lime.

	Everyone agrees.

<b>				KIMBLE 
</b>		Never get me to sell my soul for one
		of those trips...

	His tone silences the group. Kimble takes his drink.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>			(to Nat)
	 	... But if you get any more Bulls 
		tickets, Nat, give me a call.

	The group laughs, Kimble extracts himself and CREDITS
<b>	CONTINUE OVER -

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	KIMBLE
</b>
	Moving through the crowd.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	KIMBLE
</b>
	Nearly gets hit in the follow-through of an imaginary 
	golf swing.

<b>				KIMBLE 
</b>		You're slicing, Dave. Don't turn 
		your hip.

	He keeps moving.

<b>				GOLFING MAN 
</b>		Thanks, Richard...

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	ANGLE - TOUGH-LOOKING LAB RAT
</b>
	KATHY WAHLUND, totally out of her element amid the formal 
	elegance around her. She wears a leather jacket over 
	T-shirt and stares at the action on the fashion runway.

<b>				DR. WAHLUND 
</b>			(dripping sarcasm)
		I'm so glad you talked me into 
		coming, Richard... I can pick my
		cruise wardrobe.

<b>				RICHARD 
</b>		It's for a good cause, Kath... 
		Besides you need to get out of the
		lab more. Your electron microscope
		is starting to give you a tan.

	She smiles. He moves on.

<b>	ANGLE - PARTY
</b>
	Kimble continues down the bar when he spots a friend...

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Hey, Jim.

	DR. JAMES NICHOLS turns, smiles. Mid-40s, head of the 
	University Hospital. He is a fit contemporary.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		Richard, I just saw someone who 
		wanted to meet you...

	Just then Kimble spots an attractive WOMAN, late thirties, 
	wearing a drop-dead, simple black gown. She's surrounded by
	a group of men hanging on her every word. She and Kimble 
	catch a look and hold it.

<b>				NICHOLS (V.O.)
</b>		Richard Kimble... Alex Lentz. Alex
		is working on the RDU90 trials for 
		Devlin-Macgregor.

	Kimble turns to meet DR. ALEXANDER LENTZ, late 30s, tan, 
	smiling. Lentz extends his hand...

<b>				LENTZ
</b>		Dr. Kimble... Sorry, we've been 
		trading phone calls last few days 
		... something about a biopsy report 
		I returned to you?

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>			(suddenly attentive)
		Yeah... Three. Livers appeared 
		hepatetic to me.

<b>				LENTZ
</b>		I'll be in my office in the morning 
		and I'll pull up the samples. Is that 
		a good time for you?

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Sure.

<b>				LENTZ
</b>			(holds Kimble's look, 
			then to Nichols)
		See you, Jim.

	Lentz moves on. Kimble looks after him a beat, then focuses 
	on relocating the Woman he just saw. She's gone. He and 
	Nichols move together through the party.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>			(digs in his pocket)
		Before I forget, I went by the garage
		this afternoon and picket up the 
		Ferrari. Thanks for the loaner again.

	He hands Kimble a valet ticket.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		They fix it this time?

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		We'll see.

	They reach the Woman Kimble saw, his wife, HELEN KIMBLE. 
	Kimble kisses her.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		You look fabulous, Helen.

	He kisses Helen.

<b>				HELEN (WOMAN)
</b>		Hello, Jim.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>			(to Kimble)
		We've got a court tomorrow at three.

	Nichols leaves. Kimble looks at his wife.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Well, I've seen everyone, can we 
		leave?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		That would be a little abrupt, don't 
		you think?

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT
</b>
	A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to 
	others at table ant sit across from each other.

	Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, 
	mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other 
<b>	OLDER WIFE.
</b>
	Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress 
	her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS 
<b>	CONTINUE...
</b>
	INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course 
	changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange 
	of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, 
	catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to 
	his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly 
	ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper 
	of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: 
	"not yet."

	As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:

	"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod 
	at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." 
	"That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress 
	you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 
	'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)

	Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his 
	watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes 
	her head.

<b>				NOW EAU WIFE
</b>			(to table)
		I told my husband that he was going 
		to kill us if he didn't stop 
		operating. What with this AIDS thing, 
		he's putting us all at risk.

	Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share 
	a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

<b>				HELEN
</b>			(to her dinner partners)
		I'm sorry, I have to get my husband 
		home.

	They say their good-byes and pass Nichols' table. Nichols 
	shakes his friend's hand in passing. From across the room we 
	see Lentz watching.

<b>	INT. KIMBLE'S MERCEDES - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble and Helen driving home. She runs her fingers through 
	his hair as he drives.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		You looked handsome tonight...

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Thank you...

	He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much 
	for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look 
		like waiters...

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		But me?

<b>				HELEN
</b>		You looked more like... a band 
		director.

	He stops at red light, leans over and kisses her. Light 
	changes and neither notice. Slowly their kiss breaks.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Are we home yet?...

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble pulls up in front of his house. Suddenly both his 
	PAGER and CAR PHONE RING at the same time.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>			(to phone)
		Dr. Kimble
			(suddenly attentive)
		When? Okay, tell them I'll be there 
		in ten minutes.

	He hangs up.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Tim's got a problem.

	Helen kisses him again, opens the door.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Call me on your way home.

	CREDITS END as we -

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - HALLWAY / SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble, wearing scrubs but without head gear, moves down 
	stairs to the OR hall.

	He sticks his head into the operating room.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Cavalry's here.

	Two harried surgeons look up, glad to see him.

<b>	SCRUB ROOM
</b>
	Kimble begins scrubbing as the RESIDENT comes out to bring 
	him up to speed.

<b>				RESIDENT
</b>		Patient is a male, forty-three. We 
		pulled his gall bladder and the 
		bleeding started.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		What's his pro time?

<b>				RESIDENT
</b>			(concerned)
		He's at 36 seconds. We got a major 
		bleeder in here.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		You talk to the family?

<b>				RESIDENT
</b>		None. He's off the street.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>

<b>	INT. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Operation in progress. Top medical facility filled with 
	trained professionals and state of the art equipment. Kimble 
	is assisted across the table by the chief Resident. Both 
	working so intently they never look at each other as they 
	talk...

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>			(to Anesthesiologist)
		Okay... I'm clamping. Can he 
		tolerate it?

<b>				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
</b>		He's a very sick guy.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Do we have a choice?

<b>				ANESTHESIOLOGIST
</b>		Go for it.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Marie, give me a clamp...

	MARIE, the scrub nurse, passes him the instrument and Kimble 
	and the other SURGEON continue to work with the Resident 
	assisting.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>			(never looking up)
		Your husband know you're here tonight,
		Marie?... What about this liver?

<b>				RESIDENT
</b>		History's sketchy. Could be an 
		alcoholic.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Who referred him?

<b>				RESIDENT
</b>		He's on a drug protocol. RDU90.

	Kimble looks up and shares a look with the chief Resident 
	over their masks, then back to work.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		The wave of the future... Marie, you 
		told Frank yet? Frank is so jealous 
		of this late night thing we've got 
		going here... This should hold him. 
		Bleeding's stopped. Let's get a 
		biopsy...
			(to circulating nurse)
		Send it downstairs and make sure you 
		get Kath her slice.

<b>				SURGEON
</b>		You staying for the closing, Rich?

	Kimble moves away and sheds his gloves and gown.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		No. I got a date.

<b>	INT. SCRUB ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble throws away his hat and mask. The door opens behind 
	him; it is the other Surgeon.

<b>				SURGEON
</b>		Hey, Richard...

	Kimble turns.

<b>				SURGEON
</b>		Thanks.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble driving through empty Chicago streets toward home. 
	He is on phone, waits for answer.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Hi. I'm five minutes away...

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	Helen on the phone, downstairs. She is still in her gown with 
	an afghan around her shoulders. She's been reading.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		I'm glad it went well. I'll see you 
		in a minute.

	Helen hangs up phone, turns out the light and starts up the 
	stairs.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. CHICAGO STREET - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble driving.

<b>	INT. KIMBLE-S TOWNHOUSE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Helen moves down the hall toward the dressing room/closet.

	Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on 
	the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close 
	one of the interior closet doors.

	She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!

	A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen 
	claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her 
	string of pearls bursts...

	... and a single pearl bounces out of the bedroom... rolls 
	across the landing to the stairs, stopping three steps from 
	the top.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	Snow swirls around the street as Kimble's car pulls into the 
	driveway. On the third floor, we see a bedroom light still 
	on.

<b>	INT. KIMBLE'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	A GRANDFATHER CLOCK TICKS softly. Kimble tosses his keys on 
	the entry table, picks up a stack of mail on the table and 
	calls up the stairs.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I'm home. Did you hear who won the 
		Bulls game?

	No answer. He steps into the:

<b>	KITCHEN
</b>
	The wall phone shows a line in use. Kimble notices it. The 
	WASHER BUZZES, he switches the clothes from washer to dryer,
	and STARTS the MACHINE. Takes a bottle of wine and two 
	glassesand leaves the kitchen.

<b>	INT. BEDROOM - CLOSE ON .38 SMITH AND WESSON - NIGHT
</b>
	Lies on the floor, beside Helen's legs and the receiver of 
	phone, off the hook. A man's rubber-gloved hand picks up the 
	gun.

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	INT. DOWNSTAIRS - STAIRS - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble starts up the stairs to the bedroom...

<b>	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Helen's hand reaches out presses the cradle down, dials

<b>	ON KIMBLE
</b>
	Climbing the stairs... suddenly stops.

	A small white ball on the stairs. He bends down and picks 
	it up... a pearl.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Helen?

	Silence. He can see directly into the bedroom. It's quiet. 
	Too quiet. He notices a lampshade on the floor.

<b>	UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before 
	he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. 
	Adrenal surge.

	Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun 
	free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. 
	The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a 
	leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, 
	sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the 
	landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry 
	hall below.

	SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.

	The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble 
	catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his
	shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.

	Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. 
	Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable 
	face...

	The SIRENS are LOUDER...

	Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble 
	down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

	Kimble pulls himself up and starts to follow but is stopped 
	by a VOICE behind him in the bedroom...

<b>				HELEN (O.S.)

	Lying by the bed, Helen Kimble, clutches the phone with one

	to the house.

<b>	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Kimble moves to her. Sees the necklace of bruises where she 
	was held down and choked. And then a bullet wound in her 
	leg. She's already going into shock. Her speech turns thick.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Hang on, babe... going to be all 
		right.

	Her fingernails dig into Kimble's arm, trying to hold on.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		My head. Richard my hold me.

	Her eyes slip away from his. He peels away the hand on her 
	head - and sees raw pummeled brain staring back and realizes 
	she won't be all right.

	CAMERA SWINGS DOWN TO the dropped phone.

	CAMERA FINDS Kimble in an interview room. He is in "why" 
	shock. "Why her." "Why me?" Says nothing. Two Detectives: 
	KELLY and ROSETTI. Kelly, the questioner, is overweight, 
	aggressive. He shifts his gun on his hip so he can sit down.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		It was .38... I think. I only saw it

	They no longer seem on the same team.

	The two cops stare at Kimble.

	A few members lean over to make notes. It's powerful taken 
	out of context.

<b>	NICHOLS ON THE STAND
</b>
<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		Dr. Nichols. You are aware that 
		Richard Kimble was the only 
		beneficiary of Helen Kimble's estate.
		12 million dollars roughly.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		I was aware of that. The money meant 
		nothing to him.

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		Yet in your presence, Richard Kimble 
		once said that 'if he had Helen's 
		money he could find plenty of uses.'
		Did he not?

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		We were talking about -

</b>
	On the stand. He finishes his moving description of the 
	events. We see some of the jury has been moved.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		... And I was holding her when the 
		officers came in.

	Gutherie returns to his seat. The Prosecutor moves to the 
	jury. He begins slowly but his questions pick up strength.

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		How tall was this man, Dr. Kimble?

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I can't be sure. We were, mostly on 
		the floor, fighting... I couldn't -

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		Did that fight cause the scratches 
		on your face and arms?

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		No. As I explained -

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		And how did this man enter your 
		house?

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I don't know -

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		And you probably don't know why your 
		wife told the emergency operator You 
		were her attacker?

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		She didn't -

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		Your name is Richard, isn't it? Your 
		gun is a .38, isn't it? Your prints

	shockwaves through the courtroom. Reporters push out rear 
	doors. Prosecutors share a look - with a hangman's 
	satisfaction. Nichols, watching behind Kimble's table, 
	lowers his head. Disbelief.

<b>	ANGLE ON RICHARD KIMBLE

	He remains silent. Kimble is pulled gently to his feet by

<b>				PRISONER #1
</b>		Hey. Illinois penal regulations

	Young Guard shakes his head. "Fucking jailhouse lawyers." 
	Checks his watch: 4:00.

<b>				YOUNG GUARD
</b>		Jack! Feedin' time.

	Old Guard yawns to his feet, unhooks a key-ring from his 
	belt. Young Guard stows his shotgun in the weapons locker.

	PRISONER #2 looks at Kimble. Kimble stirs awake... watches 
	the cage door open, Young Guard moving back. And across the 
	aisle...

	PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head 
	between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and 
	CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp 
	plastic shank.

	Heart quickening, Kimble looks forward. Young Guard is 
	handing a petrified sandwich to Prisoner #1. Kimble snaps 
	a look back to Copeland, who palms the shank.

<b>				COPELAND
</b>		Breathe, and you're first.

	Old Guard watches from the open cage door, shotgun 
	carelessly ready.

	Young Guard reaches Kimble and extends a sandwich. Kimble 
	doesn't respond.

<b>				YOUNG GUARD
</b>		Suit yourself.

	He offers the sandwich to Copeland. In the exchange, 
	sandwich drops. Copeland leans down for it.

	Up front, Old Guard yawns again just as...

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Look out!

	Too late... Jackknifing up, Copeland drives the shank into 
	Young Guard's gut.

	Prisoner #2 dives for Young Guard's holster. As the gun comes 
	out, Young Guard gets a hand on it. A SHOT FIRES...

	Jolting Old Guard. He chambers his shotgun. Kimble hits the 
	floor. The Old Guard jams a key into the cage door and surges 
	inside, but...

	Prisoner #1 broadsides Old Guard. SHOTGUN DISCHARGES... 
	Opening a big Gainsburger hole in the driver. He sinks under

	ENGINE DIES. Dusty silence. We don't know up from down.

	On his knees, Old Guard makes his way to the driver. Finds 
	him dead. Now a SOUND. Old Guard whips his shotgun around 
	at...

	Kimble. Rising between the seats.

	A hairy beat. Old Guard might kill him just to finish things 
	off. But a GROAN turns Old Guard's head.

	Young Guard, trying to hold his guts in. Old Guart turns to
	find Kimble.

<b>				OLD GUARD
</b>			(to Kimble)
		You. You're a doctor. C'mere.

	He slides to the Young Guard as the Old Guard scrounges up a 
	medical kit, shoves Kimble down on Young Guard.

<b>				OLD GUARD
</b>		Do something.

	Kimble looks at his cuffs. "In these?" Old Guard digs out 
	his key ring and unlocks Kimble's hands - only his hands. 
	Kimble opens medical kit. It's been ransacked - just 
	Band-Aids now. Kimble looks into the wound.

<b>				KIMBLE

		gets to a hospital. Fast.

<b>				OLD GUARD

	In this delicate moment a SHIVER runs through the bus. Is it

	With other things to worry about, Kimble tries to stop Young 
	Guard's bleeding.

	We see Copeland, alive. The crash has ripped the bars from a 
	back window and shattered the glass. He works to get out the

<b>	BACK TO KIMBLE

	A second SHIVER ripples through the bus, stronger. Kimble 
	retracts his hands to touch a metal panel - and feels a 
	growing vibration.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Just where the hell are we?

	The Old Guard feels it too. He gets down on his knees and
	looks out one of the shattered, barred windows.

	The train light spider-webs across cracked windows. Kimble 
	snatches the keys away from the Guard's trembling hands.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Which one? This? This one?!

	Old Guard gulps a nod. Kimble jams a key in the lock. Throws 
	the door open. Grabs Young Guard.

	SCREECHING death, the TRAIN SKIDS closer.

	For one heartbeat, Kimble remains perched atop the bus.

	The train light X-rays him.

	Kimble leaps. Lands. Rolls. Gains his feet. Tries to sprint 
	away but can't: His feet are still chained. He gets off a 
	dozen mincing steps before...

	IMPACT: A hundred tons of STEEL SLAMS into the bus, 
	splitting it open.

	Shrapnel rips through Kimble's thigh, but he stays on his 
	feet, still running feverish half-steps.

	An EXPLOSION envelops the train. Flames stream down its 
	flanks.

	The train burns past the wounded Guard.

	Kimble looks back, expecting to see the catastrophe behind 
	him. But he gets the shock of his life - of any man's life:

	Still on its wheels, the locomotive is derailing - and coming 
	after him. It's the stuff of nightmares: One little man being 
	chased by a fire-breathing locomotive.

	The train burrows to a stop.

	Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval
	of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that 
	nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices
	something in his hand.

	It's the key-ring.

	Kimble sits and searches the key-ring for manacle key.

	Kimble watches as Copeland quickly unlocks both sets of his 
	own chains.

<b>				COPELAND
</b>		You listen to me. I don't give a 
		damn which way you go, just don't 
		follow me.

	Kimble takes the key as Copeland wraps his chains around his

	Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the 
	scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.

	Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's 
	about to happen.

<b>	ANGLE - OLD GUARD
</b>
	Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his 
	shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG 
	SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote 
	news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the 
	b.g., listening.

<b>				OLD GUARD
</b>		... train was bearin' down on us, 
		fast. I don't know how - it's still 
		kind of hazy - but I grabbed him
		and pushed him out of the bus.

<b>				SHERIFF
</b>		You coulda both been killed.

<b>				OLD GUARD
</b>		I know, but hell, he's my partner.
		Woulda done the same for me.

	The young Sheriff in charge nods, buying the story. Gerard 
	eases forward, displays his badge, interrupts.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Excuse me, Sheriff Rollins? Deputy 
		U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard.

<b>				SHERIFF
</b>			(annoyed)
		I'll be with you in a minute.

	The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields
	his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos 
	of all four prisoners.

<b>				SHERIFF
</b>			(to Old Guard)
		For the record. These three dead. 
		And this one...

	He switches to a photo of Kimble.

<b>				OLD GUARD
</b>		Well, everything happened so fast...
			(bites lip, decides)
		Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.

	Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred 
	prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.

<b>				SHERIFF
</b>		You get some rest.

	He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

<b>				SHERIFF
</b>		Looks like you came a long way for 
		nothing. My men've already done a 
		thorough search from point of 
		impact and found nothing.

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	ANGLE - CULVERT
</b>
	Biggs and Newman stop by the muddy culvert. Biggs sees 
	something. He orders Newman into the muck after it.

<b>	GERARD
</b>
	Aware of media, proceeds patiently with the young Sheriff.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		With all due respect, may I suggest 
		check-points starting at a 15-mile 
		radius on I-57, I-24, Route 13 east 
		of -

<b>				SHERIFF
</b>		Whoa, whoa, whoa... For what? 
		Prisoners are all dead. The only 
		thing check-points will do is get a 
		lot of good people out here frantic 
		and flood my office with calls.

	Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and 
	we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(beat)
		Well, shit, Sheriff, I'd hate for 
		that to happen... So, I'll be 
		taking over the investigation.

<b>				SHERIFF
</b>		On whose authority?

<b>				GERARD
</b>		By authority of the Governor of the 
		State of Illinois and the office of
		the United States Marshal, 5th 
		District Northern Illinois...

	Poole produces State and Federal authorization documents 
	from one of her pockets and hands it to the young Sheriff.

<b>				SHERIFF
</b>			(back-down beat)
		Okay. You want jurisdiction over 
		this mess, you got it.
			(to assistants)
		Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to
		mop up for us.

	He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. 
	Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's 
	manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.

	Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to
	a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Please, ladies and gentlemen, step
		back and give this poor man some 
		room.

	Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a 
	change of story and command.

	Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the 
	Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(friendly, to Old 
			Guard)
		Always an interesting thing when we 
		find leg irons and no legs in them 
		who held the keys, sir?

<b>				OLD GUARD
</b>		Uh, me.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Would you be so kind as to show them
		to me, sir?

	Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

	The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the 
	press hovering just out of earshot.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Second chance.

	Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

	The Old Guard can't take it - points to Kimble's photo.

<b>				OLD GUARD
</b>			(cracking)
		He mighta got out.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				SHERIFF
</b>		What the hell is this? A minute ago 
		you tell me he's part of the 
		wreckage, now you're -

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Renfro - Take that bus apart. I want 
		an accurate body count. Poole - Set 
		up operations right here.

	He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving 
	downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like 
	Israelites behind Moses.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Ladies and gentlemen... our 
		fugitive's been on the run for 
		ninety minutes. Average foot speed 
		over uneven ground - barring injury 
		is approximately four miles an hour, 
		giving us a radius of six miles. I 
		want a hard-target search of any 
		residence, gas station, farmhouse, 
		henhouse, doghouse and outhouse in 
		that area. Check-points go up at 
		15 miles.
			(to media)
		You got that? Good. Now, turn 
		those damn things off and get out 
		of our way.

<b>	INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

	ROARS... just above the treetops. Helicopter speeds up a
	dark river. Its tracking beam illuminates the river bank.

<b>	EXT. RURAL ROADS - NIGHT
</b>
	Flashing lights. Two highway patrol cars set up roadblocks. 
	The SQUAWK of police RADIOS breaks the rural quiet. A moment 
	later a HELICOPTER ROARS overhead.

<b>	EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with 
	blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's 
	going to need stitches.

	Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps 
	moving.

<b>	EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN
</b>
	Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction 
	of the lights.

	A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the 
	road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 
	mile.

<b>	ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM
</b>
	Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he 
	nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. 
	He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison 
	jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his 
	breath.

	Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off 
	the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for 
	cover behind the wrecked car.

	The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front 
	seat and closes the door.

	He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets 
	something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door 
	and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the 
	coveralls missing from the seat.

	As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite
	side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window,
	clutching the coveralls.

<b>	EXT. CRASH SITE - DAWN
</b>
	A crude headquarters is set up beneath a tent, near the 
	crash site. Maps are laid out on tables. Power and phone 
	lines are pulled down from the lines running along the 
	tracks. Renfro supervises the electronics.

	Poole handles phones, takes a report from the field and 
	relays it to Gerard.

<b>				POOLE
</b>		Blood trail found. Two miles

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(to Biggs)
		Type it and match it against all

		Renfro, get an I.D. fax on Kimble to 
		every local hospital.
			(to Newman)
		Newman...

	Newman appears.

<b>				NEWMAN
</b>		Yes, sir...

<b>				GERARD
</b>		I need some coffee.

	As Newman steps off, everyone turns at sound of SHOUTING 
	from the train crash.

	A RESCUE WORKER shouts up to others.

<b>	EXT. RURAL HOSPITAL - LOADING DOCK - MORNING

	Loading dock outside the E.R. A WORKER stacks boxes of food

	operator's coveralls, picks up a box and carries it inside. 
	Once inside he branches off down a hallway.

<b>	INT. RURAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - MORNING

	A door opens on a long hallway. A DOCTOR, CHILD with a

	Kimble, clean-shaven, and wearing the patient's glasses and

	E.R. admissions desk with his newly received fax, and starts 
	down the corridor toward Kimble.

	The Trooper looks up as the two men pass...

<b>				TROOPER
</b>		'Scuse me, Doc?...

	Kimble turns but continues slowly backing toward the E.R. 
	doors behind him.

<b>				TROOPER
</b>		... Don't know if you heard or not

		prisoner from that bus train wreck 
		'couple hours ago. Thought he might 
		show up here if he was hurt.

	The Trooper looks down at his fact sheet as we see a slow 
	trickle of blood from a shaving nick begin winding down 
	Kimble's cheek.

<b>				TROOPER
</b>			(from fax sheet)
		Approximately six one, 180 pounds, 
		brown hair, brown eyes and beard.

	At the last second Kimble feels the drop of blood and wipes 
	it clean as the Trooper looks up.

</b>		Every time I look in the mirror ...

<b>				PARAMEDIC #2
</b>		Thanks, Doc, we had to dig him out

	As the gurney comes out, Kimble looks right into the face 
	of the Young Guard. The Guard's eyes suddenly open wide.

</b>		It's him... It's -

	Kimble claps the portable oxygen mask back over the Young 
	Guard's mouth and keeps his hand there.

<b>				KIMBLE

	The Paramedics move him toward the ramp.

<b>				PARAMEDIC #1
</b>		He's pretty bad off. Broken leg,

	The cars in front slow as the railroad crossing signal

	Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the

	straight ahead.

	Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit

	Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, 
	lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets 
	there first.

	It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand 
	flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I didn't kill my wife.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		So, you didn't kill your wife.

	Not my problem.

	An adrenal beat. For a moment they hold a look. Then the 
	silence is broken by Gerard's radio.

<b>				BIGGS (V.O.)

	Gerard looks for his radio, then back at Kimble - he's gone.

	Instantly Gerard reaches for his ankle - and pulls a back-up

	Kimble sticks Gerard's gun into his waist band to balance

	stops.

<b>	KIMBLE'S POV

	Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Turn around, hands over your head. 
		And get down on the ground.

	For a moment Kimble eyes Gerard.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Your choice, Kimble...

	Kimble turns his back on the Marshals, stares again at the 
	water. Slowly he puts his hands over his head. Gerard puts 
	up his gun and pulls his handcuffs. He moves through the 
	water toward Kimble.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Get down on your knees.

	Kimble bends slowly, stares down into the falls, hears the 
	footsteps get closer, then does the unthinkable. He jumps.

<b>	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - DAY
</b>
	Biggs moving to the top of the massive dam sees Kimble leap 
	into the sheet of water spilling over dam and disappear into 
	the mists below. He can't believe his eyes.

<b>	INT. DRAINAGE CONDUIT - DAY
</b>
	Renfro lowers his gun.

<b>				RENFRO
</b>			(amazed)
		Son of a bitch...

	It's the most amazing thing he's ever seen...

<b>	ON GERARD
</b>
	He stands at the mouth of the tunnel staring down. He 
	stares down into the mists. Impressed. It has told him 
	something invaluable about this fugitive.

<b>	EXT. TOP OF DAM - DAY
</b>
	Gerard scrambles out of the tunnels to the top of the dam 
	near Biggs, just as squad cars, troopers and the search 
	helicopter converge on the site.

<b>	EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY
</b>
	Far downriver a figure fights through a snag in the bend.

	The snag - a tree branch - breaks away and heads down 
	stream. Hanging onto the branch we see Kimble.

<b>	EXT. BARKLEY DAM - LOWER RESERVOIR - SUNSET
</b>
	Below the dam and spillway. Troopers in waders search the 
	shallows, deputies beat bushes along the shore.

	Farther out we see a dredge boat slowly working the waters.

<b>	FROM SHORE
</b>
	Gerard watches the dredge cage come up again. As if with 
	the next pass it will prove him the victor. The HEAD 
	ILLINOIS TROOPER CAPTAIN approaches.

<b>				HEAD TROOPER
</b>		Running out of daylight, Inspector.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Lights and generators are coming, 
		Captain.

<b>				HEAD TROOPER
</b>		Look, I don't mean to tell you your 
		job, but maybe one person in a 
		million could've survived that fall.
		The guy's fish food.

	Gerard turns and brings his look to bear on the Captain.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Then find me the fish that ate him.

	He turns and heads to a waiting helicopter.

<b>	EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON
</b>
	Kimble runs through the woods. He staggers, his arm hooks a 
	sapling which spins him to the ground. He lays motionless, 
	exhausted.

<b>	KIMBLE'S DREAM - INT. KIMBLE'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
<b>	ANGLE
</b>
	Helen in bed. Kimble's hand comes INTO FRAME and touches 
	her shoulder. She turns toward Kimble as he moves INTO 
	FRAME and kisses her.

<b>	DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	ANGLE
</b>
	Helen tosses her head back. She wears white silk pajamas 
	and smiles down AT us. A hand reaches up and unbuttons the 
	top two buttons of her top. Then Kimble moves up INTO FRAME 
	as we -

<b>	INT. KIMBLE'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
	Helen exiting Kimble's car the night of the murder. She 
	looks back at Kimble, framed by the door frame, ant smiles.

<b>				HELEN
</b>		Good-bye. I love you.

	Again... Then again... then:

<b>	HARD CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. FOREST - MORNING
</b>
	Kimble comes out of his sleep with a start. Shivering. He 
	remembers where he is. His breathing returns to normal.

<b>	EXT. TRESTLE - TUNNEL - MORNING
</b>
	Kimble moves across a river trestle and disappears into 
	tunnel.

<b>	INT. DRUG STORE - DAY
</b>
	Kimble on pay phone in the rear of the store waits for 
	party 
	to answer. An old lady and her mother shop.

	Across the store a pharmacist watches Kimble.

<b>	ANGLE - PHONE
</b>
	Kimbles watches the boys as he waits for answer. We hear 
	RINGING, then a receptionist answers:

<b>				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
</b>		The law offices of Gutherie, Morgan 
		and Wainwright.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Walter Gutherie please.

<b>				RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
</b>		I'm sorry, Mr. Gutherie has left 
		for the day, would you like his 
		voice mail?

	Kimble hangs up and moves down an aisle, stopping in front 
	of the hair color. He takes a box of black hair dye off the 
	shelf and looks at the instructions. When he looks up he 
	sees the pharmacist looking at him.

<b>	EXT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT
</b>
	A roadside diner. Kimble, his hair now black, and wearing a 
	new pair of Wranglers, hooded sweatshirt and a duffle coat, 
	moves down the road to the diner.

<b>	INT. SONNY'S DINER - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble enters. He sits at the counter and a sparky OLDER 
	WAITRESS, late, mid-forties, with strong good looks and 
	tough smile fills his coffee cup before he even asks.

<b>				OLDER WAITRESS
</b>		Need to look at the menu?

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Some soup, please.

<b>				OLDER WAITRESS
</b>		Good choice.

	She marks her pad and leaves. Sights ant sounds around 
	Kimble begins to occupy his attention:

	A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He 
	stares at him.

	A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks 
	away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is 
	he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.

	Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him 
	his soup. Where's the first waitress?

	Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he 
	sees:

	The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she 
	going to report him? He fights the paranoia.

	A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

<b>	ANGLE - TV
</b>
	A report on the escape. A television reporter describes the 
	chase for Kimble; his jump at the dam and his presumed death 
	from the fall.

	Kimble decides it's time to leave. He drops some money on 
	the counter and exits.

<b>	EXT. DINER - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble moves across the parking lot trying not to run until 
	he's out of sight of the diner. Once free of the lights of 
	the diner he starts running and disappears into the night.

<b>	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both 
	sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly 
	hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves 
	faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to 
	a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the 
	inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him 
	chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble 
	looks at himself. He's shaking.

	A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next 
	to him, passenger window rolls down...

<b>				OLDER WAITRESS
</b>		Need a ride?

	Kimble stares at her.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Which way are you going?

	She smiles and points in the direction her car is traveling. 
	They hold a look as we hear:

<b>				RENFRO (V.O.)
</b>		We feel confident about the I.D.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. HOUSE - DAWN
</b>
	A quiet house on a quiet street out from town. A homeless 
	woman picks through garbage. A garbage truck moves slowly 
	down the street. A plumbing truck parked along a curb. Just 
	early morning traffic.

	We see Renfro and Newman watch the house from across the 
	street, behind a deserted house. Gerard joins them. We see 
	that Biggs is in the plumbing truck. Poole is the homeless 
	woman picking through the garbage. Newman hands Gerard a 
	radio.

<b>				RENFRO
</b>		Local officials were about to wet 
		their pants to move in.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		I bet they were.
			(to radio)
		Where's the woman?

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	BIGGS
</b>
	In the plumbing truck. He triggers his mike.

<b>				RENFRO

		Same room.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(into radio)
		Okay... I'll take front. Biggs and 
		Renfro, rear. Poole, handle support. 
		I don't want anyone hurt. Stay 
		outside unless called. Radios on 
		three.

	The deputies prepare their weapons. Newman checks his 
	service issue .38, stares at Gerard's Glock.

<b>				NEWMAN
</b>		Uh, just want me to wait here, sir?

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Hell, no. You're with me, Newman. 
		Let's go.

<b>	EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAWN
</b>
	DOOR CRASHES open, splintering the deadbolt right out of 
	the door.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		U.S. Marshals. Down! Down!

<b>	INT. HOUSE - DAWN
</b>
	Textbook perfect, Gerard and Newman rush into front room.

<b>	THEIR POV
</b>
	Down the hall a man's figure streaks across a doorway OUT 
<b>	OF VIEW.
</b>
	A woman in the rear of the house BEGINS SCREAMING.

<b>	GERARD
</b>
	Motions Newman to the left to check the door off the living 
	room while he moves down the main hall into the back 
	bedroom.

<b>	ANGLE - LIVING ROOM / NEWMAN
</b>
	Clearly unnerved by the screaming woman, Newman opens door 
	off the living room. The door opens into a smaller bedroom. 
	He steps into -

<b>	SMALLER BEDROOM
</b>
	It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to 
	the bedroom.

<b>	HALLWAY
</b>
	Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and 
	continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the 
	woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move 
	silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman 
	opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward 
	the doorway to the kitchen.

	Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. 
	He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty.
	Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	SMALLER BEDROOM
</b>
	Newman looks around, suddenly scared. The only place he 
	didn't search was behind the bedroom door. He turns just as:

<b>	COPELAND
</b>
	Surges out, knocks Newman's gun from his hand. In a flash, 
	Copeland yanks Newman's arm behind his back and presses a 
	knife against the deputy's neck and moves him out of the 
	room.

	We...

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	GERARD
</b>
	He hears Copeland moving somewhere in the front of the house.

<b>				COPELAND (O.S.)
</b>		I got your man! Now I want outta 
		here!

	Gerard moves back through the bedroom past the SCREAMING 
	woman. He locks in on the voice and sound of the moving 
	fugitive.

<b>	ON COPELAND AND NEWMAN
</b>
	Copeland listens but gets no response from Gerard. He backs 
	through the second bedroom door, pulling Newman into the -

<b>	LIVING ROOM
</b>
	Newman's eyes are pure terror - the blade pressed against 
	his throat.

<b>				COPELAND
</b>			(to Gerard)
		You hear me? I said, I want out or 
		I'll cut your man's throat!

<b>	GERARD
</b>
	Keeps moving down the hallway, through first bedroom, pauses 
	at door to the second bedroom and chooses his course.

<b>	LIVING ROOM
</b>
	Copeland positions himself between the bedroom door and the 
	hallway opening. He's troubled he can't hear Gerard.

	Suddenly he hears a NOISE behind him at the bedroom door He 
	whips Newman around and we see:

	A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too 
	late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

	He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. 
	The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, 
	stunned but unhurt.

	Gerard now turns to the screaming woman behind him in the 
	bedroom doorway.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Shut up.

	She does. Immediately.

<b>	EXT. HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
	As coroners and tactical police mop up. Gerard moves across 
	the yard, sips coffee from Styrofoam cup. He stops at a 
	sheriff's car, Newman sits on back seat, shaken, nearly 
	hysterical, clutching his ear.

<b>				NEWMAN
</b>		My ear... I can't hear a thing out 
		of it. I can't believe you did that!

<b>				GERARD
</b>		You think I should have bargained 
		with him, don't you?

<b>				NEWMAN
</b>		Yes. You could've missed! You 
		could've killed me!

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Yeah, you're absolutely right. I 
		could've.

	They hold a look.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		How bad's your ear?

<b>				NEWMAN
</b>		Terrible. I probably have permanent 
		hearing damage.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Let me see it.

	Newman leans toward him. Gerard speaks into his ear.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		I don't bargain.

	Gerard leaves. Newman watches him - realizing what a truly 
	unsettling man Gerard is.

<b>	EXT. CHICAGO PAY PHONE - MORNING
</b>
	Kimble makes call. While he waits for phone to be answered 
	TRAINS COME and GO in the b.g. An EL CROSSES OVERHEAD. The 
	BELLS of Chicago River DRAWBRIDGE.

<b>				KIMBLE

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:

	Walter Gutherie answers phone from his office overlooking 
	Lake Michigan.

<b>				GUTHERIE

		Running only makes you look guilty.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I wasn't worrying about appearances, 
		Walter.
<b>	
</b><b>				GUTHERIE
</b>		Tell me where you are. I'll come
		meet you so you can turn yourself 
		in .

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I'm not turning myself in. I need 
		money.

	Gutherie is silent. When he speaks again his speech takes on 
	the lawyerly tone of a man who's covering his own bases.

<b>				GUTHERIE
</b>		Richard. You're asking me to harbor
		and aid a convicted felon... I can't
		help you that way. My advice - both 
		as a friend and as your legal counsel 
		- is for you to give yourself up. 
		Now tell me... where are you?

	Kimble picks up the change in his attorney's tone.

<b>				KIMBLE

</b>		Give me an address. I'll be -

	CLICK. Gutherie hears the LINE GO DEAD. Kimble's gone.

<b>	EXT. DOWNTOWN - DAY

	his next move. Then seeing bank clock flash the time: 9:30 -
	he knows what that move is.

<b>	INT. NORTH BANK TENNIS CLUB - DAY
</b>
	An upscale mid-town tennis club. Behind glass windows of 
	the entryway we see tennis courts. From the courts comes Dr. 
	Charles Nichols still dressed in his warmups, carrying his 
	tennis bag. A friendly DESK ATTENDANT Sharon) smiles as he 
	goes by.

<b>				DESK ATTENDANT
</b>		See you tomorrow, Dr. Nichols?

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		Creature of habit, Sharon.

<b>	EXT. NORTH BANK CLUB - DAY

<b>	INT. / EXT. NICHOLS'S CAR - DAY
</b>
	As he pulls up to the first stoplight, a homeless man moves 
	toward the driver's side and begins washing his windshield. 
	Nichols waves the man off.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		Not today, please.

	The man shuffles off. Just then a second man appears at his 
	passenger window. He leans down to wave him away

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		No. Not -

	... then stops - the face at his passenger window is 
	Richard Kimble's.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>			(stunned)
		Oh, my God... Richard...

	Nichols rolls down the passenger window.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		How're you doing, Charlie?

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		You're alive...

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Yeah. And I need your help.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		Anything.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I need some money. Whatever you've 
		got on you.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		Of course.
<b>	
</b>	Nichols reaches into his gym bag in the backseat and digs 
	for his wallet...

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		Tell me where you're staying. I'll 
		get you more money. Some clothes. 
		Just give me an address...

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I'll call you.

	Kimble glances around, the area is still clear. He looks 
	back into the car and doesn't see the police car turn the 
	corner and come up the street behind them.

	Nichols finds his wallet ant hands all the cash he's got to 
	Kimble, who quickly pockets it.

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		I know why you came back - to find 
		him. If I can help, call me... 
		Call me.

	They hold a look. The stoplight changes to green but they 
	don't see it.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		Thanks, Charlie...

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		Here, Richard, take my coat...

	He reaches into the back for his coat, suddenly police car 
	behind him POPS its SIREN. Nichols looks into his rearview 
	mirror. Sees a COP lean out his window.

<b>				COP
</b>			(to Nichols)
		Hey, buddy - green light. Let's go.

	Nichols looks back at Kimble. He's gone.

<b>	INT. U.S. MARSHAL'S OFFICES (CHICAGO) - CLOSE ON AUDIO TAPE - DAY

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Call them back. Tell them you've 
		made a mistake.

<b>				POOLE
</b>		What?

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(to Renfro)
		Stop it there.

	Renfro hits play. Kimble's VOICE is heard again:

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Drop the voices.

	Renfro removes the two voices. What comes up are the 
<b>	BACKGROUND SOUNDS. EXTERIOR NOISES (BELLS RINGING, TRAFFIC, 
</b>	MECHANICAL... TRAINS). Everyone becomes focused to the 
	sounds now.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(he's heard something)
		Listen.

<b>				BIGGS
</b>		Trains? Traffic?

<b>				GERARD
</b>		More... there's a voice in the 
		background.

	At first the sound is unrecognizable. A BELL. GRINDING 
	MECHANICAL. Then a P.A. VOICE on the tape: "Next stop 
	Merchandise Mart."

<b>				RENFRO
</b>		That's an El announcement.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		And there's no E1 in St. Louis. 
		Ladies and gentlemen, Richard Kimble
		is in Chicago. Poole, get his

		C.P.D. check the shelters... Biggs, 
		bring in the detectives that handled

	Instantly the room is in movement.

<b>				STEVENS

	Stevens stops.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		They don't know he's alive and as 
		far as Kimble knows we don't either. 
		I want to keep it that way as long 
		as we can. Are we clear?

	The whole group sense Gerard's intensity in regard to 
	Kimble.

<b>				RENFRO
</b>			(for the group)
		Perfectly.

	Gerard reflects on a moment of personal satisfaction.

	bags around the room. Plastic covers the remaining pieces 
	of furniture.

	Gerard stares at the empty walls. Shadows on the walls show

	looks up like someone's bitten him. He, Biggs and Gerard are 
	in Nichols' administrative office. Gleaming. Filled with

	hangs up his lab coat and slips back into his suitcoat. He 
	shows no sign of nervousness.

	Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets

	making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable 
	attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking 
	for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.

	Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it 
	on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and
	covers his face.

	Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the 
	Prosthetic Clinic material.

	Kimble moves instinctively to the back door.

	He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees 
	the back courtyard covered by more cops.

	Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, 
	he's sweating, preparing for the worst.

	He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of 
	charging through the basement door they move up the front 
	steps and into the house overhead.

	Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

</b>		Hey, take this one up the hall to

	Kimble nods. Anne moves to another patient.

	Kimble grabs the kid's gurney and begins wheeling it up the

	Biggs and Gerard wait for the elevator. Finally Gerard's

	Kimble descending. Doors open and close throughout the

	Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims 
	shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down.

	Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.

	One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the 
	shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the 
	stairwell railing to spy...

	Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be 
	any dark-haired man. But still...

<b>				GERARD
</b>		(a quick probe)
		Kimble.

	Others look up out of curiosity... but not Kimble. Two 
	landings below, he falters a step, then tries to regain 
	his step, keeps moving.

	But Gerard is pulling his Glock: The hitch in Kimble's 
	stride told him everything.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Kimble!

	Kimble blitzes down the stairs. Gerard moves after him.

	Kimble throws open a fire door and starts across the lobby. 
	Sees two cops, quickly approaches.

	The two cops rush to stairs and Kimble immediately moves
	toward the doors, fast but not running. Hoping to cloak 
	himself in civilians.

	Kimble closing in on the door when suddenly a KLAXON HORN

	People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors

	Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.

</b>		Kimble. Stop!

	But there's only one way of stopping Kimble.

</b>
	Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the 
	outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble 
	is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door 
	- trapping him partially inside the revolving door.

	Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees 
	Gerard.

	Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - 
	but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd,
	shoves a man out of his line of fire.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Down. down. everybody down!

	With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the 
	opening...

	... and makes it outside - except for his foot - caught like 
	in a bear trap, as the door locks down. Harrowed, Kimble looks
	back over his shoulder at...

	Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and 
	clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Kimble. Stop!

	It's Kimble's nightmare coming true. If he could chew off his 
	leg right now, he would. He pulls at his foot just as

	Gerard FIRES seven times in two seconds.

	Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A 
	long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with 
	bullet holes, he sees...

	Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's 
	alive. He runs free.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Open the doors!

	Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the 
	glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. 
	It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble 
	rush across the street and disappear into the parade.

	Doors open and Gerard and his men follow.

	He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus 
	shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car 
	parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans 
	across the seat and opens the door for him.

	He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, 
	he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a

</b>		Half the people in the study were

		come into the study with bad livers?

<b>				WAHLUND
</b>		The one on the right is one of the 
		samples you sent me. It shows a lot 
		of perriportal inflammation loaded 
		with eosinophils. When you see that 
		with the accumulation of bile it's 
		a classic for -

</b>		- drug induced hepatitis.

<b>				WAHLUND
</b>		I'm impressed. Now look at this.

	She positions a second slide.

</b>		According to the study, this is a

	Kimble studies the slide. The tissue difference is markedly 
	different, clearer.

</b>		Cold normal.

</b>		Oh, last summer sometime. August...

	Kimble looks up from the protocol report.

</b>		Because a good third of the samples 
		Lentz approved were signed after he

	Kathy comes to look at the report. Lentz's signature is

	aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and 
	almost smiles.

	For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the 
	gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. 
	Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, 
	driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost 
	unconscious.

	Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit 
	Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead.

	Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the

	off the floor.

</b>
<b>	INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	A room lined with security monitors. Two security personnel 
	sit in front of their console. Newman stands behind them.

	On screen: We see Kimble moving down the stairs toward 
	Nichols, who pulls himself to his feet.

	Newman stands in front of the screen, talks to his radio.

<b>				NEWMAN
</b>			(to radio)
		I've got Kimble on the roof with 
		Nichols. Southeast exit.

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
	Gerard and deputies Poole, Biggs, and Renfro around him.

<b>				BIGGS
</b>			(to radio)
		Keep and eye on him. Biggs has roof plans.

<b>				BIGGS
</b>		There are four exits to the roof.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		I want them covered.

<b>	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT
</b>
	Nichols rises to his feet, swings, but Kimble blocks the 
	blow and lands another that sends Nichols down another 
	set of stairs to the roof.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		You took everything away from me... 
		for money.

<b>	INT. BALLROOM ELEVATORS - NIGHT
</b>
	Gerard and the marshals reach the ballroom floor. The 
	elevator doors open to a flood of confused and disoriented 
	doctors trying to escape. The marshals wade through, meet 
	up with two hotel security guards.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		This way.

<b>	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble pulls Nichols to his feet. They are silhouetted by 
	the lights of the city skyline.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I want to know, Charlie... was it 
		worth it...?

<b>				NICHOLS
</b>		This thing is bigger than even you 
		think, Richard. You can't stop it.

	He hits Nichols again with tremendous force, knocking him 
	against the parapet. Nichols stares over the edge - the 
	street appears far below.

<b>	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Gerard and his deputies work their way into the ballroom. 
	The deputies move to separate areas. Several doctors point 
	them in the direction Kimble and Nichols fled.

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT
</b>
	Newman stands in front the security monitors and watches 
	Kimble and Nichols on the roof.

<b>	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble reaches Nichols and draws to hit him again as the 
	HELICOPTER suddenly ROARS over the rooftop. Its beam hits 
	the two men and a VOICE booms from the helicopter:

<b>				VOICE FROM HELICOPTER (V.O.)
</b>		Chicago police. Freeze.

	In the instant of shock, Nichols knees Kimble and bolts.

<b>	INTERCUT:
</b>
<b>	INT. HALLWAY / HOSPITALITY SUITE - NIGHT
</b>
	Gerard moves down connecting hallway where a couple of 
	concerned doctors are trying to open the door to the 
	hospitality suite.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(to doctors)
		Clear the hallway.
			(to security)
		Get that door open.

	The door opens and Gerard moves quickly through the 
	hospitality suite for the rooftop.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(to security)
		Stay at this door.

	He moves through the door to the roof alone.

<b>	INT. HOTEL SECURITY - NIGHT
</b>
	Newman watching the security monitors sees Kimble and 
	Nichols. On another monitor we see Gerard exit the suite.

<b>	EXT. ROOF - NIGHT
</b>
	Nichols runs.

	Kimble recovers, sees Gerard moving down the fire escape 
	toward him, and Nichols escaping. He goes after Nichols.

	The helicopter circles back over the roof, illuminating the 
	rooftop in its million-candle-power beam.

<b>				HELICOPTER PILOT (V.O.)
</b>		I've got a visual on Kimble. He's 
		running.

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
	Kelly listens on his ratio.

<b>				KELLY
</b>		Bring him down.

<b>	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble chases Nichols down the roof as BULLETS from the 
	helicopter rip into the air conditioning duct next to Kimble.

	The helicopter swings out to keep Kimble in sight.

<b>	ON GERARD
</b>
	Gerard hits the bottom of the fire escape and follows.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(to radio)
		This is a United States Marshal. 
		Get that helicopter out of here!

<b>	ANGLE - NICHOLS
</b>
	He moves away among the duct work.

	Kimble follows.

	Gerard continues after Kimble.

	The helicopter circles and follows from above.

<b>	INT. PENTHOUSE / DOOR TO ROOF - NIGHT
</b>
	Renfro triggers his radio.

<b>				RENFRO
</b>		There is a U.S. Marshal out there. 
		Hold your fire!

<b>	HELICOPTER'S POV
</b>
	FOLLOWING Kimble. Its beam tracking Kimble across the 
	rooftop. He moves through the blowers and duct work. 
	Kimble is gaining ground on Nichols.

<b>	ON SHARPSHOOTER
</b>
	He is about to fire when he hears through his radio.

<b>				RADIO (V.O.)
</b>		Hold your fire.

	The shooter pulls back.

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
	Gerard rushes across the roof toward Kimble.

<b>	ANGLE - NICHOLS
</b>
	He is almost to the end of the roof when Kimble tackles 
	him. The two men crash against sloped glass roof of an 
	elevator housing.

<b>	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</b>
	Inside the shaft - an elevator moves toward the roof. It 
	stops on the floor ten feet below the roof. THROUGH the 
	glass roof we see the doors open.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. ROOFTOP - GERARD - NIGHT
</b>
	Charges toward -

<b>	KIMBLE
</b>
	Who slams Nichols hard against the glass. The WIRED 
	GLASS CRACKS and bellies with the form of their bodies.

	Nichols' head rocks from the impact.

	The GLASS GROANS. The wire stresses. The caulking begins 
	to drop.

	Nichols struggles but Kimble has him in control. Slams 
	him down hard again.

<b>	HELICOPTER
</b>
	Circles, illuminates the struggle in its spotlight and 
	Gerard closing.

<b>	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</b>
	The elevator doors close and the car beneath the 
	skylight begins to descend.

<b>	GERARD
</b>
	Pulls up.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Kimble!

	Kimble slams Nichols one more time against the glass 
	and the wire holding the glass gives way, sending Kimble 
	and Nichols into...

<b>	INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble and Nichols, locked together, fall down the shaft 
	and crash onto the roof of the descending elevator car. 
	Nichols crashes through the ceiling into the car. Kimble 
	hits and slides across the roof to the edge, stopping 
	himself, just before he falls into the shaft. An 
	elevator car rushes toward him out of the blackness.

<b>	EXT. HOTEL ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</b>
	Gerard reaches the elevator housing, looks down into the 
	shaft.

<b>	GERARD'S POV
</b>
	Kimble's car disappears into the darkness.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. ELEVATOR CAR - NIGHT
</b>
	Nichols pulls himself to his feet. Hits the emergency 
	stop and the doors open. He disappears into...

<b>	INT. HILTON LAUNDRY - NIGHT
</b>
	... a huge industrial laundry room. Steam rises from the 
	giant machines.

<b>	INT. ELEVATOR CAR/LAUNDRY - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble drops from the ceiling into the car and moves 
	carefully into the laundry.

	... like an industrial jungle. Dimly lit, filled with 
	DEAFENING MACHINERY. Five hundred pound bags of laundry 
	move from a network of ceiling tracks to a pair of 
	heavyduty conveyor belts and two thirty-foot long washers.

	... At the other end of the washers, hydraulic presses 
	stamp out three-foot diameter "cakes" which are moved by 
	conveyor and dollies to automated dryers.

	The NOISE is DEAFENING.

<b>	INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</b>
	Gerard comes down back stairwell. Followed by Renfro.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(to radio)
		Where did the elevator stop?

<b>	INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>	NEWMAN IN SECURITY
</b>
	Newman checks the computer board for the elevator 
	position.

<b>				NEWMAN
</b>			(to radio)
		Level five.

<b>	INT. LAUNDRY - NIGHT
</b>
	Nichols pushes through the hanging laundry bags toward an 
	exit, tries the door. It is secured with a collapsible 
	grating with a padlock. He looks up, keeps moving.

<b>	KIMBLE
</b>
	Notices the swinging bags, follows Nichols' trail. He 
	stops to get his bearings, sees shadow at the far end of 
	the room between the two washers. Kimble closes in, moving 
	between the large conveyors.

<b>	ANGLE - SORTING ROOM
</b>
	Gerard enters sorting room with Renfro. He sees two sorters 
	standing by a small conveyor as he enters.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Get out of here.

	He and Renfro move around the corner where a laundry 
	worker is hooking a 500 lb bag of lines onto the overhead 
	rail. A hydraulic lift, operated by a hanging on/off 
	switch raises the bag on a yellow steel I-beam. The worker 
	takes one look at Gerard and abandons his station.

	Gerard, Biggs and Renfro move to the closed doors of the 
	main room.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(to Renfro)
		We're going in. Give me five 
		minutes. Keep C.P.D. out.

	He draws his Glock, opens the door and enters the main 
	room.

<b>	INT. LAUNDRY - ON KIMBLE - NIGHT
</b>
	He moves to end of washers, using the machines as cover.

	He sees the shadow again takes a pole leaning against the 
	dryer as a weapon, turns the corner and is about to belt 
	him when he realizes it's not Nichols, but a laundry worker.

	Kimble moves away from the terrified man, when he hears a 
	voice from the other end of the laundry.

<b>				GERARD (V.O.)
</b>			(above the din)
		Kimble!

	Kimble reacts to Gerard's voice, moves away.

<b>	ON NICHOLS
</b>
	Moving behind machinery, sees light at far end of the room 
	where Gerard enters.

<b>	ON GERARD
</b>
	The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.

	They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves 
	up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both 
	move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated 
	equipment.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		... There is no way out of here.

	The building is locked down.

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	KIMBLE
</b>
	Moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near 
	the conveyor belts.

<b>				GERARD (O.S.)
</b>		Kimble... I know about Nichols. I 
		know about Sykes. Kimble stops.

<b>	ON GERARD
</b>
<b>				GERARD
</b>		... Nichols borrowed your car the 
		night of the murder and called 
		Sykes from it.

<b>	RENFRO
</b>
	Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag 
	comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins, 
	dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.

<b>	KIMBLE
</b>
	Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with 
	Nichols.

<b>	GERARD
</b>
	Moving through the forest of massive bags.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		... That's why there was no forced 
		entry at your house. He'd used your 
		keys.

<b>	KIMBLE 
</b>
	Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.

<b>	NICHOLS
</b>
	Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the 
	killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and 
	chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the 
	hanging control for the I-beam.

<b>	GERARD
</b>
	Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He 
	dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can 
	see straight back toward the washers. 

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Kimble... Come meet me out here.

<b>	ON RENFRO
</b>
	He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks 
	under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a 
	WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes 
	rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, 
	opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.

<b>	NICHOLS
</b>
	Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty 
	shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand. 
	Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.

<b>	GERARD
</b>
	Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor 
	belts. He makes one last appeal.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		It's time to quit running... if you 
		don't, you know I'll stop you. He 
		listens, there is no answer.

<b>	KIMBLE
</b>
	Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His 
	shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.

<b>	GERARD
</b>
	Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He 
	pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back 
	on us...

<b>	NICHOLS
</b>
	Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just 
	before he fires however he hears...

<b>				KIMBLE (O.S.)
</b>		Hey, Chuckles...

	Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick 
	and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor 
	behind Gerard.

<b>	GERARD
</b>
	Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble 
	with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes 
	instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.

	Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.

	They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the 
	room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him.

<b>	INT. / EXT. HILTON HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)
</b>
	Chicago Police hold back crowds of onlookers on Michigan 
	Avenue. Police cars and vans, television news trucks vie 
	for space in front of the Hilton Towers.

	Dr. Charles Nichols, on a stretcher, loaded into an 
	ambulance. The doors close.

	REPORTERS and television cameramen line the sidewalk 
	giving reports and interviewing doctors from the ballroom. 
	We PICK UP pieces of their reports as we MOVE PAST them 
	TOWARD the entrance.

<b>				T.V. NEWS REPORTER
</b>		... As we reported a few minutes 
		ago, the saga of once-prominent 
		Chicago surgeon, Dr. Richard Kimble, 
		who escaped from an Illinois 
		Corrections bus, took a strange
		twist this evening when Dr. Kimble 
		was captured at the Chicago Hilton...

	ANOTHER REPORTER continues:

<b>				ANOTHER REPORTER
</b>		... there are unconfirmed reports 
		from police of new evidence which 
		may exonerate Kimble while 
		implicating some of the biggest 
		names in medicine...

	The doors to the police van close amid a flurry of 
	photographs.

	A third reporter interviews a STUNNED DOCTOR from the 
	ballroom:

<b>				STUNNED DOCTOR
</b>		He just walked in... We didn't know 
		what he was going to do. My wife 
		was very frightened... The next 
		thing I knew cops were charging in 
		and...

<b>	CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	INT. HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
	Kimble, in handcuffs, is escorted by Biggs, Newman, Poole 
	and Gerard, out of the hotel into the waiting chaos. 
	Renfro, his head bandaged, is helped by paramedics.

<b>	EXT. HOTEL / INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
	As soon as the group exits the hotel. Television lights 
	flood the scene. Kimble lowers his head. Reporters crowd 
	forward, yelling questions.

<b>				REPORTER
</b>		Dr. Kimble, is it true you can prove 
		your innocence!

	Gerard wants the crowd controlled.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(to police)
		Get them back.

	The marshals ant cops clear a line for Kimble to get into 
	a waiting car away from the media. Biggs opens the back 
	door and helps Kimble inside.

<b>				BIGGS
</b>		Watch your head, Dr. Kimble.

	Newman climbs in behind the wheel. Gerard in the back next 
	to Kimble. He leans out the window and motions to Poole.

<b>				GERARD
</b>			(to Poole)
		Poole, you got that thing?
			(to Kimble)
		Give me your hands.

	Kimble pauses, then holds up his wrists and Gerard unlocks 
	Kimble's handcuffs.

	Poole hands an ice-pack over the seat. Gerard places the 
	pack on Kimble' 9 bruised and battered hands.

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Take care of those hands, Doc, 
		you're going to need them again 
		soon.

<b>				KIMBLE
</b>		I thought you told me 'you didn't 
		care.'

<b>				GERARD
</b>		Yeah, well, don't spread it around.

	They share a look of mutual respect as the car pulls away.

<b>	HELICOPTER POV
</b>
	The car carrying Kimble pulls onto Michigan Avenue heading 
	back downtown. As we PULL BACK we see Kimble's car - at 
	first alone on the great avenue - then gradually joined 
	by other cars until finally becoming integrated in the 
	traffic, movement and lights of the city.
