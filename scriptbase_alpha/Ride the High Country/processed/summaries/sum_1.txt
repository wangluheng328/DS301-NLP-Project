The world is changing and for an old lawman like Steve Judd, there aren't many opportunities left for him.
He accepts to work for a bank protecting gold shipments that are coming from a new gold find 2 or 3 days ride away.
He's pleased when he runs into an old friend, Gil Westrum and soon hires him and his sidekick to help him out.
Along the way they meet Elsa Knudsen, a young woman who lives alone with her strict and demanding father.
One of the miners has asked her to marry him and after an argument with her father, joins Judd but she's not quite prepared for his several brothers, all of whom expect to share her.
As for Westrum, he is embittered with life and has his own plans for the gold they are supposed to protect.
