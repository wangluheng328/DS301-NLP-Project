In New York, the former executive and presently owner of a pet shop Zoe has no boy-friend and only a couple of friends since she has difficulties to let people into her life.
She lost her parents when she was a child and her only relative alive is her grandmother that lives in a nursing home and Zoe feeling lonely.
She decides on artificial insemination to have a baby and to join a supporting group of single mothers.
When she leaves the clinic very happy with the successful procedure, she meets the cheese manufacturer and college student Stan and they immediately feel attracted for each other.
They date and Zoe believes she has found the prince charming and changes her expectation with the insemination.
However the doctor finds that she is pregnant and now she has a dilema; how to tell Stan that she is pregnant.
