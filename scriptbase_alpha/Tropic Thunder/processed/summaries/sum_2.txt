Sgt.
Fourleaf Tayback is the author of the international best seller "Tropic Thunder" detailing his accounts of the Vietnam War.
Now that book has been turned into a movie.
Directed by first time director Damian Cockburn, the film stars veteran action hero Tug Speedman, multi - character comedy actor Jeff Portnoy, star of the "Fatties Fart II" (more famous for his off camera drug addiction arrests than his acting), and three time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus (famous for his total immersion style of acting) - fresh off his most recent Cannes film festival smash.
Rounding out the cast is character actor Kevin Sandusky and rapper Alpa Chino, who in his spare time, hawks an energy drink known as "Booty Sweat".
When filming the movie's climactic scene goes horribly awry with a pyromaniac blowing up the Vietnamese jungle side off camera, the film's director, with convincing from executive producer Les Grossman, and Sgt.
Tayback himself, decide to take the film in a much different direction.
Now shooting the movie guerrilla style, the actors are taken deep in the jungle.
There, Cockburn is killed by a landmine, and Speedman is kidnapped by ruthless drug lords who are enamored with his box office flop "Simple Jack".
The rest of the crew then has to band together to save Speedman - who are convinced they are a real army.
Can they overcome their differences to become a real military unit, save Speedman, and win best picture?
Or will they face the wrath of their hot headed, foul mouthed, executive producer?
