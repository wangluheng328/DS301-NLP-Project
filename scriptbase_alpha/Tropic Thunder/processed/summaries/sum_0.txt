A film crew is in Southeast Asia filming a Vietnam-war memoir.
It's early in the shooting, but they're already behind schedule and over budget.
On the day an accident befalls the novice director, the cast and crew are attacked by a gang of poppy-growing local drug dealers, except the cast and crew don't realize these aren't actors who are stalking them.
The thugs kidnap Tugg Speedman, an actor whose star seems on the decline, and it's up to the rest of the ragtag team to band together long enough to attempt his rescue.
But will Tugg want to leave?
