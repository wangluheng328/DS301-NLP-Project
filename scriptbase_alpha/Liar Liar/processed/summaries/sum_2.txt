Fletcher Reede is a fast talking attorney and habitual liar.
When his son Max blows out the candles on his fifth birthday cake, he has only one wish, 'that his dad would stop lying for 24 hours'.
When Max's wish miraculously comes true, Fletcher discovers that his biggest asset (his mouth) has suddenly become his biggest liability.
Legal and emotional havoc ensue as Fletcher tries to keep his practice afloat and his ex-wife Audrey from taking their son and moving to Boston.
