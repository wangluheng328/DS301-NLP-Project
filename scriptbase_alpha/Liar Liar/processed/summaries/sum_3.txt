Fletcher Reede is an incredibly successful lawyer who has built his career on lying.
Unfortunately he spends far too much time working instead of being with his son Max, so Max makes a birthday wish that for just one day, his dad can't tell a lie.
The wish comes true and Fletcher must try and defend his client, Samantha Cole even though his entire defense for her is a lie.
