One summer day in an upper class neighborhood of suburban New York City, middle aged Ned Merrill appears in the backyard of one of his friends and neighbors, who he has not seen in quite some time.
Before the neighbors can welcome him, they who are happy to see him, Ned jumps into their swimming pool with much energy and vitality.
Ned learns that with the addition of a recent swimming pool in another neighbor's backyard, he can literally swim home moving from swimming pool to swimming pool, his home which is miles away.
He names the route Lucinda's River, after his wife.
He is determined to make this journey despite some obstacles along the way.
At each swimming pool, Ned stops and chats with his neighbors.
Each stop reveals more and more of Ned's life journey until he reaches his final destination.
