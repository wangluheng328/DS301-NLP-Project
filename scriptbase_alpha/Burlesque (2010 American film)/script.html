                                    Written by

                                   Steven Antin



<b>                                                             2/20/09
</b>
                         

<b>          TITLE SEQUENCE OVER MUSIC
</b>          A series of tight CLOSE-UP shots of dancers moving in high
          energy fast paced sexy choreography. Very provocative. Legs.
          Arms. Butts. Boas. Sequins. Costumes. High heels. A
          kaleidoscope of images and colors.

<b>          END TITLES ON A BLACK SCREEN
</b>          FADE IN sounds of PEOPLE TALKING -- GLASSES CLINKING -- all
          the BACKGROUND SOUNDS of a BUSY, HIP NIGHTCLUB. SUDDENLY.. .a
          loud DRUM ROLL.
          CAMERA is low, moving through BACKSTAGE, passing CURTAINS and
          the WINGS, flying out onto a shiny black STAGE awash in
          light. PUSH IN on FOOTLIGHTS which are now blinding us,
          blasting into camera as they form the word...

<b>                         BURLESQUE
</b>          DRUM ROLL ends with a CYMBAL CRASH. The SCREEN goes BLACK.
          Then we hear an opening MUSIC "INTRO", a bawdy QUARTET.
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: RED LUSCIOUS LIPS... speaking directly into
          CAMERA in a smoky, sultry voice.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Once upon a time ...a long, looong
          time ago... there was a good little
          girl...and they called her...
          REVEAL ...TESS. A stunner with impossibly long lashes,
          theatrical make-up and a sequined, skin-tight band-aid of a
          dress. She works the tight stage of the club, toying with
          the AUDIENCE.

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Burlesque.
          MUSIC BLARES from a HOT YOUNG BUMPER BAND -- sax, drums, bass
          -- wearing bowler hats, suspenders and lots of ink. The
          crowd HOOTS. Lame streamers EXPLODE from the stage.

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Some say she up and died-of
          neglect. Abandonment.

<b>                         (WHISPER)
</b>          .old age.
          The club's red booths are about half-full with a hip crowd.
          Walls cluttered with photos. Celebrities tucked in shadows.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          2.
</b>
<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          But I say...no matter how hard you
          try, you can't keep a good girl
          down. And I've got a bevy of 'em.

<b>          INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          A DOZEN gorgeous, leggy GIRLS fight for the mirror. Miles of
          skin. Heavy make-up. Lashes. Boobs. Butts. Fishnets.
          Boas. And SEQUINS. Oceans of them. It's definitely
          decadent. Completely cabaret.

<b>          TESS (O.S.)
</b>          Come to think of it, none of them
          are all that good, which isn't all
          that bad...
          SEAN (31), a cute gay guy with an armful of accessories
          pushes his way through the girls and in a blur, tightens a
          corset, tosses a boa, adjusts a garter just so.

<b>          TESS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Eight shows a week. Sixteen
          gorgeous girls. Thirty-two towers
          of luscious legs...

<b>          BACK ON TESS --
</b>          Behind her, our GIRLS slink onto the stage one by one.

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Say hello to Scarlett. Jesse.
          Anna. Coco-puff. And Georgie-Girl.
          The girls gather at the edge of the stage, lit by footlights,
          moving in place to the beat of the INTRO MUSIC. Hips sway.
          Fingers snap. Tess weaves playfully between them.

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          All of them the creme-de la creme.

<b>                         (CYMBAL CRASH)
</b>          De la creme.
          The girls strike nasty, (but funny) provocative poses, etc...

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Each one a bastion of bodacious...
          (Coco bends over, peers
          between her legs)
          Elegance.
          TWO GIRLS upside down on chairs NAIL aerial splits.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.
</b>
<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Not to mention their other...
          (smacks Coco on the ass)
          Ass-ets.
          Coco raises a brow, moves her butt to a LOUD BUMP-AND-GRIND.

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Welcome to the Burlesque Lounge,
          dead smack in the center of the
          Sunset Strip-- did I say "strip?"
          (cat calls from audience)
          I meant TEASE...
          FOOTLIGHTS FLARE, UPLIGHTING THE GIRLS. They shift their
          weight, hitting the beats with risque moves and hip-thrusts
          as they MOVE DOWNSTAGE suggestively toward the audience to
          the MUSIC...

<b>          EXT. MAIN STREET, GRUNDY, IOWA - NIGHT
</b>
          A small, grime-streaked steel town, hanging on by the skin of
          its teeth. Boarded-up storefronts, a run-down A&amp;P. CAMERA
          MOVES past an old sign: WELCOME TO GRUNDY!!! and lands on
          a broken neon sign that reads "DWIG 'S BAR" It flickers so
          you can read the name: DWIGHT'S. Then goes back to DWIG.

<b>          INT. DWIGHT'S BAR - SAME
</b>
          Chipped paint. Old beer posters. A few pathetic customers.
          Beer on tap. Pinball standing lonely in the corner.
          A REGULAR drains his beer, tosses down a quarter and starts
          to leave. Someone stops short at the table.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Uh, excuse me? You forgot
          something.
          He turns. Sees:
          ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on
          her hip. Ali has a look that's all her own: short shorts,
          white platform sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than
          the rest of Grundy's women combined. She's young -- 22 --
          but has a confidence that's got nothing to do with age.

<b>                         REGULAR
</b>          No, that's your tip.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.
</b>
<b>                         ALI
</b>          Huh. See, now that's interesting --
          you and I must do math completely
          differently, cause me? I start with
          the six beers I brought you, add
          the four spills I cleaned up, the
          five times I refilled your peanuts,
          plus the three times you
          "accidentally" touched my ass, then
          I tack on lying to your wife when
          she called looking for you, twice,
          and I come up with a sum that's a
          hell of a lot more than twenty-five
          cents.
          Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by LORETTA --
          30's wearing every one of those years hard.

<b>                         LORETTA
</b>          She's just teasing, Ike. You go on
          home now, and tell Kay I said hi.
          The Regular leaves. Loretta picks up the quarter.

<b>                         LORETTA (CONT'D)
</b>          It's better than nothing.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Nothin's cheap. A quarter's an
          insult.

<b>                         LORETTA
</b>          It'll cover half a load down at the
          Spanky Clean.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          There's only one thing a quarter is
          good for.
          Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room,
          passing a GEEZER who's sitting by himself, drinking alone.

<b>                         LORETTA
</b>          Oh no, hon, now you know how Dwight
          feels about that.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Dwight isn't here.
          Ali stops in front of the rinky-dink karaoke machine.

<b>                         LORETTA
</b>          He could come back any minute.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          5.
</b>
<b>                         ALI
</b>          Tough. I'm not working here for the
          tips Loretta.
          She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song.
          She picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats,
          starts singing ETTA JAMES'S "SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME".

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>          OOOOOOOOOH, SOMETIMES I GET A GOOD
</b>

          Ali takes off down the street. She passes TWO OLDER WOMEN
          waiting for a bus. A beat as they watch her pass. Then:

<b>                         OLDER WOMAN
</b>          She'll be back.

          front of her is peering over the chair, watching Ali. Ali
          smiles at her. The Little Girl's mother notices, gets the
          girl to sit down by tickling her.
          Ali unzips the pocket on her suitcase, takes out the FRAMED
          PHOTO of the mom and girl, looks at it. Then she looks out
          the window and watches America fly by as DAY TURNS TO NIGHT.

<b>          EXT. STREET - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. DAY - CARRY MUSIC
</b>
          The rush of tourists and traffic. Through a sea of people
          moving down the crowded sidewalk we FIND ALI as she emerges
          through the crowd, carrying her bags. Looking around at this
          exciting city. She SPOTS a SHITTY HOTEL with a sign: "$49.00
          a night." She looks up at it. Then heads across the street--

<b>          INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
          Cramped, dingy carpet, chipped paint. Key in the door. The
          MIDDLE-EASTERN HOTEL MANAGER -- 40's -- leads Ali in,
          pointing out the features of the room, speaking fast in an
          impossibly thick Kurdish accent. Ali nods along, not
          understanding a word. When he stops:

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Okay!

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>          Well. Good luck with that.
          He drops her suitcase on the bed and stands there. Waiting.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, hang on.
          She digs into her purse. All she has is twenties. She peels
          one off and holds it out.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          If I could just get a little --
          But before she can finish, he pockets it, nods and leaves,
          closing the door behind him. To the closed door:

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          -- change.
          She pulls open the blinds, they fall off the wall with a
          CRASH! Ali stares at them. Then she opens the window. The
          SOUNDS OF HOLLYWOOD pour in.
          She digs out her cash, sticks it under the mattress. Then
          she reconsiders.

          from her purse, dumps the make-up onto the bed, seals the
          money up in the Ziploc, and takes it into:
          THE BATHROOM. She lifts the lid of the back toilet tank and
          slips the Ziploc of cash under it, catching the bag in the
          lid as she sets it back down, so it won't fall in.
          She goes back into the main room to find a CALICO CAT sitting
          on the window sill. It MEOWS, hops into the room.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)

          "SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW". Just as Ali gets in line, the

          Ali wanders down the sidewalk chugging an iced latte. The
          Strip hums with SLICK NIGHT LIFE. Expensive cars pull up to
          valets. Hipsters swish past velvet ropes. Ali moves through
          the throngs, alone, anonymous, invisible.
          She passes a CONSTRUCTION SITE for a 15-STORY-TALL BUILDING,
          all lit up, guys working at night. A BUS pulls out, spewing
          exhaust. As the smoke clears, Ali sees, across the street:
          A BEAUTIFUL, STATUESQUE GIRL standing on the landing of a
          fire escape under a street lamp beside a NONDESCRIPT CLUB.
          Ali catches glimpses of her as the Sunset traffic whizzes by:
          full make-up, spangled burlesque costume, impossibly high
          heels, awesome. This is Coco. Coco makes the dirty
          streetlight look like a movie-quality Kleig. Everything about
          her shimmers.
          Intrigued, Ali looks for a break in the traffic and crosses
          the street. As she nears the club, she hears a MAN'S VOICE:

<b>                         ALEXIS
</b>          Like I said, LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH!
          ALEXIS, drag queen/door whore, also in full costume and make-
          up, TOSSES a GUY out the front door onto the street, then
          heads back inside--
          Ali smiles to herself. Then turns back to look at COCO who
          disappears inside a BACK DOOR as...NIKKI walks out. Lights a
          ciggie. She has on full make-up. Lacquered lips. Lashes like
          peacock feathers. She sees Ali staring.

<b>                         NIKKI

          Nikki strikes a pose, campy, showing Ali her best side. They
          both laugh.

          Nikki's face turns to stone. Her eyes widen in horror. Ali
          sees the mistake she made. She's mortified.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)

          Sean grabs her and drags her inside. As he does, a STRAND OF
          CRYSTAL BEADS comes off her costume, falls to the ground.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I'm really sor--
          The stage door slams shut. Ali picks up the strand of beads.
          Holds them up in the light, watching them shimmer.
          She goes to the front of club, where a smattering of L.A.
          HIPSTERS enter. There's a GLASS DISPLAY CASE full of photos
          of the acts. Ali looks at the pictures of the Girls in their
          elaborate costumes and provocative poses.
          She's unintentionally made her way to the front door. Black
          curtains obscure her view inside. She peers in. HEARS cool
          music emanating. The sounds of a nightclub. Intriguing. She
          ventures inside...

<b>          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Ali MOVES down a DIMLY LIT HALLWAY. More beautiful photos of
          women in elaborate costumes, drawings, sketches, paintings
          clutter the walls. Ali follows the photos down the hallway.
          MUFFLED SOUNDS penetrate the darkness: people talking over
          each other, glasses clinking. 1930's Berlin style music.

          Ali looks in her wallet. Sees one lone twenty inside. She
          hands it to Alexis. He nods for her to go ahead. Ali
          descends a staircase INTO THE CLUB...
          .and is BOMBARDED by: colors, chaos, laughter, scandal --
          all shimmering, as if someone dunked the place in glitter.
          And over it all, an incredible mash-up of old music with a
          contemporary beat tying it all together.
          Ali ENTERS, rounds a pillar, staring out into the room as a

          choreography: thrusting hips, whipping heads, stomping feet.
          Ali watches, exhilarated, as the music builds and SWELLS to a
          full on performance with the entire ensemble--

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Get you a drink?
          She turns. A bartender is watching her watch. JACK - 25,
          punky, dark hair, eyeliner, one arm half-sleeved with tats.

<b>                         ALI

</b>          You still have that new-car smell.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I thought you looked familiar.
          He smiles. As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a
          tray for a DITSY WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She
          doesn't notice. He barks at her:

<b>                         JACK

<b>                         ALI

          She stares up at the stage, marvels at the dancers.

          He laughs. Points across the club to A DOOR leading
          backstage.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Ask for Tess. She's your guy. Flirt

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey, Iowa-- use my name.
          He hands her a card. She looks at it:

</b>          Thanks, Jack.
           She smiles, slips it in her cleavage and heads for the door.

          Ali enters into a frenzy. Legs, costumes, boobs, heels,
          eyeliners -- all flying around like a flock of birds.

          She switches to mascara. Sean, arms heavy with corsets,
          catches eyes with Ali, nods toward Tess: "that's her." Ali
          steps closer to Tess.

          Tess glances at Ali in the mirror. Then goes back to her

          Tess strides out, not looking back. Ali sees the Girls
          trading glances, amused. She turns and leaves.

          The Bumper Band plays as Ali makes her way back toward the
          bar, dejected. Across the room, the Ditzy Waitress, holding
          an empty tray, flirts with a table of YOUNG HIPSTER GUYS.
          Ali sees ANOTHER TABLE OF CHIC CLUBSTERS trying to get the
          waitress's attention. The Waitress ignores them.
          Ali sees the trays on the end of the bar. She grabs one, goes
          to the TABLE OF CLUBSTERS, clears their empties, takes their
          order. She finds Jack at the bar, unloads the empties.

          She heads back to the bar with empties, eyes glued to the
          stage, where Coco and the GIRLS are dancing to "Wagon Wheel
          Watusi." As Ali hits the bar, Coco nails a stunning kick.

          century French expression "voix de
          ville" -- "voice of the city".
          Popular songs of the time that were
          strung together into stage shows.
          Which, over time, gave birth to
          another kind of show in which
          talented girls showing a bit more
          skin danced, did skits, and, _ yes,
          sang. In addition to being
          raunchier, these shows were
          funnier, hence the new name.
          "Burlesque": "comical" in French.
          Ali sees the Girls enjoying this dressing-down immensely.

          She reaches in her pocket, pulls out a card. It's Jack's that
          he gave her in the club. It has his address on it.

          She opens the window. The cat scurries back in, leaps onto
          the ledge. Ali pets him. Looks at Jack, smiles.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't have a name for him yet.
          It purrs. Jack eyes it warily.

          learning a song. When he pauses, from the living room:

          Her listening, him playing. After a few measures:

<b>                          ALI (CONT'D)

<b>                         JACK

</b>           Hey Jack?
          He stops again.

          Light rain on the window.
          CLOSE ON: THE CAT'S FACE, staring right into camera.
          REVERSE ON: Jack, waking up. As his eyes open, the Cat licks
          him on the mouth.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Aauuuugggghh.
          He hurls the cat away and bolts out of bed, disgusted.

<b>          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Jack straggles in, wiping his mouth. The sofa's made up,
          blankets folded. Ali is making breakfast, her back to him.
          He can't help but notice she's only wearing a tiny tank top
          and undies. She hears him clear his throat.

<b>                         ALI

          his fridge.

          As Ali realizes she's barely dressed in front of a straight
          guy.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I should put on pants.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Probably.
          She bolts out to the living room, starts digging through her
          bag, bent over. She's in the doorway, so from the kitchen,
          all he can see is her cute little ass sticking out.

<b>                         ALI

          She can't find pants. She shifts, so now her ass is facing
          him directly. He tries not to look--

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Well, you did, and it was fine.
          Aha! Pants. She pulls them out, starts putting them on. He
          looks out. Her foot is caught in the pants leg. As she hops
          around, trying to untangle it--

<b>                          JACK (CONT'D)
</b>           Or at least it will be as soon as
           you get dressed.
          She tumbles out of view, thumps against some furniture.
          She appears in the doorway, pants on, pulling on a sweater.
          She slips her feet into her shoes.

<b>                         ALI

          Come on, cat.
          She zips the cat into the bag he came in.

          She leaves. He closes the door behind her. Stands there.

<b>          EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY

           Ali looks at the rain. Then marches out into it, lugging her
          stuff. Goes about 15 yards in one direction, then stops.

           Jack watches her out the window as she marches 15 yards in

          stop across the street. She crosses to it and sits.

          Ali peers down the street for the bus. Jack appears beside

          The DOOR KICKS OPEN-- they ENTER, Jack carrying Ali, dripping
          wet.

<b>                         ALI
</b>
<b>          PLEASE PUT ME DOWN--
</b>          He sets her down--

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Look, you have nowhere to go, I
          have a couch. You may as well stay
          here for a few days.

<b>                         ALI
</b>           You really don't need to do that.
          I'll be fine --

<b>                         JACK
</b>          You'll be homeless. You always have

</b>          It's never happened before.
          The Cat jumps up on the back of a chair, all wet, and SHAKES,
          splattering them with wet cat smell.

<b>                         JACK/ALI

          CLOSE ON A HEAVILY MADE-UP GIRL as she screams and drops out
          of the shot in a flying split. Behind her, a ROW OF DANCERS
          do the same. Typical, fantastic, old-school can-can.
          WIDEN to see Tess and Sean, on the floor, auditioning them.
          The club is brightly lit, none of its evening aura.
          Scattered around the club are other HOPEFULS in groups,
          waiting for their turn.

          Ali and Jack enter as the auditions are under way. As they
          set up the bar, Ali watches the stage, intrigued.
          MONTAGE: the dancers auditioning, in small groups. All
          shapes, sizes. Ali watching. Finally only a few are left.

          They walk off stage, dismissed. Tess turns to Sean.

          Last group, please.
          HALF A DOZEN DANCERS move to the stage. Ali watches from
          behind the bar, thinking. Then, on her face, we see: an idea
          forming.
          ON THE FLOOR, Tess and Sean check their clipboards,
          organizing for this next set. They look up and start in:

</b>          All right, ladies, and five, six,

          Coco and Georgia ENTER-- surprised to see Ali on stage.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Trying out.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          I don't think so.

          be as rude as you want--but don't
          you dare tell me I'm not serious.
          Sean's eyebrows reach for the ceiling as Nikki enters, SEES
          Ali on stage.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          I may not have been to a
          professional dance school, but I
          have a lot of talent and I came to
          this town to do something with it.
          And the only reason I've been
          putting up with all the bullshit
          "attitude" I get from you is cause
          I want to do it here.

<b>                         (BEAT)

          you're gonna give me MY shot. Right
          here. Right now.
          Everyone in the club just stands there. Jaws dropped. Tess
          just looks at her, blinks, incredulous.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          One song. You don't like it, I'll

</b>          Your call, lady. I know every

          Sean, eyes big as saucers, looks from Ali to Tess, then back

<b>                         AGAIN--

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Which one do you wanna see?
          Tess looks at her in disbelief.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          I said, which one do you wanna see?
          Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to
          DAVE in the sound booth--

</b>          Tough Lover!
          Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly.
          ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to
          dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but
          it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality.
          After a few measures, Tess has seen enough.

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Okay then, next?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Hang on.
          (to Dave in the booth)
          Start it again, please?
          As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down
          and shakes it loose.
          Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage--

<b>                         NIKKI
</b>
<b>                         (TO GEORGIA)

<b>                         COCO
</b>          Shhhh.
          On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude.
          Then she looks up at the booth again.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Anytime.
          The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive.
          She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but
          she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her
          before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She
          misses a step or two, but who the hell cares?
          On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced.
          Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to
          respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow.
          At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms -
          - unable to tear his eyes away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          52.
</b>          As the SONG CLIMAXES, Ali finishes with an alluring toss of
          her ass, then lands in a sexy layout on a chair, owning the
          stage. The music ends. A stunned silence. The only sound
          is Ali's heavy breathing.
          Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY.

<b>                         NIKKI
</b>          What are so you happy about, that's
          your replacement.

<b>                         GEORGIA
</b>          Yeah, but she's really good.
          Tess and Ali are in a stare down.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          I want so badly to say something
          bitchy, but nothing's coming.

<b>                         SEAN
</b>          There's a first.
          Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          You were off the whole second half.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          So, I was spot on the first half?
          Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco
          and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then
          suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and
          RUNS to the bathroom to puke--
          Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in
          my ass.
          Ali tries hard not to beam--

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Do I have the job, or not?

<b>                         TESS
</b>          You're not great. What you are is
          lucky. Because I need someone
          tonight.

          As Tess turns and leaves--

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Even in those shoes that time
          forgot.

<b>                         SEAN
</b>          Theeeere's bitchy.
          Nikki watches Tess go-- turns and pours herself a shot.

<b>                         NIKKI
</b>          Well-- this totally sucks ass.
          Sean jumps up on the stage.

<b>                         SEAN
</b>          Congratulations. The last time
          someone showed Tess balls like
          that, she married him.
          (looks Ali over)
          You look like a checker at a Mal
          Wart in Wichita. Just tripled your

          Ali jumps off the stage, runs to the bar, where Jack is still
          standing, slack-jawed. She throws her arms around him.

<b>                         ALI

          But hey-- with my raise I'll be off

          She squeezes him tight-- then heads backstage leaving him
          standing there, really turned on.

          shimmy and shake number. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the girls'
          faces as drums roll and their heads turn to each drumbeat.
          The last face to turn is ALI'S. In FULL STAGE MAKE-UP, she
          looks like a gorgeous classic burlesque dancer. The girls,
          in 20's revealing bathing suits and stilettos, kick and dance
          downstage in a line. Ali struggles a little to keep up
          A WAITER CROSSES FRAME and we WIPE TO:

          knows the steps now, she's not thinking about them. She's
          all performance, vamping to the audience, selling like crazy.
          She NAILS a final layout on a chair, it's flawless.
          Tess and Sean are watching from the wings. They notice the

          A general chorus of "Yeah?" and "I'm in."
          FOLLOW Ali to the bathroom as she throws on her clothes and
          washes off her make-up, humming "Rich Man's Frug" to herself.
          She heads back out to the dressing room to find:
          EVERYONE IS GONE. She looks around. Feels like an fool.
          She plunks down in a chair. Drops her bag on the floor.
          Looks at herself in the mirror.

          mirror. Notices her eye make-up -- strong, thick eyeliner.
          Ali picks up a brush, dips it in eyeliner, and tries to
          duplicate the look on her own eye. After a first try:

<b>          TESS (O.S.)
</b>          Your brush is for shit.
          She turns and sees Tess in the doorway. Tess comes over,
          takes Ali's brush. Looks at it.

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)

<b>                         ALI

          Tess reads her like a book. Knows what went down. She turns
          to leave, then pauses at the door. Turns back.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Don't take it personally. Their

          Ali meets her eyes in the mirror. Then Tess grabs a brush
          from her own station, tosses it to Ali.

          She leaves Ali alone.

          watches him go LOOKS DOWN onto the STAGE as ALI STEPS to

<b>                         THE MIC--
</b>
<b>                         ALI

<b>                         (LIP-SYNCHING)

<b>          WHEN HE KISSES ME I'LL GET A

<b>          THRILL, AND WHEN HE DO THAT WIGGLE--
</b>          Nikki reaches out and FLIPS A SWITCH.
          THE SOUND DROPS OUT. THE PLAYBACK STOPS. The girls freeze
          in awkward poses, unsure of what to do.
          MURMURS in the room as the audience looks around, confused.
          BACKSTAGE, Tess looks up at the sound booth, sees it's empty.
          Dave appears at her side.

<b>                         DAVE
</b>          You wanted to see me?
          ON STAGE -- Ali looks at flustered Tess...the girls...the
          audience. Panic.
          On the floor, Nikki watches with satisfaction as she makes
          her way over to Marcus. Enjoying the train wreck she caused.
          Then -- in a flash, Ali turns to the audience, and SINGS
          a'capella from the TOP OF THE SONG.

<b>                         ALI
</b>
<b>          OH--OH--OOOOOOOOOOH.
</b>          She looks around. Silence. Mouths agape. Tess approaches in

<b>                         THE WINGS--

<b>                         SEAN

          Ali starts to sing again, her version, slow, and sexy...

<b>                         ALI
</b>
<b>          WELL I WANT A LOVER TO MOVE ME SO,

<b>          65.
</b>          Tess looks at Ali, you could knock her over with a feather.
          Sean looks at Tess. Scarlett looks at Coco. Jack stares at
          the stage. Everyone stunned by the sound coming out of this
          girl. And now the song really takes off!
          SUDDENLY, one of the BAND BOYS grabs his sax and plays. Ali
          jumps in, seamless, as the guys on Bass and Drums join in.
          Ali picks up the choreography. The girls fall in with her.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)

</b>
<b>          LOVER. UH-HA...
</b>          Coco and Scarlett chime in on back-up. Hearing them, Jessie
          and Anna join in as well. Ali takes off, holding nothing
          back. The girls feed off her confidence, and soon all of
          them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs, stomping
          their feet to the music. The girls singing back-up.
          In his seat, Marcus sits up a little straighter -- suddenly
          paying more attention. Unable to take his eyes off Ali.
          The BAND plays along. The BARTENDERS accompany them with
          hand-claps. All except Jack, who's too spellbound to move.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)

</b>          ON THE FLOOR, Nikki watches, aghast, as the crowd engages
          like we've never seen them.

</b>          The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE, knowing they caught a once-in-a-
          lifetime performance. Marcus stands, clapping, whistling.
          Ali basks in it, jubilant, rapturous. She glances to the
          wings and sees Sean, clapping and jumping in place. Then she
          sees Tess beside him, stone-faced.

<b>          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
          The Girls exit the stage in a flurry, everyone congratulating
          Ali -- a whirlwind of hugs, kisses. Ali reaches Tess.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Tess, when the music stopped--

</b>          Why didn't you tell me you I have no idea what happened.
          could blow like that?

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          I did.
          Tess spots a TATTOOED BAND GUY in the door.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Do you boys know all the music?

<b>          TATTOOED BAND GUY
</b>          Hell, yeah.
          Nikki wanders in, drink in hand. Tess looks at them all.
          Plants her hands on her hips.

          Ali can't keep from beaming as she shakes her head, no!

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Good.
          The Girls file into the dressing room. Tess heads out, past
          Nikki.

<b>                         NIKKI
</b>          "People don't come to hear us

<b>                         TESS
</b>          No. But they'll come to hear her
          sing. Dry out and maybe you can
          back her up.
          She leaves. Nikki scowls. Sean grabs Ali.

<b>                         SEAN
</b>          Bitch, you SANG that damn song!
          He heads off to the dressing room, too, leaving Nikki and Ali
          alone together. Their eyes meet.

<b>                         NIKKI
</b>          One of us has clearly
          underestimated the other.
          She tosses her glass in the trash and leaves Ali alone.

<b>          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT
</b>
           Ali trots out from backstage, spots Jack behind the bar. She
          heads over to him. Before she gets there:

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          Where'd you learn to sing like
          that?
          She turns. Marcus is there. Handsome, charming and devious as
          ever.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          You can't learn to sing like that.

          here.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I just got into the show and
          suddenly I'm too good for it?
          Shrugs, "but, you are" then--

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          How about a drink?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Sure. Jack's at the bar. Tell him I
          sent you. It's on me.

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          But I hate lines.
          AT THE BAR - Jack looks up, SEES Ali and Marcus talking.
          BACK ON MARCUS who looks Ali up and down.

<b>                         MARCUS (CONT'D)
</b>          Seriously. You sound even better
          than you look. Which is saying a
          lot.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Talk about a "line."
          She smiles, amused, and heads away from him, toward the bar.
          He watches her go. Tess intercepts Ali.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          What did he want?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Directions to the bar.
          As Ali heads off. Tess glances back at Marcus, mistrustful.

<b>          INT. EMPTY BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          After hours. The club is closed. Jack, Ali, Coco, Sean and
          Georgia are sitting around the bar as Jack closes up.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          You blew me away! Who knew you

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I don't know, I can't explain it.
          It's like -- I start singing, and
          something starts to move inside me.
          It's in my hands, my feet, my gut,

<b>                         MY THIGHS
</b>          She runs her hands over her body as she describes it. Jack
          watches her -- holy smokes. Sean notices his gaze on her.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          and it just builds and builds
          till I feel like I'm gonna explode.

<b>                         GEORGIA
</b>          Trust me, I know what that feels
          like. I have to pee. Again.
          She hops off the stool and scurries to the back. Coco
          stands, to leave. Looks at Ali.

<b>                         COCO
</b>          Wanna grab something to eat?
          Ali looks back at Coco -- validated. Accepted. At last.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Yeah. Lemme get my bag.
          Ali moves off. Coco goes to get her coat. Sean sees Jack
          still watching Ali as she walks across the room.

<b>                         SEAN
</b>          Well, will you look at that.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          What?

<b>                         SEAN
</b>          You looking at that girl the way I
          looked at you all those years.
          Only difference: you actually stand
          a chance with her.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          I have a fiancee.

</b>          Let me guess what about: her, her
          and...oh! Her.
          Jack shoots him a glare.

<b>                         SEAN (CONT'D)
</b>          All I'm saying is, this one's
          beautiful on the inside too. And
          she won't be on the shelf forever.
          Ali comes back, ready to go. Feels them stop talking and
          look at her.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          What?

<b>                         SEAN
</b>          I was just explaining to Jack that
          even opportunity has a shelf life.
          Jack grabs a trash bag and takes it out back. Sean looks at
          Ali more closely. He brushes her hair out of her face. Then
          he holds it off her shoulders and raises that gay eyebrow.
          - INT. SALON - DAY - Ali sits in front of a mirror while Sean
          gives the HAIRDRESSER very specific instructions.
          - INT. JACK'S APARTMENT, AT HIS KEYBOARD, Jack plays a high-
          energy style piano which runs over a QUICK SEQUENCE: It's the
          instrumental music to: "BUT I'M A GOOD GIRL."
          - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - The Burlesque Girls dance on stage,
          performing a high-energy tap dance, coupled with a European
          slap-dance, with the slapping of each other's bodies and
          faces integrated with tapping and music. It's very cabaret,
          but modernized with contemporary STEPPING. CARRY MUSIC:
          - INT. SALON - LATER - The HAIRDRESSER spins the chair
          around. Ali's her hair is platinum blonde, with bangs and a
          Louise Brooks bob that frames her face beautifully. Her
          smoky eyes pop like never before. Ali studies herself:

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Where have I been all my life?

          BIGGER, BAWDY, SHOW-STOPPING BOISTEROUS SOUND as Ali APPEARS
          with her new look. Amazing. Like Helmut Newton meets Carnaby
          St. circa 1965. As she begins this HIGH ENERGY SONG-- Jack is
          looks up from the bar. Totally blown away.

          JACK AT THE BAR - he turns to see Ali.

          She spins herself around on a bar stool, so he can see all

          The Burlesque Girls are prepping for the show.

          Ali pretends she didn't hear. She sits at her mirror. The
          girls stare at her, mouths agape. Ali picks up her mascara
          wand, looks down the mirror at Nikki's reflection.

          Ali takes a deft stroke of her wand over her lashes, then
          bats them at Nikki. Nikki walks out. Coco smiles with
          appreciation. Whistles long and low. The girls all laugh.

          Tess glad-hands guests, then spots Vince, waving at her. She
          starts over, then sees Marcus in the booth with Vince. She
          turns and walks the other way. Vince catches up to her.

          Tess, at her desk, reads a contract. Marcus and Vince sit
          across from her, watching.

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          It's very simple. I buy you out
          and pay you a million off the top.
          (motions to Vince)
          Five hundred grand each.
          Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Why do you want this club so badly?

<b>                         MARCUS

          Tess looks at Vince, betrayed.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Did you also tell him about the

          She looks at a photo on her wall: the Burlesque Girls, in all
          their glory.

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Which is why I'll never let it go.
          She gets up, opens the door, ushering them out. Marcus
          shoots Vince an angry look as they head downstairs.
          IN THE STAIRWELL, Vince reassures Marcus:

<b>                         VINCE
</b>          Don't worry. The balloon payment's
          due on the first. She doesn't have
          the money. She has to sell.
          IN TESS'S OFFICE, Tess stands in the doorway, having heard.
          Then she walks back to her desk and sits, dejected. Head in
          her hands. For the first time ever, looking worried and
          defeated. Something she'd never show anyone. A beat. Then:

<b>                         SEAN
</b>          Well. We've had a pretty good run.
          She looks up. Sean is in the doorway.

<b>                         SEAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Maybe it's time to just.. .hang it
          up. Let it go. Call it a day.
          Tess's eyes go steely with determination.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          No. You cannot say that to me. I
          can eat these "sky is falling"
          dipshits for breakfast, lunch, and
          dinner, but not YOU. You cannot be
          that person. I've scoured dirty
          flea markets for costumes, stayed
          up all night sewing till my fingers
          bled, painted and repainted every
          goddamn wall of this place myself.

          sister, mother and shrink to every
          girl who's ever danced here. I've
          hocked every keepsake I've ever
          owned to keep this place afloat.
          Because this club is the last of
          it's kind, and if it goes away, one
          day there won't be anything like it-
          - and THAT would be a tragedy. So
          you cannot say that to me. Because
          now someone's gotta believe in me,
          Goddamnit. And I need that person
          to be you. So don't you ever let me
          hear you say that again. I will
          never let this club go. Never.
          Sean looks at her...a wry smile.

<b>                         SEAN
</b>          There she is. Thought I'd lost you
          for a minute.
          Tess just looks at him, and smiles. He grabs a boa, throws it
          around his neck and exits. When he's gone, Tess's smile
          fades.
          IN THE CLUB, the place is empty. Jack is wiping down the bar
          cleaning up. He starts stacking some chairs in the house
          as..SEAN CROSSES the floor.

<b>                         SEAN (CONT'D)

</b>          Night.
          Sean EXITS as Jack carries a stack of chairs to the side of
          the room, sets them down near the piano. STOPS, grabs a chair
          for himself and sits down. Begins to play an original song.
          ACROSS THE ROOM, Ali ENTERS from backstage. Her dance bag
          over her shoulder. She HEARS the piano, peers around a
          column, SEES Jack playing. She stays in the shadows and
          watches as he sings and plays a beautiful song. (TBD)
          The song ends. Ali applauds slowly. Impressed. Jack looks up,
          surprised that she is there.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Beautiful. You write that?

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Just some sentimental crap. Ready?

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          76.
</b>          She smiles at his modesty. Nods. He crosses to her. Grabs her
          dance bag and they EXIT together.

<b>          INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
          Jack enters, unloading his keyboard from his back. He hears
          Ali in the bedroom. He quietly moves over to the ajar
          bedroom door -- peeks in and sees:
          ALI, in bra and undies. She hums the song he played the night
          before in the mirror as she gets dressed.
          ON JACK, watching, mesmerized. His eyes travel her body.
          She moves out of view. He leans against the wall to try to
          keep seeing her -- and steps on the CAT. It MEOWS. He
          flattens against the wall. Ali looks up.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Jack?
          Jack zips back to the door, opens it quietly, then SLAMS it.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Hey! Just got home!
          Ali grabs a dress from her bed, slips into it.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          In here! Can you zip me up?
          In a nanosecond-- Jack enters the bedroom.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey. Where you been?

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Rehearsing. I'm playing a late
          show tonight.
          As he zips up the back of her dress, he sees the PHOTO
          propped against the lamp on the bedside table.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Who is that?
          She picks up the picture. Looks at it.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Me and my mom on my 7th birthday.
          She died just a few weeks later.

</b>          She was so young.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          24. There was so much she never
          got to do. Sometimes I feel like,
          if I make the most of my life, part
          of her will get to live a little
          more, too.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Wow. You must miss her.
          She puts the photo down. Turns back to him. They're close.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Every single day, something happens
          I want to tell her about.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          What was today's?
          A beat. Their eyes connect.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Don't know. Hasn't happened yet.
          They stand there, close to each other. Jack sees a strand of
          hair caught in the earring. He pulls it away, freeing it.
          His fingers move through her hair. She closes her eyes,
          feeling his fingers against her neck.
          Then she opens her eyes, looks at him. He looks back, unable
          to look away. Until:
          His CELL PHONE RINGS. Breaking the mood. He pulls it from
          his pocket. Checks who's calling. Looks back at Ali.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          I should... it's... Natalie.
          Ali steps away from him, disappointed. He answers the phone.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Hey, babe, how are you?
          Ali watches him walk away from her, falling into the
          conversation with Natalie.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Yes, she's still here-What do you
          want me to do, it's not like you're
          here helping out, you know...

          floor perusing a Fashion Magazine. Across the room, Jack sits
          on the couch, PLAYING HIS KEYBOARD--UNDERSCORING THE SONG. He
          looks at Ali. Watching her. Without looking up, she takes a
          pencil, gathers her hair, and puts it up expertly. A few
          strands fall back onto her neck. Sexy. Ali feels his stare.
          Looks up at him. Smiles. He smiles back. She goes back to her
          magazine. ON JACK. Loving that she's there.

          - EXT. STREET. AFTERNOON - Ali on the back of Jack's
          motorcycle, puts her arms around his waist. Jack revs the
          engine. Weaving through traffic on the Strip. The wind in

          They pass AN INCREDIBLY WELL-DRESSED COUPLE coming down.

</b>          Ooh. Killer shoes.

<b>                         MARLA

</b>          Glad you could come.
          Ali stares at Marcus. He smiles, takes her hand, keeps
          leading her up the stairs.

<b>                         AL I
</b>          You had to make an appearance at

          You'd like those guys. Greg's the
          entertainment editor at the Times,
          and Marla's a designer.
          Ali glances back at Marla again, locks in on her shoes.

<b>                         AL I
</b>          I'm gonna dream about those shoes.

<b>                         MARCUS

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Hey, I saw them first.
          He laughs as they reach the top of the stairs and a
          BREATHTAKING PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE ENTIRE CITY is revealed.
          Ali pauses, taking in the glittering, massive view of L.A.

<b>                          ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          Whoa. L.A. looks one hell of a lot
          prettier from up here.

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          It should. That view cost me three
          times what the house did.

<b>                         (POINTING)
</b>          See that strip mall down there?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          You own that too?

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          No. I own everything above it.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          There is nothing above it.

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          Exactly.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          You own...air?

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          Air rights. The guy who owns the
          strip mall was having money issues
          and almost had to sell. Whoever he
          sold to would have put in a huge
          tower. So I bought the air rights.
          Now no one can ever build above one
          story.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Aren't you the sly puss.

          I get to keep the second best view
          in L.A.

          He gazes at her. She rolls her eyes.

<b>                         ALI (CONT'D)
</b>          How many girls have you used that
          on?

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          None who ever called me on it.
          He smiles. Looks at her. Then...

<b>                         MARCUS (CONT'D)
</b>          What do you want, Ali? In life.
          Girl like you, gives up everything,
          gets on a bus heading for total
          uncertainty-- she's got a dream. I
          want to know what it is.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Why?

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          Because you're talented enough to
          get whatever you want. And I'm
          smart enough to help make it
          happen. So? What do you want?
          A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I want to be the best singer I can
          be. I want to give as much joy as I
          get when I perform. And I want to
          die knowing I made the most of
          every opportunity life gave me.

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          That's ...so beautiful.

<b>                         AL I
</b>          There wasn't a dry eye in the house
          when I said it at the Grundy County
          Junior Miss Talent Show.
          His eyes narrow.

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          Why do you women always take
          advantage of nice boys?

          boy.
          He clinks her glass. Smiles at her. Devilish and sexy.

<b>          INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - WEE HOURS - NIGHT

          Party's over. Lights low. Ali walks through the almost-
          empty house, passes a COUPLE making out on a couch, a GUY who
          holds out a joint. She motions "no thanks", heads into the:
          LIVING ROOM, where Marcus is asleep on a Bertolli chair,
          drink in hand. An OLDER GUY is playing the piano quietly.
          Ali takes the drink from Marcus's hand, sets it on the table.
          She hears the pianist start a new song: (TBD). She smiles.
          Goes over to him.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Ooh, I love this song.
          The Piano Player scoots to make room. She sits beside him. He
          starts humming along. She does too. Then he sings a line.
          She sings one back. And they fall in together. Not vamping,
          not performing. Just feeling the beauty of the music in the
          middle of the night.

          Jack quietly lets himself in. He sets his keyboard down, then

</b>          Ali?
          He looks in. Empty. He checks the clock: 4:45. He hears a
          "meow", and sees the cat. He picks it up, turns out the
          light, and leaves the room.

          it. It flies through the air and hits Nikki in the back of
          the head. Nikki SCREAMS, whips around, incredulous, to see:

          "BABY IT'S YOU"-- Jack turns to the DJ, points both fingers
          at him and YELLS:

          wraps her in his arms and starts to sing quietly in her ear.

          boots, slides it off, dumps it. Then he tries the second --
          it sticks -- he pulls harder -- the boot pops off and he
          careens backwards, crashing into the lamp, knocking it over
          again. Ali cracks up. He turns to the lamp.

          Then Jack's door opens. He stands in the doorway in matching
          "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" pajamas, leaning against the

</b>          Forgot to lock up.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Night again.
          He walks back into the bedroom and once gain shuts the door.
          Ali smiles to herself, plumps her pillow. The door flies
          open again -- Jack's there in just the pants, no top.

<b>                         JACK
</b>          Water. No hangover.
          He stumbles past Ali to the kitchen, drinks from the tap.
          After a moment he returns to the bedroom, nodding to Ali.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Night.
          Ali just nods. He closes the door. Ali smiles, waiting.
          After a beat, the door opens again. Jack is there, in boxers.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Hungry.
          He walks past her to the kitchen, opens a box of cereal,
          pours it into his mouth. Grabs some milk from the fridge,
          pours it into his mouth, too. Returns to the bedroom,
          crunching. He closes the door. Then -- very quickly -- he
          opens it again and walks out.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          I know I forgot something else, but
          I just can't remember what...

<b>                         (TO HIMSELF)
</b>          Door locked, water, food...
          He wanders out into the room, past Ali, and we see from
          behind he is butt-ass naked. She cracks up.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          What's so funny?
          She covers her face. He glances down.

<b>                         JACK (CONT'D)
</b>          Well I never!
          He strides back to the bedroom, shutting the door. After a
          moment, he comes back out dressed in an old, flowered
          bathrobe and fur-lined orange hunting cap.

</b>          I remembered what I forgot to do.

</b>
<b>                         (SERIOUS)

           She kisses back, making up for all their lost time.

          seem to be floating in blackness, their curves illuminated.
          They begin to move to the music (think WABASH BLUES, CRAZY

          a bottle of wine. Crosses and sits next to her on the chaise.
          Marcus refills their wine glasses. An empty bottle already
          there. She sips as she leans back and relaxes.

          Jack, alone now, collects the clothes Ali left behind. He
          reaches under the couch and sees the PHOTO of Ali and her
          mother. He picks it up, smooths out the cracks. Traces 7-
          year-old Ali's face with his fingertips.

<b>          INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - GUEST HOUSE - DAY

          Ali lies in a tangle of 1000-thread-count sheets. Her eyes

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Where am I?
          She sees a Warhol-esque PRINT OF MARCUS on the wall. She
          raises her brows then sees her disheveled reflection in a
          huge mirror: smeared mascara, hair askew.

          Ali, freshly showered, enters, a stranger in a strange land.
          STAFF is milling around. She HEARS a SPLASH. Looks out the
          glass windows, sees Marcus swimming laps. The HOUSEKEEPER
          passes her, nods "morning". Ali smiles.
          Then she notices a long table full of miniature MODELS of
          BUILDINGS. She takes them in, pausing at a tall, sleek MODEL
          of a glass HIGH-RISE, towering over the other models.
           She runs her finger lightly over it, intrigued. Then she
          sees the address marker: 7800 Sunset Blvd.
          Ali stares, stunned. Marcus enters, toweling himself dry.

</b>          What is this?

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          Now it's a model. But when it
          grows up, it'll be a mixed-use
          space: retail and residential.

</b>          This is the address of the

<b>                         ALI

<b>                         MARCUS
</b>          Not according to the city.

          THE FRONT DOORS OPEN, and Ali ENTERS, spots Tess, rushes over
          to her.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Tess! I have to talk to you!

          waiting for her reaction. But Tess just turns, continues up
          to her office, and shuts the door. Ali turns to Sean-- then
          starts after her--

</b>          I've got something for you.
          He pulls out the photo of Ali with her mother. It's in a new
          frame.

          Ali nods, jumps up from her stool, and races for the door,

          - EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT - Ali (in a Prius) peels out of
           the lot, weaving through traffic as she lifts her cell.
          - INT. AIRPORT - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT: a CELL PHONE in a
           plastic bowl moves through a security X-ray machine.

          Jack, in line, about to board the plane. He's wearing his
          iPod headset, deaf to the world.

          A PLUMP WOMAN in front of him looks at Ali. Ali points to
          Jack. The woman taps Jack and points. He looks to see:
           ALI, on the other side of Security. Jack takes his earphones
           off and smiles. He crosses over to her, carrying his bag.
          They are separated by several feet of security ropes.

<b>                         JACK

          Our cat. I named him.
          They smile again. Neither wanting this moment to end. She
          waves. He nods. Then he turns and walks off to board. Ali
          watches him go.
          ON JACK, walking back to the gate-then -- he stops. Turns
          back to see Ali, but she's gone.

<b>          FEMALE SECURITY GUARD
</b>          Boy, you get out there and kiss
          that girl! Now!
          Jack looks at her, then quickly turns to walk past the Male
          Security Guard.

<b>          MALE SECURITY GUARD
</b>          Go ahead-- but you're gonna have to
          come back through Security again.

<b>                         JACK

          Martin looks at Jack. Then:

<b>          MALE SECURITY GUARD
</b>          Ah, hell. Go ahead. Bag stays here.
          Jack drops his bag, takes a running JUMP over the ROPES and
          RUNS through the crowded concourse -- startling everyone.
          ON ALI, as she walks through the concourse, reliving her last
          sight of Jack. As she's about to get on the escalator:

</b>          She turns. Jack is there. In one fantastically romantic move,
          he pulls her into his arms, kisses her deeply -- an epic kiss
          that makes passersby stop and stare.

</b>          Well, go get 'em, Jack.
          He smiles, then disappears into the crowd. Ali stands there,
          watching him, gobsmacked by the kiss.

          Sean's car whips into the parking lot. Ali jumps out and
          heads for the front entrance. The CONSTRUCTION WORKERS from
          the towering building across the street HOOT and CAT-CALL at
          her. She waves to them and nods: that's right, boys.

<b>          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT

          Ali enters just as Tess, in a spotlight on stage, turns
          toward the audience. She looks fabulous. Only someone who

          ON ALI-- a lightbulb going on! As Tess exits the stage, Ali
          pushes through the crowd and races backstage.

          TWO SETS OF FIERCE HEELS and LEGS stride in unison down a

          in a phone conversation as WHAM! The door to his office
          flies open and Ali and Tess stride in, an overwrought

          Tess smiles at him. Looks at Ali, who's not smiling. She
          elbows her. Ali starts smiling. Tess walks up to the desk and
          sits herself down. Ali does the same.

</b>          Mr. Anderson. Your pretty million-
          dollar ocean views are going away
          because I'm selling my building to
          a developer tomorrow who'll have
          his twenty stories all framed up by
          the time you start selling --

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Trying to sell--

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Trying to sell these condos.

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Or. I can put you in a position
          where your buyers could be
          guaranteed their million-dollar
          views forever.

<b>                         BUSINESSMAN
</b>          I'm listening.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          As am I. As long as you're telling
          me you'll have a check to me by
          5:00 today.

<b>          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - EVENING
</b>
           The BUMPER BAND PLAYS. Vince sits with his POSSE. His
           cocktail waitress/girlfriend approaches with an empty tray.
          She whispers to him:

<b>                         COCKTAIL WAITRESS
</b>          Sorry, baby, they cut you off at
          the bar. Said you have to pay cash.

<b>                         VINCE
</b>          What? I co-own this goddamn place--

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          131.
</b>          Tess comes up behind him.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Not anymore you don't. I'm buying
          you out.

<b>                         VINCE
</b>          You can't do that.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Actually, according to page 4 of
          our contract, I can.

<b>                         VINCE
</b>
<b>                         (SCOFFING)
</b>          In the next 48 hours?

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Why postpone joy?
          She hands him a CASHIER'S CHECK. Vince stares at it.

<b>                         VINCE
</b>          What the hell is this?

<b>                         TESS
</b>          I realize it's been a while since
          you've seen one, but it's called a
          check.
          He stares at it, stunned.Then at her.

<b>                         VINCE
</b>          Where'd you get this?

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Not your business anymore. And
          neither is the lounge.

<b>                         (POINTS)
</b>          I'm sure you know where the door
          is. It used to be half yours.
          (re. the waitress)
          And take HER with you.
          Tess turns and goes over to the bar, where Ali spins around
          on her barstool, having heard the whole thing.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          How'd that feel?

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Not half bad.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          132.
</b>          Tess parks it next to her. Looks at Ali. Smiles, then breaks
          into a giggle. Ali smiles. Tess laughs even harder, tears in
          her eyes now. They are just two girls laughing hysterically
          at the bar, Tess keeps trying to say something, but can't get
          it out, until she looks Ali square in the eye...

<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          It felt pretty God damn awesome!
          And they crack up again. Then...

<b>                         ALI
</b>          And to think, you didn't even want
          me around.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Oh, Jesus, here it comes.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          .What was it you said to me that
          first night? "Twenty bucks at the
          door will make all your dreams come
          true." That was sweet of you.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Are you finished?

<b>                         ALI
</b>          (loving needling her)
          Kinda ironic, when you think about
          it. I started off begging you to
          make my dreams come true, and here
          we are --

<b>                         TESS
</b>          All right already! You want me to
          say it, I'll say it.
          She looks at her.

<b>                          TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          This place is the love of my life.
          The only dream I've ever had. I
          don't know what I would have done
          if I had lost it.

<b>                         (HEARTFELT NOW)
</b>          Thank you.
          A moment between them... as Tess SPOTS NIKKI ENTER the club
          carrying her dance bag--a little fresher than we've seen her
          before, and sober. Nikki looks over at Tess... then
          approaches. Ali turns away on her bar stool, respectfully.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          133.

</b>
<b>                         (SHEEPISH)
</b>          I crossed the line.
          Tess crosses her arms, and with a smirk on her face--

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Again.

<b>                         NIKKI
</b>          Again, and I wanna come home--

<b>                         TESS
</b>
<b>                         AGAIN--
</b>
<b>                         NIKKI
</b>           Yes, again! Did you fill my spot or
           what...?

<b>                          TESS
</b>           What do you think?
          Tess and Nikki share a look.

<b>                          TESS (CONT'D)
</b>           Curtain's up in 20. Shake a leg.
           Nikki smiles, hikes her dance bag over her shoulder and heads

<b>                         BACKSTAGE--
</b>          Ali looks at Tess quizzically--

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Just like that?

<b>                         TESS
</b>          If I had a dollar for every time
          she's quit...

<b>                         ALI
</b>          Really?

<b>                         TESS
</b>          We all fight. Bitch. Love and hate.
          And then make up. Just like
          sisters.

<b>                         ALI
</b>          I never had a sister.

<b>                         TESS
</b>          Me neither. THANK GOD.

<b>                         (THEN)
</b>
<b>                         (MORE)

<b>          134.
</b>
<b>                         TESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Now get your cute little ass and
          big ole' voice up on stage, cause
          this is Burlesque, baby girl, where
          the women are always on top, and
          the men like it that way. Like I've
          always said --

<b>                         ALI/TESS
</b>          You can't keep a good girl down.

<b>          BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM
</b>          Ali walks into the dressing room. Sits down in front of her
          mirror. Across the room, Nikki is sitting at hers. Ali looks
          at Nikki in the reflection of her mirror. Their eyes meet.
          Then Nikki nods. And Ali nods back. For the first time, a
          mutual respect.
          All the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room.
          Chatting, gossiping, changing their clothes. The legs, boobs,
          fishnets, etc. Things back the way there were, and the way
          they'll always be.
          ON ALI. She looks at herself in the mirror. Picks up the make-
          up brush Tess gave her. Dips it in water. Then applies a line
          on her eye expertly. She smiles to herself. MUSIC UP: A heavy
          bass drumlin beat which takes us to...

<b>          INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC
</b>
          A SPOTLIGHT. MOVING down the smoke-filled shaft of light as--
          A FIGURE RISES into view at the back of the stage. Over the
          contemporary BEAT, we HEAR a beautiful classic opera
          (Carmen?) REVEAL...it's NIKKI! She sings a line or two in an
          amazing operatic voice that totally blows us away. Then ...a
          DANCE BEAT KICKS IN as COCO comes into view, and sings
          another line. Then Jessie. Then Scarlett. And FINALLY...
          Ali RISES into view, wearing a diamond studded Gaultier-type
          harness top and sequined hot-pants. This song (to be written)
          is a contemporary dance song about BURLESQUE with a vintage
          feel to it. Nikki and the Burlesque Girls, in similar
          costumes, back Ali as she SINGS her big finale. CAMERA MOVES
          through the packed house as we SEE Georgia, Sean, Mark (the
          DJ) and Tess, who double-takes at MR. ANDERSON (the
          Businessman) who sees her and smiles.
          ON STAGE, ALI and the entire company explode in a surreal
          whirl of dancing. Turning. Kicking. Arched backs. Legs
          overhead. Rhinestones. Garters. Fishnets. The entire company,
          band and bartenders join in an all out BOLLYWOOD FINALE.

                         

<b>          135.
</b>          CAMERA MOVES INTO THE CLUB as music CROSSFADES with the
          SOUNDS of people TALKING. Glasses CLINKING. All the
          background sounds of a busy nightclub. A LOUD DRUM ROLL takes
          us to...
          A LOW CAMERA moving across a black stage as we MOVE IN ON the
          footlights which become a MILLION BRILLIANT LIGHTS blasting
          into camera, blinding us until they form letters reading:
