A security guard named David Dunn is coming home from work, when the train he is on is suddenly derailed, the train crashes, and he is the sole survivor, out of 132 people.
Without a scratch on his body.
Soon he is contacted by comic-book store owner Elijah Price whose bones are easily breakable, who claims David is a superhero.
