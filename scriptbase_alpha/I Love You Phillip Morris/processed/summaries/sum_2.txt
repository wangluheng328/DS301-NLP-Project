Steven Russell would admit that most of his life has been a lie, those lies starting when he found when he was an adolescent that he was adopted.
Those lies include being a closet homosexual while being married to a woman named Debbie, and committing continual fraud to support the lavish lifestyle associated with being what he considers the epitome of a gay lifestyle once he does come out.
In prison for committing those acts of fraud, Steven falls in love at first sight with fellow inmate Phillip Morris, a shy, quiet gay man.
Phillip, in return, falls in love with Steven.
But in providing what he feels Phillip would want in life, especially if they make it out of prison together, Steven may feel like he has to resort to what he knows best, that being fraud.
Phillip, on the other hand, if he finds out about what Steven is up to, may not be able to tolerate the behavior despite never having met a man who makes him feel like Steven does.
