JAZZ MUSIC playing in the background.

OUTSIDE THE LOFTMORE RESIDENCE - NIGHT Lightning and thunder crash as 
we see the old LOFTMORE residence.  Sounds of FIGHTING come from the 
inside.  

INSIDE THE LOFTMORE RESIDENCE - NIGHT FIGURE has MARKS GRANDFATHER by 
the head, pushing him towards a BURNING fireplace.  MARKS GRANDFATHERS 
head gets pushed into the fireplace.  Show FIGURES'S hand smashing 
glass cases, finally grabbing a medallion and other assorted objects.  
MARKS GRANDFATHER, now burning, attempts to get up.  FIGURE stuffs 
objects into a black satchel, closing it as MARKS GRANDFATHER gives up 
the fight and succumbs to the flames.  

CUE WAXWORK THEME MUSIC, rolling acting credits as camera zooms in on 
the FIRE of the fireplace.  

LOFTMORE RESIDENCE, PRESENT DAY

Show fireplace, without fire, as well as a portrait of MARKS 
GRANDFATHER.  MARK and MARKS  MOTHER sit at opposite ends of a long 
table which the PORTRIAT hangs over.  MARK is reading the  newspaper.

MARKS MOTHER 
Darling?  I hear you were having drinks with the butler the other 
night.  Now  you know that sort of thing leads to anarchy.

MARK 
Mom.

MARKS MOTHER 
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'

MARK 
They're all human beings

MARKS MOTHER 
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have 
disappeared

MARK 
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?

MARKS MOTHER 
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for 
college

MARK 
Mom, when are you going to let me have some coffee in the morning?

MARKS MOTHER 
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you

MARK 
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY

MARKS MOTHER 
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.

MARK folds up his paper, setting it down on the table and exits the 
room.

HALLWAY - DAYTIME

JENKINS, the butler is standing at the ready with MARKS books.

 JENKINS 
Your books Master Loftmore

MARK 
Thank you Jenkins 

 JENKINS 
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir

MARK 
Thank you

JENKINS 
And uh, your nicotine sir

MARK 
Thank you

JENKINS 
Allow me sir

JENKINS takes out a lighter and lights the cigarette

JENKINS 
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?

MARK 
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air

JENKINS 
Have a nice day (cough) sir

OUTSIDE THE LOFTMORE RESIDENCE - DAY MARK exits his house smoking his 
cigarette

SIDEWALK - DAY

SARAH 
I saw the greatest movie with mark last night

CHINA 
With Mark?

SARAH 
He still likes you

CHINA 
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to 
spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we 
went out he  actually made me pay for a drink? 

 SARAH 
He did?

 CHINA 
Yes, I'm sure.  
(Sighs)  
What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style.  
Someone who knows how to treat a lady.

SARAH 
Businessman?

CHINA 
Businessman!

SARAH 
Doctor? Lawyer? 
  CHINA 
Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.

SARAH 
Yeah, yeah, OK

CHINA 
Yeah (Sighs)

 SARAH 
So why are you dating Jonathan?

CHINA Dating?  Grow up Sarah, one night of fun.  Anyway, Johnny may not 
have a lot  of class, but.

SARAH 
But?

CHINA 
But he still has something Mark hasn't.

SARAH 
What's that?

CHINA 
A body.  I mean we're talking major body

SARAH - kicks CHINA lightly and jokingly 
China! You're awful! You're a whore! 
  CHINA - laughing 
I am!

CHINA and SARAH are now walking next to a white picket fence.  Camera 
pans down revealing the  WAXWORK.

SARAH 
Strange, I've never seen that before

CHINA Yeah.  Weird place for a waxwork, maybe they don't like customers 
(laughs at  herself)

Camera pans back revealing a shocked look on both SARAH and CHINAS 
faces as they see MR  LINCOLN standing there looking up at the sky.

MR LINCOLN 
I'm sorry ladies, did I startle you?

CHINA 
Heart attack maybe, startle no.

MR LINCOLN 
I see you're interested in my waxworks, yes?

SARAH 
Well.

CHINA Yeah.  In fact we were just saying it's kind of a weird place to 
have one.  I  mean, on a street like this.

MR LINCOLN 
Really?  Why?

SARAH - looking around, noticeably freaked out 
Customers and that.  (LOOKS at CHINA) We gotta get back to class.

CHINA 
Yeah.  Nice meeting you mister.

MR LINCOLN 
Mister?

CHINA looks turned on by this.

SARAH 
Come on China (NUDGES CHINA with her BOOKS)

MR LINCOLN 
I'm having a private showing tonight.  At midnight.

CHINA 
Hmmm.  Good time.  After dinner but before breakfast.

MR LINCOLN You can bring some friends of course.  No more than six 
though.  Otherwise I'm  afraid we might be a bit full.

CHINA 
Oh. you're expecting a crowd

MR LINCOLN 
Like I said, no more than six

CHINA smiles and her and SARAH turn away

MR LINCOLN 
See you at midnight then

CHINA and SARAH turn back, but MR LINCOLN is gone.  SARAH looks nervous 
and CHINA giggles.

CHINA 
Oooooh Scaaaarrrrryyy

The two turn and run off to class.

SIDEWALK - DAY

MARK is lightly walking to class

GIRL 
Morning Mark!

MARK 
Hey, how you doing?  I'm late.

MARK runs off at a brisk jog.





LECTURE HALL - DAY  The decor is old 1940 Nazi posters.  A large Nazi 
flag is erected by the LECTURER.  The LECTURER  speaks with a strong 
GERMAN accent.  LECTURER In June of 1941, Operation Barbarossa attacked 
the Soviet Union - and the three  Baltic States, simultaneously.  In 
just the matter of a few days, the Lithuanians  FELL Under the assault 
of the Nazi Blitzkrieg.  The German occupation, and  Hitlers 
announcement of an Austland (?) Republic, meant the END of the  
Lithuanian culture.

MARK enters the lecture hall from doors in the back.

LECTURER 
Good afternoon Herr Loftmore

MARK 
Good morning - Sir

LECTURER You obviously know all about the Lithuanian struggle, 
otherwise you would  have attended the first fifteen minutes of the 
lecture, ja?


MARK - looking smug Yes sir


LECTURER Good.  Tomorrow I want a twenty-page essay on the subject now 
sit down.


MARK Thank you sir


LECTURER Now where was I?  What was I talking about in my notes?  Where 
are my notes? My notes may be here ja?

MARK takes a seat next to CHINA, SARAH, and TONY near the back of the 
lecture hall


MARK Thanks for that phone call that I never received last night


LECTURER And so.


CHINA Well I must be drawing a blank.  I don't remember Jonathan ever 
letting me use  his phone.


TONY 
OH!  Gotta hurt!


MARK You went out with JONATHAN LAST NIGHT! What are you?  CRAZY?!


LECTURER 
And Mr. Loftmore, I nearly forgot.  I also want a 40-page essay on the 
trouble  with DICTATORS! (Raises his pointer to the ceiling in a Seig 
Heil fashion)

FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY It's a sunny day.  In the stands we see SARAH, 
TONY, and MARK

MARK 
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night

TONY 
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch

SARAH 
Hey, China's a friend of mine

CHINA and JONATHAN, a football player sans shirt, are standing next to 
each other down by the field. 

MARK 
Look at that. If he got on top of you, you'd have a better chance with 
a  steamroller.

TONY - holds up his fingers a few inches apart 
You know what they say about body builders man, this big right here

SARAH 
Stop saying things so loud!

TONY 
Oh! The virgin has spoken! SARAH 
Stop it!

CHINA - joining the rest of them in the bleachers 
Hi! TONY - holding his fingers up again 
Hey, is it true what they say about body builders.

CHINA 
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that 
big.

MARK 
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA 
Jeez.  Can't even take a joke

TONY 
Save it for the powder room babe, this man is in pain

SARAH 
You guys are being real assholes

MARK 
Thank you Sarah

CHINA - sarcastically 
Thank you Sarah

JONATHAN 
Hey babe, are we going to catch a flick tonight, get a little of that 
back row  boogie?

CHINA 
Oh I don't know handsome, I'm a little tired

JONATHAN 
Yeah, me too after last night.  Hey Mark, want to go play catch?  Or 
are you  incapable of doing that as well?

MARK starts to get up but TONY stops him 
  TONY 
Don't do it superman, you only got one life man.

JAMES and GEMMA walk onto where the four are sitting

JAMES 
Hey Mark, I see you've made a new friend.  I hope he'll fit through the 
front  door.


TONY Yea, sit down but no more jokes, this guy is in pain.

Scenes of football players beating the crap out of each other

GEMMA 
What's happening tonight guys?

 TONY Nothing.  I gave up drinking.


SARAH The third time this month?


JAMES Yeah I was thinking of renting a horror film, what do ya say?


GEMMA Ooooh. That's a new idea


TONY Sound's alright.  How about you Marcus?


MARK 60 pages on Lithuanian dictators or something.

More scenes of football players. 
  CHINA 
Well, Sarah and I were invited to a late night waxwork show by the 
handsomest  gentleman

GEMMA 
No kidding?

CHINA Mmmm.It's a private show though.  We can bring a few select 
friends.  

More scenes of football action

JAMES 
Ah, waxworks are out of date; this is the video age.

CHINA 
Well, Sarah and I are going, how about you Tone?

TONY 
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people (turns towards JAMES and  
GEMMA)

SARAH 
Come on Mark MARK 
Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays

TONY 
YES!

Back on the field, JONATHAN punches one of the other players out cold.

LOFTMORE RESIDENCE - LOUNGE - NIGHT TIME

SARAH, JAMES, CHINA, TONY and GEMMA are all seated in a lounge, 
drinking and smoking.  MARK  is off camera.

MARK 
Anybody want another drink?

CHINA 
It's eleven forty-five let's go

TONY 
What's the rush babe, got a date with Jonathan after the show?

CHINA 
Can't a girl get laid around here without being burned at the stake?

MARK (with cigarette in mouth and smirk on face) 
Anybody got a match?

CHINA (noticeably pissed off) 
I do what I want, when I want.  Dig it or fuck off.


CHINA stands up and walks out the doorway, MARK follows after.

TONY 
Oh ho! That's. SARAH, JAMES, TONY, GEMMA 
...gotta hurt!

HALLWAY IN LOFTMORE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

CHINA walks into the hallway, throwing the door open wide.  MARK 
follows after but is hit in the face by  the closing door.  CHINA is 
sitting on what appears to be a dresser.  MARK walks over.
CHINA sighs.

MARK 
We need to talk. CHINA 
Yeah about what?

MARK 
About what?  About us.

CHINA 
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.

MARK 
Right. 
  CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class 
babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A 
little `je nes se qua'.

MARK 
A little what? CHINA 
See.  You don't even speak French.

MARK 
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?

CHINA 
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?

MARK 
Suffer?  We're living in America.

CHINA (giggles) 
Mark, you're very sweet.  But you just don't get it.

MARK (as CHINA turns and walks away) 
Shit.

SIDEWALK OUTSIDE OF WAXWORK. - NIGHT

SARAH, JAMES, GEMMA, CHINA, TONY, and MARK are walking along the 
sidewalk en route to the  WAXWORK.  They approach the white picket 
fence surrounding the WAXWORK and stop.

JAMES 
Nice place for a waxwork.

CHINA 
Yea, that's what we said.

SARAH 
Looks a little spooky boys, you think we should do this?

TONY 
Never fear, Tony is here.  Ladies first.

CHINA 
Well what a gentleman. I think I'll play feminist tonight.

MARK Guys, could we hurry this up a little bit.  I'm a little worried 
about my maid's  knowledge of Lithuania, ok.

CHINA 
Well if you're in such a rush darling, why don't you lead the way?

MARK 
Ok toots, I will.

TONY throws the gate open.  MARK turns back to the gang and pulls down 
the breasts of his suit jacket.MARK walks slowly towards the WAXWORK.  
When he's about halfway there, a cat meows, causing the  rest of the 
gang to come running up towards him.

MARK 
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.

TONY 
Safety in numbers man.

MARK 
Right.

MARK continues walking towards the WAXWORK, the others lagging behind.  
He's now almost to the  front door.

MARK (turning back) 
You know I . . .  What was that about safety in numbers?

TONY 
So we're fickle.

GEMMA 
James, I want to go home. JAMES 
What?!  It was your idea to come in the first place.

GEMMA 
Yeah but this is not my idea of fun.

TONY 
Come on Gems, let's just take a look.

GEMMA 
No.  It just doesn't feel right guys.

GEMMA turns and starts walking away.  JAMES 
Women.  Hey honey wait up! 

JAMES quickly follows suit.

MARK 
Anyone else not coming?

TONY 
Right behind you.

The front door to the WAXWORK opens slowly, causing the cigarette to 
fall out of TONYS mouth.

TONY 
Oh shit.  It's the old door opening by itself scene.

Camera pans down to reveal a very short butler.

JUNIOR 
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.

MARK 
Uh, wrong picture Tony.

The four enter the house, CHINA noticeably trying to keep from touching 
JUNIOR

JUNIOR 
Ve vere expecting more.  The main door closes.

LOBBY OF WAXWORK - NIGHT The four enter into the lobby of the WAXWORK.  
TONY lights a cigarette.

JUNIOR 
Please sit down.

The four quickly sit, CHINA, SARAH and TONY on the couch; MARK on a 
chair separate.

JUNIOR 
Make yourselves, comfortable.

TONY motions with his hand to MARK

JUNIOR 
A drink for anyvon?

TONY motions `no' with his hand.  A side door opens and HANS walks in, 
carrying drinks on a tray.  The  four look up with surprise at HANS, 
who easily stands taller than seven feet.

JUNIOR 
You supposed to vait until I ring ve bell!  Get out!  Get out!

JUNIOR hits HANS in the leg until HANS leaves through the door he came 
in.  JUNIOR gives a quick  bow and exits the room.

TONY 
Big party.

 CHINA 
Hey, it's a private show, what do you want?

MARK 
If those guys are waxworks, they have definitely improved them since I 
was a  kid.

CHINA Oh yeah.  Well you didn't have to come you know.  I'm sure 
someone would  have loved to have taken your place.

MARK Oh yes darling, and who were you expecting, Maurice Cheval'.  
(singing) Thank  heaven, for little girls.

CHINA (laughs) 
I don't think so babe.

With that, the doors to the WAXWORK exhibit open wide, revealing a few 
of the terrors that reside within. 

TONY 
This time I really don't see anyone man.

MARK 
Must be what we came for. 
 The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind 
them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome.  
The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on 
the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give 
each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a 
Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four 
are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY 
encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife 
towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of  
werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a 
dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied 
creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped 
man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY 
walking up to a cottage room display.

 TONY 
This. is killer. 

TONY pulls out a cigarette and is about to light it when he 
accidentally flicks his lighter into the display.TONY pats himself down 
looking for another means with which to light the cigarette but finds 
nothing. 

TONY 
They won't mind if I go in for my lighter.

TONY looks around to make sure no one is watching and enters.  He is 
transported into a forest  surrounding.

FOREST - NIGHT TONY is in a dark forest.  COBWEBS from a nearby tree 
cover his face.  He spits them out.  His clothes  have become ragged 
and his hair is long and curly.  

TONY (looking noticeably disgusted) Alright.  Who put the acid in my 
drink again, China?  Wait a minute.  I gave up  drinking.  Hologram?  
No - hologram, right?  Hypnotism!  Hypnotism.  That's  it, alright I'm 
hypnotized! Alright.  

TONY looks around at his surroundings and speaks to the sky.

TONY 
Well I uh, hope you guys can hear me cause this is a hell of an 
illusion. I mean, I  can smell the pine trees.

TONY looks around again and decides on a plan of action.

TONY 
Ok - and uhhhh.. we got house.. and we got house.  I guess we'll go to 
the  house.  Alright.

TONY, noticeably pleased with his quick decision making, chuckles to 
himself as he walks towards the  house.  A wolf howls in the distance.  
TONY gets to the door and knocks on it.

WEREWOLF (as MAN) 
GO AWAY!

TONY 
Hypnotists, make this guy a little more friendly ok (knocks again)

WEREWOLF (as MAN) 
PLEASE! GO FAR FROM HERE!

TONY (talking to the sky) 
Thanks.  I'm going to go in now.  Beautiful.

TONY enters the building.  We see it is a sparse cabin with a lantern 
on the wall.  It looks incredibly  similar to the one TONY originally 
saw when he was in the WAXWORK

WEREWOLF (as MAN) 
Why didn't you listen!

The MAN (WEREWOLF) walks towards TONY and puts his hands on his 
shoulders.

WEREWOLF (as MAN) Jack, I know your father was my dearest friend, but 
you can do nothing to help  me.  TONY 
Jack?  You got the wrong guy man.

WEREWOLF (as MAN) 
JACK! You must run Jack, as far as you can!

The MAN steps back away from TONY, into the moonlight - as a wolf howls 
in the background.

WEREWOLF (as MAN) 
The full moon, has already risen.  In a few moments, I dare not think 
what will  happen.




TONY 
It's so cold in here!  Why don't I just mosey on out, get some wood - 
we'll talk.

The MAN sits down at the table and looks like he's in pain.

WEREWOLF (as MAN) 
It is. too late.

The MAN starts thrashing around at the table.

TONY Relax!  I'll go outside - get the wood.  Come back, have a cup of 
coffee, we'll  talk about it.  Become friends.  Friends - think about 
it.  Be right back.

TONY exits out of the cabin and looks up towards the sky.

TONY Get me - the hell - outta here!  I'm stuck in this cold, nowhere 
place, nowhere  to go, no cigarettes! And what am I supposed to do?  
Entertain this asshole?

The sky doesn't respond.

TONY Oh, ok great, good friends, beautiful, ok. I'll talk to the guy, 
I'll play your game,  I'll get the wood, I'll talk to him.  What?  
Wood.wood.wood.

TONY looks around and finds some chopped wood.  Meanwhile, our MAN is 
slowly becoming a  WEREWOLF inside the house.  Outside . . . 

TONY (picking up wood) How big is this wood supposed to be, you got an 
axe or something?  Caribbean.The Bahamas.  A pretty girl.  A body.  A 
bikini.  Do I get a pretty woman in my  illusion?  No.  No I get a 
dick.  This sucks man.

TONY enters the house again.This time, it's empty.


  TONY 
Guess he didn't want to talk.

WEREWOLF CAM - Enters the room and walks towards TONY who stands there 
phased.  Then, realizing  what is coming towards him, runs.

TONY 
Ahhhhhh SHIT!

TONY drops the wood and runs back up against the wall.

TONY 
Hey boys, this isn't fun anymore!  Get me the hell out of here!

TONY finds a large bone on the table and picks it up.

TONY (holding the bone out to the WEREWOLF) 
Hey boy, good boy, stay!  TONY (backing up along the wall and grabbing 
a pot) 
Don't come CLOSER!

TONY gets ready to hit the WEREWOLF with the pot but then thinks better 
of it and continues backing up  on top of a table.  TONY falls off the 
table and is backed up against a wall.  Without any other options, he  
takes a swing.  The WEREWOLF catches his arm and takes a bite out of 
it.  TONY begins screaming  painfully.

The front door of the cabin opens and the HUNTER and his ASSISTANT 
enter the room.  The hunter has a  large rifle.

HUNTER 
Damnit! We're too late!  Give me the silver bullets!

Upon hearing this, the WEREWOLF drops the screaming TONY and turns 
towards the new prey. As the WEREWOLF approaches, the ASSISTANT drops 
the silver bullets.

 HUNTER (to ASSISTANT) 
No, leave them.  Go distract it.

The WEREWOLF comes face to face with the HUNTER, staring him down.  The 
ASSISTANT, now along  an opposite wall, grabs and bottle and breaks it, 
gaining the WEREWOLFS attention.  The ASSISTANT  picks up a chair and 
bashes it against the WEREWOLFS side.  The WEREWOLFS ears perk up and 
it  brushes off its shoulder.  Meanwhile, the HUNTER loads the rifle.  
The WEREWOLF then grabs the  ASSISTANTS head and begins to crush it, 
followed by quickly ripping him in two down the MIDDLE.The HUNTER 
closes the chamber on the gun, takes aim and FIRES, hitting the 
WEREWOLF square in the  chest.  The WEREWOLF staggers back, sits down 
in a chair, and turns towards TONY, who begins the  transformation.  

TONY 
Oh! Oh this has gotta hurt!

The HUNTER picks up another of the fallen bullets, loads it, and takes 
aim.

HUNTER 
God forgive me.

With the shot of the gun, TONY (as WEREWOLF) dies and we see the 
exhibit again, this time, with a dead  TONY (as WEREWOLF) in it (along 
with the other WEREWOLF).  MARK walks by this exhibit, looking  for the 
others.

Camera shifts and we see SARAH walking around looking at the exhibits.  
The first she spies is a scene  from THE LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS with 
the PLANT having freshly eaten someone.  

Now we cut to CHINA who is admiring a gentleman knelt down on a 
staircase.  The staircase has many a  cobweb on it.  

CHINA 
Well what are you supposed to be doing hansom?

The `bar' in front of the exhibit suddenly drops to the ground.  CHINA 
looks around for anyone who might  see her enter.

CHINA 
Let's just take a little look.

CASTLE - NIGHT CHINA enters the exhibit and finds herself dressed in 
Victorian (if not older) era garb.

DRACULA Welcome my dear.  We thought you were too tired to join us, so 
we started  without you.  My apologies.You are going to grace us with 
your presence.Join us.

Camera cuts back and forth between DRACULAS and CHINAS eyes.

DRACULA 
Come to me.

CHINA descends down the stairs toward the table.

DRACULA 
You've met my son, Stephan.

STEPHAN, standing near DRACULA, takes a bow.

DRACULA 
Please, be seated.

CHINA takes a seat at the other head of the table.  

DRACULA (still standing - points to the female vampires) 
This is Corrinja, Vega, Gabriella, and Emma.

DRACULA sits down and continues.




  DRACULA I'm so sorry your fiancée couldn't join us, he had to leave 
very abruptly.  But he  asked me to watch over you, at least until 
tomorrow.  I hope you'll find our  company - satisfactory.  

DRACULA claps his hands and a SERVANT comes over to CHINA, placing a 
dish in front of her.

DRACULA 
Raw meat.  You do like raw meat?  Please, if not we can have some soup.

CHINA 
No, that's fine.  I haven't had steak tartar in a long time.

DRACULA 
Steak tartar?  Oh yes, steak tartar.

A second SERVANT walks over carrying a sauce container.

CHINA (waving her hand) 
Oh, no.

DRACULA No sauce?  But the sauce makes the dish.  Well, if our guest 
doesn't like the  sauce.

CHINA 
No that's ok.  If you recommend it I'll try it.

The SERVANT pours the dark red substance on top of the steak tartar.

DRACULA 
It's a little salty; but that's all part of its charm.



CHINA cautiously looks around - the rest of the table is watching her.  
Slowly she picks up a fork and  begins eating.  With the first bite, 
the rest of the table, sans DRACULA, almost dives literally headfirst 
into  their meal.  DRACULA hits the table causing them to look up at 
him.  With a silent look the vampires  cronies take up their napkins 
and forks.  However, they still down the meal rapidly.  After the meal 
is done,  STEPHAN and DRACULA both rise.

DRACULA 
I must bid you goodnight.  Ludwig will show you to your room.

LUDVIG, one of the SERVANTS, leads CHINA up the stairs and down a long 
hallway.  Before long, they  reach her room.  CHINA enters, LUDVIG 
closing the doors behind her.

CHINA 
Wow.  What an intense dream.

CHINA explores the room, discovering a closet full of clothes.  

CHINA 
Great dress.

STEPHAN suddenly enters through the front door.

CHINA 
Doesn't a gentleman knock?

STEPHAN If my father knew I was here, he'd banish me from the castle.  
He wants you for  himself.

STEPHAN is close to CHINA at this point, bending down as if to kiss 
her. CHINA 
Hey, not so fast.

STEPHAN suddenly bares his fangs.  CHINA dodges at the last minute 
causing STEPHAN to bite into the  bust that was behind her.

STEPHAN 
Bitch!

CHINA runs out of the room, down the hallway, back into the dining 
room, and finally through a door  leading into a white ceramic tiled 
room.  

CHARLES (Off screen) 
Darling?  Is that you?  It's me, Charles.

CHINA 
Charles?

CHARLES 
Yes.  Charles, you're fiancée.

CHINA looks around for some sort of light switch - and finds one

CHARLES (Off screen) 
Don't turn it on!  I don't want you to see me like this.

CHINA turns on the light and we can finally see all of CHARLES.  His 
LOWER LEFT LEG has been  chewed away, most likely as the steak tartar.  
CHINA starts crying.

CHARLES 
Oh dear darling.

CHINA It's all a game.  The waxwork.  A game.  It isn't real.  It's all 
just a sick stupid  game!  YES!

CHARLES 
YES! I wish it were so!  AHHHHHHH!!! GET IT OFF!

A rat has taken a liking to CHARLES leg.  CHINA brushes the horrid 
beast away.



CHARLES AHHHH!Thank you.  Now listen carefully.  The Count, is a 
vampire.  They all  are.  You have to destroy them! 
 
  CHINA (messing with the chains holding CHARLES down) 
Come on, I can pick this.

CHARLES 
No! It's too late for that!

CHINA 
Vampires are fiction!

CHARLES No! They're real!  And they can only be killed by a crucifix, 
wood through their  heart, or decapitation!

Another set of doors suddenly bursts open, with STEPHAN coming through 
them.

STEPHAN 
So my pretty, you came down for a little midnight snack?

CHARLES 
Don't look in his eyes!

STEPHAN 
I too feel peckish.  First, the h'our dourve

STEPHAN peels a chunk of skin off of CHARLES leg.  CHARLES meanwhile is 
screaming like mad.CHINA starts crying again.

STEPHAN 
Now - the entrée.

STEPHAN leans over CHARLES and tries to grab CHINA.

CHINA 
No! Don't! No!

The two continue running back from end to end of the table until 
finally STEPHAN falls on top of  CHARLES leg, causing CHARLES to scream 
madly.  STEPHAN finally runs around the end of the table.CHINA picks up 
a CHARLES Carving knife and PLUNGES it into STEPHANS chest. STEPHAN 
pulls  it out and STABS it into CHARLES good leg.  Once again, CHARLES 
screams madly.  CHINA dodges  another STEPHAN attack and grabs two of 
the knives (one being the one in CHARLES leg) and makes a  cross out of 
them.  She TURNS and holds it towards STEPHAN.

CHARLES 
Touch his head!  Touch his head!

CHINA, now determined, leans forward and holds the makeshift cross to 
STEPHANS head.  STEPHAN in  turn, howls in pain and ultimately, his 
HEAD explodes.

CHARLES Brilliant darling! Now find the Count!  Look over there!  Break 
the chair.  You  can use it's legs as stakes!

CHINA runs to the chair and hesitates.

CHARLES 
BREAK IT!

Just as CHINA breaks the chair, the doors burst open and the female 
vampires enter.  CHINA wields the  stake as a sword and clocks one of 
the vampires over the head, knocking her onto CHARLES.  The other  
three rush her, but she fends them off by driving the stake into the 
heart of two of them.  One of them is  knocked back towards the wall of 
champagne, where the bottles pierce her body, spraying champagne all  
over the room.  CHINA takes a knife and stabs the last remaining 
vampire (the one on CHARLES) in the  back, dragging it off his body.  
CHARLES shows his new set of fangs and CHINA runs out of the room -  
back into the dining room.  She tries one set of doors and while 
walking backwards she hears the sound of  wings flapping.  She turns to 
discover the COUNT.

DRACULA 
Going somewhere my beauty?

CHINA looks into his eyes and slowly walks towards him.  The COUNT 
flourishes his cape and CHINA  leans her neck to the side.  The COUNT 
takes her in his arms and leans her down on the stairs, baring his  
fangs.  The COUNT sinks his teeth in and we are moved out of the 
exhibit.


  MARK 
China, Sarah, where are you guys?

MARK walks in front of the DRACULA piece and walks towards a MAN IN THE 
IRON MASK exhibit. We see SARAH looking intently at a MARQUIS DE SADE 
exhibit.  MARK walks over to her.  

SARAH The Marquis de Sade once said that sex without fear and pain was 
like food  without taste.  

MARK 
Haven't we been doing our homework.

SARAH 
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.

MARK Guilt?  Society?  Good and Evil, I really don't know.  I'm going 
to go look for  the other two ok?

SARAH is still intently focused on the exhibit.

MARK 
Ok? 
 MARK walks away leaving SARAH alone with the exhibit.  The barrier in 
front of the exhibit drops and  SARAH slowly begins walking towards it.  

MARK 
Where the hell are they?

SARAH, her concentration broke, turns.

SARAH 
Somewhere around?


  MARK They're not anywhere.  I looked everywhere, I checked.  I want 
out of here  Sarah, I'm serious.

SARAH 
Getting scared?  Don't worry, they've probably just gone home.

MARK 
What?  Tony and China, together?

SARAH 
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.

MARK 
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.

MARK walks off.  SARAH takes a last look at MARQUIS DE SADE and quickly 
follows.  The two go into the main lobby outside of the exhibits and 
are greeted by JUNIOR who bows to them.  

JUNIOR 
I hope you enjoyed your visit.

MARK 
Uh yes, thank you.  It was quite enjoyable.  

JUNIOR 
Two of your friends left earlier MARK 
Uh huh.

 JUNIOR 
They seemed, closing by much (?)

MARK 
Tony and China?

JUNIOR 
Vell.  Goodnight.

OUTSIDE THE WAXWORK - NIGHT

MARK What is it with this girl?  One day its me, the next it's Charles 
Atlas, and now  Tony.  I mean what does she want?

SARAH 
Then why do you still like her?

MARK 
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what 
you can't get.

SARAH 
I know what you mean.  

SIDEWALK - NIGHT We see Jonathan walking along towards a phone booth.  
He enters and dials a number.

MRS WEBSTER (CHINAS MOTHER) 
Hello?

JONATHAN 
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?

MRS WEBSTER 
No Jonathan.

JONATHAN 
No?  

MRS WEBSTER 
She went to a waxwork party

JONATHAN 
A party at a waxwork huh?  

MRS WEBSTER 
Can I give her a message?

JONATHAN 
You don't happen to have the address do ya?

OUTSIDE THE WAXWORK - NIGHT We see JONATHAN standing outside the 
WAXWORK

INSIDE THE WAXWORK - NIGHT JONATHAN is walking around the exhibits

JONATHAN 
Guys this is Jonathan.  Where are ya?

We see HANS walking behind JONATHAN

JONATHAN 
Aww shit.  They're gone.

JONATHAN walks up to a PHANTOM OF THE OPERA exhibit, trying to get a 
better look at its mask.MR LINCOLN suddenly grabs him.

MR LINCOLN
 
Good evening.  I own this waxwork.  

JONATHAN Look, I'm sorry.  I mean I didn't mean to.  I was just 
following a friend in here  for some laughs you know.  I'll be leaving.




MR LINCOLN Well that's alright.  What's the point of having all these 
beautiful works of art if  you can't appreciate them?  For instance.

MR LINCOLN motions towards the PHANTOM piece 
  MR LINCOLN 
Isn't the figure wonderful?  As worn by the Phantom.

JONATHAN 
In the movie `Curse of the Opera'!

MR LINCOLN 
They've made a movie about the Phantom of the Opera?

JONATHAN 
Several MR LINCOLN 
Would you like a closer look?

JONATHAN 
Really?

MR LINCOLN 
Step in please.

MR LINCOLN pushes JONATHAN into the exhibit and we see the familiar 
blue glow.  Looking satisfied  he walks off.

 MR LINCOLN 
They'll make a movie about anything now a days.

In the background we see JONATHANS body in the PHANTOM exhibit.

OUTSIDE SARAHS APARTMENT - NIGHT MARK and SARAH are walking in front of 
the rich looking apartment complex.  

SARAH 
I would invite you in but it's late


  MARK 
That's ok.

MARK moves in for the goodnight kiss, but at the last moment SARAH 
moves away.
 SARAH 
No Mark.
  MARK 
Why not?

SARAH 
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.

MARK 
Come on.

SARAH 
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for 
something else.  

SARAH looks down at the ground.  MARK picks up her chin and looks at 
her.

MARK 
Hey.  It's ok.  It's alright.  Now go get some sleep.

SARAH gets a big smile on her face.

MARK 
Come on scram, get out of here.

SARAH slowly walks off.

SARAH 
Thank you.

MARK pulls out his nicotine and smokes one.  

INSIDE LOFTMORE RESIDENCE - MAIDS ROOM - NIGHT The MAID is sitting in 
front of a pile of books and papers, randomly throwing balls of paper 
at the wall.

MAID 
Loco!

The MAID starts screaming in Spanish.  A knock is heard at the door.

MAID 
Quien es?

The door opens and MARK walks in, holding a finger up to his lips and 
mouthing `be very quiet'.

MARK 
Are you finished?

MAID 
Yes.  But you know my English.  It's not so good.

The MAID hands MARK something noticeably less than 60 pages.

MARK 
No no, that's ok.  Great, footnotes and everything.  You are an angel.  

MARK walks out of the MAIDS room and stops in the hallway to read a bit 
of the paper.

MARK `The Trouble with Dictators'.  I think dictators are the bad 
people.  They have  the shouting voices and the small moustaches.  

MARK looks depressed but walks off.

INSIDE LOFTMORE RESIDENCE - MORNING MARK is sitting in his bathrobe 
talking on the phone.

MARK She didn't come home last night?  Well then.. Alright.  I'm sorry.  
I'm just a  little upset ok.  Could you tell her that Mark called?  Ok.  
Thank you.

MARK hangs up and dials another number.

MARK Hi Steve, yeah it's Mark.  Is Tony there?  He's not?  Could you 
tell him that I  called please?  Thank you.

MARK hangs up the phone.

OUTSIDE THE WAXWORK - MORNING We see Mark at the door.  When now one 
answers he runs off.

MARK (Off Screen) And I spoke to Steve and he didn't know where Tony 
was.  And I went by the  Waxwork this morning and no one was there.  I 
mean, maybe they've been  kidnapped.  Or even worse, boiled in 
wax.BLEACHERS - DAY JAMES, GEMMA, MARK, and SARAH are all seated on the 
bleachers.

 GEMMA 
Mark, maybe she had another party to go to.  

JAMES 
More like a motel to go to, you know China.

MARK 
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just 
friends.

SARAH 
That's not what you said last night.

MARK 
Ok, so maybe I was a little over emotional.  

SARAH 
A little?

MARK Sarah, I really don't care who China is screwing anymore, I really 
don't.  But  I'm positive it's not Tony.  So where are they?

JAMES 
I still vote for the motel.

MARK I'm going to give them until this afternoon.  And if we don't find 
them, I'm  going to the police I swear.



INSPECTOR ROBERTS OFFICE - DAY

INSPECTOR ROBERTS You know how many people have gone missing in this 
area in the last two  weeks?

MARK 
No.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 13. And that's a hell of a lot of people in two 
weeks.  

MARK 
And now, another two INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
And you're telling me that they've been kidnapped.  And boiled in wax?

MARK 
All I know is that there is something going on in that Waxworks.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
Now come on kid.  You can give me a better story than that.

MARK 
I told you everything that I know yes!

INSPECTOR ROBERTS Ok.  But if this is some sick joke I'll have your 
balls in the slammer so fast you  won't have time to squeal.  Do you 
understand me?

MARK nods his head.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
Good.  

OUTSIDE THE WAXWORK - DAY INSPECTOR ROBERTS, MARK, and a PLAIN CLOTHES 
COP show up in front of the WAXWORK.MARK leads them up through the 
front gate to the front door.  The PLAIN CLOTHES COP stays by the  gate 
with the car.  INSPECTOR ROBERTS knocks on the front door.

 MARK Now watch this.  This weird little tiny guy whose addicted to 
helium is going to  open the door.

The door opens, revealing MR LINCOLN

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
Weird and tiny huh?

MR LINCOLN 
Hi

INSPECTOR ROBERTS (flashing his badge) Hi.  I'm Inspector Roberts.  I'd 
appreciate a look around your waxwork if that  would be convenient.

MR LINCOLN 
Yes of course.  Why?

INSPECTOR ROBERTS This young man claims that he and some friends 
visited here last night and uh,  well they've disappeared.

MR LINCOLN (laughing) 
Well come on in please.

MR LINCOLN steps aside and INSPECTOR ROBERTS and MARK enter.  MR 
LINCOLN closes the  door behind them.

LOBBY OF WAXWORK - DAY MARK, INSPECTOR ROBERTS, and MR LINCOLN are 
gathered there talking.

MR LINCOLN As you know Inspector we're not open yet so I doubt if they 
visited this  waxwork.

 INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
Mmm-huh.

MARK 
You going to swallow that shit?

INSPECTOR ROBERTS (pointing towards MARK) 
You shut up.  (turning back to MR LINCOLN) 
I'm sorry, you were saying?



MR LINCOLN Yes.  Well its just that it couldn't possibly been this 
waxwork.  Unless they  broke in after dark.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS turns and looks at MARK

 MARK 
What?  Oh come on I don't believe this.  

MR LINCOLN 
Of course you can feel free to wander around if you wish.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
It would be a pleasure

MR LINCOLN motions with his finger for INSPECTOR ROBERTS to follow him. 
MARK begins to  follow but INSPECTOR ROBERTS turns to him.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
You - stay here. MARK 
I want to show you a waxwork that. 
  INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
SIT!

INSPECTOR ROBERTS follows MR LINCOLN into the exhibit area.  MARK takes 
a seat in the lobby.

INSIDE THE WAXWORK - DAY MR LINCOLN and INSPECTOR ROBERTS walk by the 
exhibits.  INSPECTOR ROBERTS pulls out a  cigarette and lights it. MR 
LINCOLN pulls it out of his mouth, putting it out on his finger and 
hands it back  to him.  They walk up to the MUMMY exhibit.



INSPECTOR ROBERTS Oh this is wonderful!  You know I've always been 
fascinated with Egyptian  history.

MR LINCOLN 
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
Hmm.

MR LINCOLN 
Would you like a closer look?

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
It's all rather morbid though isn't it?

MR LINCOLN (sighs) 
Well it does seem to be what the people want.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
Yes, I guess you're right

 MR LINCOLN  
Are you sure you wouldn't like a closer look?

With that MR LINCOLN grabs INSPECTOR ROBERTS by the shoulder and almost 
tosses him into the  MUMMY exhibit.  At the last second INSPECTOR 
ROBERTS catches his footing and stops him.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
No.  Really, I must be going.

OUTSIDE THE WAXWORK - DAY MARK and INSPECTOR ROBERTS are discussing the 
recent trip

MARK 
You're going to fall for that?

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
What else do you want me to do?  This isn't Russia you know.

MARK What are you going to do, wait for the next person to disappear, 
and then the  next?  Why don't you do something?

INSPECTOR ROBERTS Listen kid.  I know you're worried.  Why don't you 
just go home, your friends  have probably left a message for you there.  
Now relax.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS walks off.  MARK gives a last look at the WAXWORK.

MARK 
That's it.

MARK runs off.





LECTURE HALL - DAY The LECTURER is standing below a picture of Hitler.  
The chalkboard reads:


Test on Tues!! 
Study Chapters 12-17 
Included Invasion Of Allied Forces  
And Down Fall Of Axis

The LECTURER holds his hands in a position VERY similar to that of 
Hitler in the picture behind him

LECTURER 
Never.  Never underestimate the political significance of Mein Kampf as  
literature.

The LECTURER is interrupted as MARK stumbles in.

MARK 
Sorry I'm late sir.  I'm so sick I'm...
  (makes retching sound) 
I don't know what's wrong with me

SARAH looks on in amazement and covers her eyes.  MARK 
I feel nauseous.  Sarah's got it to, it's an incredibly contagious 
disease.

The LECTURER moans and rests on the podium.

MARK (coming over to SARAH) Excuse me I've gotta get through here.  
Sarah's gotta, she's gotta come with me  to the hospital to get X-
rated.  I mean X-rayed.  
 MARK grabs SARAHS hand and begins to bring her with him.



 MARK Come here.  I've got swollen glands and, and my tongue is coated 
and pustules,  it's terrible sir.  I think I'm gunna puke.I think she'd 
better come as quick as  possible.  I'm sorry sir I'll bring her back 
as soon as possible. 


With that, MARK and SARAH exit the classroom.  

HALLWAY AT SCHOOL - DAY MARK and SARAH run into the locker-filled 
hallway outside of the lecture hall.

MARK  
Come on!

SARAH feels MARKS forehead. 
  SARAH 
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!

MARK 
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on
 ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.  

SARAH 
Oh that explains everything.

MARK 
You don't understand.  I recognized his face now come on.

SARAH 
Big deal!

INSPECTOR ROBERTS OFFICE - DAY INSPECTOR ROBERTS looks over case files 
while a fan turns overhead.  Each face in the file he  recognizes as 
one of the faces in the waxwork exhibits.



OUTSIDE THE WAXWORK - DAY INSPECTOR ROBERTS and the PLAIN CLOTHES COP 
are sitting outside in the cop car - license  number 42530.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
First I want to see if I'm imagining things.

PLAIN CLOTHES COP 
Feeling all right?

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
I'll letcha know.

With that, INSPECTOR ROBERTS gets out of the car and loads a bullet 
into the chamber of his gun.

INSIDE THE WAXWORK - DAY INSPECTOR ROBERTS enters through a door saying 
`STAFF ONLY'.  He takes out a cigarette, looks at  a decaying head on 
the floor, and puts it back in the pack.  Instead he sticks a toothpick 
in his mouth and  begins walking by the exhibits.  He walks over to the 
DRACULA exhibit, looks at it for a bit, looks around,  and enters.  He 
walks over to where CHINA lays and pulls out a knife.  He digs under 
the skin and pulls out  a chunk of muscle-like tissue.  He tries for a 
while to use the knife to put it in a bag and then finally gives  up 
and grabs it - tossing it in the bag.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
Shit.

LOFTMORE RESIDENCE ATTIC - DAY MARK and SARAH climb into the attic of 
Marks house.  There is a nice spider web on the wall.

MARK 
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.

SARAH 
Who's is all this?



MARK My grandfathers.  Well, most of it anyways.  He was a very strange 
man.  He  was fascinated by death and horror.  My family never really 
acknowledges him,  apart from that portrait in the dining room. 

MARK and SARAH split up.  MARK goes over to an old chest while SARAH 
goes over to a different  chest.  They both thumb through old pictures 
and magazines.  MARK finally finds a copy of the `Daily  Gazette' with 
the front-page headline `HORROR LORD MURDERED'.  SARAH on the other 
hand, finds  a book entitled `Marquis De Sade'.  She begins to open it.  
A soft breeze picks up and the book begins to  glow.  

MARK 
Sarah?  Come over here

SARAH closes the book and the chest and the breeze and glow stop. She 
then comes over and sits down  next to MARK

MARK Listen to this.  "Last night, millionaire Michael Loftmore was 
found murdered in  his drawing room.  His body was badly burned, and he 
seemed to have died in  great pain.  The only thing missing from the 
house was a collection of 36  artifacts, all belonging to Loftmore. "  
And then it goes on.  Now listen to this."The only clue is the 
disappearance of a Mr. David Lincoln, Loftmore's chief  helper at the 
house.

SARAH 
Well?

MARK 
Well.  (turns to something like page 5 of the paper, revealing a 
picture of MR  LINCOLN) 
.this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.

SARAH That's the same man I originally met with China.  But he hasn't 
aged.  Mark,  what's happening?

MARK 
I don't know.  But I know where we can find out.

INSIDE THE WAXWORK - DAY INSPECTOR ROBERTS is now walking smugly around 
the exhibits with a cigarette in mouth.  He lights a  match on a nearby 
exhibit.  That being done, we then see the blue glow as he steps into 
the MUMMY  exhibit.

RA-OUL'S TOMB - DAY INSPECTOR ROBERTS looks around astonished.  He is 
wearing period clothes, straight down to the  fedora.  We see a 
PROFESSOR trying to move the cover off of a sarcophagus.  A native 
attendant stands  by. 
  PROFESSOR 
Come on Nigel, just don't stand there, give me a hand.

A GIRL stands next to INSPECTOR ROBERTS.

PROFESSOR 
Come on Nigel.

 GIRL  
Help the Professor darling.

The INSPECTOR looks around, still amazed.

PROFESSOR Whew.  This one's a heavy one.  Come on Nigel, give me a 
hand.  Push the darn  thing.  

INSPECTOR ROBERTS tosses his hat down and begins helping the PROFESSOR 
push the lid off of the  sarcophagus.With the two of them pushing, the 
cover is slowly lifted away.  Inside is a simple corpse  holding a 
scroll.  INSPECTOR ROBERTS mouths the word `what'.  The PROFESSOR frees 
the scroll  from the corpses hands and unrolls it.  

PROFESSOR 
It's a curse.

The NATIVE begins bowing on the ground for forgiveness.

PROFESSOR Those who desecrate the Tomb of Ra-oul will be condemned to a 
painful death  at the hands of.

The sarcophagus on the wall opens revealing THE MUMMY.  The GIRL 
screams.

PROFESSOR 
Good heavens.  It's the mummy.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
Shit!  Let's get the hell out of here!

The door to the chamber suddenly slides shut.

GIRL 
Ahhhhhh!!! Jesus!

 INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
The door! What's at the door?!

The MUMMY slowly starts walking towards our party.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
There's a lever around here someplace!

INSPECTOR ROBERTS and the GIRL start pulling on torches with the hopes 
that they'll open the door.The NATIVE is still bowing.  The MUMMY 
closes upon him and crushes his head under its foot.  

GIRL 
Oh my goodness.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS (reaching for where his gun would normally be - then  
turning to the PROFESSOR) 
Haven't you got a gun or anything?

PROFESSOR 
Yes... my bag. on the other side of the tomb.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS runs to the other side and begins rifling through the 
bag trying to find the gun.Meanwhile, the PROFESSOR has picked up a 
spear and is planning on holding off the MUMMY.  It takes  two swipes 
at the PROFESSOR, and then when it's back is turned, he PLUNGES the 
spear through it's  chest.  The MUMMY turns around, grabs the 
PROFESSOR, and pulls him toward itself - impaling him on  the spear.  
INSPECTOR ROBERTS finds the gun, which is empty, and loads it.  After 
the MUMMY is  done with the PROFESSOR, it begins walking towards 
INSPECTOR ROBERTS and the GIRL.INSPECTOR ROBERTS aims on the MUMMY and 
fires, slowly making his way towards the door.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS (to the GIRL) 
Don't just lay there.  Open the damn  (fires gun) 
Door!

The INSPECTOR runs out of bullets and the MUMMY hits him with a right 
backhand.  The MUMMY  then turns, picks up the GIRL and throws her into 
the waiting arms of the CORPSE.  INSPECTOR  ROBERTS gets up and starts 
throwing punches at the MUMMY.  Meanwhile, what appears to be a BOA is  
in the sarcophagus with the GIRL, slowly making it's way towards her 
face.  The MUMMY easily picks up  ROBERTS and tosses him into the 
sarcophagus with the GIRL, CORPSE, and BOA.  Then, despite their  
screaming, it picks up the lid and places it on the sarcophagus.

OUTSIDE SIR WILFREDS HOUSE - DAY MARK and SARAH run up and ring the 
doorbell.

INSIDE SIR WILFREDS HOUSE - DAY We see SIR WILFRED laying the piano.  
Decorating the walls are eclectic objects such as spears and tribal  
masks.  SIR WILFRED'S BUTLER leads MARK and SARAH over to the room 
where SIR WILFRED is  at.  He stops mid piano stroke.

SIR WILFRED 
Hello Mark!  Sit down here fellow sit down!  I am.

Now we see that SIR WILFRED is confined to a wheelchair.  

MARK 
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.

SIR WILFRED 
Hi there Sarah

SARAH 
Hello


 
  SIR WILFRED Just call me Wilfy.  Everyone else does.  Now, how bout a 
whiskey.  Maybe  someone's drunk?

MARK 
No thank you sir we're fine.  

SIR WILFRED 
So Mark, what's so urgent?

MARK 
Well, it's a long story.SIR WILFRED 
Oh good share.  I love them

MARK 
I think Sarah should start.

SIR WILFRED Even better, won't have to look at your eyes too much.  
Well come on young  lady, haven't got all day.

SARAH 
Well, it all started when a friend and I

MARK 
China

SARAH China and I were walking to class in my neighborhood, and we ran 
into this  man.

THE POLICE CAR OUTSIDE THE WAXWORK - DAY The PLAIN CLOTHES COP is now 
suspicious about INSPECTOR ROBERTS.  He loads his gun and in  great 
CHiPs style, goes into the front door of the WAXWORK.  

LOBBY INSIDE THE WAXWORK - DAY The PLAIN CLOTHES COP (with his 
SUNGLASSES on) slowly makes his way around a corner - not  noticing 
HANS behind him.  HANS grabs him and breaks his neck.  The PLAIN 
CLOTHES COP falls to  the ground - dead.  HANS seems pleased with 
himself.  MR LINCOLN walks in.

MR LINCOLN What the hell did you kill him for?!  We still need two 
more, he would have  been perfect!

HANS sits down in a chair and begins crying. MR LINCOLN (soothing HANS) 
That's alright.  I'm sorry I shouted.  You've got to learn your own 
strength.You're a big boy now, very big.  Hans, we'd better find some 
new visitors.We're running out of time.  

(directing to the corpse of the PLAIN CLOTHES COP) 
Get rid of that, it's useless.



SIR WILFREDS STUDY - DAY SARAH  Mark found the article in the attic, 
and uh, about the murder and Mr. Lincoln,  and so that's why he thought 
we should come and see you.

MARK puts a cigarette out in a hoofed ashtray.

SIR WILFRED (putting down his whiskey) This is very serious you see 
your grandfather, bless him, had collected over the  years 18 trinkets 
belonging to 18 of the most evil men there have ever been.

MARK 
Well?

SIR WILFRED 
Well divide 18 into three

MARK 
Six six and six

SIR WILFRED Yes, the number of the Devil.  Your grandfather and I were 
fascinated by the  horror stuff.  We talked about it, we played a 
little, never really took it too  seriously.  Mr. Lincoln, obviously 
does.

MARK 
Who is this Mr. Lincoln?

SIR WILFRED Well, he had his own waxwork show in San Francisco but it 
failed.  Before he  started working for your grandfather.

MARK He murders my grandfather 40 years ago, and yet he still doesn't 
look a day over  50?

SIR WILFRED 
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either

MARK 
Sell my soul?  

SIR WILFRED 
Any student of Black Magic can do it.  (wheels into the nearby library) 
.most of these books will tell you how! 
  SARAH 
So what happens 
when you've sold out?

SIR WILFRED 
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.

MARK 
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate 
balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found 
a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by 
making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he 
possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing 
victim, you can bring him back to life!

SARAH gives a look of concern.








  SIR WILFRED But what you have discovered is even more terrifying!  
You see your  grandfather not only collected their belongings, but also 
a small piece, from the  dwelling of the deceased.  What Lincoln has 
done is to recreate a whole scene  from each characters life, which 
becomes like a small time vessel.  The whole  display is the ghost, not 
just the figures.  He doesn't need to kill anyone,  sacrifice, or use 
spells; he just sits back while the display does it for him.  Until  
the day, when there are 18 victims.  A time when 18, of the most evil 
souls,  there have ever been, shall live again - destroying the world, 
with the help of  their possessed.  The voodoo end of the world, when 
the dead shall rise, and  consume all things.

MARK 
Can this be stopped?

SIR WILFRED 
Maybe before the event, never after.  

SARAH 
What can we do?

SIR WILFRED You must burn the waxwork.  But most important, the ones 
that have not yet  claimed lives, that way, the chain can never be 
finished.  Now you must hurry!  I  wish I could help but I can only be 
your hindrance.
  MARK 
But.. SIR WILFRED 
You must go now!

MARK 
Come on Sarah

MARK and SARAH walk out of the study.

MARK 
Thank you Sir Wilfred


SIR WILFRED 
Good luck

SIR WILFRED dials a number on the phone.

SIR WILFRED 
Tell the others our Mr. Lincoln has been found.  It has begun.

OUTSIDE THE WAXWORK - NIGHT A taxi drops off MARK and SARAH outside the 
WAXWORK.  MARK is carrying a small bag.

SARAH 
Why can't we just burn it down from the outside?

MARK Right.  They douse the flames and we get arrested for arson, that 
would be nice.No, we've got to burn down each display ourselves.

MARK reaches into his paper bag pulling out lighter fluid.

MARK 
Let's find our way around back.

BACK OF THE WAXWORK - NIGHT MARK knocks out some glass and opens a 
window

MARK 
Be careful.  I can't see a damn thing.

MARK lights his lighter revealing a spooky face.

MARK 
Don't worry, it's only wax.  There's a light switch.

SARAH flips the switch, revealing that they are in the basement of the 
WAXWORK.  In the middle of the  room is a large pot filled with boiling 
wax.  A staircase is at the far end of the room, leading up.

EXHIBIT PARLOR - NIGHT MARK and SARAH enter in through the same `STAFF 
ONLY' door that INSPECTOR ROBERTS used.They walk past the WEREWOLF 
exhibit and MARK notices the strange resemblance to TONY.

MARK 
Sar.

Before he can finish, MARK notices that she has gone off.  She's 
standing in front of the MARQUIS DE  SADE exhibit again.  

MARK (whispering) Sarah! What are you doing?! We have to burn the 
victimless displays!  Move it!Come on girl, move it!

MARK has set himself down in front of a living dead display and is 
getting read to douse it with lighter  fluid.  

MARK 
Sarah, come on!

The familiar sound of someone entering an exhibit is heard. 

MARK 
Sarah?

MARK himself is suddenly pushed into the exhibit.  We see standing 
behind him HANS and JUNIOR

JUNIOR 
Bravo!

THE PRINCES CHAMBER - DAY The MARQUIS DE SADE and the PRINCE are 
standing in front of an attendant.

PRINCE 
To a divine lunch Marquis

The two toast.  PRINCE Well, are we riding, or do you have something 
slightly more vigorous for this  afternoon's entertainment.  

MARQUIS DE SADE I don't know about you your majesty, but I do get so 
bored with whipping -  whores.

The MARQUIS snaps his fingers and SARAH (wearing a blindfold and a 
white gown) is lead in by two  ATTENDENTS.  One of the ATTENDENTS 
removes the blindfold.

MARQUIS DE SADE 
How would you like to ride this little philly, until she drops?

PRINCE What a wonderful idea.  What fine lines.  So fit.  So unbroken.  
Someday you  can show me the rest of your stable.  

MARQUIS DE SADE (putting on his whipping glove) 
Shall we see, how long it will take, to break her?  (turning to the 
PRINCE for his crop) 
May I?

PRINCE 
Well of course. 
  MARQUIS DE SADE 
Please, have a seat.

While the PRINCE takes a seat, two ATTENDENTS
strap SARAHS wrists in irons which are hanging  from the ceiling.  They 
then undo the straps on the back of her gown, revealing her bare back.  

MARQUIS DE SADE (removing SARAHS wig) What a beautiful sight no?  
First, I'm going to warm you up with the Prince's  riding crop, after 
which I'm going to hand you to the Prince and his consorts to  use you 
like the whore you are. Then my beauty, I shall beat you again, until  
you die.

The MARQUIS hits SARAH once, and we are transported to.

GRAVEYARD - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE MARK looks at his surroundings.  
There are many gravestones all around him.  Three or four figures can  
be seen approaching.  MARK is walking backwards when a ZOMBIE grabs his 
foot.  MARK falls to the  ground and is struggling with the ZOMBIE and 
we see more approaching.  MARK grabs a nearby rock and  beats the 
ZOMBIES WRIST with it, until its hand is chopped off.  MARK begins 
making his way towards  the gate but the HAND is still attached to his 
leg.  He pulls it off only to have it grab on to his wrist.  It does  
this twice (one on each hand).  The ZOMBIES are fast approaching.  MARK 
looks at the top of the gate  and sees that it is spiked.  He takes a 
leap and PLUNGES the hand onto one of the spikes.  He then throws  the 
gate open and is greeted with the blue barrier.  The ZOMBIES continue 
coming.  MARK feels around  the barrier, realizing what it is.  He 
turns, and faces down the oncoming horde.  

MARK None of this is real.  I was forced in here.  If I don't believe 
in you, then you  don't exist. 

The ZOMBIES look at each other.

MARK 
Shit I hope I'm right.

MARK leaps towards the barrier and lands in.

WAXWORK - EXHIBIT PARLOR - NIGHT JUNIOR and HANS stand outside the 
exhibit.

JUNIOR 
Grab him!

HANS chases after MARK trying to grab hold of him but MARK out runs him 
and runs toward the  MARQUIS DE SADE exhibit.  He leaps and lands in.

FRENCH HALLWAY - DAY MARK is in dark hallway but rays of sunlight come 
in from behind him.  A sole French GUARD is on  duty.  

GUARD (with gun out) 
De vous.  Ket ve vula.

MARK (holding his hands up) 
I'm sorry.  I've never been very good at languages.

MARK grabs the gun and tosses the guard against the wall.  The two 
struggle but MARK finally throws  him into an iron door, knocking him 
unconscious.

THE PRINCES CHAMBER - DAY

MARQUIS DE SADE I have never seen a girl, take so much. She's an even 
bigger whore than I first  thought. 
  PRINCE 
Then why you stop Marquis?  Beat her more.  

MARQUIS DE SADE But your highness.  If I beat her more, she may not 
survive.  And then, you  won't have a chance to feel this white virgin 
flesh.  

PRINCE Then we shall pleasure another of your sluts.  I want to see 
this whore die at the  whip now.

MARQUIS DE SADE 
As your highness wishes.

The MARQUIS takes his whip from the wall.

MARQUIS DE SADE 
Now, my pretty rose; you die.

FRENCH HALLWAY - DAY  MARK stands outside a door holding the gun.  
Slowly he pushes the door open.  Inside is a chamber with  women 
dressed scantily.

ROOM - DAYGIRL  Lucky bitch.  Just because she is a virgin she gets to 
get beaten in front of the  English Prince?  I mean, we were all 
virgins once.

MARK gives up on this room and continues down the hallway.  

THE PRINCES CHAMBER The MARQUIS DE SADE is whipping away at SARAH.  
MARK enters from between some curtains.  The  PRINCE and two GUARDS 
draw their weapons.  The MARQUIS stops whipping and looks on.


  SARAH (in gasped breaths) 
Please don't stop.  Please whip me more.  Don't stop.  Don't stop.  
More. MARK walks up to SARAH and unlocks her irons.  The MARQUIS looks 
on.  SARAH then turns, and  grabs on to the MARQUIS'S leg.

SARAH 
I don't want to leave.  Don't let him take me.

MARQUIS DE SADE It seems, she prefers our company, young man.  I must 
say, your girlfriend gave  up quite an entertaining show.  What a slut 
she is.

MARK Until the girl dies you don't really exist.  You're just trapped 
in your little world.Your words mean nothing.  

MARQUIS DE SADE Oh don't be angry, just because she had her first 
orgasm at the end of a whip,  and not by your touch.


  MARK 
Sarah listen to me.

SARAH 
Go away.

MARK Remember Tony?  China?  These people butchered your friends!  
Don't you  understand?  You're being possessed.  It all started when 
you looked into the  display.  These people may have killed your 
friends but they can't harm you.Not unless your mind allows them to! 
Watch.

MARK hands the gun over to the MARQUIS who smiles.  


 
  MARQUIS DE SADE 
Your friend, has quite an imagination

MARK Come on.  Shoot me.  Hit me!  Or are you scared?  Afraid to look 
like a coward.Afraid that she might see that the Marquis de Sade can 
only beat little girls.And can't fight like a real man!

The MARQUIS lowers the gun and shoots.  The bullet passes through MARK 
and hits the opposite wall.

MARK 
See.  Exactly.

The MARQUIS pushes SARAH away and walks up to MARK.  He strikes through 
MARK again and again  with his whip, but has no effect.  He then steps 
back with the PRINCE.  MARK walks up to SARAH who  is now holding out 
her hand.  He takes it and lifts her up.  

MARQUIS 
Don't look so smug boy.  We shall be meeting again.  

MARK and SARAH exit the chamber, go down the hallway, and come to the 
iron doors.  MARK moves  the GUARD out of the way, and shows SARAH the 
barrier by putting his hand through it.

MARK This is the barrier.  If you don't believe in all of this, then 
the barrier, it can't  stop you.

MARK puts his arm through this time.  

MARK 
See.  Now are you ready?  Are you ready?  

SARAH nods her head and grabs onto MARKS hand.  The two of them step 
through the barrier and land  on the ground, directly in front of HANS, 
JUNIOR, and MR LINCOLN.  The two stand up


  MARK 
Well it looks like your little plan failed.

MR LINCOLN and HANS grab them and cover their mouths. MR LINCOLN 
Just a little precaution.

GEMMA (off screen) 
Do you really think they'll be here?



JAMES Honey, I know just as much as you.  Some guy with a squeaky voice 
called and  said to meet them here at midnight. (admiring the waxworks) 
They are good aren't they?

GEMMA (walking over to the MARQUIS exhibit) 
I suppose so.

JAMES (over at the LIVING DEAD exhibit) WOW! The glasses from `Nutty 
Zombies from Hell'!  I've gotta have those for  my collection.  Hey 
Gem.

We hear the familiar sound of someone entering an exhibit, and GEMMA is 
gone.

JAMES 
Women.  

JAMES looks around. JAMES 
No ones gonna miss `em.

JAMES steps into the LIVING DEAD exhibit.  JUNIOR looks at his watch.  


  JUNIOR 
He was late!

MR LINCOLN 
Shut up and watch.

JAMES and GEMMA both appear in their respected exhibits.

MR LINCOLN 
It's done.

MR LINCOLN and HANS release MARK and SARAH.

MR LINCOLN 
Live my children.  Live.

The blue lightning begins to dance around the room and the exhibits 
slowly start to come to life, right down  to the ZOMBIE HAND on the 
gate.  One by one we are treated to each of the exhibits, showing the 
ghastly  horror of them all.MARK and SARAH begin walking away - as 
quick as possible.

MR LINCOLN 
Run.  Run.  There's nowhere to run.

The duo is just about to the door when the mad LUMBERJACK (from the 
first exhibit they saw) stands in  front of them, axe at the ready.  
Suddenly, an arrow pierces through his chest.  The doors burst open  
revealing SIR WILFRED and a large band of slayers.

MARK 
Wilfred?

SIR WILFRED He's right you know.  There is no where to run.  If one of 
these gets out, the  world will be contaminated within a few days.  Our 
only chance to contain them  is here, before this whole rotting place 
is brought to the ground.

JENKINS 
We're all here, and ready sir!

MARK 
Jenkins!  

JENKINS 
Good evening sir.





SIR WILFRED 
Very good.  These belonged to your grandfather  (hands MARK and SARAH 
swords) Use them wisely.  Lets make sure that these wiseasses are toast 
before we burn  them! HOOOOOOOOOO!!!!

SIR WILFRED and COMPANY charge into the fray.  SIR WILFRED has 
outfitted his wheelchair so it  now resembles a battlewagon.  The two 
forces collide.  JONATHAN can be seen beating the hell out of a  few 
members of the COMPANY, as is the MARQUIS.  MR LINCOLN exits the 
battle.  A mad DOCTOR  is getting ready to kill one of the SLAYERS 
SLAYER #1 
Help me! Help me! Get him! Get him!

SARAH responds by PLUNGING her sword into the DOCTOR'S side.  MARK 
meanwhile, is attacked by  the Tribal INDIAN.  The two trade punches 
until finally MARK tosses him over and PLUNGES the sword  into his 
chest.  JAMES, who is now a ZOMBIE, attacks SARAH 
  

SARAH 
James its me, Sarah, James its me!  Sorry.

SARAH tosses JAMES against the wall and another SLAYER kills him.  One 
SLAYER is trying to douse  gasoline, but MR LINCOLN reappears, with gun 
in hand, and shoots him dead.  We also find CHINA, now  vampirized, and 
missing a chunk of skin from where INSPECTOR ROBERTS went digging, is 
trying to  make amends with MARK.

CHINA 
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.  

MARK 
China.  What happened? CHINA 
Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.  

CHINA begins kissing MARK, aiming for his neck when JENKINS PLUNGES a 
stake through her.

JENKINS It's all right sir.  She, uh, wasn't human you know.  She's 
been dead a long time.Come on, we've got battles to win!

JONATHAN is still out beating up the SLAYERS.  He grabs SARAH and 
hoists her in the air.

JONATHAN 
Kiss me Sarah

SARAH (head butting him) 
Kiss this!

SARAH picks up the LUMBERJACKS axe and PLUNGES it into JONATHANS neck.  
Meanwhile,  GEMMA has now found MARK.



GEMMA Mark.  You've always wanted me.  Now's your chance baby.  You 
afraid of me?TAKE ME!

MARK (picking up a rifle) 
Take this.

MARK blows GEMMA away.  MARK observes the battlefield and sees HANS 
coming up on JENKINS

MARK 
Watch out Jenkins!  Behind you!

MARK takes a shot and misses.  He realizes it's only a double-barreled 
shotgun so he picks up his sword.HANS has now PLUNGED a knife into 
JENKINS.  MARK runs up and PLUNGES his sword deep into  HANS.

MARK 
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?

JENKINS 
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those 
bastards!

A ZOMBIE was lying in wait in the grass.  MARK stabs it once and it 
dies.  He then stands up and looks  determined to kill something.  More 
general carnage goes on and we see a group of SLAYERS have  DRACULA 
cornered.

SLAYER #2 
I'm gunna carve you

DRACULA pulls his cape across his body.

SLAYER #3 
Wait he's changing!

Sure enough, DRACULA has taken on BAT form.  He flies over the group 
trying to make his exit.SLAYER #4 however, grabs the BAT.

SLAYER #4 
Make my day.

With that, he blows off the BATS head.  

MARK and SARAH continue to help slay the monsters.  Then SARAH runs 
across JUNIOR.

SARAH 
You, you little bastard.

JUNIOR 
Mmmp!

SARAH grabs JUNIOR and holds him above the LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS 
PLANT.

PLANT 
Feed me!

SARAH drops JUNIOR into the PLANT.  Meanwhile, TONY (as WEREWOLF) 
attacks SIR WILFRED.SIR WILFRED fights him off, but it is MARK who 
delivers the killing blow.  

MARK (admiring his sword) 
Silver.

SIR WILFRED 
Tally-ho!

MARK spies the MARQUIS from across the battlefield.  The MARQUIS runs 
at him but a dead corpse  runs into him.  MARK ducks into the `STAFF 
ONLY' room.  

MARQUIS 
Damn!

One of the gas pourers dies and his lighter sets fire to the doused 
floor.  The fire quickly spreads.Meanwhile, MARK finds himself in the 
basement of the WAXWORK.  He hides around a corner, waiting  for the 
MARQUIS.  MR LINCOLN, who dodged in here before hand, sees this and 
climbs for higher  ground.  The MARQUIS enters the room and he and MARK 
begin swordplay.  The MARQUIS easily  disarms MARK.

MARQUIS DE SADE 
Now we shall see, who is the real man.

The MARQUIS tosses the sword back to MARK while MR LINCOLN looks on.  
The MARQUIS disarms  MARK again, and again tosses the sword back.  More 
swordplay.  The MARQUIS is obviously having fun  with this.  MARK goes 
for some good ol' fashioned American tactics and decks the MARQUIS 
squarely in  the solar plexus, knocking him off their platform.  MARK 
leaps down, but is again disarmed.  This time,  the MARQUIS holds the 
sword to his throat.  The MARQUIS looks up to MR LINCOLN who is holding  
his thumb up in the old Roman fashion.  The MARQUIS salutes.

MR LINCOLN (turning his thumb down) 
Kill the wimp.

MARQUIS DE SADE 
School time's over.  Now you die.  

Suddenly the LUMBERJACK axe buries itself into the MARQUIS back.  He 
slowly turns around and sees  that SARAH is his killer.  SARAH and MARK 
run at each and are united down by the pool of boiling wax.

MR LINCOLN (pulling a gun from a hiding spot) 
How romantic.  

MARK 
One last thing before you kill us Lincoln.

MR LINCOLN 
You know my name.

MARK 
I should.  You murdered my grandfather.

MR LINCOLN You're a Loftmore?  Old hallows grandchild.  Well well well 
what a  coincidence its such a small world.MARK 
Well then why do you want to end it?

MR LINCOLN 
Somebody has to.  See you in hell.

MR LINCOLN aims the gun at SARAH and MARK.  SIR WILFRED however sees 
this and shoots MR  LINCOLN.  MR LINCOLN takes a few dying shots, and 
falls off the balcony into the pool of wax.  MARK  stands up and smiles 
to SIR WILFRED MARK 
Thanks!  You ok Sarah?

SARAH nods her head, then screams as MR LINCOLN comes out of the wax 
pool, grabbing MARK by  the shoulders.

 MR LINCOLN 
Would you like a closer look?

With that, MR LINCOLN falls back into the pool.

SARAH (to SIR WILFRED) 
Watch out!  The flames!

SIR WILFRED 
Don't worry about me young people, save yourselves!

The MAN (as WEREWOLF) walks up behind SIR WILFRED and proceeds to twist 
off his head

SIR WILFRED (in his dying words) 
Go on!  Oh my goodness!The flames quickly engulf WILFRED and the MAN 
(as WEREWOLF) and then abruptly make their way  downstairs.  Large 
flames ignite in front of the only exit out.  MARK pulls down a towel 
from the wall and  hands part of it to SARAHMARK 
This is our only chance.  

The two pull the towel over their heads and jump through the basement 
window.  Upstairs, the  WAXWORK is burning madly, with exhibits falling 
down on people left and right.  We see that  INSPECTOR ROBERTS is still 
alive, albeit in the sarcophagus.

INSPECTOR ROBERTS 
Help!

SARAH and MARK make it outside and turn to see the WAXWORK slowly 
burning.  A huge explosion  then rips through the WAXWORK, igniting any 
of it that wasn't burning already.  The two stand outside  and hold 
each other for a while.  Slowly the camera zooms in on the destruction 
and we see slight  movement.  The ZOMBIE HAND is still alive.  It 
slowly makes its way out of the rubble and across the  lawn.
