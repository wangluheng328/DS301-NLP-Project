Two people from two worlds.
FBI Agent Fox Mulder, a believer.
FBI Agent Dana Scully, a Skeptic.
Together they must solve the mysteries such as who, or what destroyed a Federal Building in Dallas, what killed 4 firemen and a child supposedly killed in the blast and more, but these mysteries were not placed by some insane terrorist, these were placed by our very own Government.
