A couple of years before the outbreak of the First World War, in a feudal German village, mysterious events happen.
First, the local doctor has an accident when his horse stumbles upon a hidden wire.
Then a woman falls in a hole below the rotten floor of a barn and dies.
The young son of the local baron is found hung upside-down and tortured.
The son of the midwife is found tied to a tree and brutally battered.
In an environment of cruelty and abuses, the local teacher suspects that the repressed daughter and the son of the pastor are the responsible for the crimes.
