In Baltimore, five women and four men try to sort out the signals that the sexes exchange.
Gigi imagines every man she meets is Mr.
Right; she gets reality checks from Alex, a sweet but cynical saloon keeper.
Janine and Ben seem solidly married until he chats with Anna in a market checkout line; meanwhile Anna is indifferent to the pursing Connor.
Neil and Beth have been together seven years; she dumps him when she realizes he really and truly isn't going to marry her.
Does he love her?
And Mary sells advertising while searching on line for a man.
Will those in love stay in love?
Will those searching figure out who is and who isn't into them?
Are men all that different from women?
