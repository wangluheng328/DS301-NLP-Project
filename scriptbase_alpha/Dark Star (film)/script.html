                    <u>DARK STAR: A SCIENCE FICTION ADVENTURE</u>

                 A Screenplay by John Carpenter and Dan O'Bannon







<b>     OPEN ON BLACK SILENCE.
</b>
     The sound of electronic music rises, hollow, metallic.

     FADE IN on a long TRACKING SHOT through the universe.  As the NARRATOR
     speaks we move through galaxies, nebulae, solar systems, moving from
     the infinite slowly down to a particular planetary system deep within
     a maze of suns.

<b>                                   NARRATOR
</b>                              (over)
                    It is the mid 22nd Century.  Mankind
                    has explored the boundaries of his
                    own solar system, and now he reaches
                    out to the endless interstellar
                    distances of the universe.  He moves
                    away from his own small planetary
                    system in huge hyperdrive starships:
                    computer-driven, self-supporting,
                    closed-system spacecraft that travel
                    at mind-staggering post-light
                    velocities.  Man has begun to spread
                    among the stars.  Enormous ships
                    embark with generations of colonists
                    searching the depths of space for
                    new earths, now homes, new
                    beginnings.  Far in advance of these
                    colony ships goes a new pioneer: the
                    scouts, the pathfinders, a special
                    breed of man who has dedicated his
                    life to blazing the trail through
                    the most distant, unexplored
                    galaxies, opening up the farthest
                    frontiers of space.  These are the
                    men of the Advance Exploration
                    Corps.  The task they face is one of
                    unbelievable isolation and
                    loneliness.  So far from home that
                    Earth is no longer even a point of
                    light in the sky, they must comb the
                    universe for those unstable planets
                    whose existence poses a threat to
                    the peaceful colonists that follow.
                    They must find these rogue planets
                    -- and destroy them.  Among these
                    commandos are the men of the
                    scoutship <u>Dark Star</u>.

     We are now moving toward a planet.  Floating in front of the planet is
     the SCOUTSHIP DARK STAR.  As we move toward the ship, we begin to hear
     VOICES, crackling with static.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                              (over -- radio filter)
                    Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?

<b>                                   PINBACK
</b>                              (over -- great static)
                    Mafhkin oble groop...

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                              (over -- filter)
                    Ah, what was that again, I still
                    can't hear you?

<b>                                   PINBACK
</b>                              (over -- filter)
                    I said I'm trying to reach Talby.
                    Something's wrong with the damn
                    intercom.  I need a last-minute
                    diameter approximation.

     CAMERA IS NOW FLOATING TOWARD THE OBSERVATION DOME on top of the ship.
     In the Dome sits TALBY.  He is staring around, wide-eyed, at the
     planets and stars.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                              (over -- filter)
                    Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle.  Do
                    you read me?  Talby?

     WE MOVE IN CLOSE ON TALBY'S FACE.  The shot stops and holds as he
     continues to stare, rapt.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                              (cont'd -- over --
                              filter)
                    Talby, do you read me?

     There is a CRACKLE, and Doolittle's voice suddenly booms through, loud
     and clear:

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                              (cont'd)
<b>                    TALBY!

<b>                                   TALBY
</b>                              (snaps out of it)
                    Oh!  Ah, yes, Doolittle.  What is it?

     <u>INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM</u>

     CLOSE SHOT of a digital clock, ticking down the seconds.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                    I need a diameter approximation.

<b>                                   TALBY
</b>                              (over)
                    Okay, Doolittle, I'll have it in a
                    minute.

     CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL BACK along the length of the control room,
     revealing three men: BOILER, DOOLITTLE, and PINBACK.  They are seated
     close together in cramped little chairs, surrounded by a maze of
     instrumentation, pressing buttons, making adjustments and corrections.
     There is one EMPTY CHAIR; the panel in front of it looks burned.

<b>                                   PINBACK
</b>                    I need a GHF reading on the gravity
                    correction.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                    I'll check it.

<b>                                   BOILER
</b>                    I have a reduced drive reading of
                    seven thousand.

<b>                                   PINBACK
</b>                    Right, that checks out here.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                    Pinback...

<b>                                   PINBACK
</b>                    Yes, Doolittle.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                    Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.

<b>                                   PINBACK

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                    In a second.

<b>                                   PINBACK
</b>                    Boiler, can you set me up with some
                    temp figures?

<b>                                   BOILER

                    corrected to mass critical.

<b>                                   PINBACK
</b>                    I read that with a quantum increase
                    of seven.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                    Pinback, I have a computer reading
                    of nine five seven seven.

<b>                                   BOILER
</b>                    Time to start talking.

<b>                                   PINBACK
</b>                    Bomb bay systems operational.

     Pinback hits a button on his panel.

     <u>INTERIOR - BOMB BAY</u>

     The screen is BLACK for an instant.  Then, two enormous doors begin to
     open ponderously, revealing the planet rotating below.  A huge BOMB,
     designated with a giant <u>#19</u> on its side, lowers slowly out of the
     ship on a rack.

                    This is a chain-reaction bomb,
                    otherwise known as an Exponential
                    Thermostellar Device.  Its own
                    destructive power is small, barely

                    contact with an object the size of a

                    in the very matter of that planet,
                    turning it into a giant reactor
                    which destroys itself in one
                    staggering thermal flash.

                    into the Veil Nebula, we may
                    actually find a strange and
                    beautiful thing: the Phoenix
                    Asteroids.  They should be passing

</b>                    They are a body of asteroids that
                    make a complete circuit of the
                    universe once every 12.3 trillion
                    years.  The Phoenix Asteroids... From
                    what I've heard, Doolittle, they
                    glow... glow with all the colors of
                    the rainbow.  Nobody knows why.  They
                    just glow as they drift around the
                    universe.  Imagine all the sights
                    they've seen in the time they've
                    been travelling -- the birth and
                    death of stars, things we'll never
                    see.  The universe is alive,
                    Doolittle.  I thought it was all
                    empty, but it isn't.  In between the
                    stars, it's seething with light and
                    gasses and dust.  There are little
                    pebbles drifting around, planets no
                    one on Earth has ever seen... No one
                    but the Phoenix Asteroids...

     There is a BLIPPING SOUND.  It is insistent.  Talby is rudely yanked
     from his reverie.  He looks down at a panel.  But his soft talk has
     started Doolittle reminiscing.

                    surf a lot, Talby.  I used to be a

                    can remember running out on the
                    beach early spring mornings with my
                    board and a wet suit...

     Talby turns in his seat and addresses Doolittle directly.

     This fades, and MISSION CONTROLLER appears on the screen, against a
     background of computer terminals.  He is dressed in a snappy tunic, and
     when he receives the on-camera cue, he smiles ingratiatingly.

<b>                                   MISSION CONTROLLER
</b>                    Hi, guys.  Glad to get your message.
                    We gather from the ten-year
                    communications lag that you are
                    approximately 18 parsecs away.  Drop
                    us a line more often, won't you?

                    Sorry to hear about all the
                    malfunctions, and real sorry to hear
                    about the death of Commander Powell.
                    There was a week of mourning all
                    over Earth.  The flags were at half
                    mast.

                    Now I hate to send bad news when you
                    guys are up there doing such a swell
                    job, but something's come up, and we
                    all felt you ought to know about it.
                    Our systems simulation computer has
                    predicted that by the time this
                    message reaches you -- that is to
                    say, in about ten years -- there
                    will be a failure in one of your
                    vital ship's systems.  The
                    malfunction will occur in --
                              (rifles papers)
                    -- system number E180246.  You can
                    see what a problem this would be if
                    you didn't catch it on time.  Now
                    what you should do is this: First,
                    do not, repeat, do not attempt to
                    adjust the system manually.

     <u>INTERIOR - COMPUTER ROOM</u>

     The room is dim and eerie, banks of dimly flickering lights and the
     hum of air-cooling machinery.

     Talby is seated before a glowing screen.  He punches several buttons,
     and the screen comes to life.  A schematic cross-section of the ship
     appears in glowing green lines.

     Talby punches more buttons, and the screen flashes through the levels
     or the ship.  Finally it shows Level 6.  There is a small red light
     pulsing in the <u>Emergency Air Lock</u>.

     Talby punches another button.  The Emergency Air Lock is magnified
     fifteen times until it fills the screen.  The red light is pulsing in a
     small area labelled COMMUNICATIONS LASER #17.

     Talby picks up a microphone.

                    The scanner shows it to be some sort
                    of fault in the communications
                    laser, down by the Emergency Air
                    Lock.  Can't pinpoint it exactly, but

     protection against possible depressurization, and therefore wears no

     Talby stops facing LASER SHAFT 17.

     The plate cover on the laser shaft hangs loose; it appears to be
     burned.  Talby approaches it and puts down his tool kit.  He turns on
     his helmet radio.

     Silence.

     Very carefully, Talby reaches out to touch the dangling plate cover on
     the laser shaft.  He pushes it, and it drops to the floor of the lock
     with a CLANG.

     He takes a long tool from the tool kit.  Slowly, with agonizing care,
     he inserts the tool into the laser shaft, painstakingly avoiding the
     beam.  He engages the tool into the base of the laser, and begins
     slowly to make an adjustment.

     There is a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT.

     Talby drops the tool and staggers back, clutching his face plate.

     Doolittle climbs down a ladder into the icy-blue, cold Freezer Room.
     The walls are covered with frost, and mist hangs in the air.

     He pulls on a pair of insulated gloves and approaches a heavy freezer
     door.  On the door is a sign:

     COMMANDER POWELL is encased in the freezer in a post-death, frozen
     ammonia state.  Wire and electrodes are attached to his head.

     Doolittle takes a microphone from a console on the freezer.  He flips a

     collapses with relief.

     Far behind Talby, coming nearer, is a shimmering point of light.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE

     The point of light is closer now, and it has begun to differentiate
     into a group of beautifully colored frost-like shapes.

                    They glow with all the colors of the

                    some debris from the ship!  It's
                    coming right by me.

     Several chunks of debris from the ship drift past Doolittle.

<b>                                   TALBY

                    them in a minute.  Doolittle, I'm
                    going into them.

     Talby drifts into the huge frost-like shapes, expanding and glowing
     and spinning, slowly refracting all the colors of the spectrum with a
     cold glow.

<b>                                   TALBY
</b>                              (cont'd)
                    I'm beginning to glow.

     The field of spectral shapes, with Talby in their midst, begin to
     drift away into the distance.

                    They're taking me with them, with
                    the Phoenix... going to circle the
                    universe forever.  I'm with them
                    now... be back this way again some
                    day.  Doolittle, before it's too
                    late, there's one last thing I
                    want to tell you...

     Talby's signal dies out as the glowing lights disappear into the
     depths of space.

     Doolittle is hanging onto a long, thin chunk of debris.

<b>                                   DOOLITTLE
</b>                    Hey, Talby!  I've grabbed a piece of
                    the ship, and I think I've figured
                    out a way!

     He pulls the piece of metal down beneath his feet, and stands on it.

     Crouching and extending his arms, Doolittle surfs down into the
     atmosphere of the planet, banking and planing as he disappears to a
     small dot.
