The other boys, curious, follow.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">Michael Quinn kneels before the door, examining the lock. He looks around.  
On a counter next to the door are EATING UTENSILS. Michael Quinn picks up 
A FORK. He bends the fork's tines. Inserts it in the lock.  
He fishes around for a second. Nothing happens. He pulls the fork out, 
rebends it, and inserts it in the lock again. And CLICK.. ..the lock pops.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">Michael Quinn turns and smiles. The boys flood inside.  
The hungry boys go for the food cart, scooping up eggs and sausage. They're

The Man in Black hangs from the girder with one hand; with the other he 
yanks the piece of window off his foot-mounted suction cups.  
He drops to the mezzanine. He rests the glass against the wall. He peers over 
the balustrade at the party below. Satisfied, he removes his hood, ENDING TITLES.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">This is SIMON TEMPLAR. A hard, self-reliant, crafty man. You should treat him

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. NIKKO HOTEL - INTERIOR CORRIDOR

</p><p></p><p id="act">Templar kneels, lifting an edge of the rug.  
Revealing ANTI -THEFT PRESSURE SENSORS.  
Templar produces a DARTGUN (the size of a flare gun, silenced, with a spool 
of steel cable attached to the top). He aims down the corridor and fires.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">A STEEL DART explodes from the barrel, spooling out the cable, and imbeds 
above the door at corridor's end.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">Templar yanks the other end of cable from the spool. He looks around for

</p><p id="dia">Sorry about this.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">He ties the cable around Myaki's bronze neck.  
He hangs from the cable, testing it. It will hold.  
He pulls out an aluminum contraption with small wheels and two handle grips.  
It's A GLIDER for the cable.  
He attaches the glider to the cable, grips the handles, and glides the length of 
the corridor.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR - OVER THE DOOR 

</p><p></p><p id="act">Templar bumps up against the door. He pulls his knees up and over the

HIS FACE is now right next to the door handle, over which is an ELECTRONIC

</p><p></p><p id="act">Templar pulls out a BLACK BOX. It's a really small, really powerful computer

</p><p></p><p id="act">He activates the system. The little computer starts running through

Templar turns the door handle; pushes open the door.  
He pulls himself up. Hangs from his hands again.  
He swings his legs back and forth, getting momentum up.  
He releases from the glider and lunges inside.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He RIPS the painting off the wall and heaves it aside.  
And here, where the painting was, is A SAFE.  
Templar unshoulders his backpack. He pulls out a 40-pound CARLSBAD &amp; 
RINKER industrial diamond-tipped drill, as big as a jackhammer. No finesse 
here, people.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">No, there's no time for high-tech. He's going to drill right through the bitch,

</p><p></p><p id="act">He's through the lock in seconds. Templar heaves the drill aside; it lands with 
a THUD on the beautiful mahogany table. He opens the safe.  
INSIDE THE SAFE is one object: A SMALL BOX, the size of a cufflink keeper.  
Templar grabs it and opens it.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">INSIDE THE LITTLE BOX is a tiny MICRO-CHIP.

land coiled in several places.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">Ilya happens to be standing inside one of the coils of the drill's extension 
cord.  
And this is not lost on Templar.  
Templar, on his knees, grabs the cord and yanks it; the coil tightens around 
Ilya's ankles. His legs fly from under him and he goes down, the gun 
clattering across the floor.  
Ilya tries to get to his feet.  
Templar floors him with a right cross.  
Templar grabs the box and his backpack and sprints across the room. Ilya 
gains his feet and grabs his gun; sprints after Templar.

He's going out the way he came in.  
Suddenly ILYA'S HANDS are around his ankles.  
Templar falls. He's going 12 stories to his death.  
No. His fingers clutch the outside of the balustrade. Templar dangles there, 
looking up at the sadistic face of Ilya. And suddenly below --

Ilya falls 12 stories to his death.  
No he doesn't. He falls one story and miraculously catches the balustrade

Templar clambers up again, atop the balustrade.  
He jumps to the ceiling girder.  
Hand over hand, swinging like an acrobat, Templar's across the girder in 
seconds.

TEMPLAR throws open the passenger side door for Jillian.

most of Brooklyn. Ten bucks again.  

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY 
</p><p id="dia">I'll alert the media.  
Guy's richer than god...  

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DELORES 
</p><p id="spkdir">(reads a check) 
</p><p id="dia">Hey, Mr. Anderson at the Met 
gave a thousand this year. Lucy? 

</p><p></p><p id="act">But LUCY'S not listening.  
She's staring at a check. Her eyes are like hubcaps.  

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY 
</p><p id="dia">Oh my goodness gracious...  
</p><p id="spkdir">(looks at Delores) 
</p><p id="dia">Get Mr. Thomas, Delores.  

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DELORES 
</p><p id="dia">What is it? 

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY 
</p><p id="dia">A check for fifty...  
</p><p id="spkdir">(gulps) 
</p><p id="dia">...million dollars.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">Delores gets up, goes to Lucy, who's hyperventilating.  
Lucy hands her the check. Delores starts hyperventilating. Lucy reads the 
letter: 

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY 
</p><p id="dia">It's from a "Jillian St.  
Thomas Foundation," 
for the benefit of scientific research.  

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DELORES 
</p><p id="dia">Never heard of it. Lemme see.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">Lucy hands Delores the letter.  
INSERT - THE LETTER is printed under a letterhead with a logo design: the 
stick figure man with halo, the same design as the tiepin Jillian gave Templar.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">BACK TO SCENE 

</p><p></p><p id="act">Delores looks at Lucy. Lucy looks back.  
And over this we hear a voice. We've heard it before...  

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JILLIAN ST. THOMAS 
</p><p id="dia">If you're afraid of the dark, 
remember the night rainbow...  

</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. MANHATTAN - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SUNSET 
</p><p></p><p id="act">A lone man stands on the bridge.  
The spires of Manhattan rise above him.  
The sun is setting...  

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JILLIAN ST. THOMAS 
</p><p id="dia">If tomorrow morning the 
sky falls, have clouds for 
breakfast. If the birds 
forget their songs, 
listen to the wind...  

</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA closes in on the hard, defiant face of a man who has changed a great 
deal in these months.  

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JILLIAN ST. THOMAS 
</p><p id="dia">And if between right and wrong...  
And Simon Templar joins Jillian here, speaking with her 
soul... 
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SIMON AND JILLIAN 
</p><p id="dia">...do what is right.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">And Simon whispers to himself...  

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SIMON 
</p><p id="dia">I will do what is right.  

</p><p></p><p id="act">PULLING BACK, we see that the sunset has cast rays through the bridgework.  
And we can't be certain, it is vague, but the rays filtering through the 
bridgework seem to cast a halo over Templar's head.  
He is, now, The Saint.
