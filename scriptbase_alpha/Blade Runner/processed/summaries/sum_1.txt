Los Angeles, 2019: Rick Deckard of the LAPD's Blade Runner unit prowls the steel & micro-chip jungle of the 21st century for assumed humanoids known as 'replicants'.
Replicants were declared illegal after a bloody mutiny on an Off-World Colony, and are to be terminated upon detection.
Man's obsession with creating a being equal to himself has back-fired.
