Deckard, a policeman of the future, hunts down and terminates replicants, artificially created humans.
He wants to get out of the force, but is drawn back in when 4 "skin jobs", a slang term for replicants, hijack a ship back to Earth.
The city in which Deckard must search for his prey is a huge, sprawling, bleak vision of the future.
This film questions what it is to be human, and why life is so precious.
