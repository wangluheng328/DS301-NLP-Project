The film opens with a squad of seasoned German soldiers, led by a disillusioned but skilled sergeant, on a patrol on the Russian front in WWII.
They return to base to find a new commander, a traditional Prussian officer who wants only one thing from his command - An Iron Cross to maintain his family honor.
The scene is set for a graphic portrayal of the horrors of war and of the conflict between two men of differing backgrounds.
