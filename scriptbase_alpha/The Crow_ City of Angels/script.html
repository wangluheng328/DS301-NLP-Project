</b><b>          
</b>
                                     Written by

                            David S Goyer &amp; James O'Barr


<b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          FADE IN:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. LIMBO - DAY/NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And
          out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying toward
          the camera in slow motion.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SARAH (O.S.)
</b><b>          
</b>          I believe there's a place where the restless souls wander. Burdened
          by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter Heaven...
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK.
          A warrior whose baleful eyes shine behind the familiar irony
          mask war paint.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SARAH (O.S.)
</b><b>          
</b>          And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly
          searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the
          hopes that somehow, some day...
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          The figure on horseback sweeps past us, disappearing once again
          into the mists of time.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SARAH (V.O.)
</b><b>          
</b>          ... they will be reunited with the ones they love.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. DOCS, COMMERCIAL WATERFRONT - NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Present day. The Crow settles on a shipping container, tilts
          its head, watching...
<b>          
</b><b>          SUPER TITLE:
</b><b>          
</b><b>          "CITY OF ANGELS - OCTOBER 29TH - LA NOCHE DE SAN LUCAS"
</b><b>          
</b>          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS tearing open a tiny glassine envelope
          filled with powder - our drug du jour - Trinity. The face of
          the envelope has been stamped with an image - a cartoon imp with
          a shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up sign.
<b>          
</b>          A MAN lowers his face to the envelope, snorts up the powder.
          The man discards the glassine envelope...
<b>          
</b><b>          FOLLOWING THE ENVELOPE
</b><b>          
</b>          as it flutters to the ground, landing "imp-side" up. Let the
          rush begin.
<b>          
</b><b>          PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b><b>          
</b>          Garbage-poisoned waters wreathed in fog. Although once part of
          a thriving shipping industry, decades of decline have seen these
          docks become a hellish dumping ground. Case in point:
<b>          
</b><b>          A FATHER AND HIS YOUNG SON
</b><b>          
</b>          are kneeling next to one another at the end of a pier, their
          arms linked together, then tied behind their backs. DANNY CORVEN
          (8) is quietly sobbing. ASHE (late 20s), tries to calm the frightened
          boy.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          DANNY
</b><b>          
</b>          I'm sorry, Dad...I'm sorry... I didn't mean to look...
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          ASHE
</b><b>          
</b>          It's okay, Danny. It's okay...
<b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          NEMO (O.S.)

<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          A bright light comes on. Ashe and Danny turn their heads to avoid
          the glare.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>

</b><b>          CLOSE ON
</b><b>          
</b>          A camcorder lens as it auto-focuses, bringing Danny's distorted
          face into view via the lens' reflection.

</b><b>          
</b>          CAMERA FINDS Ashe and Danny's executioners, CURVE, KALI, SPIDER
          MONKEY, and NEMO.
<b>          
</b>          NEMO, a post-modern sleaze-hound, circles Danny and Ashe with
          a camcorder. He Pats Ashe's face.

<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          SPIDER MONKEY, lean and gangly, crouches next to Ashe, holding
          a marigold in his hand.

</b><b>          CAMERA POV (CLOSE ON ASHE'S EYE)
</b><b>          
</b>          Ashe stares directly into the camera.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SPIDER MONKEY

<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Spider Monkey tucks the flower behind his ear. Danny is praying
          now, MUMBLING a Catholic School litany.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SPIDER MONKEY
</b><b>          
</b>          You're wasting your breath, angelito. Nobody up there's listening.

</b><b>          WHOOSH!
</b><b>          
</b>          We cut to an extreme high-angle shot - God's omniscient POV,
          perhaps.
<b>          
</b><b>          CURVE
</b><b>          
</b>          leans up against his motorcycle a few yards away - big, burly,
          shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips. He's got a custom
          paint-job on his pearl drop gas tank - a buxom blonde doing the
          "wild thing" with the Grim Reaper. Curve's also the one who just
          dusted himself
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          CURVE
</b><b>          
</b>          (hyped on drugs)
<b>          
</b>          Let's get this over with. Judah's waiting.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Kali, a cold-eyed heavy-metal femme with a killer's casual stoicism,
          is methodically loading bullets into her revolver. She's taking
          her own sweet time, in defiance of Curve. There's a tension between
          them. Finally, she flicks her wrist, snaps the revolver shut.
          Kali walks up to them...
<b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          ASHE

<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          ...and puts a bullet through Danny's chest. Ashe SCREAMS.

</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Danny's body slumps forward, dragging Ashe down next to him.
          Ashe stares into his son's lifeless eyes.
<b>          
</b>          Curve saunters over, stares down at Ashe, flicks his cigarette
          butt off into the water.

          world. Bit by bit, Ashe's struggles subside. All we hear now
          is an ever-slowing HEARTBEAT. Darkness begins to close in around

          welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying overhead - "GO BACK".

          Sarah inherited from Eric and Shelly, is perched on the end of

</b><b>          SARAH'S ARTIST LOFT
</b><b>

          warmth to it, in stark contrast to the urban decay outside -
          an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an arching half-circle
          window through which Sarah can view the local wildlife on the
          streets below.

          in her navel, another in a nipple...

<b>          
</b>          Troubled, Sarah climbs from the shower, shrugs on some clothes.
          Among her accourterments is a necklace featuring a silver ankh,
          the symbol of eternity.

          mask that used to hang by Shelly's mirror. Next to the mask is

          Lots of memories. Lots of ghosts.

          shivering from withdrawal.
<b>          
</b>          Sarah draws closer, notices some of the grinning imp drug sachets
          at the girl's feet. The girl shies away, frightened, suspicious.

</b>          After a moment, Grace offers a reluctant nod. Sarah helps her
          from the entryway, into the warmth of the dying light. Grace
          blinks, shields her eyes.

<b>          
</b>          Nearby is a battered road sign - "END CITY LIMITS". Someone has

          Sarah is finishing coloring a Japanese dragon which winds its
          way over the man's forearm. She makes another line of color then
          sits back, smoothing more Vaseline over the man's arm. She picks
          up a jeweler's loupe, makes an adjustment on her needle...
<b>          
</b>          Behind Sarah we glimpse the cluttered tattoo shop - walls covered
          with sheets of flash (ready-made art), bookshelves crammed with
          reference works. Sarah's partner, NOAH, a chain-smoking proto-punk
          Brit, consults with a YOUNG GRUNGE COUPLE.

</b><b>          
</b>          It's a crow, rendered in bold slashes of black. Or is it? Upon
          closer examination the crow looks like something else - two demons
          fighting. The design is a classic ambiguous figure - like the
          picture of the woman in front of a vanity which can also be seen
          as a skull.

</b><b>          
</b>          Sarah approaches, dropping by Ashe's side. She sees Danny's painting
          which Ashe cradles protectively.
<b>          
</b>          Ashe looks up at Sarah, his eyes full of questions.

</b><b>

          lid, dipping her fingers inside...
<b>          
</b>          Sarah's re-creation of the irony war mask has an oddly ritualistic
          feel to it. Yet the act is also quite erotic, for the mutual
          attraction between these two battered souls is almost palpable.
<b>          
</b>          As Sarah continues to speak, she begins to paint Ashe's face
          using Danny's art supplies.
<b>          
</b>          We see this transformation in bits and pieces - an eye here,
          fingers dipping into the canister of white there, ruby lips being
          smeared with black...
<b>          
</b>          ...the face that is taking shape is both similar to and different
          from Eric's. It's the legacy of the Crow, as funneled through
          Ashe's own, unique pain.

          with moisture. There are heating mantles rigged with flasks and
          condensers, vacuum pumps - along with ingredients like battery
          acid, paint thinner, and Epsom salts. Nearby are dozens of 50-gallon
          drums containing the finished product.
<b>          
</b>          Spider Monkey is working away at the printing press, pausing
          to snoot some of Judah's drug. Nearby is an old TV featuring
          lurid videos of amateur bull riding - we watch as a drunken participant
          gets gored.
<b>

</b>          Judah turns towards us, his transformation now complete. We see
          that he has painted himself a parody of Ashe's irony mask in
          the Crow's own blood.
<b>

</b><b>          WE RISE UP

<b>          
</b>          The peripheral noise from the street festival dies away. We're
          in the eye of the hurricane now. Once again, time seems to shudder
          to a stop. And the only thing we hear are...
<b>          
</b><b>          THE CROWS

</b>          Thousands of them, filling the heavens with their KEENING WAILS.
<b>          
</b>          Ashe slowly opens his eyes, tentative. When you're this deep
          in the bosom of bliss, the last thing you want to do is waken,

<b>          
</b>          No, there's Danny slipping back into the crows, the mask pulled
          down over his face once again.
<b>          
</b>          Ashe reaches for Danny, spinning him around, pulling off the
          mask...
<b>          
</b>          ...only it's not Danny! It's a drunken DWARF with fucked-up teeth
          who's laughing his ass of at Ashe. Ashe recoils, horrified, then

<b>          
</b><b>          JUDAH
</b><b>          
</b>          standing just a few yards away, emerging from the doorway of
          his tower. He got the anti-Crow blood mask on his face. His eyes
          are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a
          feral snarl. In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his
          campanile.
<b>          
</b>          Judah grabs Ashe by the lapels of his coat, draging him close
          so they're eye to eye -- close enough to breathe the same beath
          -- two sides of a coin.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Ashe reaches his hand into his coat, pulling out a .45. He FIRES
          into Judah's chest - once, twice, thrice...
<b>          
</b>          Judah doesn't even stagger, he just keeps on grinning. Wisps
          of smoke rise up from the holes in his chest.
<b>          
</b>          Ashe stares at Judah, dumbfounded.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Judah follows with a series of blows, each more savage than the
          next, driving Ashe back...
<b>          
</b>          Ashe stumbles, falls to his hands and knees. He reaches to his
          mouth, his hand comes away spattered with blood. Ashe shakes
          his head to clear it.
<b>          
</b>          Judah kicks Ashe in the face, knocking him onto his back...
<b>          
</b>          ...but Ashe springs back to his feet. He tries to strike Judah.
          Judah catches Ashe's hand and squeezes tight. We hear bones snapping.
<b>          
</b>          CRACK! Judah smashes out with his other fist, Ashe spins around
          and collapses...
<b>          
</b>          Ashe tries to push himself up by his hands. He coughs, spitting
          up more blood, crawls forward...

          neck, dragging him off his feet.
<b>          
</b>          Judah pulls Ashe forward, crouching over him like a spider ready

          security gate shut. She punches the "DOWN" arrow on the tarnished
          control panel. With a lurch and HUM the elevator car starts its
          journey downward.

</b>          Judah has dragged Ashe over to the East side of the street, in
          front of an old movie palace. He leaps atop one of the vending
          stalls and clambers onto the marquee itself.
<b>          
</b><b>          JUDAH

</b>          Even as Ashe fights to free himself of the chain, Judah loops
          one end of it over a street lamp. He jumps from the marquee,

          His coat and short have been all but torn to shreds.
<b>          
</b>          Judah drags down on the chain harder, lifting Ashe even higher,
          tightening the noose. He secures the chain on a hydrant, then
          strolls forward, inspecting his work. Judah circles Ashe, grinning
          like the cat who swallowed the canary.

          It flutters to the ground, landing at Judah's feet.
<b>          
</b>          Judah kneels, picking it up. As he unfolds the painting, we see
          that it has been stained with Ashe's own blood. He tilts it this
          way and that -- as if he were appraising the craftsmanship of
          the piece.
<b>

          fall away into the night wind.
<b>

          She pulls the misericord out. Blood begins to well up from the
          wound. She stares at her blood-covered hands in disbelief, then
          falls back.
<b>          
</b>          Silence now as the crowd begins to back away. The mood has shifted.

</b>          Ashe looks up at Judah, fueled by a righteous rage that's been
          burning since the moment of his resurrection. He rises. All reason
          is gone. The only think that remains for Ashe is an unbridled
          animal fury.
<b>          
</b>          Ashe launches himself at Judah, sending the villain tumbling
          back into a nest of scaffolding. One of the pipes punches clear
          through Judah's chest, impaling him!
<b>          
</b>          Judah hangs there, transfixed like a butterfly with a pin stuck
          through it. He struggles to pull himself from the piping, but
          even so, he's laughing hysterically...

          face is pale, having lost so much blood. Tears spill down Ashe's
          cheeks, causing the war-paint makeup to run in rivulets.

<b>          
</b>          And as we pull back from them, we realize that the scene mirrors
          the prophetic image from Sarah's own painting - the woman dying

</b>          The church is aglow with candles. Ashe lays Sarah's body down
          in front of the offrenda, folding her arms across her chest,

<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          PRIEST
</b><b>          
</b>          Why are you still here?
<b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          ASHE
</b><b>          
</b>          Because I have nowhere left to go.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Ashe steps past the priest, moving towards the doorway and the
          daylight beyond.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          PRIEST
</b><b>

</b><b>          
</b><b>          ASHE
</b><b>          
</b>          (looking back)
<b>          
</b>          This city is filled with shadows. One more won't make it any
          darker.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. CHURCH - DAWN
</b><b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Ashe exits the church, finding haven in a shadowed doorway. He
          reaches into his pocket, removing the wedding ring Sarah had
          given to him...
<b>          
</b><b>          CLOSE ON THE RING
</b><b>          
</b>          as Ashe turns it over in his hands, seeing the word "FOREVER"
          inscribed on the inside of the band. He slips it on his finger.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          GRACE (O.S.)

<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Ashe looks up to see...
<b>          
</b><b>          GRACE,
</b><b>          
</b>          the drugged-out girl that Sarah helped at the beginning of the
          film. She's looking good now, clean of the poison that once possessed
          her. And damned if she isn't holding Gabriel in her arms.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          GRACE

<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Gabriel MEOWS to Ashe. Ashe reaches out and scratches the cat's
          ear.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          GRACE
</b><b>          
</b>          Isn't he cool? I found him on the street. I was going to take
          him home with me.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          ASHE
</b><b>          
</b>          You should. Looks like he needs a home.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          GRACE
</b><b>

<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          She smiles at him and starts off down the street. Gabriel turns
          around in Grace's arms and peers back at Ashe from over her shoulder.
<b>          
</b>          Ashe moves out from the shadows into the steadily growing light,
          watching them. We see just a hint of hope in his eyes - hope
          that someday he and Sarah will be reunited.
<b>          
</b>          As we hold on Ashe's face, Sarah's VOICE-OVER begins.

</b><b>          
</b><b>          SARAH (V.O.)
</b><b>          
</b>          I believe there's a place where the restless souls wanter...

</b><b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          The same scene as the beginning of our film. We've made a circle.
          A heavy mist hangs before us - endless and impenetrable. And
          out of that primordial fog a CROW materializes, flying towards
          the camera in slow motion.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SARAH (V.O.)
</b><b>          
</b>          Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot enter
          Heaven...
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          Presently a second shape materializes - a FIGURE ON HORSEBACK,
          galloping after the Crow.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SARAH (V.O.)
</b><b>          
</b>          And so they wait, trapped between our world and the next, endlessly
          searching for a way to rid themselves of their pain - in the
          hopes that somehow, some day, they will be reunited...
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b>          As the dark rider comes towards us, we realize that it's Sarah
          whose baleful eyes are now shining behind the irony mask war
          paint.
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SARAH (V.O.)
</b><b>

</b>          Ashe on the bike. Now we intercut between the two doomed lovers,
          each on their respective steeds. Worlds apart, and yet, somehow
          traveling the same road.
<b>          
</b>          We are intercutting faster and faster, until the sound of HOOFBEATS
          and the MOTORCYCLE'S ROAR are indistinguishable.
<b>          
</b>          Until the two figures themselves begin to blur.
<b>          
</b>          Faster and faster and faster until we...
<b>          
</b><b>          CUT TO BLACK.
</b><b>          
</b>          Over the darkness we hear Sarah's final words to Ashe:
<b>          
</b><b>           
</b><b>          
</b><b>          SARAH'S VOICE
</b><b>

<b>          
</b><b>          (BEAT)
