San Francisco physician Archie Bollen is divorcing, sorting out new relationships with his ex, her new man, his sons, and friends who knew him as part of a couple.
At a charity event, Petulia Danner, a young and lovely socialite, throws herself at him, telling him they should find a hotel room and soon announcing she intends to marry him.
She's quixotic, vulnerable, and not easy to dissuade.
She's also married and faces demons of her own.
Bollen returns to his apartment one afternoon and finds her unconscious, savagely beaten, most certainly by her husband.
How Archie and Petulia respond to the husband's abuse are the film's conclusion.
