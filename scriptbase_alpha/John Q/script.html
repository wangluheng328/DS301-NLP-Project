</p><p></p><p id="act">- Carroll Shelby

</p><p></p><p id="act">FADE IN:

</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

</p><p></p><p id="act">Mancini's "Ave Maria" fills the screen as a white BMW speeds along the road.

</p><p></p><p id="act">CREDITS ROLL

</p><p></p><p id="act">A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is behind the wheel. We never see her face. Hanging from the mirror is a rosary with a crucifix. Her porcelain hand turns up the volume and the music swells. A silver bracelet dangles from her wrist.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

</p><p></p><p id="act">A slow-moving semi obstructs her path. The woman leans out the window to see if the road is clear before moving into the oncoming lane. She steps on the gas. She's in the wrong lane and can't get over. There are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

</p><p></p><p id="act">Suddenly, the headlights are upon her. And airhorn blasts and she's trapped between two monstrous big rigs. She cuts the wheel hard, but too late. The oncoming truck clips her, sending her car end over end.

</p><p></p><p id="act">SLO-MO

</p><p></p><p id="act">The accident is violent and horrible. The BMW cartwheels along the highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction. The music crescendos and sparks fly as the car skids along the pavement on its roof. And as the BMW violently smashes headfirst into the embankment, the beautiful woman is slammed into the windshield like a crash-test dummy. 

</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. MIDDLE AMERICAN TOWN - PRE-DAWN

</p><p></p><p id="act">The indigo horizon shimmers with the first light of morning. Vapor spewing smokestacks dwarf brick and mortar homes. Dairy Queens, Hardee's, and Walmarts line the main drag. Stars and Stripes flutter from lampposts.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

</p><p></p><p id="act">A man sits propped up against pillows, his sleeping wife snuggled next to him. His name is JOHN QUINCY ARCHIBALD. His strong, handsome face is beginning to show wear and tear. From across the room, last night's news broadcast drones on the TV. The President is telling everybody how wonderful the country is doing.

</p><p></p><p id="act">JOHN Q. watches impassively, the irony not lost on him. Suddenly, he hears a noise. Something's not right. He jumps out of bed, wearing only a pair of BVDs.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WIFE
</p><p id="dia">Honey, what is it?

</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - MORNING

</p><p></p><p id="act">The screen door bangs open. John Q. bursts onto the porch to find a tow truck parked in front of his house. TWO TRUCKERS are winching a hook and cable to a ten year old Chevy.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Hey, what the hell are you doing?

</p><p></p><p id="act">TOW TRUCK DRIVER #1
</p><p></p><p id="act">What does it look like?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Aw, come on. That's my car.

</p><p></p><p id="act">TOW TRUCK DRIVER #1
</p><p></p><p id="act">Yeah? That's not what the bank says.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The truckers quickly circle to the front and hop in. John Q. just watches as the truck speeds away, dragging the car along the cement.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The neighbors now stand on their porches, staring. J.Q. turns to see his wife, DENISE, standing in the doorway. She's not a happy camper. 

</p><p></p><p id="act">Their nine year old son, MIKE, appears at his mother's side, wiping the sleep from his eyes.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MIKE
</p><p id="dia">What's going on?

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSE ON a hand circling want-ads in red ink. J.Q. sits at the kitchen table drinking a half-filled cup of coffee, his eyes scouring the classifides. 

</p><p></p><p id="act">Denise enters, dressed in her brown and red supermarket cashier's uniform. Without speaking, she passes J.Q. and starts making breakfast. 

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Sorry.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Denise doesn't respond. A chill fills the air.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q. (CONT'D)
</p><p id="dia">I talked to the bank. They promised they'd work with me. 

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">Okay.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">I did.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE 
</p><p id="dia">John, that was two months ago.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">We've got enough money for next month's rent. That's it. It was either the car or the house, so I thought...

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">You thought.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">What did you want me to do? Have us put out on the street? I'm down to twenty hours a week a the plant. They shipped off half the damn jobs down to Mexico.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">My car is gone, John.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">You know I'm out there trying to find a second job.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">What do you want me to say? That it's fine? Alright, it's fine.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">The car's still ours, Denise. We own it. All we have to do is wait two weeks until my check comes in.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Mike enters dressed for school. He strikes a body builder's pose, flexing.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MIKE
</p><p id="dia">Yah! Ronnie Coleman, Mr. Olympics two years running. Yah!

</p><p></p><p id="act">He moves to the bread box and grabs a donut.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">Sit down, honey. Eat some breakfast.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MIKE
</p><p id="spkdir">(mouthful of food)
</p><p id="dia">I am eating.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">A donut isn't breakfast.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MIKE
</p><p id="dia">Yeah it is. It's a continental breakfast.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, well, you're not a continent right now.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MIKE
</p><p id="dia">Uh, Dad, what do you call North America?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Denise sets down two plates of hot food.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">Enough about that. You're not going to school without breakfast. Now eat. Both of you.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Mike and John Q. wolf down their food three bites at a time.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MIKE
</p><p id="dia">I can't believe those jerks took our car, can you, Mom?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Denise gives J.Q. the hairy eyeball.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">No, I can't.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MIKE
</p><p id="dia">What are we going to do? You're not going to do something, right, Dad? You know what I'd do? I'd get so big and mad, I'd just go crazy and kick someone's butt.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Watch your language.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MIKE
</p><p id="dia">I would. I swear. When I grow up I'll be so strong no one will ever take nothing from us.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">You've been watching too much of that W.W. wrestling.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MIKE
</p><p id="dia">Not wrestling, Dad. Body building. There's a big difference.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">Alright, alright. Get your books. You're going to be late.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Mike runs out of the room. Denise starts to clear the table.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE (CONT'D)
</p><p id="dia">Give me a ride to work?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Sure.

</p><p></p><p id="act">J.Q. takes her arm.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q. (CONT'D)
</p><p id="dia">Baby, things will get better. I promise. I've just got to get a few paychecks ahead, that's all.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. COMPUTER ROOM - SOMEWHERE IN AMERICA - NIGHT

</p><p></p><p id="act">An amber light flashes through the darkness, followed by a rapid buzzing sound. The CAMERA PUSHES IN on a mammoth-sized printer, furiously pounding letters onto a fact sheet. We catch glimpses of peoples' names, hometowns, other vital information. Vernell Tilson, Des Moines. Arthur Friedlander, Jefferson City. Amy Podgorsky, Topeka.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. JOHN Q.'S TRUCK - DAY

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">Of course. Basically, there's not enough blood being pumped by the heart, so it backs up in the lungs. Sort of like a sponge getting wet. Mike's heart is trying, but I'm afraid it's working too hard.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">So what's he need? An operation?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Turner gathers himself, takes off his glasses.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">I'm afraid we're considerably beyond the point of corrective surgery, Mr. and Mrs. Archibald. Your son's heart is useless. He is going to need a transplant.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">What options?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">To do nothing. Medicate him. Keep him as comfortable as possible. You need to start thinking about quality of life now.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">I don't understand. We were just with him. He seemed fine.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">He's going to seem fine. But as his heart gets worse, he will become increasingly fatigued, need more and more sleep, until one day, he'll go to sleep and he won't wake up.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">I know it's difficult, but you must face the fact that your son may not have much time left. You might want to make it a happy time. Say goodbye.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">Oh my God.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">And transplantation is a high risk operation. You could lose your son on the table. You may not want to take that chance.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER

</p><p></p><p id="act">J.Q. looks at Denise, who nods.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Okay. Let's do it.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">The first step is to get Mike's name on an organ recipient list. Once he does, his chances are very good. Your son's an extremely rare type so there's less demand. With B-positive blood, Mike could go to the top of the list right away.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">It's not that simple. There are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list, Mr. Archibald. The cost of transplant surgery is expensive. In most cases, prohibitively so.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">I've got major medical. Don't worry, I'm covered.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">Actually, we've already checked with your carrier. There's no provision in your policy for a procedure of this magnitude.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">There must be some kind of mistake. My son is covered. I've got full medical. He's covered.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">What about you, Mrs. Archibald? Do you have coverage?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">No. I've only been working at the market a short time. You need to be there two years before you get benefits.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Payne flips through the Archibald family file.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">I see that you don't own your own home. No investments, stocks, bonds. And you have a little over one thousand in savings.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Did you hear what I said? I'm telling you, I'm insured.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">That may very well be, but you'll have to check with your carrier on that. In the meantime, I'm afraid we're going to have to treat you as a cash account.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">How much does a transplant cost?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">Transplant surgery, doctor fees, post operative treatment and immunosuppressant drugs, you're looking at two-hundred and fifty-thousand dollars minimum.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">What are you saying? If I don't come up with a quarter million dollars you're not going to treat my son?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">We have treated him. We continue to treat him. Now I understand how upset you are, sir. But with other options available, we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly. If you opt for replacement surgery, that's your choice. But the hospital maintains a very strict policy with respect to cash patients. We require a down payment before the patient's name can be placed on the receiver list.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">What kind of down payment?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">Thirty percent. Seventy-five thousand.

</p><p></p><p id="act">J.Q. Seventy-five thousand dollars to put my kid's name on a list?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">Our son is upstairs dying and all you can talk about is money?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">Yes, it takes money to provide health service. It's expensive for you and for us. My job is to keep this program alive. For everyone. Now, I'm sorry, but we need you to guarantee payment before we can place your son's name on the list.

Carrying an armload of medicine. He replaces the IV bag and starts to administer the meds. One after the other, Reggie injects them into the IV line, and Mike stirs.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE
</p><p id="dia">What's that?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">REGGIE
</p><p id="dia">Lasix. It's a diuretic to help get rid of some of the fluid build-up. But it's potassium sparing, so he needs this one to supplement.

Down the Pediatric ICU, she sees the hospital chaplain again. There is a commotion. The parents are crying. And a sheet is pulled over her face of the now dead child. The chaplain tries to console the devastated mother, who screams as her child is wheeled out of the room.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

</p><p></p><p id="act">The vending machines have been jimmied open and a huge pile of candy bars and soda cans sit on the waiting room table. Everybody is chowing down.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">The thing I don't understand is why no one caught it before. Mike had check ups every year since the day he was born. Why didn't his doctors pick it up?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">Was he ever diagnosed with a murmur?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, he was. About a week after he was born. But his doctor said that was normal. That it happens all the time.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">He might not have been tested thoroughly enough.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Why not?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MAGUIRE
</p><p id="dia">You got an HMO, right? There's your answer. HMO's pay their doctors not to test. Their way of keeping costs down. Let's say Mike needed additional testing, insurance says they won't cover them. The doctor keeps his mouth shut and no one's the wiser. Little Mike falls through the cracks, and come Christmas, the HMO sends the doc a big, fat bonus check. J.Q. looks at Turner.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Is that true?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">Possible. Not likely, but possible.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Then Mike's doctors could have known about his condition all along? And he could have been treated years ago?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">Who knows?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LESTER
</p><p id="dia">Nothing personal, Doc, but you all are a bunch of damn crooks.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MAGUIRE
</p><p id="dia">You see,here's the problem. Over here, you've got your insurance companies who basically want you healthy or dead. That's how they make money. And over here, you've got your medical establishment, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, who don't want you healthy or dead. They want you sick. That's the way they make money.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LESTER
</p><p id="dia">It's all about getting paid, man.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MAGUIRE
</p><p id="dia">And the individual is caught in the middle of this gigantic tug-of-war. It's a game. And the end result is, people don't get the treatment they deserve.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LESTER
</p><p id="dia">Because then no one gets paid.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JULIE
</p><p id="dia">But what about that thing you guys take? That promise? What do they call it?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">STEVE
</p><p id="dia">The Hippocratic oath.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LESTER
</p><p id="dia">More like the hipp-crit-cial Oath to me. How's that go, Doc? "I solemnly swear to take care of all sick folk, except those without major medical?"

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MAGUIRE
</p><p id="dia">I'm telling you, it's not that far from the truth. The shit happens all the time. Paramedics bring in some accident victim gasping for his last breath. Big boys in accounting find out they can't pay, they send them packing.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JULIE
</p><p id="dia">Hospitals can't turn people away.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">STEVE
</p><p id="dia">Yeah. I thought there were laws about that.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MAGUIRE
</p><p id="dia">There are laws. But there are also ways around the laws. All we have to do is stabilize them. After that, we're off the hook.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Turner is getting hot.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">That's not how it works.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MAGUIRE
</p><p id="dia">That's exactly how it works. Maybe not up there on the fifth floor, but down here, if you ain't got no money, you get a band-aid, a foot in the ass, and you're out the door.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH
</p><p id="dia">Is that how you paid for that Armani suit, Doc?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Finally, Turner explodes.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">Shut up. Enough already. I've heard all the bitching and moaning I can stand. Sure, the system sucks. There's red tape and there's worse. There's tough luck. And if you're looking for kindness and compassion, they're in short supply these days. But some of us got into medicine to do something about it. I break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam. I'm in it up to my elbows. I've seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around. And when I say I do my best, I mean it. So don't tell me about doctors, because they're the last stop between you and six feet under. And if you all want to regard me as some blood sucking vampire, fine. I'm the bad guy. But who's holding the fucking gun?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Turner gets up and walks into the treatment room.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JULIE
</p><p id="dia">Wow.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH
</p><p id="dia">What's his problem?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">STEVE
</p><p id="dia">I've got to be honest, if my kid was dying and I couldn't get help, I don't know what I'd do.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DEBBY

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">STEVE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH
</p><p id="dia">Screw you, Tyrone.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Steve leaps from his seat and goes after Mitch, bristling with the racial slur. J.Q. moves in fast, trying to separate them. But instead of going for Steve, Mitch goes for broke and rushes J.Q. The Ethylchloride is out and Mitch sprays it into J.Q.'s eyes, temporarily blinding him.

</p><p></p><p id="act">John tries to get his bearings but Mitch is already swinging the scalpel. As J.Q. blocks the knife, his arm is sliced and starts to gush. Mitch goes for the kill, but J.Q. grabs his arm and they wrestle to the ground, the scalpel and John's gun clattering to the floor. The element of surprise gone, Mitch is now getting the worst of it. J.Q. is getting in some heavy blows and no one is stepping in to stop it. Mitch sees the gun across the floor next to Julie.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH (CONT'D)

</p><p></p><p id="act">Julie gets up.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH (CONT'D)
</p><p id="dia">Shoot him, honey. Shoot him.

</p><p></p><p id="act">But instead of grabbing the weapon, she picks up the Ethylchloride, sprays it directly in Mitch's eyes from superclose range and doesn't stop. Mitch's hands fly to his eyes and he screams. J.Q. gets up and recovers his weapon, sticking it in his waistband. Julie stands over Mitch, who is still writhing in pain.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH (CONT'D)
</p><p id="dia">You stupid bitch!

</p><p></p><p id="act">Julie rears back, and with her go-go boot, she kicks Mitch square in the groin.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JULIE
</p><p id="dia">That's for beating the shit out of me.

</p><p></p><p id="act">She kicks him again.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">Don't you dare try to blame this on me. You think Mr. Archibald is the only one with a sick child? Try the HIV ward. There's a whole floor full of them. People get sick. They die. That's the way it goes. I'm faced with tough decisions every day.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MONROE
</p><p id="dia">The fact is there's a man threatening to kill innocent people because you refused treatment for his son.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">The fact is there are fifty million people in this country without medical insurance, sir. And there's one of me in every hospital. That's not my fault. It's just the way the country's set up. You want to change it? Write your congressman.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Moody looks over from his map.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MOODY
</p><p id="dia">Excuse me, but why don't we just tell him his son's on the list? Doesn't that make sense? I mean, how's he going to know.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MONROE
</p><p id="dia">That's not a bad idea.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PAYNE
</p><p id="dia">You want me to put his name on the list, fine, but it's a mistake. You give in to this man, there's going to be guns in every hospital in America.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MONROE
</p><p id="dia">I don't personally care if you put the kid on it or not. That's your conscience. But give us a hand, will you honey? Work with us. Tell him his kid's going to be alright. Do you think you can do that?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH
</p><p id="dia">No. I want to know. Every day you read about this kind of shit. And now we're in the middle of it. How is it going to end, John? This country, man. I swear to God.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MAGUIRE
</p><p id="dia">Shut up, Mitch.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">He's right. You know how easy it was to get this gun? One gun show. Five minutes.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH
</p><p id="dia">That's right. You're just a punk with a gun. I understand your kid is sick, but what makes him better than me? I've got a life, too.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, but you've got insurance.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH
</p><p id="dia">So, what, you're going to shoot me? Because that's what you're telling the cops. If poor little Mikey doesn't get the very first heart available, all of us die.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">No, I don't want to cheat anyone. I just want my kid to have a fair shot.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH
</p><p id="dia">So what's the plan, Stan? I mean, exactly? How long are you going to hold us hostage? Until your son gets a new heart?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">I don't know.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH
</p><p id="dia">Think, Einstein. Use your head. Correct me if I'm wrong, Doctor, but hearts don't come just like that. It takes months, years sometimes.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">I know.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MITCH
</p><p id="dia">Then what's your move?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">I'm not letting my kid die! I'm out of options, alright?! I have no more ideas. This is it. The end of the road. I'm looking for an act of God. I'm looking for a miracle.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE

</p><p id="dia">Mrs. Archibald...

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DENISE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">No, we don't. You're an adult. Mike is strong, but the amount of blood your heart pumps may be too much for Mike.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.
</p><p id="dia">I'll take that chance. It's better than letting him die.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LESTER
</p><p id="dia">What happened to Mike is bad, man. It's the worst. It ain't fair, but you can't kill yourself. Sometimes you've just got to let go and let God take care of it. You've got to accept it.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">That Mike's going to die.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.

</p><p id="dia">I know you only think of Mike as a patient, but he's a great kid. Really. He's like magic, you know? He loves bodybuilding. You believe that? And he's funny. You'd like him, Doc. You'd really like him, if you knew him.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">I do like him.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">J.Q.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MAGUIRE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">So, what are they going to do? Sue me? Disbar me? Evict me from the country club?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. KLEIN
</p><p id="dia">Raymond, you're under a lot of stress. You're not yourself.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DR. TURNER
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, well, what is myself? Because right now, I really don't know. Let's see --
