                                         ACT ONE

               DIRT 

               CAMERA MOVES up through the earth finding the gnarled tips 
               of a perennial weed. We RISE out of the soil REVEALING a 
               beautiful blooming daisy. In fact, it's an entire...

           1   EXT. FIELD OF DAISIES - DAY - FLASHBACK                        1   

               CAMERA FLIES OVER the "Welcome to Couer d'Couers" sign at 
               the field's edge to FIND a bright, care-free boy of about 10 
               (YOUNG NED) racing through the flowers sending petals flying 
               as he chases his dog DIGBY, an adorable yellow lab as bright 
               and care-free as Young Ned. Our OMNISCIENT NARRATOR (imagine 
               Patrick Stewart reading a bedtime story) begins:

                                     NARRATOR
                         At this very moment in the town of 
                         Couer d'Couers, Young Ned was 9 years, 
                         27 weeks, 6 days, and 3 minutes old.

               Young Ned is only a few feet behind his dog, 3 sets of legs 
               speeding through the brush. He reaches out trying to make 
               contact, but Digby is just out of touch. Closer... closer... 
               The brush gives way to a clearing. Closer... closer, still...

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         His dog Digby was 3 years, 2 weeks, 
                         6 days, 5 hours and 9 minutes old.

               WHAM. Out of nowhere, Digby is HIT BY A PASSING SEMI-TRUCK.  
               A BLUR OF BIG RIG obscures the impact. Ned stops, horrified.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         And not a minute older.

               TIME SLOWS TO A CRAWL. FUR SAILS THROUGH THE AIR, as if Digby 
               was taking flight by his own propulsion. ALL SOUND DROPS OUT 
               except for the RAPID, RHYTHMIC POUNDING of Ned's HEART and 
               the EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION of his LUNGS.

               He approaches the unmoving body of his dead dog Digby.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         This was the moment Young Ned realized 
                         he wasn't like the other children. 
                         Nor was he like anyone else for that 
                         matter.

               Ned kneels down beside Digby and as he reaches out to stroke 
               the dog's matted fur... CAMERA JUMP CUTS TO:

               AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP OF NED'S FINGER

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         2.


               The ridges of his fingertip look like circular troughs. As 
               Ned touches his dog we see a small STATIC POP OF ELECTRICITY 
               between his finger and Digby's fur.

               CAMERA JUMPS WIDE

               TIME RESUMES TO NORMAL as Digby inexplicably scrambles to 
               his feet with a happy dog-smile on his face and runs off 
               into the field of daisies.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         Young Ned could touch dead things 
                         and bring them back to life.

               Young Ned watches slack-jawed and furrow-browed as Digby 
               disappears over the horizon. He stares at his finger, not 
               sure exactly what just happened.

               CLOSE ON - A FLY

               It lands on a cupboard door and darts to and fro until SMACK.

               A FLY SWATTER ends its life in one abrupt movement. We are...

           2   INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - KITCHEN - DAY - FLASHBACK          2   

               The dead fly lands on the counter top. Young Ned's MOTHER 
               sets the fly swatter down and returns to lovingly preparing 
               a pie, pressing dough into the pie plate.

                                     NARRATOR
                         It was a gift given to him, but not 
                         by anyone in particular. There was 
                         no box, no instructions, no 
                         manufacturer's warranty. It just 
                         was.

               Young Ned peers over the edge of the counter, reaching in 
               and touching the dead fly. There's a small ELECTRIC POP then 
               the fly flies up and out the open window.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         The terms of use weren't immediately 
                         clear nor were they of immediate 
                         concern.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS THE FLY and Young Ned's gaze to:

           3   EXT. NEIGHBOR GIRL'S HOME - DAY - FLASHBACK                    3   

               A girl named CHUCK, pig-tails et al, plays in the back yard.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Young Ned was in love.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         3.


               She's making a small village out of mounds of dirt and 
               cardboard boxes with Play-Doh people and toy cars as her 
               FATHER waters the lawn in the background.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         Her name was Chuck. At this very 
                         moment, she was 8 years, 42 weeks, 3 
                         hours and 2 minutes old.

               She squeezes a little people head out of the Play-Doh Fun 
               Factory and places it on the body she's already constructed.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         Young Ned did not think of her as 
                         being born or hatched or conceived 
                         in any way. Chuck came ready made 
                         from the Play-Doh Fun Factory of 
                         Life.

               She makes the final few touches on her village and it COMES 
               TO LIFE THROUGH THE MAGIC OF IMAGINATION.

               CHUCK'S P.O.V. - IMAGINATION REALIZED

               Large as life, TOY CARS drive through tiny streets, and TOY 
               PEOPLE mill about on tiny sidewalks.

               BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The ground SHAKES. The TOY PEOPLE 
               react to the strangeness... then a GIANT REPTILIAN LEG STOMPS 
               into a cardboard building, crushing it.

               CAMERA REVEALS A GIANT PIG-TAILED GODZILLA stomping through 
               the village, sparing no one as PLAY-DOH PEOPLE SCRAMBLE.

               And just when we think a lone TOM CRUISE-ESQUE PLAY-DOH PERSON 
               has escaped... SQUISH. A GIANT RODAN-ESQUE WINGED DINOSAUR 
               looking as much like Ned as the Godzilla looks like Chuck 
               (wearing the same clothes, etc.) stomps him good.

               SMASH BACK TO REALITY

               Chuck and Ned are stomping through the remains of her small 
               village, having an absolute ball and getting very dirty.

               ON NED

               His Mother is sweeping the dirt off of him with a broom.

           4   INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - KITCHEN - DAY - FLASHBACK          4   

               Freshly broomed, Young Ned stares out the window as filthy 
               Chuck is getting hosed off in the backyard by her Father.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         4.


                                     NARRATOR
                         He was under Chuck's spell... until 
                         a blood vessel in his mother's brain 
                         burst, killing her instantly.

               IN THE BACKGROUND, WE SEE NED'S MOTHER CUTTING FRUIT ONE 
               MOMENT THEN ABRUPTLY DROPPING OUT OF FRAME.

           5   INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - KITCHEN - DAY - FLASHBACK          5   

               Young Ned turns away from the window to find his Mother dead 
               on the linoleum floor next to the stove.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP - MOTHER'S OPEN AND STARING EYE

               Young Ned reaches into FRAME and touches his Mother's cheek 
               just below the eye. A BOLT OF STATIC ELECTRICITY. Her 
               constricted pupil dilates and Ned's Mother blinks.

               DING. The timer goes off.

               ON NED

               He slowly backs away as his Mother stares at him. A CLOCK 
               appears in the corner of the OUR SCREEN and begins counting 
               down from ONE MINUTE. 59 seconds... 58... 57...

                                     NARRATOR
                         Young Ned's random gift that was 
                         came with a caveat or two...

                                     MOTHER
                         Did the timer go off?

               Young Ned nods as his Mother gets to her feet, brushes off 
               her apron and pulls on a pair of OVEN MITTS.

                                     MOTHER (CONT'D)
                         I must've slipped. Clumsy. Hmmm.

               Ned sits at the kitchen table, unable to look away as his 
               Mother pulls a pie out of the oven. 37 seconds... 36...

               Ned's Mother places the pie in the kitchen window to cool.

               ON CHUCK IN HER YARD

               She kicks over the last standing building and runs inside as 
               her Father continues to water the lawn in the background.

               The COUNTDOWN continues... 23... 22... 21...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         5.


               ON NED AND HIS MOTHER

               Ned watches as his Mother readies a second pie to go into 
               the oven. 11... 10... 9... 8...

                                     NARRATOR
                         It was a gift that not only gave... 
                         it took.

               Ned's Mother twists the timer around, puts a new pie in the 
               oven and as she closes the oven door. The CLOCK HAND has 
               traveled almost full circle: 4... 3... 2...

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         Young Ned discovered he could only 
                         bring the dead back to life for one 
                         minute without consequence. Any longer 
                         and someone else had to die.

               INCLUDE THE KITCHEN WINDOW, through which we can SEE Chuck's 
               Father drop dead. Young Ned and his Mother don't immediately 
               see this because their backs are to the window.

               Ned's Mother cuts a piece of pie, puts it on a plate, and 
               sets it down in front of Young Ned. He takes a bite. Heaven.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         It was the most delicious pie ever 
                         baked because it was the pie that 
                         was not meant to be.

               His Mother's GASP draws his attention to the window, where 
               they can see Chuck's Father dead in the yard.

           6   INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - NED'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT   6   

               Ned stares out the window at an AMBULANCE slowly pulling 
               away from Chuck's house without its lights on, horrified.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Young Ned realized somehow in the 
                         grand universal scheme of things, he 
                         had traded his mother's life for 
                         Chuck's father's.

                                     NED'S MOTHER
                         Come on, big daddy, into bed.

                                     NARRATOR
                         And he was horrified.

               Ned's Mother pulls up the blankets so Ned can slide into 
               bed. She draws the blanket up to his chest. (NOTE: Never 
               touching him directly.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         6.


                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         But there was one more thing about 
                         touching dead things that Young Ned 
                         didn't know. And he learned it in 
                         the most unfortunate way.

               She moves to kiss Ned on his forehead.

               EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE ON - NED'S MOTHER'S LIPS

               As they're about to make contact with his forehead, we see a 
               STATIC POP OF ELECTRICITY.

               GO WIDE

               Ned's Mother drops dead right then and there.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         First touch, life. Second touch, 
                         dead again forever.

               Ned kneels next to his dead mother, poking her cheek, waiting 
               for her to open her eyes again. She doesn't.

           7   EXT. NED'S HOME/CHUCK'S HOME - DAY - FLASHBACK                 7   

               Young Ned sits on the porch, dressed all in black. He watches 
               as Chuck's 30-something Grey Garden-esque aunts (VIVIAN and 
               LILY) drag large steamer trunks into Chuck's house.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Chuck was orphaned when her father 
                         died and fostered by her aunts Vivian 
                         and Lily. A renowned synchronized 
                         swimming duo, they shared matching 
                         personality disorders and a love for 
                         fine cheese.

           8   INT. NED'S CHILDHOOD HOME - NED'S BEDROOM - FLASHBACK          8   

               Young Ned watches as his FATHER fills a steamer trunk with 
               all the belongings from his room, his Rodan costume,

                                     NARRATOR
                         For all intents, Young Ned was 
                         orphaned, too. After a brief mourning 
                         period, his father panicked at raising 
                         a child alone. In the wake of that

                         If they weren't so delicious and 
                         eaten so quickly, folks might notice 
                         the pies stayed fresh an unusually 
                         long time.

               Dead, dying or bruised fruit is lovingly picked from a bowl

               The Pie-Maker's hand snatches it before it hits the floor

                         That's racial profiling. Looky here, 
                         if the dog's innocent, it's murder. 
                         If it's murder, then there's a reward.

                         The facts were these: one Leonard 
                         Gaswint, 39 years, 42 weeks, 5 days, 
                         3 hours and 26 minutes old, was found 
                         mauled to death in a parking garage.

               A chow named Cantaloupe cleans himself next to a parked car 
               which partially obscures Leonard Gaswint's corpse.

                         His dog Cantaloupe was the soul

               There's a business photo of Leonard Gaswint with text that 
               reads: "REWARD $20,000."

                         Convinced of her innocence, the 
                         Gaswint family offered a significant 
                         reward to find the real killer.

               Ned and Emerson stand outside the morgue with the CORONER, 
               who is filling out a series of forms on a clip board. TWO 
               COUNTY SHERIFFS stand nearby, looking official.

                         Already had a dog expert.

               Emerson and Ned approach a sheet-covered body on a slab.

               Ned peeks under the sheet and Emerson takes a step back.

                                     EMERSON
                         How's he look?

                                     NED
                         He looks fine, but my threshold is 
                         pretty high so you have to take what 
                         I say with a grain of salt.

               Emerson takes a peek under the sheet himself.

                                     EMERSON
                         It's not a grain of salt. It's one 
                         of those blocks they give cows to 
                         lick.  The man's tore up.

                         Me. And I'm sure him. But mainly me.  
                         I'm fine when they don't move. It's 
                         when they move that I have a problem.

                         Yes.

               Ned turns off a metal floor lamp next to the drawer, casting 
               a shadow over the body and obscuring it. Emerson pulls back 
               the sheet and reacts to the OFF-CAMERA corpse, mortified.

                         I'm gonna wait outside.

               Ned watches as Emerson quickly disappears out the door. As 
               Ned's about to touch dead Leonard Gaswint's hand... CAMERA 
               JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP and we see the 
               FAMILIAR POP OF ELECTRICITY. Ned sets the alarm on his watch.

               A CLOCK appears in the corner of the SCREEN and begins 
               counting down from ONE MINUTE. 59 seconds... 58... 57...

               Leonard Gaswint sits upright into the light revealing he's 
               been MAULED. He couldn't be nicer.

                                     LEONARD GASWINT
                         Hello.

                                     NED
                         Hi. Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gaswint.  
                         Or Leonard. Do you prefer --

                         Leo. Your, um, current condition...

               Ned indicates the missing part of Gaswint's face. The clock 
               continues to count down: 43... 42... 41...

                                     LEONARD GASWINT
                         Do I have something right here?

                                     NED
                         No. There's nothing right there.

                                     LEONARD GASWINT
                         No, no. Cantaloupe's docile as a 
                         kitten.  It was that rottweiller. My 
                         secretary sicked her dog on me. She's 
                         been upset since last year's Christmas 
                         party. You know, it's a funny story...

               Before Gaswint can start, Ned touches him and life slips 
               from his body instantly. He stops his watch at 27 seconds.

          24   INT. COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE - DAY                            24   

               The Coroner and the Two Sheriff Deputies stand outside, as 
               before, alone with Emerson. Ned steps out of the morgue.

               fellow kenneled dogs barking M.O.S. in support.

               Digby pokes his head out from around the lounge chair. The 
               NEWSCASTER continues to prattle on in the background.

               She holds his gaze for another uncomfortable moment. He clears 
               his throat, she finally pulls back her hand.

               Ned's attention is drawn away from Digby and to the television 
               news broadcast. A NEWSCASTER reports:

               the deck of the cruise ship.

               Emerson walks out eyeing Ned, who closes the door behind 
               him. Alone in the room, Ned braces his back on the door and 
               takes a deep breath. Gulp. He slowly approaches the casket.

               Ned runs his hand over the pine frame then lifts the lid, 
               bathing the body of Charlotte Charles, aka CHUCK, in sunlight.

                         Great thought was taken as to where 
                         to touch her. The hand too impersonal, 
                         lips too forward, the cheek... the 
                         cheek.

               Ned's finger closes in on Chuck's alabaster cheek and CAMERA 
               JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP of his slow 
               caress. A CRACKLE OF ELECTRICITY between finger and cheek.

               A CLOCK appears in the corner of the SCREEN and begins 
               counting down from ONE MINUTE. 59...

               Chuck opens her beautiful eyes and blinks. Ned can only stare 
               back at her. The moment is as electric as his touch.

               He smiles at her, expecting a warm smile in return but 
               instead... WHAM. She grabs him by the jacket and SLAMS HIS

                         I had the strangest dream I was being 
                         strangled to death with a plastic

                         to sugar-coat it.

               It takes a moment. She glances at her burial shroud, her 
               coffin and finally the viewing room filled with caskets.

                         You can tell me who killed you so, 
                         um, you know, justice can be served.

                                     CHUCK
                         That is so sweet. I just wanna put 
                         you in my pocket. But I don't know 
                         who killed me. I went to go get ice. 
                         I was filling my bucket and I dropped 
                         my room key in the ice maker and 
                         just as I was thinking that was 
                         dumb...

               CHUCK stands at the ice machine perplexed with a bucket of 
               ice under her arm. FWIP - a bag is thrown violently over her 
               head. She sucks air and it shrink-wraps to her face.

               The ice tumbles to the deck in the FOREGROUND as Chuck is 
               murdered in the BACKGROUND.

                         ...then you touched my cheek.

                         I'm sorry.

               And Chuck was just starting to get used to being alive again.  
               It's weird and sad, but all she can think to say is:

                                     CHUCK
                         Thanks for calling me Chuck. Nobody's 
                         called me Chuck since... you.

               Chuck back in her coffin, Ned holding the lid. 11... 10... 
               He stumbles on his words, trying to speak but overwhelmed:

                                     NED
                         Before you...

                         Yeah?

                                     NED
                         I wanted to say I'm...

               Staring at her, Ned can't bring himself to tell her he 
               inadvertently killed her father. So instead he says:

                                     NED (CONT'D)
                         I used to... when I lived next door 
                         to you... I had a cru... I was in... 
                         You were my first kiss.

                              (smiles, touched)
                         You were my first kiss, too. Or did 
                         you think I'd been around?

                         I didn't want to assume.

                         Wanna be my last kiss? First and 
                         last?  Or is that weird?

                                     NED
                         It's not weird. It's symmetrical.

               5... 4... He looks at her and slowly moves in for the kiss.  
               She closes her eyes. Their lips are about to connect when...

          41   INT. FUNERAL HOME - BATHROOM - DAY                            41   

               The Funeral Director scoots into the stall, pulling down his 
               pants, sitting on the toilet and striking up a cigarette.

               Ned and Chuck, their lips hang in the air, centimeters apart.

                         His lips went as far as they would 
                         go.  He couldn't will them to go any 
                         further.

               Chuck opens her eyes. 2... 1... Minute's up.

               A beat, then THUNK -- we HEAR The Funeral Director's lifeless 
               head hit the stall door. Then the smoking cigarette drops.

          44   RESUME - VIEWING ROOM - DAY                                   44   

               Ned slowly pulls away from Chuck, who lies there blinking.  
               He let her live and someone else died, the weight of it all 
               is clearly on Ned's face when he looks back at Chuck.

                                     CHUCK
                         If you don't wanna kiss me, you 
                         don't... It was just a... I thought 
                         it might...

                         you didn't have to... be dead?

                         Well, that would be preferable.

               RAP-RAP-RAP, Emerson pounds on the door.

                                     NED
                         Nobody can know. I have to think 
                         about how to get you outta here. Can 
                         you lay really still until I get 
                         back?

                         Uh, sure --

               Before she can finish, he's closing the coffin lid.

          45   INT. FUNERAL HOME - OUTSIDE VIEWING ROOM - DAY                45   

               Ned emerges from the viewing room, quickly shutting the door 
               behind him. He's nervous and a little sweaty.

                                     NED

               Ned runs in and STARTLES at an ELDERLY JEWISH MAN standing 
               next to where Chuck's coffin was but no longer is. The Elderly

               The HEARSE is pulling away as Ned BURSTS out of the doors of

               Ned runs across the cemetery vaulting over headstones. He 
               cuts into a road and falls into step behind the Hearse.

          49   INT. HEARSE - THROUGH REAR WINDOW - DAY                       49   

               Ned chases the hearse until he disappears in a cloud of dust.

               Ned waves at the clouds of dust. He sees the Hearse continue 
               down the driveway until it turns onto the street, a long 
               line of cars pull out behind it.

               Ned sees which direction the Hearse is heading and cuts across 
               the Funeral Home yard, jumping over fences and hedges.

          51   INT. COFFIN - DARK                                            51   

               The small amount of light coming through the joints of the 
               coffin barely illuminates Chuck. She's beaming, awestruck.

                         Only Sleeping Beauty could know how 
                         Chuck felt at this moment. With a 
                         brush of his finger across her cheek, 
                         the world became a place of magic.

               Chuck is suddenly JOSTLED.

                         And then the pallbearers pulled her 
                         out of the hearse.

          52   INT. FUNERAL HOME - VIEWING ROOM - DAY                        52   

               8 PALLBEARERS pick up the casket and carry it out the back 
               door following the RABBI walking ahead of them. The 
               Pallbearers are unevenly matched -- tall on one side, short 
               on the other -- consequently there's some slippage.

          53   INT. COFFIN - DARK                                            53   

               Chuck continues to be jostled about.

          54   EXT. HILLSIDE GRAVEYARD/SYNAGOGUE - DAY                       54   

               The Pallbearers stop and we HEAR Chuck slide up and bump her 
               head on the inside of the coffin.

                                     CHUCK'S MUFFLED VOICE
                         Ow.

               Two Pallbearers react to the "Ow," glancing at one another 
               over the top of the casket, each thinking it was the other.

          55   EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY                                          55   

               Ned runs as fast as he can, spying the cemetery up ahead.

               He quickens his pace, running past the last of the mourners.

          56   INT. COFFIN - DARK                                            56   

               Chuck lies there, waiting patiently.

                         Lying in the dark, Chuck considered

               CAMERA PUSHES IN ON YOUNGER VIVIAN AND YOUNGER LILY, their 
               backs to us as they sit on the side of the pool facing very, 
               very sparsely populated audience stands, mermaid fins cover 
               their legs. A SIGN READS: "The Darling Mermaid Darlings."

               AND DOZENS of CAGED BIRDS in a maze of STACKS AND STACKS of

               mound of earth next to a hole in the ground next to a 
               headstone that reads "Charles Charles, Loving Father." The 
               TWO GRAVEYARD WORKERS seen earlier are about to take their 
               first shovels-full of dirt and sling them into Chuck's grave.

               Ned runs up to the Graveyard Workers, out of breath.

               Ned makes sure they're not looking and jumps into the grave, 
               pulling the lid off the coffin. Chuck sits up and smiles at 
               the sight of her Prince Charming. He returns the gesture:

               Chuck and Ned sit at a booth, Chuck wrapped in his coat. He 
               watches her devour a piece of pie and a large glass of milk.

               Ned is still filthy from digging up her grave.

                         Then you haven't been hugged properly.  
                         It's an emotional Heimlich. Someone 
                         puts their arms around you, gives a 
                         squeeze. All your fear and anxiety 
                         comes shooting out of your mouth in 
                         a big, wet wad and you can breath

                         me.

                         So a kiss is out of the question.
                              (off his look)
                         I'm teasing. I'm teasing you.

                         This is the most delicious pie I've

               He shakes his head, then touches a piece of fruit that's 
               fallen out of the pie, it SHRIVELS before our very eyes.

                         Like thinking-thinking? It wasn't 
                         premeditated.  I wasn't lying in 
                         wait.  More like I was musing on the 
                         idea.  Not, you know, dwelling. But 
                         I wasn't seriously considering until 
                         the exact moment I did it. Or, um, 
                         didn't do it.

               Chuck stares at him a moment -- this is all overwhelming.

                         I always wondered if you'd come back.  
                         I guess you came back when I needed 
                         you most. Well, that would've been 
                         before I was killed but this worked 
                         out.

                         come she's not dead anymore?" It'd 
                         be a disaster.

                         I suppose dying is as good excuse as

                         was struck by the undignified nature

               Chuck stands and returns to the bedroom. Ned lays his head 
               back down on the couch, unable to shut his eyes.

               Chuck in bed, facing the living room. She closes her eyes 
               and reaches out and puts her palm to the wall.

               surprised to see Olive standing outside her apartment 
               surprised to see a woman coming out of Ned's.

               Olive sizes her up for a moment, then out of curiosity:

                         Might see a dead woman speaking to 
                         you in confidence as an opportunity 
                         to make a whole lot of money by your

               With that, Chuck slides into the booth next to Emerson.

                         ruminating I mean pondering, not 
                         chewing cud. How about we solve my 
                         murder and collect the reward. 
                         Wouldn't that be poetic?  It's 
                         certainly an anecdote.

                         No. I wanted you not to want the 
                         reward.  100,000 dollars is a lot of 
                         money. How about a 3 way split? 
                         30/30/40? Only fair I get more. I 
                         did die for it.

                         stuff off of dead people and sold it 
                         on ebay. It's all in the obituary.

               just murdered. She locks eyes with Chuck.

                         gonna catch up. Then you're... not

                         And I'm real sorry about that. I 
                         probably should have said something.  
                         But to be honest, and really? Why 
                         not at this point? If it was safe, I 
                         would've done it myself. This is 
                         fantastic. Being honest is fun.

                         It was Aunt Vivian and Aunt Lily who 
                         received custody of the monkeys. And 
                         they were about to be paid a visit

          81   EXT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - NIGHT - MOMENTS EARLIER           81   

               Ned's VINTAGE MERCEDES screeches to a halt across the street 
               from Chuck's Aunts' House. Ned, Emerson and Chuck hop out.

                                     NED
                         You stay here.

                                     CHUCK
                         I just wanna look in the windows. 
                         Like the ghost of Christmas past.

                                     NED
                         This isn't your Christmas anymore.

                         I want my pie and I wanna eat it, 
                         too.  I'll get crumbs in the bed I 
                         don't mind.

                                     NED
                         You can't. You can have your pie, 
                         but you can't eat it. That's how it 
                         works.

                         Chuck was the Pie-Maker's pie and he 
                         could never have a bite.

                         You're making me hungry.

                         What if something happened?  What if 
                         they got hoisted on my petard, too? 
                         I would just die. Again.

                                     NED
                         I wish I could give you an emotional 
                         Heimlich so you could cough up that 
                         wad of fear and anxiety, but... I 
                         can't.

               Ned stares at her, his heart swells.

                                     NED (CONT'D)
                              (to Emerson)
                         Give her a hug.

               Emerson gives Chuck a hug.

          82   INT. POOL - DAY - FLASHBACK                                   82   

               Teen Vivian and Lily loll underwater, rolling over and over 
               languidly in sea-shell bikini tops and mermaid fin bottoms.

                         They made a name for themselves as

               Teen Vivian and Teen Lily dive, pivot, shoot out of the water 
               and flip, perfectly synchronized. The CROWD goes wild.

          83   INT. POOL - DAY - FLASHBACK - 15 YEARS LATER                  83   

               30's VIVIAN and LILY loll underwater, rolling over and over 
               less gracefully than before, their mermaid fins not as cute.

                         Still holding onto their fading glory

                         were changed forever...

          84   INT. BATHROOM - FLASHBACK                                     84   

               CAMERA MOVES PAST an advertisement for the "Darling Mermaid 
               Darlings" to FIND 40's Lily cleaning the litter box as the 
               cat waits patiently for her to be done. She accidentally 
               flips cat sand in her own face and recoils.

          85   INT. POOL - DAY - FLASHBACK                                   85   

               The cat now sits at the edge of the pool watching 30's Vivian 
               and 30's Lily (with an eye patch) loll underwater with no 
               indication of grace, colliding into each other.

                         Not only was the eye lost but their

               The CROWD in the stands is only 7 percent of what it was.

               train of PALLBEARERS carrying her father's coffin through 
               the GRAVEYARD on the hill above the Synagogue.

          87   INT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT     87   

               Vivian is preparing a cheese platter while Lily watches an 
               old television playing a NEWSREEL of the DARLING MERMAID 
               DARLINGS in action, swimming in circles under water.

               DING-DONG. The doorbell rings.

               Ned and Emerson stand at a walk-in gate talking to a box.

                                     VIVIAN'S VOICE
                         Hello?

                                     NED
                         Hi. Uh, my name is Ned. I lived next 
                         door 20 years ago. I was a friend of 
                         Chuck's... or Charlotte's, rather.

               Emerson shoots him a look. BUZZZ. The walk in gate unlatches 
               and Ned turns and gives Chuck in the car a thumbs up. She 
               returns the thumbs up and then immediately scrambles out of 
               the car, running to catch the gate before it closes.

          89   INT. CHUCK'S CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT                           89   

               Ned and Emerson sit opposite Vivian, they're surrounded by 
               CAGED BIRDS of all varieties and a maze of newspaper stacks.

               As Vivian sets a sad cobbled-together cheese and cracker 
               plate in front of their guests, Lily prattles on:

                                     LILY
                         Charlotte was a firecracker. Always 
                         trying to get us out of the house, 
                         threatening to bake anti-depressants 
                         into our food. Got to the point I 
                         was scared to eat anything she cooked.

                         She was a good cook. And a nice girl.  
                         Do you like girls?

                                     NED
                         Yes, ma'am.

                         Charlotte was a nice girl.  With the 
                         exception of puberty. Which was 
                         unfortunately the same time Lily was 
                         going through her change of life.

                                     LILY
                         It's impolite to discuss a person's 
                         menopause in mixed company.

                                     VIVIAN
                         It nearly killed me.

               Lily turns the subject back to Charlotte.

                                     LILY
                         Horrible the way Charlotte died. On 
                         a cruise. Last days spent surrounded 
                         by middle-aged over-weight women who 
                         wear sweatshirts with things sewn to 
                         them.  Usually kittens made of felt. 
                         And the food is perfectly atrocious. 
                         Unless she enjoyed vomiting and 
                         diarrhea, I can't imagine she had a 
                         good last meal.

                                     EMERSON
                         A good last meal goes a long way. 
                         Our penal system makes a point of 
                         it.

                                     NED
                         It's nice she had a little glimpse 
                         of the world before she died.

                                     LILY
                         The world isn't that great.

                                     VIVIAN
                         At least she had the sense not to 
                         fly.  Airplanes fall outta the sky 
                         every day.

                                     (TO EMERSON)
                         Cheese? I recommend the pure goat 
                         with blue ash. Has a grassy flavor.

               Emerson takes a bite.

                         It does have a grassy flavor.

                         It's delicious with Charlotte's honey.  
                         You haven't lived until you've tasted 
                         her honey. The homeless love it.

                                     LILY
                              (holds off emotion)
                         We'll never taste her honey again.

               Chuck peers through the window at her Aunts, examining the 
               life she left behind. Regardless of their neurosis, Chuck's 
               Aunts were the only family she had and she loves them.

                         For the life of her, Chuck couldn't 
                         remember why she was so desperate to 
                         leave her Aunts behind.

               Ned reacts as he catches Chuck peering through the window.  
               He tries not to lose his focus and keep on task:

                         Not to change the subject, but has 
                         the cruise line returned her 
                         belongings?  Specifically a stainless 
                         steel briefcase?

               Chuck spots Ned spotting her and ducks out of sight.

               She sneaks another look at her Aunts through the window, 
               surrounded by their feathered friends in cages. She moves 
               around the side of the house, eyes the stacks of bee hives.

          93   INT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - CHUCK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT           93   

               Chuck opens the window, climbs inside, finds the bed with 
               the suitcase and the briefcase on the springs on top. A lone 
               parrot is on its perch in the its cage in the corner.  Chuck 
               opens the briefcase to reveal the twin PLASTER MONKEYS.

                                     NARRATOR
                         The monkeys of indeterminate 
                         sentimental value took on a new 
                         sentimental value for Chuck. If she 
                         couldn't keep her Aunts, she was 
                         going to keep them.

               She HEARS footsteps coming up the stairs. She pulls the 
               monkeys out of the briefcase.

               Lily walks up the stairs.

          95   CHUCK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                       95   

               Chuck snaps the briefcase shut and moves toward the window.  
               She stops and takes a look around and slips outside.

               Lily ENTERS narrowly missing Chuck. Lily crosses to the window 
               and pulls it shut, yanking the curtains closed.

          96   EXT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - LEDGE - NIGHT                     96   

               Chuck stands on the ledge out of sight, the two plaster 
               monkeys under her arm.

          97   INT. CHUCK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  97   

               Lily moves to the bed and picks up the briefcase. Behind 
               her, silhouetted in the door, a MAN quietly ENTERS the room.

               The parrot SQUAWKS.

                                     PARROT
                         "Oh, for Pete's sake."

               Lily turns around and FWIP - a bag is thrown violently over 
               her head. She sucks air and it shrink-wraps to her face.

          98   EXT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - LEDGE - NIGHT                     98   

               Chuck is trying to see through the window, but can't around 
               the winding maze of NEWSPAPER STACKS. She shimmies along the 
               ledge toward another window.

          99   INT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               99   

               Ned, Emerson and Vivian in the living room.

                         Charlotte always wanted to get away.  
                         Got away further than any of us 
                         thought.

               Ned reaches over and holds Lily's hand...

                         In a rare moment of sensitivity, the 
                         Pie-Maker reached out and touched 
                         someone... who didn't want to be 
                         touched.

               ...but she stiffens at his touch. They sit there an awkward 
               beat as if a social taboo has been broken. Ned is finally 
               unable to take it anymore and gets up to excuse himself.

                                     NED
                         I'll go see if she needs any help 
                         bringing it down in case it's heavy.

         100   INT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - LANDING - NIGHT                  100   

               Ned climbs the stairs to the second landing. It's eerily 
               quiet upstairs. He takes a few steps down the hall.

                                     NED
                         Want me to carry that for you?

               He rounds the corner and sees the stainless steel briefcase 
               in the middle of the hall when FWIP - a bag is thrown 
               violently over his head, as well. He sucks air and it 
               shrinkwraps to his face. Ned's struggles with the Killer, 
               who tightens his grip, pulling Ned off his feet.

               WHAP -- Chuck comes out of nowhere and SLAMS THE STAINLESS 
               STEAL BRIEFASE upside the Plastic Sack Killer's head. It 
               rings in his ears and ours. He drops Ned with a plop. He 
               scrambles back pulling the sack off his face, gasping for 
               air. The Plastic Sack Killer spins around just as Chuck is 
               taking another swing with the briefcase --

               THWAP. The Plastic Sack Killer catches the briefcase before 
               it hits his head, snapping it out of Chuck's hands. A tense 
               beat then...

                                     PLASTIC SACK KILLER
                         Didn't I kill you?

                                     LILY (O.S.)
                         I can hold my breath for a long time.

               The Plastic Sack Killer turns to see Lily, still alive, 
               standing at the other end of the hall cocking a shotgun.

                                     LILY (CONT'D)
                         18 years of under-water ballet.

                                     PLASTIC SACK KILLER
                         Oh, for Pete's sake.

               BLAM! The shotgun KICK PROPELS Lily backward into the 
               partially closed door behind her and into the next room.  
               The impact of the SHOTGUN BLAST knocks the Plastic Sack Killer 
               off his feet and THROUGH THE WINDOW BEHIND HIM, the stainless 
               steel briefcase clamors to the floor.

               Emerson and Vivian both react to the commotion upstairs.

               UPSTAIRS LANDING

               Chuck and Ned stand with the gaping window between them, 
               staring at each other. Holy shit. Did that just happen?

               They look down the other end of the hall where Lily is staring 
               directly at not only Ned but more importantly Chuck, her 
               dead niece evidently returned from the grave.

                         The jig appeared to be up. Aunt Lily 
                         was looking directly at her niece. 
                         Her niece who wasn't supposed to be 
                         alive.

               LILY'S P.O.V. - HALL

               The corridor is partially obscured by her eye patch and she 
               doesn't see Chuck at all, only Ned

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         And if she possessed two good eyes, 
                         she would have seen her.

               ON CHUCK

               She slinks around the corner and out the open window.

         101   EXT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - LEDGE - NIGHT                    101   

               Chuck emerges from the second story and climbs down the rose 
               trellis. She turns back to see:

               SECOND STORY WINDOW

               Ned's looking out the window at Chuck. The wail of approaching 
               sirens can be heard in the distance.

               NED'S P.O.V. - YARD

               Chuck runs across the yard and stops at the dead Plastic 
               Sack Killer and kicks him.

                         A rush of warmth washed over the Pie 
                         Maker, he would later describe this 
                         feeling as delight. The girl he 
                         rescued from death had returned the 
                         favor.

               Ned turns from the window to find Lily holding the stainless 
               steel briefcase as Emerson and Vivian come up the stairs.

               ON BRIEFCASE

               The lid pops open to REVEAL there are no monkeys, but instead 
               it's filled with HONEYCOMB. A single bee flies out.

                         And she gave a little sweetness to 
                         the ones she left behind.

               GO WIDE

               Ned, Emerson, Vivian and Lily watch the lone bee fly out the 
               window and into the night.

         103   EXT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - NIGHT                            103   

               POLICE and NEWS VANS parked in the street outside the fence.  
               POLICE OFFICERS, REPORTERS and CAMERA-MEN storm through the 
               gait and stop short at an unusual sight.

               THE DEAD PLASTIC SACK KILLER

               He's laying sprawled out surrounded by broken glass.

               ON LILY AND VIVIAN

               They step out onto the porch, surveying the REPORTERS and a 
               gathering CROWD OF LOOKILOOS

                         of stardom.

               ON CHUCK

               She's wearing scarf and long-coat, watching from the gathering 
               CROWD OF LOOKILOOS.

                                     CHUCK
                         Hey. Aren't those the world-renowned 
                         Darling Mermaid Darlings?

               The Reporters glance at Chuck, then back at Lily and Vivian, 
               then swarm to the Darling Mermaid Darlings in a CACOPHONOUS 
               MURMUR OF QUESTIONS and GASPS.

               Chuck smiles, pleased with herself...

                         I was being selfish. I'd love to

                         I figure since they cost me my life 
                         I should get to keep at least one.

                                     NED
                         It's like those heart pendants that 
                         BFF's wear. Except with monkeys.

                                     CHUCK
                         Thanks for bringing me back to life.

               The word "life" hangs there. Chuck stares at Ned a moment.  
               The attraction is palpable, but is it love or fascination?  
               Not even Chuck could tell you. Ned's affection is clearer:

                                     NED
                         Thanks for returning the favor.

               Chuck takes her Monkey and presses its face against Ned's 
               Monkey. Ned smiles returning the kiss with his Monkey. He 
               feels the weight of the plaster statue.

                                     NED (CONT'D)
                         These are kinda heavy.

               Then: SMASH. Chuck smashes her Monkey against Ned's. The 
               plaster shatters revealing SOLID GOLD MONKEYS underneath.

                                     CHUCK
                         Is that...?

                                     NED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     CHUCK
                         Neat.

         106   EXT. CHUCK'S AUNTS' HOUSE - DAY                              106   

               The flowers in the yard are blooming and there's a fresh 
               coat of paint being applied to the house. Lily and Vivian 
               emerge and walk down the path to the gate, stepping out.

                                     NARRATOR
                         With a renewed interest in the world 
                         on the other side of their fence, 
                         Vivian and Lily retreated from their 
                         retreat...

         107   EXT. WATER TANK - DAY                                        107   

               A large metal water tank with port hole windows in the side.

               Vivian and Lily in robes and wearing bathing caps climb the 
               stairs to the platform above the water.

                                     NARRATOR
                         ...and took the plunge.

               The VERY AMPLE CROWD APPLAUDS as Vivian and Lily DIVE!

               CAMERA PUSHES INTO THE PORTHOLE WINDOW

               SPLOOSH-SPLOOSH. Vivian and Lily dive in and into each other.  
               The porthole the window in a kitchen door. The door swings 
               open to REVEAL we are:

         108   INT. KITCHEN - DAY - DAYS LATER                              108   

               CAMERA PUSHES PAST Emerson to find Ned and Chuck standing on 
               either side of the door to the WALK-IN FREEZER.

                                     NARRATOR
                         And the Pie-Maker and Chuck took a 
                         plunge of their own...

               CAMERA PUSHES BETWEEN Ned and Chuck to REVEAL they're standing 
               over a FROZEN CORPSE. A clean-cut white professorial type in 
               his late 40's wearing a suit. His name is MARTIN MILTENBERGER 
               and he's been stabbed several times.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         The facts were these: one Martin 
                         Miltenberger, Principal of the Beales 
                         School for Boys was found stabbed to 
                         death in the school's walk-in freezer.

               As Ned's about to touch dead Martin Miltenberger... CAMERA 
               JUMPS TO AN EXTREME-EXTREME-EXTREME CLOSE UP and we see the 
               FAMILIAR POP OF ELECTRICITY. Ned sets the alarm on his watch.  
               A CLOCK appears in the corner of the SCREEN and begins 
               counting down from ONE MINUTE. 59 seconds... 58... 57...

               Martin Miltenberger sits up and takes in his stabbed status.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         But before Principal Miltenberger 
                         could get into the specifics of his 
                         demise, Chuck thought it would be 
                         nice to ask...

                                     CHUCK
                         Do you have any last words or thoughts 
                         or requests?

               Ned reacts, glancing at Chuck and loving her for asking.

                                     NARRATOR
                         It was something the Pie Maker never 
                         thought or cared enough to ask until 
                         Chuck back into his life.

                                     EMERSON
                         You better ask who killed him first.

               As Martin Miltenberger prattles on, Ned stares at Chuck, his 
               heart swelling. He reaches behind him and holds his hands 
               behind his back.

                                     NARRATOR
                         As he stared at her, he reached around 
                         and held his hand behind his back, 
                         pretending he was holding hers.

               Chuck winks at Ned and reaches behind her back.

                                     NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                         And at that very moment she was 
                         pretending to be holding his.

               OFF Chuck and Ned holding their hands behind their backs...

                                                                  FADE OUT:
