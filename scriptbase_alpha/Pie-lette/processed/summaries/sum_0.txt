At an early age, Ned realizes that he has a unique gift - he can bring anything dead back to life.
There are limits however: touched a second time, the object or person dies; and anything or anyone re-animated beyond 60 seconds will result in another object or person dying.
Ned uses his powers sparingly, but when private detective Emerson Cod learns of his abilities, they form a partnership.
Ned will re-animate murder victims (for less than 60 seconds) to learn the identity of their murderer.
When Ned's childhood sweetheart Charlotte is killed however, he has a major decision to make.
