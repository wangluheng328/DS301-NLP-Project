FULL SHOT -- THE STARLIT SKY

          And he opened his mouth and taught them, 
          saying...

FADE sky to DAY.

LONG SHOT -- HELICOPTER -- OHIO RIVER COUNTRY
High over the country, CENTERING the winding river.

                    VOICE
          Beware of false prophets....

LOWER LONG SHOT -- HELICOPTER -- RIVER COUNTRY
We approach a riverside village.

                    VOICE
          ... which come to you in sheep's clothing ...

A CLOSER, LOWER HELICOPTER SHOT
We descend low over a deserted house; CHILDREN in yard run and hide; we 
hear "IT" counting "five, ten, fifteen, twenty..."

                    VOICE
          ... but inwardly, they are ravening wolves. 

MEDIUM SHOT -- "IT"
He finishes his count with a loud "Hundred" and turns, then:

                    "IT"
          What's wrong?

We PAN as he comes towards a little boy, beside an open cellar door, who
gestures towards the open door.  "IT" looks down.

                    "IT"
               (a low gasp)
          Heyy!
               (then he shouts to all
                 and to us)
          Heyy!

We DOLLY IN fast to, and TILT DOWN into, open cellar, into:

CLOSE SHOT -- A LEG
A skeletal leg in a rotted fume of stocking and a high-heeled shoe.  We 
HOLD a moment, then PULL UP and AWAY over the converging heads of several 
CHILDREN.  A CHILD whimpers softly.

HELICOPTER SHOT
The yard and the CHILDREN, same angle and height as the last descending 
helicopter shot.  We PULL BACK and AWAY.

                    VOICE
          Ye shall know them by their fruits.

HIGH LONG SHOT -- HELICOPTER
CENTERING the river.

                    VOICE
          A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit....

LOWER LONG SHOT (HELICOPTER)

CENTERING on open touring car, as it drives along a river road.

                    VOICE
          Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good 
          fruit. 

We stoop low towards the car.

                    VOICE
          Wherefore by their fruits, ye shall know them.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
He is the driver of the car.  Pleasant river landscapes (PROCESS) flow behind
him.  He is dressed in dark clothes, a paper collar, a string tie.  As he 
drives, he talks to himself.

                    PREACHER
          What's it to be, Lord, another widow?  Has it 
          been six?  Twelve?  ... I disremember. 

He nods, smiles, and touches his hat.  We see a farm couple in a poor wagon.

                    PREACHER
          You say the word, and I'm on my way.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER DRIVING
He brakes his car in a small riverside town; then proceeds.

                    PREACHER
          You always send me money to go forth and preach 
          your Word. A widow with a little wad of bills 
          hidden away in the sugar-bowl.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER DRIVING
He shifts into second gear, climbing a steep little hill.

                    PREACHER
          I am tired. Sometimes I wonder if you really 
          understand. 
               (pause)
          Not that you mind the killin's...

The stones of a country graveyard gleam in the last daylight.

                    PREACHER
          Yore Book is full of killin's.

He starts fast and noisily down a steep hill.

                    PREACHER
          But there are things you do hate, Lord: 
          perfume-smellin' things -- lacy things -- 
          things with curly hair --

INT.  A BURLESQUE HOUSE -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- A DANCER
She is hard at work to music o.s.

FULL SHOT -- AUDIENCE -- CENTERING ON PREACHER, IN AISLE SEAT
Among the members of the sad burlesque audience, he is in strong contrast: 
a sour and aggressive expression.  Music o.s.  We MOVE IN fast to a HEAD 
CLOSE-UP.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE DANCER

INSERT -- PREACHER'S LEFT HAND
Labeled H-A-T-E in tattoo across four knuckles, it grips and flexes.

INSERT -- HIS RIGHT HAND
Before we see the lettering he slides it into his pocket.

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
His head slants; a cold smile; one eyelid flutters.

INSERT -- RIGHT HAND AND POCKET
We hear the snapping open of a switchblade knife and the point of the knife 
cuts through his clothes. 

LESS EXTREME CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
He seems to "listen" for something.

                    PREACHER
          No, There are too many of them; you can't kill 
          the world.

A hand descends firmly onto his shoulder.  He glances up behind him as we

CLOSE SHOT -- A STATE TROOPER
He bends down and speaks quietly next PREACHER's ear.

          Moundsville license?

CLOSE DOWNWARD TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL HARPER
They sit in the grass, a sentimental picture.  JOHN is nine;  PEARL is five.
They are working together on PEARL's doll;  PEARL is dressing her, while 
JOHN gets on a difficult shoe.

                    PEARL
          Stand still, Miss Jenny!

                    JOHN
               (across her)
          There!  What's so hard about that?

He proudly exhibits the shod foot.

They hear the sound of an auto engine o.s.  They look o.s. and get up, PEARL 
dangling the doll.

LONG SHOT -- OVER THE CHILDREN -- BEN HARPER'S FORD
A Model-T Ford approaches at maximal speed on uneven dirt road.

                    PEARL
               (to John, happily)
          Daddy!

The car careens towards us; then swings into the sideyard as we PAN, and
stops.

They run towards their father fast; then JOHN looks puzzled and they stop 
short.

BEN HARPER half-falls out of the far door, his shoulder blood-stained, his 
eyes wild.  A hefty, simple man of thirty.  He looks at them, dazed, across 
the car.

MEDIUM SHOT -- BEN HARPER

                    BEN
          Where's your Mom?

                    JOHN
          Out shopping -- you're bleeding, Dad --

                    BEN
          Listen to me, John.

On this he comes around clear of the car with a revolver in one hand and a 
bloody roll of banknotes in the other.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
He screams.  BEN slaps him with the back of the money hand, leaving blood on 
JOHN's cheek.

CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- JOHN, BEN, PEARL
PEARL, and the house, are in the BACKGROUND.  PEARL just clutches her doll.  
During BEN's next lines, JOHN touches his cheek and looks at the blood on his 
fingers and at the bloody money -- of which we FLASH-CUT an INSERT.

                    BEN
               (rushing)
          Listen!  This money here!  We got to hide it 
          before they get me!  There's close to ten 
          thousand dollars.
               (his eyes dart wildly)
          Under a rock in the smokehouse?  Ah, no.  Under 
          the bricks in the grape arbor?  No, they'd dig 
          for it. 

CLOSE SHOT -- BEN

                    BEN
               (sudden triumph)
          Why, sure!  That's the place!

He moves forward and OUT and in his place we see two police cars, small in 
distance, coming fast.  We hear sirens.

INT. FRONT POLICE CAR -- THROUGH WINDSHIELD
...and over two STATE TROOPERS.  They move at high speed, with sirens.

BEN and his CHILDREN, tiny in the distance, dilate.

                    TROOPER
               (driving)
          That's him.

                    2ND TROOPER
               (over his shoulder, as if to us)
          He prob'ly still has that gun.

CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- BEN AND THE CHILDREN
Police cars approaching in BACKGROUND.  PEARL hugs her doll.  JOHN is dazed.
BEN stands, pistol in hand.

                    BEN
          Here they come.

                    JOHN
          Dad, you're bleeding....

He grabs JOHN's shoulder and stoops as we TIGHTEN IN.

                    BEN
          Listen to me, son.  You got to swear.  Swear 
          means promise.  First swear you'll take care of 
          little Pearl.  Guard her with your life, boy. 
          Then swear you won't never tell where that 
          money's hid.  Not even your Mom.

                    JOHN
          Yes, Dad.

                    BEN
          You understand?

                    JOHN
          Not even her?

In b.g. the TROOPERS get out of their cars and fan out cautiously to 
surround BEN: guns in hand.

                    BEN
          You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow 
          up that money will be yours.  Now swear. "I 
          will guard Pearl with my life ..."

                    JOHN
               (fumbling)
          I will guard Pearl with my life ...

                    BEN
          ... "And I won't never tell about the money."

                    JOHN
          And I won't never tell about the money.

                    BEN
          You, Pearl.  You swear too. 

CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN

                    JOHN

          Blue men.

GROUP SHOT -- TROOPERS IN BACKGROUND

          Ben Harper!

                    BEN
          I'm goin' now children.  Goodbye.

BEN backs away from his CHILDREN, raising his hands, gun in one hand.  We
PULL BACK a little, enlarging the GROUP SHOT and the role of the TROOPERS in
it.

                    TROOPER
          Drop that gun, Harper.  We don't want them kids 
          hurt.

TWO TROOPERS approach BEN from behind.

                    BEN
          Just mind what you swore, son.  Mind, boy!

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
He runs forward and clasps his stomach, with his mouth open.

MEDIUM SHOT -- BEN AND TROOPERS -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT
One TROOPER smacks the back of BEN's head with a pistol barrel.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN

                    JOHN
               (shouting; a sickly smile)
          Don't!

MEDIUM SHOT -- BEN AND TROOPERS -- AS BEFORE
Another TROOPER, with a pistol barrel, knocks the pistol from BEN's lifted 
hand.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN

                    JOHN
               (shouting)
          Don't!

BEN AND TROOPERS
BEN sinks to his knees as both men, and two others from the front, close in 
on him.

HEAD CLOSE UP -- JOHN

                    JOHN
          Dad!

He takes in the GROUP with his mouth open.

O.S., we hear the slamming of car doors, and car starting away.

FULL SHOT -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT -- THE CARS
They drive away fast in road dust.

THREE-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN AND WILLA HARPER
Carrying a shopping bag, their mother, WILLA, runs up from BACKGROUND between 
the CHILDREN, looking always to cars o.s.

CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA
She has a rich body.

RESUME THREE-SHOT
PEARL comes to her and she picks up PEARL and the doll;  JOHN, laden with his 
oath, walks quickly into the house.  WILLA does a bewildered take, then looks 
again towards the cars o.s.

INT. BEN'S CELL -- NIGHT -- CLOSE DOWN-SHOT -- BEN
He lies on his back, chuckling and murmuring indistinctly in his sleep.

                    BEN
          I got you all buffaloed!  You ain't never gonna 
          git it outen me; not none o' you!

                    PREACHER'S VOICE
               (o.s.., very low)
          Where, Ben?  Where?  Where?

                    BEN
               (distinctly)
          And a little child shall lead them.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- NEW ANGLE -- BEN, THEN PREACHER
BEN lies in profile.  From the bunk above, the face of PREACHER stretches 
down into the SHOT, upside down, snake-like.

                    PREACHER
               (softly)
          Come on, boy: tell me.

BEN awakes, sees PREACHER, and hits him so hard in the face that he falls 
from bunk to floor.  PREACHER collects himself into a squat, nursing his 
face, BEN sits up in bed.

                    PREACHER
               (with wholesome dignity)
          Ben, I'm a Man of God.

                    BEN
          Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!

                    PREACHER
          No, Ben.

                    BEN
          What'd I say?
               (he grabs Preacher by the 
                throat and shakes him)
          What?  What?  What?  What?

                    PREACHER
               (choking)
          You was quotin' Scripture.  You said -- you 
          said, "And a little child shall lead them."

                    BEN
          Hm!

He lies back, amused.  PREACHER sits on the bedside; manner of a parson 
visiting the sick.

                    PREACHER
               (gravely)
          You killed two men, Ben Harper.

                    BEN
          That's right, Preacher.  I robbed that bank 
          because I got tired of seein' children roamin' 
          the woodlands without food, children roamin' 
          the highways in this year of Depression, 
          children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies 
          on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never 
          see the day when my youngins'd want.

                    PREACHER
          With that ten thousand dollars I could build a 
          Tabernacle that'd make the Wheeling Island 
          Tabernacle look like a chicken-house!

                    BEN
          Would you have free candy for the kids, 
          Preacher?

He picks up and wads a sock.

                    PREACHER
          Think of it, Ben!  With that cursed, bloodied 
          gold!

                    BEN
          How come you got that stick-knife hid in your 
          bed-blankets, Preacher?

                    PREACHER
          I come not with Peace, but with a Sword.

                    BEN
          You, Preacher?

PREACHER gets and pockets the knife.

                    PREACHER
          That Sword has served me through many an evil 
          time, Ben Harper.

                    BEN
          What religion do you profess, Preacher?

                    PREACHER
          The religion the Almighty and me worked out 
          betwixt us.

                    BEN
               (contemptuously)
          I'll bet.

                    PREACHER
          Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.

                    BEN
               (sock near mouth)
          Keep talkin', Preacher.

He wads the sock into his mouth and lies back, sardonic.

His eyes lift from his hands, heavenward.  Moonlight on his face.  He prays,

Same shot as before, but now, prison lights are on: and a man, a prison

EXT. PENITENTIARY -- THE DOOR (REVERSE)
They walk in silence into MEDIUM, MOVING SHOT, the GUARD talkative, BART 
reluctant to talk.

The Penitentiary recedes in b.g.

                    GUARD
          He never told about the money.

                    BART
               (walking up steps)
          No.

                    GUARD
          What do you figure he done with it?

                    BART
               (turning, at door)
          He took the secret with him when I dropped him.

The GUARD leaves the shot; BART goes in.

INT. BART'S HALLWAY -- CLOSE SHOT -- BART
He hangs up his coat and hat.  Across this his wife speaks o.s.; a lighted 
door is ajar at rear of hall.  A clatter of dishes and pans o.s.

                    BART'S WIFE (o.s.)
          That you, Bart?  Supper's waitin'.

BART just nods and, tiptoeing, walks into a door next the kitchen and snaps 
on a light and turns on water o.s.  His wife comes out of the kitchen and 
goes in.

INT. BART'S BATHROOM -- CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- BART AND WIFE
He is washing his hands in thick lather.  Passing, she pecks his cheek and, 
as we PAN, looks into the next room.  He looks past her, and we see two small 
CHILDREN asleep in a big brass bed.  BART registers, turns again to the 
basin, and we PAN them back into the original TWO-SHOT.

                    BART
               (low)
          Mother: sometimes I think it might be better if 
          I was to quit my job as guard.

His WIFE's eyes go sharp and quiet.

                    WIFE
               (low)
          You're always this way when there's a hangin'.  
          You never have to be there.

BART rinses his hands.  A sigh; he takes up the towel.

                    BART
          Sometimes I wish I was back at the mine.

                    WIFE
          And leave me a widow after another blast like 
          the one in '24?  Not on your life, old mister!

He looks at her for a moment.  She goes out.  He looks o.s. towards his 
CHILDREN.  He goes into their room on tiptoe.

MEDIUM SHOT -- BART
He approaches his children, across whose bed we SHOOT without yet seeing 
them.  He comes into MEDIUM CLOSE-UP.  As he leans and we TILT DOWN, he 
extends his large hands.

CLOSE DOWNWARD TWO-SHOT -- HIS CHILDREN
Two rose-and-gold little GIRLS lie in sleep; BART's hands enter the SHOT and 
gently rearrange the covers so that their mouths and throats are free.  We 
watch for a moment more, the two sleeping faces.

EXT. CRESAP'S LANDING -- DAY
We are in Peacock Alley.  The tree-shaded dirt street of a small, one-street 
river town; a picturesque, mid-19th century remnant of the old river 
civilization, which general Progress has left behind.  Chiefly we see, in 
this order:  A schoolhouse (on far side of street); Miz Cunningham's second-
hand shop; a Grange House sporting a poster for a Western movie; Spoon's Ice 
Cream Parlor.  At the end of the street, down the river-bank, is a brick 
wharf and Uncle Birdie's wharf-boat.  In b.g. and in passing, suggestions of 
sleepy small-town life.

CLOSE PULLING TWO-SHOT -- PEARL AND JOHN
They stroll barefoot down the empty dirt sidewalk.  They look towards the 
voices, PEARL friendly, JOHN hostile.

MEDIUM SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER JOHN AND PEARL
Several, within the door of the Schoolhouse, stick their heads around the 
edge.  They chant at the HARPER CHILDREN.  Another next the door, is drawing 
something on the wall.

                    CHILDREN
               (chanting)
          Hung, hang, hing!  See the Robber swing!

OVER these lines we CUT briefly to --

CLOSER SHOT -- THE CHILDREN
... chanting, drawing.  The ARTIST completes in chalk, a large simple sketch 
of a man hanging from gallows.  As the verse ends we CUT TO

MEDIUM SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER JOHN AND PEARL
They look towards OUR CHILDREN; JOHN pays them no attention.  The drawing is 
revealed.  JOHN takes PEARL's hand.  The other CHILDREN giggle.

                    CHILDREN
               (chanting)
          Hing, hang, hung!  Now my song is done!

Between lines one and two JOHN turns away from them into --

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL -- THROUGH WINDOW
We SHOOT them through the window of MIZ CUNNINGHAM's second-hand store.  The 
back of a watch is silhouetted large in FOREGROUND; JOHN's eyes instantly fix 
on it; in b.g. the SCHOOL-CHILDREN finish their song and vanish, giggling, 
into the schoolhouse.  We hear the ticking of the watch.

INSERT -- THE WATCH
A watch with a moving sweep-hand, ticking.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL

                    PEARL
          Are you goin' to buy it, John?

No answer.  JOHN's eyes are fixed on the watch.  OVER a shop door-bell we 
hear:

                    MIZ CUNNINGHAM'S VOICE (o.s.)
          Uh-Hawwww!

They glance toward her.

MEDIUM SHOT -- MIZ CUNNINGHAM
Fantastically dirty and fantastically dressed, she hustles to them and we PAN 
her into a THREE-SHOT.  She talks like a Tidewater Cockatoo.

                    MIZ CUNNINGHAM
               (continuing)
          So your Mommy's keepin' you out of school!  
          Poor little lambs!

PEARL watches her; JOHN the watch.

                    MIZ CUNNINGHAM
          And how is your poor, poor mother?

                    JOHN
          She's at Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor.

                    MIZ CUNNINGHAM
               (she snuffles)
          The Lord tends you both these days!

JOHN doesn't take his eyes off the watch.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
His eyes are fixed on the watch o.s.

                    MIZ CUNNINGHAM'S VOICE (o.s.)
          Didn't they never find out what your father 
          done with all that money he stole?

Eyes as before till "money," then he looks up towards her.

MEDIUM SHOT -- MIZ CUNNINGHAM

                    MIZ CUNNINGHAM
          When they caught him, there wasn't so much as a 
          penny of it to be seen!  Now what do you make of 
          that!  Eh, boy?

She grins horribly.

TWO-SHOT -- OVER JOHN AND PEARL

                    JOHN
          Pearl and me, we have to go.

He walks off fast as we DOLLY BEHIND THEM; he leads PEARL who hugs her doll.

                    PEARL
               (chanting)
          Hing, hang, hung.

                    JOHN
          You better not sing that song.

                    PEARL
          Why?

                    JOHN
          'Cause you're too little.

A few paces in silence; now they come to the big window of Spoon's Ice Cream 
Parlor.

                    PEARL
          Can we get some candy?

WILLA's face is seen within; serving a customer, she sees them and waves them 
away.

                    JOHN
          No.

He keeps her strolling.  WALT SPOON comes out, proffering two lollypops.

                    WALT
          Howdy, youngins.

PEARL drags at JOHN's hand but JOHN, pretending not to see or hear, drags her 
out of the SHOT, shaking his head.  We DOLLY IN on WALT, who looks after 
them, surprised and touched, then goes inside.

INT. SPOON'S PARLOR -- GROUP SHOT -- WALT, WILLA, ICEY SPOON
We PAN WALT across a little of his Parlor; he plants the lollypops back in a 
jar on the counter and leaves the SHOT as we TIGHTEN IN on WILLA and ICEY.  
WILLA slides used dishes into wash-water; ICEY jaws down her back, from first 
moment of SHOT.

                    ICEY
          Willa Harper, there is certain plain facts of 
          life that adds up just like two and two makes 
          four and one of them is this:  No woman is good 
          enough to raise growin' youngsters alone. The 
          Lord meant that job for two!

                    WILLA
          Icey, I don't want a husband.

PEARL lies in their bed, her doll snug on her shoulder. JOHN sits on the edge 
of the bed, in his underwear.

                    PEARL
          Tell me a story, John.

                    JOHN
          Once upon a time there was a rich king...

He sees the shadows on the wall and gets up and looks at them.

                    JOHN
          ... and he had him a son and a daughter and 
          they all lived in a castle over in Africa.  
          Well, one day this king got taken away by bad 
          men and before he got took off he told his son 
          to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, 
          and before long these bad men come back and --

                    PEARL
          The Blue Men?

He moves and as his shadow moves away we see the shadow of PREACHER, 
motionless.  PEARL sits up and points at it.  JOHN notices her and sees it.  
We PAN JOHN to the window.  He looks out.

FULL SHOT -- PREACHER -- THROUGH WINDOW -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT
He stands motionless.

RESUME PREVIOUS SHOT -- JOHN AT WINDOW
He turns and we PAN him to bed.

                    JOHN
               (casually)
          Just a man.

He climbs into bed and pulls up the covers.

                    JOHN
          Goodnight, Pearl, sleep tight; and don't let 
          the bedbugs bite.

As they settle down we hear PREACHER's singing, sweet and quiet o.s.: 
"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms."

FULL PANNING SHOT -- THE BOAT, FROM SHORE
We PAN her into frame UNCLE BIRDIE STEPTOE's toy-like little wharf-boat.  As 
she passes broadside we CUT TO

... as boat passes.  BIRDIE's head sticks through a porthole.  He is a wiry 
old river character.  The boat whistles.  As BIRDIE speaks we PAN JOHN, and 
foundered skiff, into TWO-SHOT with BIRDIE.

                    BIRDIE
          She don't put in at Cresap's Landing no more, 
          but she still blows as she passes.  Come on in

          Ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as Uncle 
          Birdie's around.

He vanishes from the porthole.  We PAN JOHN from skiff to wharf and BIRDIE's 
door.

He gives JOHN a cup of coffee.

                    BIRDIE
          'Scuse me, Cap, while I sweeten up my coffee.

He fetches a liquor bottle from beneath the rocking chair; about to pour, he 
does a take at BESS'S PHOTOGRAPH.

INSERT -- THE PHOTOGRAPH
It stands in a cabinet frame: A fine-looking young woman in archaic dress, 
with sharp, accusing black eyes.

BIRDIE's face falls; he takes another drink.

          Well, boy, I'll not hide the truth; it was up 
          at Moundsville Penitentiary.

INT. SPOON'S ICE CREAM PARLOR
GROUP SHOT through door-glass, from JOHN'S VIEWPOINT:

PREACHER, WILLA and PEARL surround a little table.  WALT stands by, puffing 
his pipe.  ICEY, in BACKGROUND, stirs fudge at a little soda-fountain stove.  
WILLA looks both moved and pleased.  PEARL, shyly flirting with PREACHER, all 
but hides in WILLA's skirts.  PREACHER dandles PEARL's doll on his knee as he 
talks.  All the grown-ups are avid for his words, which we don't hear through 
the glass.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
We SHOOT THROUGH the DOOR; he quietly enters.

They look casually to JOHN, and continue talking.

          God works in a mysterious way, His wonders to 
          perform.

OVER this JOHN ENTERS the SHOT and stands at the fringe of the GROUP, staring 
at PREACHER's hands and at the doll.

                    PREACHER
          I was with Brother Harper almost to the end...

          No, Brother; I resigned only yesterday.  The 
          heart-renderin' spectacle of them poor men was 
          too much for me.

He becomes aware of JOHN's staring.

                    PREACHER
          Ah, little lad, you're staring at my fingers.

He hands the doll to PEARL.  JOHN's eyes follow the doll.  PREACHER holds up 
both hands to JOHN.  JOHN looks back at his hands.

                    PREACHER
          Shall I tell you the little story of Right-Hand-
          Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil? 

JOHN stands still.  PEARL, with her doll, crosses to PREACHER and twines 
about his knee.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
He looks on, in dumb alarm.

          of man!  The right hand, friends!  The hand of

          They're always a-tuggin' and a-warrin', one 
          hand agin t'other. 

He locks his fingers and writhes them, cracking the joints.

          Look at 'em, dear hearts!

He crashes both hands down to the table.

Slight applause from the ADULTS.  PREACHER takes PEARL with her doll, onto 
his lap.

PEARL offers PREACHER the doll to kiss.  PREACHER complies.

                    PREACHER
               (finessing it)
          I must wend my way down River on the Lord's 
          work.

                    ICEY
          You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help 
          it!

                    WILLA
          John: take that look offen your face and act 
          nice.

                    PREACHER
          He don't mean no impudence, do ya, boy?
               (no answer)
          Do you, boy?  Ah, many's the time poor Brother 
          Ben told me about these youngins.

                    JOHN
          What did he tell you?

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
He does a little take.  His eyes twinkle palely.

                    PREACHER
          Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and 
          your sister both was.

GROUP SHOT

                    JOHN
          Is that all?

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
Something new enters his eyes; a game has begun between them.

                    PREACHER
          Why, no, boy; he told me lots and lots of 
          things.  Nice things, boy.

A tight silence.  ICEY pours fudge into a buttered pan.

                    PREACHER
          My, that fudge smells yummy!

CLOSE SHOT - ICEY

                    ICEY
               (with horrid archness)
          It's for the pick-nick.  And you won't get a 
          smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the 
          pick-nick!

Over her line, o.s., hymn-singing begins and now, over her "the case rests" 
smile, we bring up the singing and

EXT. THE RIVER-BANK - CHURCH IN B.G. - FULL SHOT - THE SINGING PICKNICKERS
A pleasant, grassy river-bank.  Few men in proportion to women and children.  
We CENTER PREACHER.  They are singing "Brighten the Corner;" PREACHER sings 
conspicuously well.  The women watch him and admire him.  He gives WILLA the 
eye as we PAN to CENTER WILLA, who looks wooed and self-conscious.  ICEY 
enters the SHOT and whispers and beckons WILLA and, as the singing continues, 
they leave the group and start towards a shade tree in MEDIUM GROUND, which 
we PAN TO CENTER.

FULL SHOT -- WILLA AND ICEY
They walk; singers in BACKGROUND.

                    ICEY
          Don't he have the grandest singin' voice?

WILLA nods.  ICEY, looking ahead, is displeased.

MEDIUM SHOT -- THE TREE, JOHN AND PEARL
They sit on the bench, their backs to us, partly concealed by the tree trunk.

                    ICEY'S VOICE
               (sharp)
          John!  Pearl!

They look around.  ICEY and WILLA enter the SHOT, their backs to us.

                    ICEY
          Run along and play, you two.

                    JOHN
          Where?

                    ICEY
          Down by the river.  My goodness!

Docile, they leave the shot as WILLA and ICEY approach the bench.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- WILLA AND ICEY
They sit on the bench, their backs to us.  The CHILDREN recede towards the 
river in BACKGROUND.  WILLA meekly keeps her head down.  Singing continues 
o.s.

                    ICEY
          That feller's just achin' to settle down with 
          some nice woman and make a home for himself.

                    WILLA
          It's awful soon after Ben's passing.

                    ICEY
          If ever I saw a sign from Heaven!

                    WILLA
          John don't like him much.

                    ICEY
          Pearl dotes on him.

                    WILLA
          The boy worries me.  It's silly, but it's like 
          there was something still between him and his 
          Dad.

                    ICEY
          What he needs is a good dose o' salts!

                    WILLA
          There's something else.

                    ICEY
          What?

                    WILLA
          The money, Icey.

                    ICEY
          I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to 
          your grave, Willa Harper!

                    WILLA
          I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't 
          think I've got that money somewhere.

                    ICEY
          You'll come right out and ask that Man of God!
               (turning and yelling)
          Mr. Paow-well!
               (to Willa)
          Clear that evil mud out of your soul!

PREACHER starts towards her.  ICEY pivots and we PAN OVER her to CHILDREN by
the river.

                    ICEY
               (yelling)
          John!  Pearl!

CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL AND JOHN
JOHN looks up from pebble-skimming and loosens his tie.

                    ICEY
               (yelling o.s.)
          Come along hee-ere and get some fuu-udge!

                    JOHN
               (calling)
          I don't want no fudge.

His brow is furrowed.  He skims another pebble.

                    ICEY
               (shouting o.s.)
          You'll do what you're told!

They unwillingly get moving.

RESUME TWO-SHOT -- ICEY AND WILLA

                    ICEY
          You go set down by the River.

                    WILLA
               (getting up)
          Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!

                    ICEY
          Get along with you.

Both women set off, WILLA to River, ICEY towards GROUP.  We TRACK after ICEY.
PREACHER approaches.  ICEY, crossing him, gives him a little shove towards 
WILLA and a coy --

                    ICEY
          You!!!

CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- ICEY AND WOMEN, FAVORING ICEY
... a few men in BACKGROUND, and, beyond them, PREACHER sits down by WILLA at 
water's edge.  JOHN and PEARL approach.  As ICEY starts yammering, the men, 
WALT among them, shyly withdraw.

                    ICEY
          That young lady'd better look sharp or some 
          smart sister between here and Captina's a-gonna 
          snap him up right from under her nose!

They nod and agree, ad lib.

                    ICEY
          She's not the only fish in the river!

More agreement.  JOHN and PEARL join ICEY.  ICEY speaks to JOHN.

                    ICEY
          Now, you two stay put!

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
He looks hard towards WILLA and PREACHER o.s.

                    ICEY
               (o.s., to women)
          Shilly-shallying around ...

LONG SHOT -- WILLA AND PREACHER
... from JOHN'S VIEWPOINT in tableau of decorous courtship, framed by heavy 
domestic bodies.

                    ICEY (o.s.)
          A husband's one piece of store goods ye never 
          know till you get it home and take the paper 
          off.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- WILLA AND PREACHER
They sit by the water; drooping willows; almost in travesty of a romantic 
scene.  WILLA dabbles one hand in the water.

                    WILLA
               (very shy)
          Did Ben Harper ever tell you what he done with 
          that money he stole?

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PREACHER
His head goes slantwise and he smiles oddly.

                    PREACHER
          My dear child, don't you know?

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
He watches intently towards his mother; PEARL holds his hand.  ICEY's voice
o.s.

GROUP SHOT -- WOMEN, JOHN AND PEARL

                    ICEY
          She's moonin' about Ben Harper.  That wasn't 
          love, it was just flapdoodle.
               (agreeing nods and murmurs)
          Have some fudge, lambs.

She hands some down to JOHN and PEARL.  PEARL smears her mouth with it;  
JOHN, watching always towards his mother, takes one nibble and throws the 
rest away.

                    ICEY
          When you're married forty years, you know all 
          that don't amount to a hill o' beans!  I been 
          married to my Walt that long, and I'd swear in 
          all that time I'd just lie there thinking about 
          my canning.

In BACKGROUND WALT looks sheepish.

                    WILLA'S VOICE
               (calling o.s.)
          John!  John?

All look towards her.

LONG SHOT -- OVER GROUP
WILLA is standing, beckoning JOHN.

MEDIUM TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL
They start towards their mother.

GROUP SHOT -- ICEY AND WOMEN -- NEW ANGLE

                    ICEY
          A woman's a fool to marry for that.  It's 
          something for a man.  The good Lord never meant 
          for a decent woman to want that -- not really 
          want it!  It's all just a fake and a pipe dream.

The others agree with her.  She puts a piece of fudge in her mouth.

CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- PREACHER, WILLA, CHILDREN
... as JOHN and PEARL (with DOLL) come shyly up.  WILLA is seated again.  She
is radiant.

                    WILLA
          John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.

                    PREACHER
          Well, John, the night before your father died, 
          he told me what he did with that money. 

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN  
He desperately conceals his reaction; he thinks BEN has betrayed him.

RESUME GROUP SHOT

                    PREACHER
          That money's at the bottom of the river, 
          wrapped around a twelve-pound cobblestone.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL
He now conceals his new reaction.

RESUME GROUP SHOT
WILLA touches PREACHER's hand, warmly.

                    WILLA
          Thank you, Harry.

She looks all around her, glowing, and stands up, hands to hair.

                    PEARL
          John...

                    JOHN
          Sshhh...

                    WILLA
          I feel clean now!  My whole body's just 
          a-quivering with cleanness!

She walks away towards ICEY and the WOMEN.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER

                    PREACHER
          John: here.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL
JOHN moves to stand in front of him; PEARL to stand beside PREACHER, with the 
DOLL.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER AND CHILDREN
From JOHN's eye-level; as JOHN steps in front of him and PEARL beside him.

                    PREACHER
          Your tie's crooked.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN
The hand named LOVE and the hand named HATE come in to straighten the 
necktie. JOHN looks down.  He looks up and sees:

GROUP SHOT -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT
PREACHER, in close-up, hands busy o.s.; PEARL with doll; and between them, in 
BACKGROUND, WILLA.  She is now running fast towards ICEY, who walks towards 
her with arms outstretched.  Behind them the group of WOMEN.  BIRDIE's guitar 
music begins o.s.

                                        DISSOLVE TO

EXT. BIRDIE'S BOAT -- EVENING -- MEDIUM SHOT -- BIRDIE, JOHN AND SKIFF
BIRDIE sits beside his open door, strumming a guitar and singing.  The scene 
is lamplighted from within.  BEN's skiff is inverted on trestles in 
FOREGROUND.  At start of scene, we see only JOHN's feet; he's under the skiff 
examining it.  After three lines of song, he comes out from under, and 
lounges against the skiff, tracing a tarry seam with his forefinger.

                    BIRDIE
               (singing)
          'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River 
            Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good 
          old days of yore.  Now he sets in his old 
          wharf-boat...

                    JOHN
               (across him)
          When'll Dad's skiff be ready?

                    BIRDIE
          Can't hear ye, boy.
               (singing)
          So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for 
          Uncle Birdie...

                    JOHN
               (across him)
          When'll the skiff be ready?


                    BIRDIE
               (singing)
          And the times that are gone by.  I'll have her 
          ready inside of a week; and then we'll go 
          fishin'.  How's your Maw?

Through rest of scene BIRDIE picks lazily at his guitar.

                    JOHN
          O, she's all right.

                    BIRDIE
          How's your sister Pearl?

                    JOHN
          Just fine.

He gets up.

                    BIRDIE
          Leavin', boy?

                    JOHN
          Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.

                    BIRDIE
          Well, goodnight, boy.  Come again -- any time.

JOHN leaves the SHOT.

                    BIRDIE
          And mind now -- I'll have your Paw's skiff in 
          ship-shape, 'side of a week.

MOVING SHOT -- JOHN
As he runs past SPOON's, looking in, he is curious.

MOVING SHOT -- SPOON'S, HIS VIEWPOINT
ICEY embraces WILLA or waltzes her around; WALT looks on, pleased.

FULL SHOT -- JOHN
He hurries away from us towards home.

FRAMING SHOT -- THE HARPER HOUSE
In the otherwise dark house, one window is lighted.  JOHN enters the SHOT, 
his back to us.  Seeing the lighted window, he hesitates.

                    JOHN
               (softly)
          Is somebody there?

Silent pause, listening; then he walks cautiously towards us.

FULL SHOT -- JOHN
A tall, narrow shooting-frame; right and left thirds of screen are black.  We
SHOOT from inside the screen door.  JOHN crosses the porch and softly opens 
the door and enters on tiptoe and pauses, close to us, in the dark hallway, 
listening sharp.

                    JOHN
               (softly)
          Is somebody here?

Silence.  Relieved, but puzzled, he tiptoes along towards the rear of the 
hallway in CLOSE-UP as we PULL AWAY.  We bring in the bottom of the stairs.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
          Good evening, John.

JOHN gasps, peering, and looks up.

TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND THE PREACHER -- NARROW SCREEN
PREACHER looks at JOHN; JOHN sinks onto the edge of a chair. PREACHER sits 
opposite.  A bar of light from door falls on PREACHER's face.

                    PREACHER
          I had a little talk with your mother tonight, 
          John; and your mother decided it might be best 
          for me to -- let you know the news.

From JOHN, just a questioning helpless reaction.

                    PREACHER
          Your mother told me tonight she wanted me to be 
          a daddy to you and your sister.  We're going to 
          get married, son.

JOHN is still.

                    PREACHER
          Did you hear what I said, son?

                    JOHN
          Huh?

                    PREACHER
          Married!  We have decided to go to Sistersville 
          tomorrow, and when we come back --

                    JOHN
               (breathing it)
          You ain't my Dad!  You won't never be my dad!
 
                    PREACHER
               (obsessed, disregarding him)
          -- and when we come back, we'll all be friends --
          and share our fortunes together, John!

                    JOHN
               (screaming)
          You think you can make me tell!  But I won't!  I 
          won't!  I won't!

He gawks at his own folly, covers his moth with his hand and looks up at 
PREACHER.

                    PREACHER
               (softly)
          Tell me what, boy?

                    JOHN
          Nothin'!

                    PREACHER
          Are we keeping secrets from each other, little 
          lad?

                    JOHN
          No.  No.

PREACHER stiffens, relaxes, and chuckles softly.

                    PREACHER
          No matter, boy, we've got a long time together.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PREACHER
JOHN starts for the stairs.

It stands vibrating, then moves out of shot with receding engine sound o.s., 
disclosing:

TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL
ICEY's skirts in BACKGROUND.  They are awfully spic-and-span; they even wear 
shoes.

                    ICEY (o.s.)
          Wave yer hands!  Great sakes!

They wave after the car, bewilderedly.

                    ICEY (o.s.)
          You wait here while I get your night things.

She hustles out of shot.

                    PEARL
          Now can I tell?

                    JOHN
          Hm?

                    PEARL
          When Mr. Powell's our Daddy, then can I tell 
          him about--

His hand clamps over her mouth.  She struggles and whimpers.

                    JOHN
          You swore, Pearl!

                    PEARL
               (across him)
          John!  Don't!

                    JOHN
          You promised Dad you wouldn't never tell!

He takes his hand away but holds it ready.

                    PEARL
          I love Mr. Powell lots and lots, John.

JOHN grabs her by the shoulders and glares.

                    JOHN
          Don't you tell!  Don't you NEVER DARE tell!

SHOULDER CLOSE-UP -- WILLA
She is caressing her shoulders.

FULL SHOT -- WILLA
Her back is to us.  She is in a pathetic night dress; she stands before a 
mirror in a hotel bedroom in Sistersville.  She walks to the door.

INSERT -- WILLA'S HAND
It hesitates on the doorknob.

CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA
Shooting OVER her as she opens the door, we see PREACHER in bed, his back to 
us.  Beyond him, a window.  The drawn shade rustles quietly.

CLOSE SHOT -- THE DOOR
... from within the room. WILLA closes the door on which PREACHER's coat 
hangs.  The closing brings a knocking sound.  WILLA feels the outside of the 
coat; feels something hard; takes out the knife and looks at it.

INSERT -- THE KNIFE IN HER HAND

CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA
A moment of perplexity; then a little smile.

                    WILLA
               (whispering)
          Oh!  It's... uh...

She puts it back in the pocket and gives the pocket a pat.  She starts 
towards the bed.

TWO-SHOT -- WILLA AND PREACHER
We SHOOT OVER PREACHER as she approaches modestly and stands by the bed.

                    WILLA
               (softly)
          Harry...

His hand comes up; she puts out her own, expecting a loving hand-clasp; but 
PREACHER points to the window.

                    PREACHER
          Fix that window shade.

Startled, then again tender, she moves to:

CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA AT WINDOW
She adjusts the shade, looking always towards the bed.  She smiles 
maternally.  As we PULL BACK and PAN into FULL SHOT OF BED, she comes to the 
bed and sits on the edge and slips off her mules.  PREACHER's back is to her.

                    WILLA
               (softly)
          Harry!
                    
                    PREACHER
               (cool and clear)
          I was praying.

                    WILLA
          Oh, I'm sorry, Harry!  I didn't know!  I 
          thought maybe--

With a sounding of bedsprings, PREACHER turns.  His voice is quiet and cold.

                    PREACHER
          You thought, Willa, that the moment you walked 
          in that door, I'd start in to pawing you in the 
          abominable way men are supposed to do on their 
          wedding night.  Ain't that right now?

                    WILLA
          No, Harry!  I thought--

                    PREACHER
          I think it's time we got one thing perfectly 
          clear, Willa.  Marriage to me represents a 
          blending of two spirits in the sight of Heaven. 

He gets out of bed.  WILLA puts her face down to the pillow and moans.  
PREACHER snaps on a harsh bare bulb at center of room.

                    PREACHER
               (quietly)
          Get up Willa. 

                    WILLA
          Harry, what--

                    PREACHER
          Get up.

She obeys.

                    PREACHER
          Now go and look at yourself yonder in that mirror. 

WILLA hesitates.

FULL SHOT -- OVER PREACHER -- CENTERING A STAINED BUREAU MIRROR

                    PREACHER
          Do as I say.

WILLA walks to meet her image in the mirror; her eyes on PREACHER.

                    PREACHER
          Look at yourself.

Her head drops, facing the mirror.

CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA, PREACHER, BULB
WILLA is in HEAD CLOSE-UP; bulb hangs at center; PREACHER, in his nightshirt,
is beyond it.

                    PREACHER
          What do you see girl? 

Her mouth trembles; she can't talk.

                    PREACHER
          You see the body of a woman!  The temple of 
          creation and motherhood.  You see the flesh of 
          Eve that man since Adam has profaned.  That body 
          was meant for begetting children.  It was not 
          meant for the lust of men. 

WILLA just opens her mouth.

                    PREACHER
          Do you want more children, Willa? 


                    WILLA
          I-- no, I--


                    PREACHER
          It's the business of our marriage to mind those 
          two you have now -- not to beget more.

                    WILLA 
          Yes.

He stands watching her for a moment; then he snaps off the light and gets 
into bed.

                    PREACHER
          You can get back into bed now and stop 
          shivering.

                    WILLA 
               (whispering)
          Help me to get clean so I can be what Harry 
          wants me to be.

MOVING SHOT -- PREACHER -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT
PREACHER's watch-chain gleams.  The shot SLOWLY CLOSES DOWN on it and becomes 
still.  We see the paper-dolls blow past him.

          Now, up to bed with the both of you.

JOHN starts to laugh uncontrollably.  We PAN them past PREACHER's stomach

          Yes.  Yes.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND BIRDIE
They sit up into it.

          Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.

                    BIRDIE
          There hain't nary a hook in the land smart 
          enough to hook Mister Gar.  What a feller needs 
          is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.

Over this, he pulls horse-hair out of his hatband.  He sets to work rigging 
his noose.

                    JOHN
          Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?

                    BIRDIE

He puts over his line.  Pause.

          Preacher an' all...

JOHN's lips go like string.  BIRDIE sees it.

                    BIRDIE
          Never was much of a one for preachers myself.  
          I dunno what's wrong up at your place, but just 
          remember one thing, Cap -- if ever you need 
          help, you just holler out and come a-runnin'.  
          Old Uncle Birdie's your friend.

A powerful strike. BIRDIE lands the gar.  The air is full of sparkling water.

Admiring BIRDIE, he squares his shoulders, full of confidence.

          If you got n appetite for bones and bitterness.

               (o.s., calling)
          Plan on a longer visit next time.

                    WALT (o.s.)
          You don't hardly get settled till your frettin' 
          to git home again.

Again WILLA pauses and turns.

                    WILLA
               (with sweet radiance, to Walt)
          I'm needed to keep peace and harmony between 
          them.
               (to Icey)
          It's my burden and I'm proud of it, Icey.

She walks off into the mist.

Distant muffled sound of river-boat whistle.

                    PEARL (o.s.)
          John's bad.

WILLA enters, her back to us; she stops.

                    PREACHER
          Yes, John's bad.

                    PEARL
          Tell me another secret about my dad.

CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA
She smiles benignly.

                    PREACHER (o.s.)
          O no!  Your turn!

                    PEARL
          All right.

                    PREACHER
          Where's the money hid?

WILLA keeps smiling.

                    PEARL
          John's bad.

                    PREACHER
          Where's the money hid?  Tell me, you little 
          wretch, or I'll tear your arm off! 

Still smiling, shaking her head in disbelief, WILLA makes for house as PEARL 
screams.

INT. HARPER HALLWAY -- TWO-SHOT -- WILLA AND PREACHER
Narrow screen, same set-up as in earlier corridor scene, PREACHER and WILLA.  
Their eyes meet.  Pause.

                    PREACHER
               (stunned)
          I didn't expect you home so soon.

CLOSE SHOT -- WILLA
She still smiles; her eyes turn to sound of PEARL's sobbing.

TWO SHOT -- AS BEFORE
PREACHER stands still; WILLA in BACKGROUND opens closet door where PEARL sobs.

          Icey, I'm worried about Willa.

                    ICEY
          How do you mean?

                    WALT
          I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get 
          mad.

          Say what, Walt Spoon!

                    WALT
          There's something wrong about it, Mother.

                    ICEY
          About what?

                    WALT
          About Mr. Powell.  All of it!

INT. WILLA'S AND THE PREACHER'S BEDROOM -- FULL SHOT -- WILLA ON BED -- 
PREACHER IN BACKGROUND
WILLA lies in profile on the bed along the bottom of the frame.  A prim, old 
woman's nightdress makes her look like a child.  Her hands are clasped.  
PREACHER, fully dressed, stands at the window, which is in BACKGROUND towards 
foot of bed.  His coat, hung over a chair, is in silhouette.  River mist 
outside window halated by exterior gas-lamp.  The window shade is up.  She is 
mumbling in prayer.  She stops.

                    PREACHER
               (his back still turned)
          Are you through praying?

                    WILLA
          I'm through, Harry.

He turns.  WILLA is calm and immobile with the ecstasy of a martyr.

                    PREACHER
          You were listening outside the parlor window.

                    WILLA
          It's not in the river, is it, Harry?

                    PREACHER
          Answer me!

                    WILLA
          Ben never told you he throwed it in the river.
          Did he?

PREACHER hits her across the mouth.  A pause.

                    WILLA
               (continues, unruffled)
          Then the children know where it is hid?  John 
          knows?  Is that it?  Then it's still here, 
          somewhere amongst us, taintin' us?

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER, LISTENING FOR A VOICE

RESUME TWO-SHOT

                    WILLA
          So you must have known it all along, Harry.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER, LISTENING
After a moment, the river boat whistle blows, nearer.  HOLD CLOSE-UP for a 
moment after whistle.

CLOSE DOWN-SHOT -- WILLA, SAINT-LIKE

                    WILLA
          But that ain't why you married me, Harry.  I 
          know that much.  It couldn't be that because 
          the Lord just wouldn't let it.

RESUME TWO-SHOT -- WILLA

                    WILLA
          He made you marry me, so's you could show me 
          the Way and the Life and the Salvation of my 
          soul!  Ain't that so, Harry? 

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
He has heard the voice and starts to move out of CLOSE SHOT.

RESUME TWO-SHOT
He has moved over to the coat on back of chair.

CLOSE SHOT -- COAT
His hand goes into the pocket and brings the knife out.  (It is the same 
coat, and pocket, as in the wedding-night scene.)

RESUME TWO SHOT

                    WILLA
          So you might say that it was the money that 
          brung us together. 

He pulls down the blind.  He moves toward the bed.

                    WILLA
          The rest of it don't matter, Harry.

INSERT -- PREACHER'S HAND AND KNIFE
It clicks open.

INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM -- FULL SHOT -- THE SHADOWS ON THE WALL
They are shaped as in earlier scene, but altered by mist.  Set-up as in 
earlier scene.  Over them we hear the whinny-and-catch and the failure of the 
Ford being cranked; once; then again: then JOHN's shadow moves on the wall 
and on a third cranking which engages the engine, we PAN TO WINDOW, shooting 
over JOHN, who peers out, into blind mist.  The gears of the car shift; the 
car moves away unseen; its sounds diminish slowly, and die.  A moment of 
silence; then JOHN turns and we PAN him to the bed.  He gets in beside PEARL, 
who is asleep, and, as we TIGHTEN IN CLOSE, puts his hand across the face of 
the doll.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- ICEY
An ominous expression.  She looks sharp to WALT, beckoning secretly, through 
rear screen door of kitchen, onto porch.

                    ICEY
               (loud whisper)
          Walt!  Come quick!

FULL FIGURE SHOT -- WALT
He is scrubbing out an ice cream container on the back porch.  He looks up 
and moves towards her.

                    WALT
               (natural voice)
          What's wrong, Mother?

MEDIUM CLOSE -- ICEY, THEN WALT

                    ICEY
               (whisper)
          Sshhh!  He's in there.

WALT ENTERS SHOT with pipe.

                    WALT
          Who?

               (whisper)
          Mr. Powell!
               (Walt looks enquiry)
          Willa has run away!

                    WALT
          I'll be switched! ...

They enter the kitchen.  We hear muffled sounds of sobbing o.s.

MEDIUM CLOSE -- TWO-SHOT

                    WALT
          Just went?

                    ICEY
          She took out some time during the night -- in 
          that old Model-T --

WALT clucks his tongue.

                    WALT
          Is he hit pretty bad?

                    ICEY
          All to pieces!

WALT moves towards kitchen cabinet.

                    WALT
          There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?

                    ICEY
          A man of the Cloth?

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- WALT
He pours, snaps it down; weak-defiance.

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ICEY

                    ICEY
          Walt Spoon, that's for sickness in the house!

MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- WALT
He looks towards o.s. sobbing.

          I thought if you went and talked to him -- 
          another man --

MEDIUM SHOT -- PREACHER
He sits at a table, his back towards us, mumbling over his Bible.

TWO-SHOT -- WALT, ICEY BEHIND HIM, ENTERING THROUGH DOOR

                    WALT
          Mister Powell?

               (a reverent whisper)
          Amen!  Amen!

                    PREACHER
          She lieth and wait as for a prey.  And 
          increaseth the transgressors among men.

He closes his Bible and turns to them with weepy eyes and a brave little 
smile.

                    PREACHER
          My dear, dear friends!  Whatever would I do 
          without you!

          Is there anythin' -- anythin' ...?

                    PREACHER
          It is my shame -- my crown of thorns.  And I 
          must wear it bravely.

                    ICEY
          What could have possessed that girl?

                    PREACHER
               (simply)
          Satan.

                    ICEY
          Ah.

WALT sits across from PREACHER.  ICEY is at PREACHER's elbow.

                    WALT
          Didn't you have no inkling?

                    PREACHER
          Yes; from the first night.

                    WALT
          The first night?

                    PREACHER
          Our honeymoon.

          She turned me out of the bed.

          Nnnoooo!!

CLOSE SHOT -- WALT
Filling his pipe.

TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND ICEY

                    PREACHER
          Do?  Why, stay and take care of them little 
          kids.  Maybe it was never meant for a woman 
          like Willa to taint their young lives.

                    ICEY
               (hands clasped; with approval)
          Mmmmm!

CLOSE SHOT -- WALT
Dabbing at moisture in the corner of his eye.

                    WALT
          That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.

TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND ICEY

                    PREACHER
          I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother 
          Spoon.

CLOSE SHOT -- WALT

          A scrawl.  On a piece of notepaper on the 
          bureau.

ICEY smiles sideways.

                    PREACHER
          I burned it.

PREACHER holds out his hand, stares in disgust, and wipes his palm 
dramatically on his coat sleeve.

                    PREACHER
          I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so 
          strong of hellfire.

                    ICEY
          Amen.

                    PREACHER
          The pitcher has went to the well once too often, 
          my friends.

CLOSE SHOT -- WALT

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER

          She'll not be back.  I reckon I'd be safe in 
          promising you that.

CLOSE SHOT -- WALT

                    WALT
          Maybe she's just run off on a spree.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
          No!

                    WALT
          Well, there's no harm in hopin'.

TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND ICEY

                    PREACHER
          Ain't no sense in it, neither.  I figured 
          somethin' like this was brewin' when she went 
          to bed last night.

                    ICEY
               (all woman)
          How?

                    PREACHER
          She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone 
          up, and when I went downstairs to see what was 
          wrong...

                    ICEY
               (eagerly)
          What?

                    PREACHER
          She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine...
               (Icey touches him)
          ... that the husband -- Harper -- had hid 
          somewheres in the cellar.
               (playing his ace)
          She was drinking.

ICEY is happy to let her mouth fall open and let out a gasp.

CLOSE SHOT -- WALT
Sniffling.

THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER, ICEY, WALT

We continue to follow the line up, and bring in, close, the stern of BEN

follow only his feet; he steps past a tiny cellar window and we PAN and 
TIGHTEN IN CLOSE ON IT, into--

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL
Their noses are flat against the glass; their cheeks touch; their window 
isn't quite big enough to hold both their heads.  It is on the ground; we 
don't see their chins.  They look towards the departed PREACHER.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
          Chill-dren?

PEARL, who is on the side PREACHER has left by, turns her head towards JOHN.

INT. CELLAR -- MEDIUM CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL
They are standing on a coal heap, faces at the window.

                    PEARL
          John, why do we have to hide?

JOHN has taken charge.  He speaks very quietly, but calmly and cheerfully, as 
to an invalid.  He starts down the rustling coal-heap, helping PEARL down.

                    JOHN
          Careful.

The following dialogue as they climb down, making as little noise as 
possible.  We PULL slowly away.

          Where's Mom?

                    JOHN
          She's gone to Moundsville.

          To see Dad?

                    JOHN
          Yes, I reckon that's it.

They have achieved the cellar floor.

During the following dialogue we hear, o.s., the opening of a door, and 
PREACHER's footsteps indoors as he crosses floor, climbs stairs, and opens 
another door.

          Someone is after us, Pearl.

                    PEARL
          I want to go upstairs.  It's cold and spidery 
          down here.  I'm hungry.

          Now, listen to me, Pearl.  You and me is 
          runnin' off tonight.

                    PEARL
          Why?

                    JOHN
          If we stay here, somethin' awful will happen to 
          us.

                    PEARL
          Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?

                    JOHN
          No, that's just it.  No.

FULL SHOT -- A ROOM UPSTAIRS
PREACHER looks under a bed.

                    PEARL
          Where are we goin', John?

                    JOHN
          Somewheres.  I don't know yet.

O.s., PREACHER's footsteps come down stairs; JOHN leads PEARL carefully past 
a rake, a hoe, and a shelf-prop and they crouch down into --

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL
... beside an apple barrel.  PREACHER's footsteps cross kitchen, o.s.

                    PEARL
          I'm hungry, John.

                    JOHN
          We'll steal somethin' to eat.

                    PEARL
          It'll spoil our supper.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
          Pearl?

Both look sharp towards cellar door o.s.

THE CELLAR DOOR -- THE CHILDREN'S VIEWPOINT
The door opens; PREACHER'S head, carrying a candle in holder, a white-washed 
wall and stairs are lighted.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE 
          I hear you whisperin', children, so I know 
          you're down there. I can feel myself gettin' 
          awful mad, children. 

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN

                    PEARL
               (whispering)
          John...

JOHN claps his hand over her mouth.

CELLAR DOOR

                    PREACHER'S VOICE 
          My patience has run out, children. I'm comin' 
          to find you now.

He clop-clops nearly to the bottom of the stairs.  ICEY's voice cuts 
cheerfully across his descent.

                    ICEY
               (calling o.s.)
          Yoo-Hooooo!  Mis-ter Paow-welll!

He goes up the stairs and vanishes.  Light on wall through open door to 
kitchen.

                    ICEY'S VOICE
          Just a little hot supper I fixed for you and 
          the children.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE 
          Bless you, bless you!

                    ICEY'S VOICE
          And how are the children?

                    PREACHER'S VOICE 
          They're down there playin' games in the cellar 
          and they won't mind me when I call 'em.  I'm at 
          my wit's end, Miz Spoon.

ICEY clucks her tongue o.s.

                    ICEY'S VOICE
               (yelling)
          John:  Pearl:

She appears at head of stairs.  Her voice crackles with authority.

                    ICEY
          John!  Pearl!  Shake a leg!

She claps her hands smartly.

FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN -- OVER ICEY

                    ICEY
               (continuing)
          I won't have you worrying poor Mister Powell 
          another minute.

A short pause; then the children, covered with coal-dust, emerge into the 
light and climb the stairs.  JOHN's head is hung in defeat.  As they enter 
the kitchen, we PULL BACK.

                    ICEY
          Just look at you!  Dust and filth from top to 
          toe!

GROUP SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER PREACHER AND ICEY

                    ICEY
          Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?

                    PREACHER
          Thank you, no.  Thank you, dear Icey.  I'll tend 
          to them.  Thank you.

ICEY pats JOHN's head.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN

                    ICEY'S VOICE
          Don't be too hard on 'em, Reverend.  Poor 
          motherless children.

JOHN looks to PEARL and we PAN HER IN as PREACHER's hand named LOVE moves 
through her locks.  We PAN with PREACHER and ICEY as they move towards the
door.

                    ICEY
          Remember now, Mister Powell, don't be afraid to 
          call on us. Good night.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
He watches ICEY leave, o.s.

                    PREACHER (o.s.)
          Good night, Miz Spoon, and thank you again.

FULL SHOT -- PREACHER AND ICEY
ICEY goes away along path outside. PREACHER, his back to us, watches her a 
moment, then turns.

                    PREACHER
          Weren't you afraid, my little lambs, down there 
          in all that dark?

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN
Wondering what to do next.

CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE, OVER BESS'S PICTURE
We begin with HEAD CLOSE-UP of BIRDIE as he rocks, and PULL BACK.  He is 
rocking; and drunk.  A bottle stands beside the picture.  He turns and speaks 
to the picture.

                    BIRDIE
          They'll think it was me!  They'll think it was 
          old Uncle Birdie. 

CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE -- NEW ANGLE
His hands grip the edge of the chest on either side of the picture, which we 
now see.

                    BIRDIE
          If you'd o' seen it, Bess!  I'm drunk as a lord
          and I know it, but...

                    BIRDIE'S VOICE 
               (o.s., continuing)
          Sweet Heaven, if you'd o' seen it!

RESUME PREVIOUS SHOT
BIRDIE picks up the bottle.  His hand and the liquor tremble.

                    BIRDIE
               (continuing)
          Down there in the deep place... her hair wavin' 
          lazy and soft like meadow grass under flood 
          waters, and that slit in her throat, just 
          like she had an extry mouth. 

INSERT -- BESS'S PICTURE

                    BIRDIE'S VOICE (o.s.)
          And there ain't a mortal human I can tell but

               (continuing)
          ... Bess, for if I go to the Law, they'll hang 
          it on to me.

The bottle falls from his hand onto its side on the edge of the chest.

CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE -- NEW ANGLE
The reverse angle of the opening shot.  BIRDIE rocks heavily; liquor gurgles 
from bottle to floor.

                    BIRDIE
          Sweet heavens, save poor old Uncle Birdie.

                                        LAP DISSOLVE TO

MEDIUM THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER, JOHN, PEARL
PREACHER sits at head of table. JOHN stands to PREACHER's right, around 
corner of table.  He remains expressionless and immobile until he speaks.
PEARL stands to JOHN's right, hugging the DOLL.  The table is loaded with 
good food.  PREACHER, well-fed and at leisure, dabs his mouth delicately with 
his napkin, folds it, puts it in a ring, and folds his hands.  He waits.

                    PEARL
               (at last)
          I'm hungry.

                    PREACHER
          Why, sure.  And there's fried chicken and 
          candied sweets and cornsticks and apple 
          cobbler!

                    PEARL
          Can I have my supper, please?

                    PREACHER
          Naturally.

                    PEARL
          Can I have milk too?

                    PREACHER
          Yes.  But, first of all, we'll have a little 
          talk.

PEARL frowns and puts her finger in her mouth; she remembers he twisted her 
arm.

                    PREACHER
               (softly)
          About our secrets.

                    PEARL
          No.

                    PREACHER
          Why, pray tell?

                    PEARL
          Because John said I mustn't.

THREE SHOT REVERSE -- PREACHER, OVER NECKS OF CHILDREN
He slaps the table; his eyes crackle.

                    PREACHER
          NEVER--MIND--WHAT--JOHN--SAID!

PEARL starts to snivel.

                    PREACHER
          John is a meddler.  Stop sniveling.  Looky here 
          a minute!

He brings out the knife.

                    PREACHER
          Know what this is?

PEARL shakes her head for no.

                    PREACHER
          Want to see something cute?  Looky now!

He touches the spring; the blade flicks open.

                    PREACHER
          How about that!  This is what I use on 
          meddlers.

He lays the open knife on the table.

                    PREACHER
          John might be a meddler.

THREE SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER PREACHER
PEARL thinks the knife is a toy and crosses behind JOHN to pick it up.

                    PREACHER
          NO -- no, my lamb.  Don't touch it!  Now, don't 
          touch my knife!  That makes me mad.  Very, very 
          mad.

She hugs the DOLL and he puts the hand named LOVE on her curls.

                    PREACHER
          Just tell me now; where's the money hid?

                    PEARL
               (affectionately)
          But I swore.  I promised John I wouldn't tell.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER

                    PREACHER
          JOHN--DOESN'T--MATTER!  Can't I get that 
          through your head, you poor silly, disgusting 
          little wretch! 

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PEARL
Her mouth quivers; a large tear brims in her eyes.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER

                    PREACHER
          There now!  You made me lose my temper! 

THREE SHOT -- CHILDREN, OVER PREACHER

                    PREACHER
          I'm sorry!  I'm real sorry! 

PEARL sniffles and wipes here eyes with her free fist.

                    PREACHER
          Now!  Where's it hid, honey?

                    JOHN
               (suddenly and lightly)
          I'll tell.

THREE SHOT -- PREACHER, OVER NAPES OF CHILDREN

                    PREACHER
               (lightly)
          I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut--

                    JOHN
               (light and quick)
          NO -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she 
          swore she wouldn't.  I'll tell.

PREACHER's eyes crinkle and he turns to PEARL, smiling brightly.

                    PREACHER
               (chuckling)
          Well, I declare!  Sometimes I think poor John 
          will make it to Heaven yet!

His eyes snap back to JOHN and his voice is like a whip.

                    PREACHER
          All right, boy: where's the money?

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN

                    JOHN
          In the cellar; buried under a stone in the 
          floor.

THREE SHOT -- PREACHER, OVER CHILDREN
He closes and pockets the knife.  His eyes never leave JOHN's.

                    PREACHER
          It'll go hard, boy, if I find you're lyin'.

THREE SHOT -- CHILDREN, OVER PREACHER
PEARL gapes up at JOHN as he speaks.

                    JOHN
          I ain't lyin'.  Go look for yourself.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
... as he gets up, cellar door in BACKGROUND.

                    PREACHER
          All right...

He turns towards the door; then glances around.

                    PREACHER
          Come along.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN

                    JOHN
          What?

THREE SHOT -- PREACHER, OVER CHILDREN

                    PREACHER
          Go ahead of me -- the both of you.

They cross him towards the door.

FULL SHOT -- THE CELLAR STEPS -- FROM THE BOTTOM
The CHILDREN precede PREACHER, who carries a candle in holder.  PEARL is
gaping at JOHN's lie.  JOHN is looking left and right, casing the joint.

                    PREACHER
               (continuing)
          You don't reckon I'd leave you?

                    JOHN
               (with forced lightness)
          Don't you believe me?

                    PREACHER
               (sardonically)
          Why sure, boy, sure.

Now they are at the bottom of the stairs.  JOHN sees PEARL's expression and 
takes her hand.

                    PREACHER
          Now, where, boy?  Mind; no tricks.  I can't 
          abide liars.

                    JOHN
          Yonder.

He squeezes PEARL's hand harder, and points.

FULL SHOT -- NEW ANGLE -- OVER THE THREE
JOHN points out a place beneath a shelf laden with Mason jars; it is at the 
most distant part of the cellar from the stairs.  PREACHER starts toward it, 
leaving them at foot of stairs, then turns, catching JOHN's ruse.

                    PREACHER
               (sardonic)
          O no you don't!

He shepherds them ahead of him.

THREE SHOT -- NEW ANGLE
They arrive beneath the shelf.

                    PREACHER
          Now: where?

                    JOHN
               (lying magnificently; meeting
                Preacher's eyes)
          Under the stone in the floor.

PREACHER sets the candle on a barrel near the shelf-prop and sinks to his 
knees below shot as PEARL gapes up at JOHN and JOHN looks stony.  She seems
about to speak.

FLASH INSERT -- JOHN SQUEEZES PEARL'S HAND HARD

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER, FEATURING FLOOR
His hands sweep dust and expose concrete.  He straightens on his knees and 
turns to the CHILDREN in close BACKGROUND.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PREACHER
... as he turns.

                    PREACHER
          This is concrete.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN
A moment's silence.

                    PEARL
          John made a Sin.  John told a lie.

THREE-SHOT -- FAVORING PREACHER
PREACHER gets slowly to his feet and puts on his "listening" look.  His
sincerity is beyond doubt.

                    PREACHER
          The Lord's a-talkin' to me now.  He's a-sayin', 
          "a liar is an abomination before mine eyes."

He takes his knife out, and springs it open.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- FAVORING JOHN

                    PREACHER
          Speak, boy: where's it hid?

The knife pricks the flesh under JOHN's ear.

                    PREACHER
          Speak, before I cut your throat and leave you 
          to drip like a hog hung up in butcherin' time.

CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL
She starts to sob.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PREACHER

                    JOHN
          Pearl, shut up!  Pearl, you swore!

                    PREACHER
          You could save him, little bird.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PEARL

                    PEARL
               (crying)
              Inside my doll!  Inside my doll!

TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PREACHER, FAVORING PREACHER
PREACHER is astounded.  His hands fall away from JOHN.  He leans back against 
the wall and talks through laughter.

                    PREACHER
          In the doll!  Why, sure! Sure! 

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- JOHN
His eyes are all over the place.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE (o.s.)
          The last place anyone would look!

THREE-SHOT -- PREACHER, JOHN, PEARL
PREACHER makes a lunge across JOHN for the doll; JOHN, ducking under his arm, 
pulls PEARL forward with his left hand; he turns backwards and with his free 
hand, in one movement, knocks over the candle and pulls out the support on 
the shelf.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
Jars shower over him; one crowns him and breaks, shedding guck, which he 
wipes from his eyes.

TWO SHOT -- THE CHILDREN
They start up the stairs.

FULL SHOT -- PREACHER
He makes one step forward, steps on a rolling jar and falls.

TWO SHOT -- THE CHILDREN
They are near the top of the stairs.  We hear PREACHER below them.  JOHN 
slips and they nearly fall backward.  As JOHN recovers, PREACHER enters the 
shot, his back to us.  The children get through the open door as PREACHER
reaches the top.  JOHN slams the door, catching PREACHER's hand.  PREACHER 
screams. JOHN's astonished eyes peer through the crack in the door; the door 
loosens; PREACHER yanks his hand loose and sucks it, groaning;  the door 
slams to; the bolt is shot home.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PREACHER
... over sound of slamming bolt.  He snarls like the Big Bad Wolf.

All the above happens at once.

INT. KITCHEN -- CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL, BY DOOR
PEARL, dangling her doll, cries.  JOHN, panting, leans against wall by door.
JOHN is wondering what to do now.  Pause.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE
               (o.s., sweetly)
          Chill-dren?  The only reason I wanted that 
          money is so's you could have it.

                    JOHN
               (to himself, panting)
          The river.  That's the only where!  Uncle Birdie 
          Steptoe!

                    PREACHER'S VOICE
               (cooing)
          Puhr-urrl?  Want your Mommy back?

Pearl hugs her doll.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE
          Want me to get her right now?

                    PEARL
               (sharply)
          John?

                    JOHN
          Hush, Pearl.  Come on.

They fly out of the house.

                    PREACHER'S VOICE
               (bellowing, as they go)
          OPEN THAT DOOR, YOU SPAWN OF THE DEVIL'S OWN 
          STRUMPET!

FRAMING SHOT -- EXT. HARPER HOUSE
A pretty, pastoral shot of the house in light mist, as they run across and 
leave the shot.  Before they disappear, we hear PREACHER's fists hammering 
against the door.  We stay on the house at leisure; we hear him lunging, 
shoulder to door; we begin to hear squeaking of hinges and splintering of 
wood.

FULL CIRCLE SHOT -- FRAMING BIRDIE'S WHARF-BOAT
An ultra-romantic image of shelter and peace.  Frogs or river noises o.s., 
then the rattle of running footsteps.  The CHILDREN enter, their backs to us, 
sprinting towards the boat.  Light mist as in previous shot.

                    JOHN
               (calling)
          Uncle Birdie!  Uncle Birdie!

INT. BIRDIE'S BOAT -- GROUP SHOT -- BIRDIE AND CHILDREN
We shoot over BESS's turned photograph and over BIRDIE close, passed out in 
his rocker.The CHILDREN run through open door in BACKGROUND and JOHN runs up 
to BIRDIE.

                    JOHN
          Uncle Birdie!

CLOSE SHOT -- BIRDIE

                    BIRDIE

          Hide us, Uncle Birdie!  He's a-comin' with his 
          knife!

He grabs BIRDIE's shoulder; BIRDIE half-rises, and falls face down on floor.

          It's me!  John Harper and Pearl!  You said to

BIRDIE rears on one elbow and looks up at him.

                    BIRDIE

          Johnny!

He falls face down again.

JOHN grabs BIRDIE by one ear, turning his face up.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- FAVORING BIRDIE
He looks up earnestly at JOHN.

                    BIRDIE
          I never done it, boy.  Sweet Heaven, I never 
          done such a terrible thing!  I'll swear on the 
          Book to it, boy!  I never done it!  I never!

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
He is lost; and he becomes a man.

                    BIRDIE'S VOICE (o.s.)
          Lord save poor old Uncle Birdie Steptoe that 
          never hurt a fly!

He snores softly.

               (quiet)
          There's still the river.  The skiff is down by 
          the willows.

He masterfully takes PEARL by the hand and leads her into the night.

LONG SHOT -- THE CHILDREN
We shoot from the river.  They struggle through the sumac and pokeberry weeds 
at edge of river, towards skiff, whose prow, tethered to willow, we see 
throughout this unmoving shot, at our extreme right.  When they come opposite 
skiff -- which is a few yards out from shore --

TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN
PEARL, frankly bored, dangling her doll, is yawning.  JOHN, as he finishes 
undoing the rope from a willow root, looks up and around, checking on 
pursuit.  His eyes fix.

On the bank above, it is huge in the mist.  Same camera position as foregoing; new angle.

BACK view: skiff in BACKGROUND.  Same camera position; new angle.

          Hush.

FULL SHOT -- SHADOW, THEN PREACHER
Same position and angle as before.  PREACHER's own figure advances to 
supplant his shadow.  He peers downward, his open knife catching the light.

                    PREACHER
               (businesslike)
          Children?

He starts slashing his way through the brush-filth.

FULL SHOT -- THE CHILDREN
Same camera position as before.  They are floundering through mud, half-way 
to the skiff.

FULL SHOT -- PREACHER
Same position and angle as in previous shot of him.  He is half-way down the 
bank.  With his knife, he hacks at an entangling vine. 

FULL SHOT -- THE CHILDREN
Position and angle as before.  They reach the skiff.  Hacking sounds, o.s.

                    JOHN
          Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, 
          hurry!

                    PEARL

          That's Daddy!

He picks her up and throws her into the skiff.

CLOSE SHOT -- PEARL AND DOLL

cans.  JOHN gets in after them.

FULL SHOT -- PREACHER -- CHILDREN'S VIEWPOINT
He tears free of brush to edge of river, knife glittering.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
With his oar, he tries to push the boat free of mud.

He is shoving at the oar even more desperately.

He hurries much closer through shallow water.  Prow of boat in FOREGROUND.

                    PREACHER
          Wait, you little whelps!  Wait!

Another step forward and he does a pratt-fall and makes a splash.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN -- PEARL IN BACKGROUND
He is trying to feather the boat out to where the current will catch it.  In
panic and haste he is clumsy.

                    JOHN
          Why can't I do it when I know how to do it!

FULL SHOT -- PREACHER
... as he gets up at edge of mud.

                    PREACHER
          Wait!  Wait!  I'll slit your guts!

FULL DOWN SHOT -- THE SKIFF, THEN PREACHER
The current catches it and spins it round like a leaf.  JOHN's efforts with 
the oars are useless.  PREACHER enters, wading fast.  His hands are within an 
inch of reaching the helpless skiff; capriciously the current takes it 
downstream.

TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND PEARL
The skiff is taken steadily by the current.  PEARL sits up, doll in arms.
JOHN is almost asleep with exhaustion.

FULL SHOT -- THE SKIFF, OVER PREACHER
It is well away from him and getting smaller.  Waist-deep, he wades a couple 
of steps after it, then just looks.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- PREACHER
He begins a steady, rhythmical, animal scream of outrage and loss.

LONG SHOT -- THE RIVER AND LANDSCAPE
Featuring starlight; and the drifting boat -- PEARL in stern.

TWO-SHOT -- THE CHILDREN -- FRONT ON
JOHN is asleep.  PEARL sits sleepily whispering to her doll.

          had a wife, this pretty fly...

SPECIAL SHOT -- A FROG, AND SKIFF
A big frog is profiled; the skiff drifts by in distance; the frog twangs out 
a bass note.

          with me for a visit to my sister Elsie's farm.  
          Thot a little change of scenery would do us all

          Now ain't you relieved, Walt?

                    WALT
          Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' 
          off with never a word of goodbye.  I even got to 
          figurin' those gypsies busted in and done off 
          with all three of 'em.

                    ICEY
          You and your gypsies!  They been gone a week!

                    WALT
          Not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole 
          his horse.  Never caught the gypsies nor the 
          horse.

We descend to a poor riverside farmhouse; JOHN and PEARL tether a boat in 
front of it.

GROUP SHOT (FROM GROUND) -- THREE HOMELESS CHILDREN, OVER JOHN AND PEARL
They are eating hot boiled potatoes.  A glance at JOHN and PEARL, and they 
turn away towards lane in BACKGROUND.  JOHN and PEARL proceed towards the 
house.

MEDIUM SHOT -- JOHN, PEARL, WOMAN, THROUGH DOOR
We shoot from within open door of kitchen.  JOHN and PEARL advance to edge of 
porch.  A TIRED FARM WOMAN stands by the door within.  We shoot OVER her.

                    TIRED FARM WOMAN
          Hungry, I s'pose.  Well, I'll see if there's 
          any more potatoes to spare.  Where's your 
          folks?

                    JOHN
          Ain't got none.

Woman leaves shot briefly (we HOLD on CHILDREN).  She re-enters and goes to 
them with a bowl of steaming potatoes.  They take hands-ful and make to eat.

                    TIRED FARM WOMAN
          Go 'way; go 'way.

They turn and walk towards boat.  She looks after them.

She leaves the SHOT.  We frame them briefly, walking away, then:

willows along shore.

A wire bird-cage hangs close to the shade, silhouetted.  On the perch, a

          Howdy, Miz Cooper -- you goin' to sell me yer

                    CLARY
          She ain't our Maw.  We just live at her house.

They walk in silence.

                    JOHN
          Where's your folks?

                    CLARY

FULL SHOT -- THE STREET
A WAITRESS, wearing an apron labeled EMPIRE EATS, hurries across the street 
towards the GROUP.  We PAN her into MARY.  The procession halts briefly.  She 
embraces MARY.

                    WAITRESS
          Mary!  Honey!

The WAITRESS hurries away.  She dodges past a car.

                    WAITRESS

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL
She follows WAITRESS, then LOVERS in car, with her eyes.

FULL STREET SHOT
The car CENTERS, held up in traffic; two lovers in it, sitting close.

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL
She takes in the LOVERS.

          Women is durn fools!  All of 'em!

She sighs, angry at all women, herself included, and turns away.  We are at 
the door of a GROCERY STORE.  The GROCER is on his doorstep.

          with the consequences.

She starts into store with the GROCER.

RACHEL and GROCER come up to counter.  She takes a list from her bosom and

          One, two, three, four, five... where's the 
          other basket?  Where's Ruby?

          She went.

                    RACHEL
          John, you go fetch Ruby.

JOHN goes.  As GROCER empties baskets and tots up, RACHEL continues:

                    RACHEL
          Big Ruby's my problem girl.  She can't gather 
          eggs without bustin' 'em; but Ruby's got mother 
          hands with a youngin, so what're you to say?

JOHN has entered in BACKGROUND.  PEARL holds the doll to her, and JOHN moves 
in quietly by her side.  They stand together, as so often before.

her seat, and JOHN stands to one side. RACHEL glances at him.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
He looks suspiciously to the Book in her hands, for to him it has come to 
mean only Preacher.

INSERT -- THE BIBLE
... as she opens it on her lap o.s. we hear a screen door open.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL, CHILDREN, JOHN IN BACKGROUND
We see the door closing as JOHN goes out.  The GIRLS sit on low stools in 
semi-circle at RACHEL's feet.  We CENTER RACHEL.  RACHEL, keenly aware of  
JOHN, pretends to ignore him.   JOHN crosses behind her and stands with his 
back to us.  RACHEL, changing her mind about what story to tell, finds the 
new page she's after, and spreads her hands flat on the pages.  She never 
glances at the text.  She is fishing for JOHN.

                    RACHEL
          Now old Pharaoh, he was the King of Egyptland!  
          And he had a daughter, and once upon a time...

RESUME GROUP SHOT
RACHEL closes the Bible; she knows the Lord's battle is won.  As she 
continues, she puts aside the book and takes up her mending.

          It was Moses!  A King of men, Moses, children.  
          Now.  Off to bed.  Hurry.

On "off to bed," JOHN turns his back again.

She mends for a few moments.

                    RACHEL 
               (commandingly)
          John, git me an apple.

JOHN crosses behind her and off, towards door.  We hear it open and close.

                    RACHEL 
          Git one for yourself, too.

MEDIUM SHOT -- JOHN

          Dead.

She nods with finality.  JOHN starts to eat his apple.

          Where ye from?

                    JOHN

                    RACHEL 
          I didn't figger ye rowed that skiff from 
          Parkersburg!

JOHN makes a move; he slowly and tenderly reaches out his hand and lays his 
fingers on her knuckles.

                    JOHN
          Tell me that story again.

Our heroine would like to thank the Lord openly, but she knows she must not 
show her feelings; she speaks gruffly --

                    RACHEL 
          Story, honey?  Why, what story?

                    JOHN
          About them Kings.  That the Queen found down on 
          the sandbar in the skiff that time.

          Kings!  Why, honey, there was only one.

          I mind you said there was two.

                    RACHEL 
          Well, shoot!  Maybe there was!

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL
Maybe we see -- though JOHN does not -- the thanksgiving in her eyes.

                    RACHEL 
          Yes, come to think of it, there was two, John.

approaches in BACKGROUND.

PREACHER enters, between RUBY and LOAFER, and turns to RUBY into CLOSE TWO-

This is a familiar clue to PREACHER.

          Why, you're the purtiest girl I've seen in all

He tethers his horse and, as we PAN and TRACK on behind him, walks to the 
bottom of the steps; RUBY moves into side of SHOT: beyond PREACHER, RACHEL 
stands behind her screen door, hands folded under apron.

                    PREACHER
          Mornin', ladies.

                    PREACHER
          You're Miz Cooper, I take it.

                    RACHEL
               (coming through door)
          It's about that John and that Pearl?

THREE SHOT -- PREACHER, RACHEL, RUBY IN BACKGROUND
PREACHER's face twitches with emotion.  He breaks out into great thankful 
sobs.  He falls to his knees.

                    PREACHER
          My little lambs!  To think I never hoped to see 
          them again in this world!  Oh, dear Madam, if 
          you was to know what a thorny crown I have 
          borne in my search for these strayed chicks.

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL
She takes him in.  He doesn't take her in.

THREE-SHOT -- AS BEFORE

                    RACHEL
          Ruby, go fetch them kids.

RUBY minces off around the side of the house.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER -- RACHEL'S ANGLE
He wipes off tears with the heel of his left hand, watching her.

                    PREACHER
          Ah, dear Madam, I see you're looking at my 
          hands!

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL
She is.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER -- AS BEFORE
He holds up the right hand.

                    PREACHER
          Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-
          Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil? 

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL

                    PREACHER (o.s.)
          It was with this left hand that old Brother 
          Cain struck the blow that laid his brother 
          low--

                    RACHEL
               (wanting to know)
          Them kids is yours?

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER

                    PREACHER
               (recovering from the interruption)
          My flesh and blood!

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL

                    RACHEL
          Where's your Missus?

TWO-SHOT -- PROFILING RACHEL AND PREACHER
PREACHER gets to his feet.

                    PREACHER
          She run off with a drummer one night.  Durin' 
          prayer-meetin'.

                    RACHEL
          Where's she at?

                    PREACHER
          Somewheres down river!  Parkersburg, mebbe!  
          Cincinnati!  One of them Sodoms on the Ohio 
          River.

                    RACHEL
          She took them kids with her?

                    PREACHER
          Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds 
          those innocent little babes has heard in the 
          dens of perdition where she dragged them!

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL

                    RACHEL
          Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the 
          way up river in a ten-foot john-boat!

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
... recovering, and by-passing it.

                    PREACHER
          Are they well?

He turns his head.

FULL SHOT -- RACHEL AND PREACHER, FROM SIDE
All the CHILDREN enter, around corner of house.  As they move in, RACHEL 
replies:

                    RACHEL
          A sight better than they was.

By now, JOHN is on the top step beside RACHEL.  One of his hands holds on to 
her skirt, as if he were pulling her towards him.  His eyes never leave hers.
All the CHILDREN freeze, PEARL is on ground, just beyond JOHN.  Others in 
BACKGROUND; RUBY as near PREACHER as she can get.

                    PREACHER
          Gracious, gracious!  You are a good woman, Miz 
          Cooper!

                    RACHEL
          How you figgerin' to raise them two without a 
          woman?

                    PREACHER
          The Lord will provide.

PEARL with a wail of happiness, drops the DOLL on the step and runs to 
PREACHER, who picks her up.  JOHN instantly picks up the DOLL and holds it to 
him.  He looks up at RACHEL.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND RACHEL
JOHN looks deep into RACHEL's eyes.

                    PREACHER (o.s.)
          The Lord is merciful!  What a day is this!  And 
          there's little John!

                    RACHEL
          What's wrong, John?

                    JOHN
          Nothin'.

He smiles.

                    PREACHER (o.s.)
          Come to me, boy!

                    RACHEL
          What's wrong, John?

TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND PEARL

                    PREACHER
          Didn't you hear me, boy?

TWO-SHOT -- JOHN AND RACHEL
RACHEL bends a little over him.  She wants the situation clarified.

                    RACHEL
          John, when your Dad says 'come', you should 
          mind him.

                    JOHN
          He ain't my Dad.
            
HEAD CLOSE-UP -- RACHEL
She takes this in; JOHN has sold her.  She looks to PREACHER o.s.

                    RACHEL
          He ain't no Preacher, neither.  I've seen 
          Preachers in my time, an' some of 'em was 
          saints on earth.  A few was crookeder'n a dog's 
          hind leg, but this 'un's got 'em all beat for
          badness.

She starts to turn.

GROUP SHOT
She walks purposefully into the house.  PREACHER lunges for JOHN and the 
DOLL.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- PREACHER AND JOHN
JOHN ducks under the porch and PREACHER tries to follow him.  He can't get 
under.  O.s., we hear the slam of the screen door.  PREACHER's head comes up 
to see and we TILT UP, shooting OVER the back of his head.  RACHEL stands 
there full figure, with a pump-gun.

                    RACHEL
          Just march yourself yonder to your horse, 
          Mister.

Back of PREACHER's head is still immobile.

                    RACHEL
          March, Mister!  I'm not foolin'.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER, OVER GUN BARREL
PREACHER gets to his feet.  The open knife is in his hand.  As we see it, the 
gun barrel twitches.  PREACHER backs away towards his horse, bouncing the 
knife lightly in his hand.

                    PREACHER
               (screaming)
          You ain't done with Harry Powell yet!  The Lord 
          God Jehovah will guide my hand in vengeance!  
          You devils!  You Whores of Babylon!  I'll come 
          back when it's dark.

As he mounts his horse we

FULL SHOT -- RACHEL'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
It is dark.  O.s. we hear PREACHER singing "Leaning."

FULL FIGURE SHOT -- RACHEL
She sits in profile, her gun across her knees.  Song continues o.s.

FULL SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, ASLEEP
... in a big bed.  RUBY sits up, listening to song o.s.

FULL FIGURE SHOT -- RACHEL, AS BEFORE
Song continues o.s.  We PAN to PREACHER outside.  We see him through window.  
He sits hunched on a stump.

FULL SHOT -- THE HOUSE, OVER PREACHER
He continues singing.

HEAD PROFILE -- RACHEL
After a moment, we see her mouth open; and either to comfort herself or to 
drown out PREACHER's voice, she joins in the hymn.

FULL SHOT -- THE HOUSE -- AS IN OPENING SHOT
A descending candle moves past a window; RACHEL and PREACHER sing o.s.

FULL SHOT -- PREACHER ON STUMP
... over back of RACHEL's head.  The song ends. RUBY enters SHOT carrying a 
candle.  Its light blacks out the window-glass. RACHEL looks up.

                    RACHEL
          Moonin' around the house over that mad dog of a 
          Preacher!  Shame, Ruby!

She blows out the candle.  We see through the window.  PREACHER has gone.

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL

                    RACHEL
          Merciful Heaven!

She stands up.

CLOSE TWO-SHOT -- RACHEL AND RUBY

                    RACHEL
          Ruby, get the children out of bed.  Bring them 
          all down here to the kitchen.

RUBY leaves the SHOT.  RACHEL moves towards window.  She puts her hand over 
her eyes.

                    RACHEL
          Women is such fools!

The soft hoot of an owl o.s. RACHEL looks up.

CLOSE SHOT -- AN OWL ON A BRANCH LOOKING DOWN

CLOSE SHOT -- A BABY RABBIT

CLOSE SHOT -- THE OWL SPREADS HIS WINGS AND SWOOPS

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL
Still for a second; then, o.s., the scream of a rabbit.

                    RACHEL
          It's a hard world for little things.

OVER this line we have heard the patter of feet down staircase.  She turns.

GROUP SHOT -- THE CHILDREN [IN KITCHEN]
They look at her with complete trust.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL, OVER CHILDREN

                    RACHEL
               (snapping)
          Children, I got lonesome.  I figgered we might 
          play games.

PEARL and MARY jump up and down, patting their palms.  RACHEL extends her 
hands and they gather close to her.

                    PEARL
          Won't you tell us a story?

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL

                    RACHEL
          I might.
               (a swift furious glance 
                into the moonlight)
          I might tell a story.

She sits down, the gun against her knees.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN
... as MARY and PEARL sit at her feet.  RUBY stands beside RACHEL.  JOHN 
stands near RACHEL.

                    CLARY
          I'll light the lamp.

                    RACHEL
          It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.

CLARY sits at RACHEL's feet.

CLOSE PANNING SHOT -- JOHN
He is alert now.  He moves in close beside RACHEL, whom we PAN into

CLOSE TWO-SHOT with him, and presses the whole of his right arm against her 
arm. RACHEL registers quietly.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN

                    RACHEL
          Well... mind what I told you about little Jesus 
          and his Ma and Pa and how there was No Room at 
          the Inn?

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- RACHEL
Her eyes, sharp and glittering, look outside.

FULL SHOT -- THE OUTSIDE
Featuring empty stump, RACHEL's viewpoint.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN
She gets up with gun; we PULL AWAY; in BACKGROUND, CHILDREN turn faces to 
keep watching her.  She comes close to window, gun ready, CHILDREN in 
BACKGROUND.

                    RACHEL
          Well, there was this sneakin', no-'count, 
          ornery King Herod!

She turns round and walks back to her chair; CHILDREN's eyes always on her.

                    RACHEL
          And he heard tell of this little King Jesus 
          growin' up and old Herod figgered: Well, shoot!  
          There sure won't be no room for the both of us!
               (she sits down)
          I'll just nip this in the bud.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN, FROM SIDE

                    RACHEL
               (continuing)
          Well, he never knowed for sure which one of all 
          them babies in the land was King Jesus.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- RACHEL
Her eyes glittering as she turns to look towards us.

RESUME SIDE GROUP SHOT
RACHEL gets up with gun.  Again we PULL AWAY, as faces of all CHILDREN in 
b.g. turn to watch her.

                    RACHEL
          And so that cursed old King Herod figgered if 
          he was to kill all the babies in the land, he'd 
          be sure to get little Jesus.

Without speaking, she goes back to her chair.

FRONT GROUP SHOT

                    RACHEL
          And when little King Jesus' Ma and Pa heard 
          about that plan, what do you reckon they went 
          and done?

                    CLARY
          They hid in a broom closet!

                    MARY
          They hid under the porch!

          Well, now, John, that's just what they done!
          They went a-runnin!

The clock starts striking three.  RACHEL looks to sound o.s.

FULL SHOT -- CLOCK AND HALL MIRROR, BEYOND DARK KITCHEN
In the mirror, a shadow ducks.

FULL GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN
RACHEL gets up, gun at port, and faces into the darkness.

                    PREACHER (o.s.)
          Figured I was gone, huh?

Eyes on the darkness, she bends low to the CHILDREN.

                    RACHEL
               (whispering)
          Run, hide in the staircase!  Run quick!

They scatter out of SHOT; RUBY lingers.

                    RACHEL
               (without turning to her)
          Ruby, git.

RUBY obeys in a trance.  RACHEL, gun at ready, looks into the darkness.

FULL SCREEN -- DARKNESS
Pause.

                    RACHEL
               (o.s., in a high, steady voice)
          What do you want?

                    PREACHER (o.s.)
          Them kids!

                    RACHEL (o.s.)
          What are you after them for?

                    PREACHER (o.s.)
          None of your business, Madam.

                    RACHEL
          I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out 
          that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this 
          kitchen shootin'!

A stepped-on cat screams o.s. and PREACHER's satanic face, and his hand 
lifting the open knife, rise swiftly from the floor.

FULL FIGURE SHOT -- RACHEL -- SAME SHOT AS BEFORE
She fires off her gun.

FULL SHOT -- SCREEN DOOR
PREACHER staggers out and runs yelping with pain into the barn.  O.s. we hear 
the zing-zing of a country phone being cranked.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL, OVER BACKS OF CHILDREN'S HEADS
They huddle on the stairs in reverent silence.  RACHEL, her gun slung 
sportily under one arm, talks into wall phone which hangs just within the box 
stairway.

                    RACHEL
          Miz Booher?  Rachel Cooper.  Git them State 
          Troopers over to my place.  I done treed 
          somep'n up in my barn.

RACHEL sits on the screened porch, awake, gun on knees.  JOHN sits on floor, 
asleep, his head leaning against her.  Barn in BACKGROUND.  Sunrise.

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL AND JOHN
Same position.  JOHN awakes.

                    JOHN
          I'll see to Pearl.

                    RACHEL
          I'll make coffee.

They get up and start into kitchen.

GROUP SHOT -- THE CHILDREN, OVER RACHEL AND JOHN
They lie huddled in calm sleep.  JOHN and RACHEL watch a moment.

                    JOHN
          She's all right.

They start for the stove.

TWO-SHOT -- RACHEL AND JOHN, AROUND STOVE
RACHEL puts her gun beside the stove, ready to hand, and picks up a coffee-
pot; JOHN puts kindling in stove.

                    RACHEL
          John, you know?  When you're little, you have 
          more endurance than God is ever to grant you 
          again?  Children are Man at his strongest.  
          They abide.

JOHN looks at her a moment.  O.s. we hear police car sirens.  They look 
towards the sound.

FULL SHOT -- THROUGH POLICE CAR WINDSHIELD
We SHOOT OVER TWO TROOPERS.  Sirens loud, they rapidly approach RACHEL's 
house as RACHEL, without gun, holding JOHN's hand, comes down to fence.  
Presently, the other CHILDREN hurry out of house behind.  The car brakes.

FULL SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN OVER TWO POLICE CARS -- BARN IN BACKGROUND
The TROOPERS, fanning wide, advance towards the barn.  RACHEL and the 
CHILDREN are grouped a short distance behind them.  The barn door gapes 
black.  Short pause; then PREACHER appears.

                    A TROOPER
               (shouting)
          Is that him, Ma'am?

                    RACHEL
               (shouting)
          Yes!  Mind where you shoot, boys!  There's 
          children here!

                    TROOPER
          Whyn't you call us up before?

                    RACHEL
          Didn't want yer big feet trackin' up my clean 
          floors.

CLOSE SHOT -- PREACHER
He stands, swaying; his left arm is bloody and helpless.  In his right hand 
the open knife hangs apathetic.  His eyes are glazed.  He does not seem to 
care whether they come or not.

                    TROOPER'S VOICE (o.s.)
          Harry Powell, you're under arrest for the 
          murder of Willa Harper!

MEDIUM SHOT -- PREACHER AND TROOPERS -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT
TROOPERS close in on PREACHER, from before and behind, exactly as for BEN's
arrest.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
The same sickly look, as at BEN's arrest.

MEDIUM SHOT -- PREACHER AND TROOPERS -- JOHN'S VIEWPOINT
One TROOPER smacks the back of PREACHER's head with a pistol-barrel.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN

                    JOHN
               (shouting)
          Don't!

Another TROOPER, with pistol-barrel, knocks the knife from PREACHER's lifted 
hand.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN

                    JOHN
               (shouting)
          Don't! 

RESUME VIEWPOINT SHOT
PREACHER sinks to his knees as both men, and two others from the front, close 
in on him.  The tableau is the same as in BEN's arrest.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN

                    JOHN
               (shouting)
          DAD!

JOHN grabs the DOLL from PEARL and starts to run.

                    RACHEL
          John!  John!

She starts after him.

FULL SHOT -- TROOPERS, JOHN, RACHEL, OVER PREACHER
PREACHER prostrate along bottom of screen.  TROOPERS are beating him.  JOHN 
runs up from BACKGROUND followed by RACHEL.  JOHN rushes among the TROOPERS, 
flogging PREACHER over the head with the DOLL.  The TROOPERS, astounded, lay 
off.  RACHEL is stopped in her tracks.

                    JOHN
          Here!  Here!  Take it back!  I can't stand it, 
          Dad!  It's too much, Dad!  I don't want it!  I 
          can't do it!  Here!  Here!

The DOLL has burst open and the money has spilled over PREACHER.  Now two 
TROOPERS gently lift JOHN away.  RACHEL lifts him in her arms; she turns 
towards house.

FULL FIGURE SHOT -- RACHEL AND JOHN -- GROUP IN BACKGROUND
She carries JOHN towards the house.  His head hangs back over her arm.  We 
hear his dry, exhausted sobs.

          Bluebeard!  Bluebeard!

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN
He looks to sound of gavel.  The hubbub and the gaveling stop.

                    LAWYER (o.s.)
          Will you identify the prisoner?

JOHN looks over his shoulder in same direction as the gavel.

                    LAWYER (o.s.)
          Please, little lad.  Won't you look yonder...

His pointing finger enters the SHOT.  JOHN shakes as if he had a cold.

                    LAWYER (o.s.)
          ...and tell the Court if that is the man who 
          killed your mother?

JOHN looks at the finger.  Short pause.

                    LAWYER (o.s.)
          It's all right, Mrs. Cooper.  You can take the 
          little fellow away.

The LAWYER's hands gently help him from chair.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN
... as LAWYER's hands consign JOHN to RACHEL.

                    LAWYER (o.s.)
          Merry Christmas to you and yours, Mrs. Cooper.

The CHILDREN bob and reply, ad lib, "Merry Christmas to you."  RACHEL sniffs.

                    LAWYER (o.s.)
          And what's Santy Claus going to bring you, 
          little man?

Above JOHN's head, by winding and holding to ear, RACHEL pantomimes a watch.

                    LAWYER (o.s.)
          Oh-ho-oo-o!

                    ICEY (o.s.)
          Them is the ones he sinned against, my friends!

Gaveling starts.

                    LOAFER (o.s.)
          Bluebeard!  Bluebeard!

                    CROWD (o.s.)
          Bluebeard!  Bluebeard!

As RACHEL and CHILDREN turn to go, gaveling and hubbub fade and we

INT. A CAFE -- NIGHT
RACHEL and her CHILDREN sit in two booths in a corner, next to a big front 
window.  Christmas parcels on bench at RACHEL's right.

FULL SHOT -- RACHEL AND HER GROUP, THEN CAFE AND WINDOW
Sound o.s. of approaching crowd.  As we PULL BACK we bring in a few other 
customers and the big window.  There are Christmas decorations in the cafe 
and the street outside is hung with them.  Thirty feverish people, some of 
whom carry torches, enter the scene; ICEY stares in the window and screams.

                    ICEY
               (high-pitched)
          Them's hers!

Everyone in the cafe stands up.  RACHEL gathers her parcels.  ICEY rushes to 
door and opens it.

                    ICEY
          Them's her orphans!

She turns to crowd.

                    RACHEL
          Where's Ruby?

                    CLARY
          She went.

ICEY shouts into the cafe.

                    ICEY
          Them poor little lambs!

ICEY turns to the street mob.  RACHEL hurries her CHILDREN to door.  ICEY 
leaves door to yell at mob.

                    ICEY
          Them's the ones he sinned against, my friends!

                    CASHIER
               (across Icey)
          Go out the back way, Miz Cooper.

As RACHEL leaves SHOT, the CASHIER shouts and locks the door.

EXT. BACK ALLEY -- NIGHT -- PANNING SHOT -- RACHEL AND COMPANY 
...emerging from door.  MARY and CLARY come out first and start walking to 
our left.  RACHEL comes out and hurries off to our right, followed by JOHN 
holding PEARL's hand.  We PAN to MARY and CLARY.

                    CLARY
          Ain't we goin' to the Bus Depot?

No answer.  They turn and we PAN with them as they hurry after RACHEL, and we 
bring in RACHEL, charging away from us with her brood hustling to keep up.

GROUP SHOT -- FEATURING WALT AND ICEY
ICEY carries a torch.  She is flanked by rabid faces and smiling LOAFERS, one 
of whom carries an axe.  As she speaks, a MAN rushes up to WALT and gives him 
a rope.

                    ICEY
               (shouting, high-pitched)
          Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil 
          mud of his soul!

                    WALT
               (bellowing)
          Come on!

They all start marching, in step.

PANNING SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN
Marching and voices o.s. and in BACKGROUND.  Carrying Christmas parcels, they 
hurry alongside a building and at CENTER of PAN, cross the end of a street.  
The MOB marches down the street TOWARDS CAMERA; MEN run to join it.

                    ICEY
               (high-pitched)
          He lied!

                    WALT
          Tricked us!

                    ICEY
          He taken the Lord's name in vain and he 
          trampled on his Holy Book!

                    WALT
          String that Bluebeard up to a pole!

                    ICEY
          He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!

                    OTHERS
               (ad lib)
          Lynch him!  String him up!

We PAN RACHEL and CHILDREN past this street and they hurry towards RUBY, who 
stands alone in BACKGROUND, facing the jail.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- RUBY'S ECSTATIC FACE
In BACKGROUND, RACHEL and CHILDREN hurry towards her.  MOB noise o.s.  
Hearing the approach of RACHEL'S GROUP, RUBY turns the back of her head 
towards us.  Now there are no mob voices; only the ominous sound of fifty-odd 
people marching step.

                    RUBY
          I love him!

TRACKING SHOT -- RUBY
Ominous silence.

                    RUBY
          He loves me because I'm so purty!  You think 
          he's like them others!

SIDE TRACKING SHOT -- RUBY, RACHEL AND GROUP
Marching sound o.s.  RACHEL firmly takes RUBY's arm and drags her off in our 
direction.  RACHEL shoos MARY and CLARY ahead of her.  JOHN and PEARL flank 
RACHEL, clinging to her wide skirts.  RUBY, nearest us, keeps looking back 
over her shoulder.  We TRACK them alongside of JAIL to rear of JAIL.

                    RUBY
               (continuing)
          You took on something awful about him buying me 
          that there movie book.  You was so mad, you 
          shot him and the blue men took him.

On "blue men," we stop TRACKING and, as GROUP leaves SHOT, CENTER a POLICE 
CAR, waiting at rear door of JAIL.  POLICEMEN start out of door.

MEDIUM GROUP SHOT -- POLICEMEN AND PREACHER
They roughly hustle PREACHER into the car.  Marching sound o.s.

SHOT -- FROM WITHIN CAR -- BART
PREACHER and POLICE are in b.g.  Through car window we see BART THE HANGMAN 
come out of his door.  He wears his derby.  A POLICEMAN puts head out of 
window.  Marching o.s.

MEDIUM SHOT -- BART THE HANGMAN
On porch, by door, is a doll's perambulator, but this time there is a 
Christmas wreath on the door.  Marching o.s.

                    POLICEMAN (o.s.)
          Hey, Bart!

Auto engine starts up o.s.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- BART

                    BART
          Yeah?

MEDIUM SHOT -- POLICEMAN
Marching o.s.

                    POLICEMAN (o.s.)
          We're savin' this bird up fer you!

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- BART
Marching o.s.

                    BART
          This time it'll be a privilege.

FULL PANNING SHOT -- POLICE CAR, THEN RACHEL AND GROUP
The car jumps fast out of SHOT and we PAN PAST BART and CENTER RACHEL and 
GROUP, walking fast away from us.  Mob voices o.s.

                    A VOICE
               (o.s., over departing car)
          Bust the door down!

CLOSE GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN
Clutching Christmas parcels, they hurry away from us into darkness.  RUBY, 
hanging back, dragged by RACHEL, babbles over her shoulder.

                    RUBY
               (happily)
          They'll git him out.  I'll git my things ready 
          -- my shawl and my Mickey Mouse watch that 
          don't run and the straw hat with the flower, 
          and we'll be married and live happily ever 
          after.

                    VOICES
               (o.s., ad lib, cutting across Ruby)
          Bust down the door!  Set fahr to it!  Where's 
          that axe?!  Climb up on the balcony!  You six 
          git 'round to the back!

                    ICEY
               (o.s., screaming)
          People of Marshall County!

EXT. RACHEL'S HOUSE -- EVENING; SNOWING -- CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL AT MAILBOX
She peers into empty mailbox.

                    RACHEL
          Nothing!

She slams the box shut and, as we TILT and PAN, walks away from us through 
snow towards her lighted house.

                    RACHEL
          I'm glad they didn't send me nothing!  Whenever 
          they do it's never nothing I want but something 
          to show me how fancy and smart they've come up 
          in the world.

She goes into the house.

INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN
It is decorated for Christmas.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN
Rachel enters; the four girls stand in line, packages ready; JOHN stands in 
b.g., in doorway to next room.

                    MARY
          Can we give you your presents now?

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL

                    RACHEL
          Shoot!  You don't mean to say you got me a 
          present?

Their hands hold packages up to her.

                    RACHEL
          Shoot now!

She takes a package.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN 

                    RACHEL (o.s.)
          Why, Ruby!

Embarrassed, JOHN leaves the SHOT.

                    RACHEL (o.s.)
          A POT-HOLDER!

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN -- NEW ANGLE
From a fruit bowl, he selects the biggest apple, shines it on his shirt, 
wraps it in the doily under his bowl, opens a drawer and gets out a clip 
clothes-pin, clips his package, and leaves SHOT.

                    RACHEL
               (o.s., continuing)
          And much neater than last year's, Ruby!

Sound of tearing gift paper o.s.

                    RACHEL (o.s.)
          And Clary!  ANOTHER POT-HOLDER!  Ain't that 
          thoughtful.  I'm always burnin' my hands.

FULL SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN, OVER JOHN
... as he enters with present.  RUBY and CLARY are standing aside; MARY and 
PEARL hold up a third pot-holder.

                    RACHEL
          And did you two make this together?

                    MARY
          You hop us, some.

CLOSE SHOT -- RACHEL, ACCEPTING JOHN'S GIFT
She opens it.

                    RACHEL
               (quietly)
          John, that's the richest gift a body could have.
               (continued, briskly)
          You'll find your presents in the cupboard under 
          the china-closet.

GROUP SHOT -- RACHEL AND CHILDREN

                    RACHEL
          You know where, Ruby.

All turn and run through door except RUBY, whom RACHEL detains.

                    RACHEL
          Ruby:
               (she takes a box from 
                her apron pocket)
          This is yours.

RUBY opens it quickly; it is a cheap costume jewelry flower-spray.  RUBY and 
RACHEL kiss like grown women and RUBY goes to join the others.

FULL SHOT -- RACHEL
She turns to her stove and is framed by Christmas garland in b.g.; banging 
pots about and stirring; praying as she works, which is the best way to pray.
Appropriate noise, o.s., of opening presents.

                    RACHEL
          Lord save little children! (bang) You'd think 
          the world would be ashamed to name such a day 
          as Christmas for one of them... (bang) ... and 
          then go on the same old way. 
               (she starts stirring)
          My soul is humble when I see the way little 
          ones accept their lot. 
               (she pauses in stirring)
          Lord save little children!  The wind blows and 
          the rain is cold.  Yet, they abide...

In BACKGROUND, the GIRLS run upstairs, their new dresses over their arms.  
RACHEL glances over her shoulder.

MEDIUM SHOT -- JOHN -- RACHEL'S VIEWPOINT
JOHN stands in next room, looking at something in his hand.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN -- IN OTHER ROOM
We see he holds a watch.  He looks like any boy, rich or poor, with his first 
watch.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- RACHEL

                    RACHEL
               (whispering, so that 
                he does not hear)
          For every child, rich or poor, there's a time 
          of running through a dark place; and there's no 
          word for a child's fear.  A child sees a shadow 
          on the wall, and sees a Tiger.  And the old 
          ones say, "There's no Tiger; go to sleep."  And 
          when that child sleeps, it's a Tiger's sleep, 
          and a Tiger's night, and a Tiger's breathing
          on the windowpane.  Lord save little children!

JOHN enters boldly behind her and, with a scrape, masterfully swings a chair 
around close to her and straddles it.  RACHEL turns her back to us.  She 
expects him to speak, he doesn't, so she fills in:

                    RACHEL
          That watch sure is a fine, loud ticker!

JOHN gives her a burning, proud smile.

                    RACHEL
          It'll be nice to have someone around the house 
          who can give me the right time of day.

JOHN finds his tongue.

                    JOHN
          This watch is the nicest watch I ever had.    

                    RACHEL
          A fella just can't go around with run-down, 
          busted watches.

She turns back, face to us, and goes on with her stirring.  JOHN goes off 
towards the staircase to join the GIRLS; then turns back.

CLOSE SHOT -- JOHN

                    JOHN
          I ain't afraid no more!  I got a watch that 
          ticks!  I got a watch that shines in the dark!

He turns and hurries to the stairs.

HEAD CLOSE-UP -- RACHEL
Over the sound of his running upstairs:

                    RACHEL
               (telling us)
          They abide and they endure.
