                               JAWS 2


          FADE IN

     1     UNDERWATER - DAY                                   1

          Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface.
          A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the
          distance.  Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the
          shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming
          side by side.  They are wearing minimal rubber, considering
          the cool New England waters:  "Farmer John" wetsuits with
          cut-off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including
          an expensive camera with a flash attachment.

          One motions "Down there," the other signals "OK, I see it,"
          and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts
          of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and
          floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of
          illumination.


     2     SEA BOTTOM - DAY                                   2

          The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "ORCA," formerly
          under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these
          four years.

          Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting
          strands of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage,
          glimmering with stainless steel highlights.  A fitful flash
          of yellow from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel,
          similarly tangled.

          The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear.  They're fascinated
          by the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash
          shots.  The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence
          of a motor drive camera.


     2-A     ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW                                   2-A

          Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground.


     3     SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA                                   3

          Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut,
          moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage.

          An occasional "Flash!" lights up the bottom as Bert continues
          snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark.


     3-A     BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS)               3-A

          Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes
          a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit.  A big hand,
          f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait.

          He obliges.  Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling
          his flippers to maintain vertical stability.  One flash.

          Another.  Then a large, dim movement in the b.g.

          Something's out there, moving towards us.

          Flash.  It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel.

          Flash!  It's on us.  Flash!  Teeth?  Blood?  Flash!  Blackness,

          Death.


     3-B     OCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT                                   3-B

          The camera floats gently down and settles in the sand.  A
          dark red mist eddies by.  A last weak flash.

                                        MATCH DISSOLVE TO


     4     EXT. OCEAN - SUNDOWN                                   4

          Flash!  An expensive cabin cruiser, the "Diver Working" flag
          fluttering limply in the breeze, is riding alone at anchor.

          Flash!  A distant lighthouse beacon winks at us.  The boat
          rocks in the ceaseless swell.

          On the stern, "Elizabeth T. - Newport, R.I."  A long way
          from home....

                                        DISSOLVE TO


     5     EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY                                   5

          A blue-and-white police jeep is bouncing over the sand.  A
          figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent
          mission.  It's Martin Brody, Chief of Police on Amity.

          The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs
          leading to a concrete patio two at a time.  A classical
          trumpet solo is playing in the background.  Brody charges
          through a door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily
          through a hotel interior:  The Holidome, a three-story
          extravaganza of a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony
          is already in progress.  A banner announces:  "Grand Opening
          Ball -- Amity Scholarship Fund Benefit."  Brody crosses under
          a High School band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony;
          the trumpet player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled
          crowd applauds politely.  Brody is taking his place with
          some dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority,
          Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.

                            VAUGHN
                  Thank you, Paul Lohman, for that
                  eloquent solo.  Now, for that point
                  in the ceremonies where we for-
                  mally dedicate this magnificent
                  resort-hotel complex, a worthwhile
                  addition to the recreational
                  paradise we call Amity.


     6     ANGLE ON THE DAIS                                   6

          Seated on folding chairs, wearing their good suits, several
          of Amity's Selectmen, Real Estate Developer Len Peterson,
          and Ellen Brody, very chic.  Brody slips into the vacant
          chair next to her.  The following is conducted in urgent
          whispers, sotto voce, while Vaughn drones on.

                            ELLEN
                  Where the hell were you?

                            BRODY
                  Late.

                            ELLEN
                  I can see that. Don't you know
                  this is a big deal?

                  BRODY                  VAUGHN
          Couldn't help it.               (droning
          Hendricks over                    along)
          there...               Holiday Inn joins the
               (he indicates          Amity Shores development
               his deputy)          condominium complex In a
          ...still has the          welcome expression of
          keys to the jeep          renewed interest in Amity

          and I couldn't               Northeast Recreational
          find the spares.          Vacation Wonderland.
                              We're happy once again
                  ELLEN          to be in the center of
          Terrific.  Act               things, where the action
          as if you've               is.. We've had our share
          been here all               of hard times and long
          along.                    winters and the past few
                              years have not been easy.
                  BRODY          But today, the sun is
          How'm I supposed          rising on a new Amity,
          to do that?               a new island filled with
                              promise.
                  ELLEN               (applause)
          Look bored.               Len Peterson's Amity Shores
                              Development is an exciting addi-
                              tion to our island.  The Holiday
                              Inn we stand in is likewise a new
                              friend who we welcome as family.
                              Amity means 'friendship' and our
                              community extends its friendship
                              to all who seek her shores in
                              peace and harmony.
                                   (applause)

          Brody settles into polite attentiveness, acknowledging a
          wave from Hendricks, a politely bland young town cop in his
          idea of civilian finery.  Hendricks is fussing with the
          banner on an attractive young lady in a bathing suit....


     7     ANGLE ON VAUGHN                                        7

                            VAUGHN
                  ...And now, Tina Wilcox, this
                  year's Miss Amity, will cut the
                  ribbon that officially opens
                  this luxurious new hotel...

          Tina (the girl in the bathing suit) escapes Hendricks'
          attentions, and teeters on high heels towards the ribbon,
          while Phil Fogarty, the local photographer, snaps away.

                            VAUGHN
                  Tina was selected from more than
                  20 of this island's lovely young
                  ladies in the Miss Amity competi-
                  tion held every spring, and she'll
                  represent Amity Island in the
                  Miss Massachusetts Competition
                  in Worcester next month.  When
                  she cuts this ribbon, she will
                  be opening our island to growth,
                  to development, to planned
                  expansion with full employment
                  for our thriving community.


     8     ANGLE ON THE BAND                                   8

          Paul Lohman ("Polo" to his friends) is exchanging whispers
          with Lucy, a flute player.nearby.

                            LUCY
                  I don't think she's such hot
                  stuff.

                            POLO
                  When are we going out?  You and
                  me?

                            LUCY
                  Not tonight.

                            POLO
                  You going with Patrick?

          Lucy nods, Polo shrugs, and turns to Jane, a girl nearby.

                            POLO
                  Listen, Jane -- you want to dance
                  as soon as we get out of these
                  monkey suits?

          She nods happily, they whisper together, while we:

     9     ANGLE ON DAIS                                        9

          Martin and Ellen have been joined by their youngest son,
          Sean.

                            SEAN
                  Mom, Michael won't talk to me.

                            BRODY
                       (to Ellen)
                  Shouldn't he be at home?

                            ELLEN
                  Mrs. Silvera couldn't come.

                            VAUGHN
                  This money tree, you may have no-
                  ticed, is made entirely of twenty-
                  dollar bills, donated by Len
                  Peterson, the builder of Amity
                  Shores Condominiums, as a gesture
                  of goodwill towards the community.
                  $500 as a special gift to the Amity
                  township scholarship fund....

          Applause from the crowd, Len takes a bow.

                            VAUGHN
                       (prompting)
                  Go ahead, Tina.

          as she reaches out with the scissors.  Something catches her
          eye, and she winks at her boyfriend, Ed Marchand, smirking in
          the crowd.  He winks back, and makes "Cut it" motions with
          his fingers.


     11     ANGLE ON THE CEREMONY                                   11

          Tina cuts the ribbon, and Tom Andrews, a local diver, pushes
          a decorated float out into the pool; sparklers sputter, bal-
          loons drop from the ceiling.

                            VAUGHN
                  Thanks to Tom Andrews, of Amity
                  Aqua-Sports, for contributing the
                  special decorations.  And now, the
                  Amity High School band.  Refresh-
                  ments on the patio, everyone....

          The band swings into "Downtown," and the crowd gets up to
          dance, to eat, and to break into small groups to talk.

     11-A     INT. HOLIDOME - LATER                                   11-A

          Ellen is dragging Brody over to where Len Peterson and Larry
          Vaughn, the mayor, are in conversation.  They pass vignettes:
          Tina and Ed, Tom Andrews and Jane, Marge, other interesting
          Amity townspeople.

                            BRODY
                       (seeing Peterson
                       and Vaughn)
                  Do I have to talk to those two?

                            ELLEN
                  My boss and your boss.  Sure.

                            VAUGHN
                  Hello, hello.  It went well, I
                  thought.

                            BRODY
                  Very impressive ceremony.  Good
                  speech.

                            VAUGHN
                  Thank you, thank you.  You know
                  my son, don't you?

          He beckons over their heads to Larry Vaughn, Jr., a young
          man uncomfortable in his correct tie and blazer.  They ex-
          change perfunctory greetings.

                            PETERSON
                  The speech was right on the money.
                       (to Ellen)
                  Be a love and make sure the bar's
                  open, will you?

          He puts his arm around her, a little too familiarly for Brody's
          liking.

                            PETERSON
                       (to Brody)
                  Fantastic lady.  Don't know what
                  I'd do without her.

                            BRODY
                  Me neither.

                            PETERSON
                       (looking around)
                  Y'know, Brody -- for the first time
                  in years it's worth putting money
                  into this town.

                            BRODY
                  All of us thank you, okay?

                            ELLEN
                  Watch Sean for a minute?

          And she hands Sean off to Brody, leaving him with an over-
          active 10 year old, while she's gone.

                            SEAN
                  Can I go swimming?

                            BRODY
                  No.  Find your brother, okay?

          Sean nods and runs off, happy to have a mission.

     12     ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY - NEAR THE BAND                         12

          He is talking to Brooke Peters, a mop-maned teen-ager with a
          pleasant face.

          Timmy Weldon, a grade behind, lurks nearby.  A plumpish,
          curly-haired buddy, Andy Nicholas, is enjoying a cup of punch.

                            MIKE
                  How old is your cousin?

                            BROOKE
                  Seventeen.  She's a senior.

                            MIKE
                  I'm not crazy about blind dates.

                            ANDY
                  They're okay, if they got little
                  white canes and tin cups.

                            BROOKE
                  That's awful.

                            ANDY
                  What the hell.
                       (to Mike)
                  Did your mom put all this together?

                            MIKE
                  Yeah, it's her job.

                            ANDY
                  Is she responsible for the punch?

                            MIKE
                  No.

                            ANDY
                  Good.  It's terrible.

                            BROOKE
                  My cousin will be here tomorrow.

                            MIKE
                  Great.

          Sean finds them, and bursts into their group.

                            SEAN
                  Michael, Michael, Dad said to find
                  you.

                            ANDY
                  Okay, you did that.

                            SEAN
                  Come on, Mikey, come on....

          He tugs at Mike's sleeve; Mike allows himself to be dragged
          off.

                            MIKE
                  Okay, okay.  Got to go.

          Andy and Brooke are left standing together, Tim moves in.

                            TIM
                       (to Brooke)
                  Want to dance?
                       (she shakes her
                       head "no")
                  Okay.  Later?

          On her shrug, as she turns to Andy:

                                        CUT TO


     13     INT./EXT. HOLIDOME PATIO/TERRACE - NIGHT                    13

          It's later; night has fallen, the band is playing its version
          of "When I Fall in Love."  Many teen-agers are dancing out on
          the patio, some adults are dancing inside, the buffet is rav-
          aged, Timmy is watching Brooke, who's dancing with Polo.

          Douglas Fetterman ("Doug") joins him, after asking Marge for
          a dance and striking out.

                            DOUG
                  Get a dance yet?

                            TIMMY
                  Nope.

                            DOUG
                  Me neither.

                            TIMMY
                  Who'd you ask?

                            DOUG
                  Tina Wilcox.

                            TIMMY
                  You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl
                  friend.

                            DOUG
                  Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes
                  the most beautiful girls are the
                  loneliest.

                            TIMMY
                  That's a crock of shit.

                            DOUG
                  I know.

          Bob Burnside, a tall pal of Larry Vaughn Jr.'s, turns up
          by their side.

                            BOB
                  Same tired old faces.  You see
                  Vaughn?

                            DOUG
                  The mayor?

                            BOB
                  Larry Vaughn Junior?
                       (Doug shrugs)
                  If you see him, tell him I got a
                  six-pack, a blanket, and the Brebner
                  twins.

          He exits, on the prowl.

                            TIMMY
                  No class.

                            DOUG
                  None at all.
                       (pause)
                  I wonder what the Brebner twins
                  are doing tomorrow night.


     14     ANGLE ON BRODY AND ELLEN                              14

                            BRODY
                  Can you take a little time out from
                  your busy schedule to dance with the
                  old man?

                            ELLEN
                  Why?

                            BRODY
                  Because they're playing our song.

          And sure enough, they are -- the band has turned to a Fifties
          slow-dance standard:  "I Wish You Love."  Peterson approaches.

                            PETERSON
                  May I have this dance?

                            BRODY
                  Sorry, I'm all booked up...
                       (taking Ellen)
                  Come, m'dear.

          They slowly fox trot out onto the terrace.  Both of them
          nodding greetings to townspeople and kids -- everyone knows
          the chief.

                            BRODY
                  Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?

                            ELLEN
                  And how.  I thought you wouldn't
                  respect me.

                            BRODY
                  I did, I did.

          The music and the summer moon are working their magic.

                            BRODY
                  Listen -- what are you doing
                  later?

                            ELLEN
                  Fooling around?

                            BRODY
                  Right.

          He dips with her; they look up and notice Sean, sound asleep
          on a bench.

                            ELLEN
                  Let's get the kid home.

                            BRODY
                  Home it is.

          He crosses to the sleepy Sean and hoists him with a grunt.

                            BRODY
                       (to the kid)
                  You're getting a little big for
                  this.

          Sean murmurs sleepily and hugs his dad.  Mike, dancing with
          Marge, waves good-bye.  The Brodys start to leave, passing
          a bucket with a bottle of champagne still in it.  They ex-
          change a look, nod agreement, and Brody boosts the bottle,
          sneaking it out of the building while Ellen giggles.

                                        DISSOLVE TO


     15     INT. BRODY BEDROOM - DAY                              15

          Brody and Ellen are snuggling under the covers while early-
          morning light streams under the blinds.  It's The Morning
          After, and the clothes from the night before are scattered
          all over the room.  Brody rolls against Ellen, spoon-fashion,
          morning-horny.

                            BRODY
                  Mmmm.

                            ELLEN
                  MMMmmmorning....

          They start to move a little, then turn face to face.  Outside
          their door, the sounds of little feet; Sean padding downstairs.

                            BRODY
                  Sean's awake.

                            ELLEN
                  Door's locked.

                            BRODY
                       (kissing)
                  Good.

          Their bodies move under the blankets.  There's a crash
          from the kitchen.  They stop for a beat.  As they resume,
          little feet return.

                            SEAN'S VOICE
                  The milk fell out of the
                  'frigerator.

                            ELLEN
                       (whispering)
                  Put a towel down.  And shh --
                  Daddy's sleeping.

                            SEAN'S VOICE
                  Okay.

          His feet paddle off.  Brody and Ellen start to slide
          together, passion resumes.


                            ELLEN
                  C'mere....

          Bigger feet go downstairs; Michael's up.  The Brodys kiss,
          trying to ignore the sounds of spirited discussion between
          brothers over who's responsible for spilled milk.  Then
          the sound of a car pulling into the driveway, and a horn
          beep.

                            BRODY
                  Mrs. Silvera?

                            ELLEN
                  Mrs. Silvera.

          They try to kiss again, there's a door slam downstairs,
          and talk between the boys and Mrs. Silvera.  The Brodys
          look at each other and break up laughing at the morning,
          and themselves.


     16     ANGLE ON THE BED                                   16

          As Ellen and Brody, with the practice of 18 years of
          marriage, swing back-to-back, and put their feet on the
          floor, each on their side of the bed, still chuckling,
          up for the day.

                            BRODY
                  Need a ride?

                            ELLEN
                  As far as the office.

                                        CUT TO


     17     EXT. AMITY STREET   DAY                                   17

          The police jeep is driving through the picturesque streets,
          Brody behind the wheel, Ellen and Sean passengers.  It slows
          near the foot of the street, dockside, where a real estate
          office marked "Amity Shores Development, Leonard Peterson,
          Pres." sits.  Peterson's big Cadillac is parked illegally at
          the curb.  It has the Amity Shores logo on its side.

                            BRODY
                  Some people.

                            SEAN
                  What's daddy doing?

                            ELLEN
                  Writing a ticket.

          Brody is out of the car, his pad in his hand.

                            ELLEN
                  Hey!  That's my boss!

                            BRODY
                  Better yet.

          Peterson, in shirt-sleeves and a tie, hustles out of the office

                            PETERSON
                  Wait a minute....

                            BRODY
                  Too late, it's written.

                            PETERSON
                  Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.
                       (to Ellen)
                  Don't you have any pull with the
                  chief, here?

                            ELLEN
                  Do I have to?

                            PETERSON
                       (taking the ticket)
                  Better get a sales kit together for
                  after lunch.  I'm taking some prospects
                  out.

          Ellen kisses Brody, and starts in for her day's work.

                            ELLEN
                  See you later.

                            PETERSON
                       (to Brody)
                  Can't we fix it up to get this
                  made into a green zone or something?

                            BRODY
                  Len, pay the two dollars.


          Peterson shrugs and goes inside his office.  Brody's
          attention is drawn by some noise by the dock.


     18     EXT. DOCKSIDE, AMITY - DAY                              18

          Hendricks and an old codger, Red, are working on Amity's
          newest bit of police equipment; a blue power launch for
          patrolling local waters.  The boat is Hendricks' personal
          pride and joy.

                            HENDRICKS
                       (to Red)
                  Tie it off on your left.  Your
                  other left!

          As Red complies, Hendricks spots his boss.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Good morning!

                            BRODY
                       (walking onto the
                       dock, Sean tagging
                       along)
                  Aren't you off-duty?

                            HENDRICKS
                  Till noon.  This is on my own
                  time.
                       (to Sean)
                  Hi, Shorty.

                            SEAN
                  I'm not short.  I'm eleven.

          There's a hoot from a passing boat horn.  Sean waves happily.


     19     ANGLE ON THE BOAT                                   19

          It has slowed to a halt in front of the police berth; it's
          a scruffy working fisherman, back from the banks with a
          full load.  The Skipper hails Brody.

                            SKIPPER
                  Yo!  Chief!

                            BRODY
                  What?

                            SKIPPER
                  You got a gold-plater drifting in
                  the main channel.  Big cruiser.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Whereabouts?

                            SKIPPER
                  Off the Point.  No running lights,
                  just a diver's flag.

                            HENDRICKS
                       (aside to Brody)
                  Want me to run out there?

                            BRODY
                  On your own time?

                            HENDRICKS
                  Happy to do it.

                            BRODY
                  Then check it out.  I'll be in
                  the office.

          Hendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Cast off your bow line.  And your
                  stern line.  Spring line....

          While Red grumbles  Brody and Sean are walking up to the street.
          Michael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock.


     20     ANGLE ON BRODY AND THE KIDS                              20

          It's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina.

                            BRODY
                  Where to?

                            MIKE
                  No place special.  Just hanging
                  out.

                            BRODY
                  Sailing?

          Mike nods.

                            BRODY
                  Watch your kid brother, huh?

          He gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers.

                            BROOKE
                  Bye, Mr. Brody.

          The others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody
          drives off in his jeep.


     21     EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY                                   21

          The Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers
          around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother.

                  POLO          (Simultaneously)        SEAN
          Anyone want to sail               Can I go too?
          to the Lighthouse?

                  PATRICK                       MIKE
          Machs nix to me.               No.

                  LUCY                            SEAN
          Anyone got a spare               Please?
          mooring line? Mine's
          shot.

                  TINA                            MIKE
          I've got one....               I said, 'No.'

          Tina's in her boat, "Tina's Joy," a neat sloop.  Mike is
          going over his "Green Machine," a sleek catamaran.

                            BROOKE
                  You're not going out right away,
                  are you?

                            MIKE
                  Waiting for Andy.

                            BROOKE
                  I want you to meet my cousin.

                            MIKE
                  I will, I will.

                            SEAN
                  I want to go out with you.
                  You need a crew, don't you?

          Before Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew:  Andy
          Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing
          suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning
          diving class.  Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with
          him, with their gear.  They ad-lib "good-byes."

                            MIKE
                  I don't need you.  Andy's here.

                            SEAN
                  You always go with Andy.

                            MIKE
                       (to Andy)
                  How was dive class?

                            ANDY
                  Same as always -- glub-glub,
                  bubble-bubble, stroke-stroke.
                  There sure is some weird shit on
                  the bottom of the ocean.

                            BROOKE
                  Shells and lobsters and stuff?

                            ANDY
                  Mostly old garbage.  Today we found
                  a '48 Hudson.

                            SEAN
                  Do I have to play with the little
                  kids?

                            MIKE
                  Yeah.  Go on, beat it.

          Sean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready
          for sea.


     21-A     FOLLOW SEAN OFF THE DOCK                              21-A

          Up on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and
          a provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions.
          He points down at the dock.  The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves
          at her cousin, Brooke.

                            JACKIE
                  Brooke!  Hey!

          One of the boats has a portable radio going.  It's playing
          some medium-hot salsa.  Jackie does a couple of dance steps
          on her way down the dock.


     21-B     CLOSE ON ANDY AND MIKE                                   21-B

                            ANDY
                  Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.

                            MIKE
                  I hope that's the cousin.

                            BROOKE
                  Over here.  I want you to meet
                  somebody.

                            ANDY
                  Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.

          As the four teen-agers come together in a tight quartet, the
          music rocks up and we:

                                        CUT TO


     22     EXT. HARBOR - DAY                                   22

          Later in the day, sailboats with bright colored sails and
          ornately painted hulls tack back and forth.  Lots of chatter
          between boats, horseplay, splashing, and general good times.
          It's cruising, on water.


     23     EXT. HARBOR, ABOARD MIKE'S BOAT - DAY                         23

          with Mike, Andy, Jackie and Brooke.

                            JACKIE
                  How fast does this go?

                            ANDY
                  With the right wind, 15-20 knots.

                            JACKIE
                  What?

                            MIKE
                  Real fast.

          He sheets in, heeling the boat over in the stiff breeze.

                            BROOKE
                  Far out!

          Jackie screams in excitement; for a city girl, this is more
          fun than a roller coaster.


     24     ANGLE ON A RED CATAMARAN, "SIZZLER"                         24

          overtaking Mike's boat.  It's piloted by Larry Vaughn, Jr.,
          the Mayor's Son; with him is his good friend, Bob Burnside.

                            LARRY
                  Coming up!

                            BOB
                  Gangway, Turkies!

          It's immediately a race between the red boat -- "Sizzler,"
          and Mike's "Green Machine."  The Kids ad-lib -- "Faster,"
          "Lookout," "Gybe, gybe."

                            ANDY
                  We're carrying weight.

                            LARRY
                  We'll take your supercargo.

                            JACKIE
                  Is that me?

                            BROOKE
                  That's you.

                            JACKIE
                  I've never been supercargo.

          Donny and Denise's boat cuts in, stealing the Sizzler's air.

                            LARRY
                  Hey, get out of our air!

                            DONNY
                  Want a passenger?


     24-A     ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER AND FELIX                              24-A

          Denise hops nimbly from one boat to the other as Danny sails
          tight as a tick to the red cat.

                            BOB
                  Way to go!


     25     QUICK CUTS:  FUN AT SEA                                   25

          The sailboats cutting up, cruising the harbor, the local
          teen-agers partying with each other:

          --  Patrick and Lucy's Sol Cat, flying its hull.

          --  Susie's Laser heeled 'way over' in a stiff breeze.

          --  Polo and a pretty girl in his sloop, "Sea Witch."

          --  Timmy Weldon and Doug Fetterman playing catch-up
              in their respective boats, the Doughdish and the
              inflatable.

          --  Marge in her Lightening, sailing close to Ed and
              Tina in Tina's Joy.

     26     UNDERWATER NEAR THE ORCA - DAY                              26

          Silent, green-blue depths.  A diver, Crosby, working the bottom.,
          running a search pattern.  Another diver, Tom Andrews, running
          close.  They signal to each other, and make another pass.

          Follow Tom Andrews as he skims the bottom, near the wreck of
          the Orca, half-buried in the silt.  A diver's line runs up and
          out of the frame, to:


     27     EXT. OCEAN - DAY                                   27

          Bobbing on the surface are three boats:  the Amity Police
          launch, the deserted Elizabeth T., from Newport, flying
          a diver's flag, and the ScubaVue, a local diveboat operated
          by Tom Andrews and his partner, Crosby; it has "Amity Aqua
          Sports" lettered on it somewhere.  Hendricks and Red are on
          the deck of the police boat, peering at the cruiser.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Rich or poor, it's nice to have
                  money.

                            RED
                  Figure they split?

                            HENDRICKS
                  Happens every season -- someone
                  takes off.  Once we had a schooner
                  for a month while the owners went
                  fox hunting.

          A sudden eruption in the water nearby startles them -- it's
          Andrews, surfacing, holding up the underwater flash camera.

                            ANDREWS
                  This is all there is.

          Crosby pops up next to him, shows empty hands.

                            HENDRICKS
                  If that's it, that's it.

          The divers head for their boat, Hendricks fires up his
          engine, and we:

     28     INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY                              28

          Brody is trying to reason with an indignant fat man.

                            INDIGNANT MAN

                  I can't watch the news, I can't
                  watch a ball game, I can't watch
                  movies -- all I hear is that
                  rotten kid with his rotten radio
                  ... "Breaker, Breaker...."

                            BRODY
                  I'll do what I can, but you're talk-
                  ing about a federal jurisdiction....

                            INDIGNANT MAN
                       (leaving in
                       a huff)
                  So call the FBI!

                            POLLY
                  Black, two sugars.

                            BRODY
                  Thanks.  What else is out there?

                            POLLY
                  One petty theft, one domestic dis-
                  turbance, and an exhibitionist.

                            BRODY
                  I'll take the exhibitionist, you
                  handle the others.

                            WOMAN
                  Chief Brody?  I want you to do
                  something about my first husband.

          Brody is caught in the open.

                            WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                  Martin, you have got to demand that
                  Grace Kinney keep her shades down.

                            2ND MAN
                  What about enforcing the "No Park-
                  ing" ordinance on Beach Road?

                            BRODY
                  In a minute, in a minute -- talk
                  to Mrs. Prendergast, please....

                  WOMAN                  2ND MAN
               (continuing)               (eager to
          Albert keeps coming               be heard)
          around when I'm with          Every time there's an
          gentlemen friends and          out-of-state car in my
          he throws mud on their          driveway, I lose another
          cars....               mailbox.  Those little
                              iron sailboats cost thirty-
                              two dollars each!

                            BRODY
                       (to White
                       Haired Man)
                  Talk to me about Mrs. Kinney.

                            WHITE-HAIRED MAN
                  Her bedroom window faces my oldest
                  boy's bedroom, and she's teasing
                  him, dancing around in a towel,
                  or less....

                            BRODY
                  Dancing?

          Hendricks has entered, carrying the camera brought up from
          the bottom by the divers.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Chief....

                            BRODY
                  Hendricks.  I want to go over
                  your reports and your Form 908.

          They go into Brody's inner office; the uproar continues be-
          hind the door, but it's calm in here.

                            HENDRICKS
                  I never heard of a 908.

                            BRODY
                  I just made it up.  It means, "Get
                  me out of there."
                       (notices the
                       camera)
                  What the hell's that?

                            HENDRICKS
                  Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews
                  brought it up from under that
                  abandoned cruiser.

                            BRODY
                  Abandoned?  It's a little early in
                  the season for that.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Rich people.  Home port is Newport,
                  Rhode Island.

                            BRODY
                  If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as
                  hell wouldn't leave it anchored
                  alone in the channel.

                            HENDRICKS
                  If you had a $100,000 boat there'd

          Hendricks puts the camera in an informal "Lost & Found" box
          sitting in the office.  Brody makes the mistake of opening
          the door, revealing the White-Haired Man.

          Looking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette
          against the daylight.  There's a commotion, and a water ski
          drops into view.  Then another one.  Pale legs churn the water.

     34     EXT. OCEAN - DAY                                   34

          Off Amity Beach, a bilious green lap-straked boat is bobbing
          in the water, the engine idling.  Two girls are fooling around;
          the one in the water is Terry, the one driving the boat is
          Diane.

                            TERRY
                  Did you ever see a dolphin?

                            DIANE
                  Sure.  They like to play.  We may
                  see some today.

                            TERRY
                  Great!

          She fumbles with her skis.

                            TERRY
                  Whoops, almost lost one.  Can't
                  play with the dolphins without skis....

                            DIANE
                  Ready?

                            TERRY
                  Hang on, hang on...Okay, go.

          Diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear,
          starting forward.  Terry waves "okay," Diane opens up the
          throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling Terry upright.
          A wake boils out from under her skis.


     35     ANGLE ON THE BEACH                                   35

          Ed and Tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter of
          the dunes.  There's a portable radio, a cooler with some beer,
          and some sandwiches -- a perfect afternoon alone.  Above the
          dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski boat
          can be seen, raising a big wake.  Tina disengages, and sits
          up, brushing sand out of her hair.

                            TINA
                  Take a break for a minute, okay?

                            ED
                  Huh?

          Tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is
          towing Terry on the water.

                            TINA
                  Eddie, can we do that?
                       (no reaction)
                  Can we go skiing?  We can use my
                  Uncle's boat.  Eddie?

                            ED
                  Next week.

                           TINA
                  With you, everything's next week.
                  I want to go skiing soon.  Tomorrow?

          Ed grunts non-comittally.  Tina takes a beer from the cooler,
          and goes up on the dune to watch Terry and Diane.  She waves
          to them, and to someone down the beach.


     36     EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY                                   36

          An old lady, Grace Witherspoon, is rocking on her porch, also
          enjoying the view of young people enjoying themselves. She
          acknowledges Tina's distant wave, and turns her attention
          back to the skiers.

          having a wonderful time.  Terry is good, criss-crossing the
          wake, showing off.


     38     CLOSE ON TERRY                                        38

          rushing through the water, waving, stunting.

                            TERRY
                  Faster!  Faster!

          She waves at Diane, who leans over the controls, to coax
          more speed out of the old engine.


     39     UNDERWATER                                        39

          following the skis effortlessly, closing in on the
          turbulent wake.


     39-A     ON THE SURFACE                                        39-A

          Terry whipping along; a fin raises near her.  She glances
          at it, waves, thinking it's a porpoise.

                            TERRY
                  Porpoise!  Look!  A dolphin!

          The fin slides low in the water, heading towards her.  She
          puts the rope around her waist, leaving both hands free.


     39-B     UNDERWATER                                        39-B

          closing in on the wake, crossing it.


     39-C     TERRY - ON THE SURFACE                                   39-C

          The fin cuts across her path.  Too late to maneuver, Terry
          hits the looming gray back of the Shark.  The skis bump,
          leave the water, Terry takes a spectacular spill.  The rope
          around her waist tows her helpless through the water, gagging
          her, preventing her from shouting.  She flounders as Diane
          slows the boat to see what's happened.


     39-D     ANGLE ON THE BOAT                                   39-D

          turning back to see if her friend hit a submerged log or
          hurt herself.

                  Terry!  You okay?

                            DIANE
                  Okay, okay, coming....

          She still doesn't realize the gravity of the situation --
          she hasn't seen the fin.


     39-E     ANGLE ON TERRY                                        39-E

          hysterical, pulling herself hand-over-hand up the rope,
          trying to get to the boat.


     39-F     UNDERWATER                                        39-F

          screaming, as the Shark rises from the deep and takes her.
          Suddenly she's gone, a swirl of pink froth marking the
          water where she went under.


     40     IN THE BOAT - DIANE                                   40

          Looking around for her friend, suddenly panicky.  She pulls
          the rope hard, and tumbles backward as it comes up with
          nothing on it -- just a cleanly bitten end.

                            DIANE
                       (screaming)
                  Terry!

          Then the Shark appears, blood on its mouth, lunging up and
          butting the stern, jarring the engine loose.  Fuel spills
          from a ruptured line.

                            DIANE
                  Help!  God, help!

          She throws things at the Shark, which slides back under
          the water.


     40-A     DISTANT ANGLE ON THE BOAT - FROM THE BEACH                    40-A

          Diane can be seen flailing in the boat, very distant screams
          floating across the water; at this range they sound like
          the normal shrieks of teen-age girls having fun....


     40-B     ANGLE ON THE BOAT - CLOSE                              40-B

          as the Shark hits from a fresh angle, this time taking a
          chunk out of the boat, biting down with powerful jaws.  Diane
          hurls seat-cushions, oars, anything she can lay hands on.
          She fumbles desperately in a compartment, produces a flare-
          pistol.  She cocks it and fires point-blank at the shark.


     40-C     CLOSE ON THE SHARK                                   40-C

          The flare hits, wet fuel glistening on the water and skin
          of the Shark explodes in a sheet of flame.


     40-D     DIANE                                             40-D

          A last flash before the gasoline explodes.

                            DIANE
                       No-o-o-o-o-o...!

          A sheet of fire, she's in the middle, screaming, aflame,
          the Shark forgotten.  She falls into the water as the
          ruined boat overturns and there's an oily explosion.


     41     EXT. BEACH - DAY - ED AND TINA                              41

          Ed and Tina look up as they hear the distant "crump" of
          the boat blowing up.

          Mrs. Witherspoon looks up, startled by the sudden tragedy.
          She gets up to go to the phone, indoors, and we:

          The launch is anchored at the site of the explosion, offshore.
          Red is fishing up bits of flotsam with a boathook.  Hendricks
          is on the radio, talking to the shore.

                            HENDRICKS
                  I can't find anyone out here.
                  They must've gone to the bottom,
                  or drifted with the current.


     44     BRODY ON SHORE                                        44

          He's on the porch of tile Witherspoon house, using his portable
          walkie-talkie.  Mrs. Witherspoon is waiting in the b.g.
          Nearby, we can see a sign:  "BURIED CABLE:  Call New England
          Light and Power Before Digging."  The cable itself surfaces
          in a chain-link fenced enclosure, and climbs a power pole for
          distribution to the island.  Ed and Tina are also there,
          having given statements.

                            BRODY
                  There should be bodies.  Witnesses
                  say two people; one in the boat,
                  one skiing.

                            HENDRICKS (o.s.)

                  Try dragging.

                            HENDRICKS (o.s.)
                  For how long?  Current's moving
                  everything around, and it's getting
                  dark.

                            BRODY
                  Stay on it.  I don't care how

          Brody turns to Ed and Tina, and takes out his notebook.

                  We heard this noise, like a 'boomp'
                  out there, and when we looked,
                  there was just this cloud of
                  smoke.

                            GRACE
                  That was the explosion.  One minute
                  they were having a wonderful time,

                            GRACE
                  I don't know what could've done
                  that.

          Brody stares out at the quiet sea -- what's lurking under
          that calm surface?

                            TINA
                  Can we go now?

          Brody's still looking past them, towards the ocean.

                            TINA
                  Chief Brody -- can we go?  Please?

          Hendricks has the winch in operation, the cable in his hand,
          with big grappling hooks attached.  The boat is lit by its
          powerful worklights.  Hendricks heaves them out, watches as
          the current takes them, then puts the winch in gear,
          hauling back.

                  I don't care about the overtime,

     46     INSERT - THE WINCH CABLE                              46

          It goes taut with a sudden strain.

                            HENDRICKS
                  I think we got something.

          Red moves to the winch, watching warily as it slows to a
          near stall with the weight.

                  What the hell is it?

          There's a strain on the cable -- it's pulling the stern of
          the boat down as it struggles with the weight.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Here it comes....

          lit by the harsh worklights on the deck of the launch.  The
          cable from the winch is taut, pulling something up from the
          black depths.  What?  The coupling appears, then the hook,
          and an oily cable.

          it spins out and settles back on the bottom.  Red jiggles

          The next morning, the Brody family is downstairs, each
          getting his own special breakfast.  Mike gets cereal for
          himself and Sean, Ellen is cracking some soft-boiled eggs,
          Brody is drinking coffee and smoking.

                            ELLEN
                  You have to smoke so early
                  in the morning?

                            BRODY
                  It's good with coffee.

                            ELLEN
                  So's a donut.

                            SEAN
                  I want Fruit Loops!

                            MIKE
                  Eat Cheerios.

                            SEAN
                  You eat Cheerios.  I want Fruit
                  Loops.

                            ELLEN
                  Eat Cheerios.

                  What're you guys doing today?

                       (indicates Sean)
                  I don't know about him -- I'm
                  going down to the dock, maybe go
                  sailing.

                            BRODY
                  Every day?

                  What else is there to do?

                            BRODY
                  You could work out at the beach,
                  make a few bucks for school.

                            MIKE
                  Do I have to?

                            BRODY
                  You'll have to make up your own
                  mind about that.

                            ELLEN
                  Where's my day book?

                            BRODY
                  In the den.

          Ellen passes them on the way to the den to look for it.

                  He doesn't have to work all the
                  time, it's his vacation.

          Mrs. Silvera enters from the service porch.

                            MRS. SILVERA
                  Good morning -- everyone up early
                  today?

                            BRODY
                  There's a lot going on.

          He follows Ellen into the den.

          Ellen is rummaging around the papers on the end table, looking
          for her book.

                            ELLEN
                  Why don't you take a half day and
                  clean this junk up?

                            BRODY
                  Because, I'm in the middle of a
                  boating accident, I got only
                  four regular cops and one secretary,
                  and a Chief Deputy who is constantly
                  fiddling with the police boat   He's
                  another one.

                            ELLEN
                  One what?
                       (she finds
                       the book)
                  Ah-ha!

                            BRODY
                  Boat nut.  What is it about this
                  place that makes everyone a freak
                  for boating?

                            ELLEN
                  It's an island.
                       (she pecks him
                       on the cheek)

                  What about tennis?  Riding?
                  fixing up old cars?  Bartending?

                            BRODY
                  Okay, not bartending.  Why on
                  the water every day?

                            MIKE
                  Because.

                            BRODY
                  Look, humor the old man --
                  just be careful.

          Mike passes through on his way out, nodding to Mrs. Silvera
          who acknowledges his passage.  Brody is close on his heels.

                            BRODY
                  Don't go out if it's rough or any-
                  thing, huh?  We've had a lot of
                  trouble.

                            MIKE
                  Okay, okay.

          The back door slams behind him.

                            SEAN
                  Can I go with you today?

                            BRODY
                  You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie.
                  Okay?

          Sean nods, resigning himself to the inevitable.

                            MRS. SILVERA
                       (to Sean)
                  You can come with me to the market.

                            SEAN
                  All right.

                            BRODY
                  I'll be at the office.

          Mrs. Silvera nods, and pours Sean a glass of milk.  Brody
          sighs, and heads out the door.  Sean calls after him.

                            SEAN
                  Bye, Daddy.  I'm going to be careful,

          Sitting snug and ship-shape on Mike's Green Machine are Mike,
          Andy, Brooke, and Jackie.  They are heeled over in a brisk wind,
          making good headway; sailing nearby in the b.g. are Patrick and
          Lucy and Donny and Denise, in their boats.

                  We got some stuff at the store.  Ed
                  and Tina are going to be there.

                  It's an island, near here, with a
                  lighthouse.  We sometimes hang out
                  there, you know....

                  Great.  I got some wine.

                  Well, maybe I will, then.

          Andy does about a triple take before he regains his cool.

          The crowd edges back, giving way to Brody and Elkins.

                            BRODY
                  See?  What'd I tell you?


     71     ANGLE ON THE WHALE                                   71

          Brody is holding a handkerchief to his nose as he approaches
          the dead thing, indicating a huge open wound on the side.

                            BRODY
                  Look at that:

                            ELKINS
                  First things first.

          She produces a tape measure and gives one end to Brody.

                            ELKINS

                  From the tip of the snout, please.

          Elkins is measuring the length of the creature.  She calls
          off numbers to Hendricks, who is officiously writing it all
          down, repeating numbers as he hears them.

                            ELKINS
                  Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.

                            BRODY
                  Come on, let's check the bite
                  radius.

                            ELKINS
                       (cold)
                  The what?

                            BRODY
                  Bite radius.  You know, the size of
                  the mouth?

                            ELKINS
                  The whale's mouth?

                            BRODY
                  The Shark's mouth.

                            ELKINS
                  What shark?

          Brody pitches his voice low, so that the crowd won't listen.

                            BRODY
                  The shark that did this.  It was a
                  shark, wasn't it?

                            ELKINS
                  We don't know that, do we?

                            BRODY
                  But that's what we're here to find
                  out, right?

                            ELKINS
                  You don't tell me my job, and I
                  won't tell you about yours, okay?

                            HENDRICKS
                  I can't hear you if you're going
                  to whisper.

                            MIKE
                  Can we go now?

          He turns to join the kids as they slip through the crowd to
          return to their blanket, ad-libbing good-byes.

                            BRODY
                       (to Mike)
                  You stay here a minute.

                            MIKE
                  Oh, c'mon.

                            BRODY
                  You heard me.

                            JACKIE
                  We'll be over by the lighthouse.

                            MIKE
                  I'll be right there.  Wait up.

          They hang around, waiting for him.  Elkins has reclaimed
          Brody's attention.

                            ELKINS
                  Could be a shark.  But maybe not.

                            BRODY
                  Look, I know a little bit about
                  sharks.

                            ELKINS
                  Do you?

                            BRODY
                  I know that this was probably a
                  Great White Shark.  Car-cadon...
                  Caradan....

          He fumbles for the correct Latin.

                            ELKINS
                       (helping out)
                  Carcharadon Carcharias.

                            BRODY
                  That's it.

                            ELKINS
                  Okay, so that's it.

                            BRODY
                  Is there one in these waters?

                            ELKINS
                  What makes you think there might
                  be?

                            BRODY
                  Because this big fish has been
                  bitten by some other big fish....

                            ELKINS
                  This is a mammal, not a fish.

                            BRODY
                  Jesus, don't quibble with me.  I
                  want to know if a Great White
                  Shark did this.

                            ELKINS
                  Probably.

                            BRODY
                  That's it?  Probably?  Look,
                  sharks are attracted by blood,
                  and thrashing around....

                            ELKINS
                  And sound.

                            BRODY
                       (this is a new one)
                  Sound?

                            ELKINS
                  Sound.  Like sonar, or radar.
                  They home in on irregular sounds,
                  unusual sounds, any rhythmic low-
                  frequency vibration.

                            BRODY
                  So there's one around here.

                            ELKINS
                  Not necessarily.  These wounds
                  could've been inflicted 30 miles
                  out to sea, or more.  None of them
                  are immediately fatal.  Currents
                  could've carried the body 10 miles
                  further.

                            HENDRICKS
                       (chiming in)
                  We got a helluva tide this month.

                            BRODY
                  Could you just keep that crowd
                  back, please?

                            MIKE
                       (fidgeting)
                  Pop....

                            BRODY
                  You stay right here.  You're going
                  in with me.


     72     ANGLE ON BRODY AND MIKE                                   72

          As Elkins examines the whale, calling her observations to
          Hendricks.

                  MIKE          (simultaneous)          ELKINS
          We came out in my boat.          Lower jaw displaced and lacer-
                              ated by predator attempt to
                  BRODY          seize the tongue.  Additional
          Andy can sail it in.          large tissue loss in the dorsal
                              and sub-dorsal areas, as well
                  MIKE               as the caudal.  Oriamal bite
          I got a date!               radius 37 inches, allowing for
                              salt-water erosion and subse-
                  BRODY          quent small predator and
          She' ll understand.          scavenger tissue attacks....

                  MIKE
          She won't.

          The Kids have moved a little closer to hear what's going on
          between father and son.

                            BRODY
                  I don't want to discuss it.

          Elkins crosses to Brody.

                            ELKINS
                  It's either a Great White, or
                  another killer whale.

                            BRODY
                  Can't you tell?

                            ELKINS
                  Not when it's like this.  This
                  animal has been ashore for 10,
                  12 hours, and drifting for a day,
                  at least.  Every little nibbler in
                  the sea's taken a bite.

                            BRODY
                  Look -- can Great White Sharks
                  communicate?  Send out signals,
                  or something?  You know, take
                  revenge, sense an enemy....

                            ELKINS
                  Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't
                  take things personally.

                            MIKE
                  Dad, please....

          Brody turns on him.  This at least, is something he can do
          something about.

                            BRODY
                  No more sailing.  You come back
                  with me, and that's it.

                            MIKE

                  Why me?

                            BRODY
                  Because I say so.

                            ANDY
                  I'll tie up at the town dock, don't
                  worry, man.

                            JACKIE
                  See you later, Mikey....

                            ED AND TINA
                  Later, bye... (Ad lib).

     74     INT. AMITY TOWN HALL - DAY                              74

          Vaughn and Brody enter, walking through the spare, empty town
          meeting hall, towards the conference table.  They are alone.

                            VAUGHN
                  I'm showing summer rentals.  We
                  got a helluva season going.

                            BRODY
                  We have got to talk, and we have
                  got to talk alone.

                            VAUGHN
                  We're alone.

                            BRODY
                  Larry, I don't know how to say this,
                  but I think we got a shark problem.
                  A real one.

          Vaughn stares at him, then unlocks the door to his private
          office -- "Mayor" -- and leads Brody in.


     75     INT. VAUGHN'S OFFICE - DAY                              75

          Small, expensively furnished in antiques, with a few symbols
          of Amity boosterism cluttering one wall:  a photo of the beach,
          featuring a shark tower; an architect's rendering of the new
          Holiday Inn, some charts and graphs showing upward progress,
          a few stills of businessmen's luncheons, plaques, awards, etc.

                            VAUGHN
                  Are you serious?

                            BRODY
                  Of course.  Look -- I've got some
                  missing persons, fatalities,
                  evidence of a large predator....

                            VAUGHN
                  No one has seen a shark -- no fin,
                  no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.

                            BRODY
                  I got a feeling.  I have to act on
                  it -- you can understand that,
                  can't you?

                            VAUGHN
                  Of course I can, but can't it wait?
                  These things cost money, and this
                  town doesn't have much money.

                            BRODY
                  We have to do something.

                            VAUGHN
                  We have done something -- hell, we
                  damn near went broke putting up a
                  shark watch tower on the beach --
                  it's the only one in 2000 miles,
                  y'know.

                            BRODY
                  I know, I know....

                            VAUGHN
                  And I stood by while you told the
                  people from Ramada and Marriott
                  that if they put up a hotel they'd
                  need $800,000 worth of steel net
                  around their beaches!  In New England?
                  We all lost on that one.

                            BRODY
                  It's still a good idea.

                            VAUGHN
                  Martin, when we build up our tax
                  base a little, you can have every-
                  thing you want; right now, the
                  town's broke.

                            BRODY
                  Please, Larry -- there's good reason.
                  Those water skiers....

                            VAUGHN
                       (interrupting)
                  A tragedy.  But that was a boating
                  accident; no bites, no sharks,
                  nothing but a boating accident.

                            BRODY
                  Two of them are still missing!

                            VAUGHN
                  There's always deaths in these
                  waters that never turn up.  Are
                  they all shark victims?

                            BRODY
                  Maybe they are!

          Brody's overstated his case, and he realizes it.

                            VAUGHN
                  Bullshit.

                            BRODY
                       (shouting)
                  Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit
                  -- there's a dead whale out there
                  with bites all over it!

                            VAUGHN
                       (shouting back)
                  What am I, an ass?  When you called
                  me, I called Elkins, and her bosses.
                  Nothing she saw is proof of anything.

                            BRODY
                  Someone has to do something.

                            VAUGHN
                       (back in control)
                  Don't push it this time.  If you
                  do, it won't turn out the way you
                  want, I guarantee you that.

          The two men study each other for a long moment.  Then,

                            VAUGHN
                  I've got to get back to work.

          He holds the door for Brody, who walks out as Vaughn lags be-
          hind, locking up his sanctum.

                                        CUT TO


     76     EXT. AMITY BEACH ROAD - DAY (DUSK)                         76

          Brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home and
          family.  He drives past the town's billboard:  it's covered
          with an architect's rendering of the Amity Holiday Inn .  The
          sign reads:  "WHEN IN AMITY, ENJOY THE HOLIDAY INN."

          Plastered across it is an added streamer:  "NOW OPEN."  Barely
          visible underneath are older notices:  "UNDER CONSTRUCTION,"
          and "OPENING IN JUNE."

          As Brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main
          road and heads down towards the beach.


     77     EXT. BEACH - DUSK                                   77

          Brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he
          continues on home.  As he drives along, he sees:  a clambake;
          some teen-agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few
          solitary surfcasters and fishermen.

          The beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and Brody and his
          jeep have the sand to themselves.  It's then that he sees
          something:


     78     BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW                                   78

          A big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the
          surf just off the beach ahead.  It's a piece of the water-
          skiers' boat; Brody heads towards it.


     79     ANGLE ON THE SURF                                   79

          As Brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets out
          to look at the flotsam.  His shoes get wet.  He backs up onto
          dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this object.
          It bobs up and down in the surf; Brody makes "Get in here"
          motions.  The junk resists.

                            BRODY
                  Come on, give a guy a break.

          No response.  He takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up
          his trouser legs.  A silly sight.  He wades into the water
          after it.

                            BRODY
                  Come on.  Here boy.  Come to
               Poppa....

          It eludes him, and he flounders after it.  A big wave breaks
          across his crotch.

                            BRODY
                  Hoo!  Cold!

          He's almost there, it's just beyond his reach, he's got it,
          he's lost it, he has it again, it's slippery....

                            BRODY
                       (ad lib)
                  Come here.  Come on, Sweetheart.
                  You bastard.  A little closer...
                  Here y'go....

          Then, he's got it ---

                            BRODY
                       (exultant)
                  Gotcha!


     80     CLOSE ON BRODY IN THE WATER                              80

          As he grabs the ruined wood, and pulls it towards him.  Sud-
          denly, the mass of wreckage breaks apart, and something
          lunges out of the mess and into Brody.


     81     SHOCK CUT CLOSEUP - "THE THING"                              81

          Brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror; the
          gory remains of Diane, burnt beyond recognition,: flesh peeled
          away, discolored, charred, ruined by days in salt water. He
          screams, and scrabbles in the wet sand, trying to get out
          of the dreadful clutches of the half-human thing he's dredged
          from the water.


     82     ANGLE ON BRODY                                        82

          Extricating himself, puking, retching, splashing water on his
          face, washing his hands frantically, just behind him, The
          Thing lying on the sand, a gruesome joke played by the sea.

                                        DISSOLVE TO


     83     INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - NIGHT - EXTREME CLOSEUP - CYANIDE BOTTLE     83

          Macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of Sodium Cyanide,
          from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose.  Follow
          the syringe and reveal Brody, working at his desk in the
          deserted office.  He is injecting the deadly chemical into
          some jacketed .38 hollow-point ammunition; a dozen cartridges
          are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them,
          sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle.  The
          radio scanner is monitoring the local police band:  routine
          reports faintly in the b.g. -- a slow night in pre-season Amity.


     84     ANGLE ON BRODY                                        84

          As a sound at the door makes him look up.  He hides the odd
          gear as Hendricks enters, starched and crisp in his uniform.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Chief?

                            BRODY
                  In here.

                            HENDRICKS
                  I missed you at the funeral home.
                  Santos said you were here.

                            BRODY
                  You didn't miss much.  Christ, what
                  a mess.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Positive I.D.?

                            BRODY
                  The woman passenger on the boat
                  that blew up.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Oh.

          There's an awkward pause.  Brody sees the box with the divers'
          stuff sitting where it was left earlier.

                            BRODY
                  What about that camera?

                            HENDRICKS
                  What camera?

                            BRODY
                  That one -- from the wreck.  You
                  brought it up, did you look inside
                  it?

                  Hendricks' guilty look confirms he didn't.

                            BRODY
                  Well, what the hell -- might be
                  something worth seeing.  Take it
                  somewhere and see if there's film
                  in it....

                            HENDRICKS
                       (catching on)
                  If there is, develop it!

                            BRODY
                  You got it.

     The Deputy rummages in the locker, happy to be on the trail.

                            HENDRICKS
                  I know just where to go.

                            BRODY
                  Not the drugstore!

                            HENDRICKS
                  Of course not,  They're closed.
                  Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it
                  for me.

                            BRODY
                  The drugstore's closed?  What the
                  hell time is it?

                            HENDRICKS
                  Nine-thirty, ten maybe.

                            BRODY
                  Shit -- I'm late for dinner...
                  Close up, okay?

          And he runs for the door, the speed-loaders with the Cyanide
          bullets safely in his pocket.

                            BRODY
                       (at the door)
                  Oh yeah -- I'm expecting a long
                  distance call, very important.
                  Give them my home phone.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Right.

          Brody pats his pockets to make sure the speed-loaders are
          safe inside, then exits.  As Hendricks watches him go,

     86     EXT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT                              86

          Brody's jeep pulls up, and he gets out, beat.  He is slouching
          towards the door when he hears the phone ring inside.  He
          perks up, and starts to move faster.

                                        CUT TO


     87     INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT                              87

          Ellen is on the phone in the den as Brody enters the house.
          The Kids are on the floor in front of the TV, playing an
          electronic video game that pings and beeps softly under the
          following.

                            ELLEN
                       (into the phone)
                  Thank you.  I'll tell him.

                            BRODY
                  For me?

                            ELLEN
                       (hanging up)
                  Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard
                  the research vessel Aurora, presently
                  in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be
                  in radio range until half-past next
                  spring.

                            BRODY
                  Damn.

          He starts upstairs, casually concealing the towel-wrapped
          package of gun and ammunition.

                            MIKE
                  Is Hooper coming to dinner?

                            BRODY
                  Not till next year.

          He goes upstairs, Ellen waits a few beats, then follows him.

                                        CUT TO


     88     INT. BRODY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT                         88

          Brody comes up the stairs and goes into the bedroom, where
          he carefully puts the gun in the bed table.  Ellen finds him.

                            BRODY
                  Oh, hi -- How was dinner?

                            ELLEN
                  Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family
                  affair.  Where were you?

                            BRODY
                       (getting up)
                  Santos' place.

          They both know what that means -- the morgue.  Brody goes
          into the bathroom and starts scrubbing his hands compulsively.


     89     INT. BRODY HOUSE - BATHROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT                    89

          Ellen follows Brody, watches as he washes under too-hot
          water.

                            BRODY
                  Oww!

                            ELLEN
                  Careful.  What's wrong?

                            BRODY
                  Nothing.

                            ELLEN
                  Nothing, huh?

                            BRODY
                  That's what I said.  Is there any
                  of that hand cleaner stuff?

                            ELLEN
                  Use the little brush there.  Why
                  were you at Santos'?

                            BRODY
                  Found one of the missing victims
                  from that boat deal.

                            ELLEN
                  Oh.  Want to talk about it?

                            BRODY
                  No.

                            ELLEN
                  Terrific.

          Mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when
          Brody spots him; Sean is just behind him.

                            BRODY
                  Michael.

                            MIKE
                  Yeah?

                            BRODY
                  You want to come here a minute?

          Mike shrugs and crosses to his father; Sean whizzes past on
          into his room.

                            SEAN
                  Hi Dad.

                            BRODY
                  Hiya yourself.

                            MIKE
                  What is it?

          He expects something:  this is a formal audience with the
          Head of The House.

                            BRODY
                  I got something for you to do
                  tomorrow.

                            MIKE
                  I kind of had plans....

                            BRODY
                  Sailing?
                       (Mike nods)
                  Forget it.  You're beached.
                  Grounded.  No more boats.

                            MIKE
                  Hey, come on....

                            BRODY
                  No backtalk!  I spoke to Upton, at
                  the beach, and he's got a job for
                  you there.  You can work until
                  school starts.

                            ELLEN
                  All summer?

                            BRODY
                  He wanted a job, he's got one.  I
                  want to see that boat out of the
                  water by tomorrow night.

          We see Sean's door opening as he peeps into the hall to see
          what the fuss is about.


     89-A     ANGLE ON SEAN'S DOOR                                   89-A

          It opens a few inches, he looks out at the grownups and his
          brother, decides he wants no part of this, and quietly
          closes the door.

                            MIKE (o.s.)
                  Dad, please....

                            BRODY (o.s.)
                  Tomorrow night.  Out of the water.


     89-B     ANGLE ON THE HALLWAY                                   89-B

          Mike silently storms into his room, not-so-silently slamming
          the door as he exits.  From inside the room, loud rock music
          muffled behind the door -- an expression of teen-age rebel-
          lion.

                            ELLEN
                  Not so loud!

          The music lowers its volume.  Brody turns to go into the
          bedroom, to take his shoes off, to go to bed....

                            BRODY
                  I know what you're going to say.

                            ELLEN
                  Do you?

                            BRODY
                       (on the bed)
                  In the city, it happened all the
                  time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop,
                  top, a drunk gets cut in pieces
                  under the Brooklyn local, old
                  people die alone in shitty
                  apartments and three weeks later
                  someone calls the cops because of
                  the smell and the flies.  Call the
                  cops.  What are we, immune?

                            ELLEN
                  It was bad, wasn't it.

                            BRODY
                  The goddamn smell is always the
                  same.
                       (he shudders at
                       the recollection)

                            ELLEN
                  Are you going to be able to sleep?

                            BRODY
                  Yeah.   I think so.
                       (he raises
                       his voice)
                  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!

          Ellen gets up, and quietly closes the door.  The upstairs
          hallway is empty, the doors closed.  The Brody household
          compartmented and closed for the night.

                                        DISSOLVE TO


     90     EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY                                   90

          The familiar striped cabanas flank the white sands; there's
          a crowd of midweek seasonal tourists and locals oblivious to
          the tall steel tower that dominates the beach.

          A classy van outfitted for passengers pulls into the parking
          area, followed by Vaughn's Cadillac; the parking attendant
          waves them into a preferential area, where they disembark:
          Vaughn, Peterson, Ellen, and some more prospects, including a
          woman named Bryant and her daughter, Renee.

                            PETERSON
                  This is the town beach; the devel-
                  opment naturally has its own
                  private access, but I wanted you
                  to see the concession area.  Look
                  at that sand -- like sugar!

          He scoops up a handful of the fine powder.  Ellen directs the
          attention of the photographers.

                            ELLEN
                  During the summer, the sun sets
                  right there...
                       (she points)
                  Over the water.  Beautiful.

                            VAUGHN
                       (to Ellen)
                  I'll say hello for you.

          Ellen nods, preoccupied.  Vaughn strolls away, headed in the
          direction of the cabanas.  Mary Nichols, a local Selectwoman,
          emerges from behind the counter of one of the concessions.

                            NICHOLS
                  Hello -- selling some more of the
                  good life?

                            ELLEN
                  A piece here, a piece there, it
                  all adds up.

                            NICHOLS
                  Your husband's been here all morn-
                  ing.  What's he doing?

                            ELLEN
                       (good-naturedly)
                  His job.

          Michael Brody, dressed in township workman's coveralls, is
          repainting some flaking woodwork.  Sean is happily mixing
          paint.  Vaughn joins them.

                            VAUGHN
                  Your dad got you working?

                            MIKE
                  Yeah.


          He continues his chore, without enthusiasm.

                            SEAN
                  I'm helping.

                            VAUGHN
                  You know where your dad is?

                            MIKE
                  Up there.

          He points at the tower.

                            VAUGHN
                  Oh, for Christ's sake.

          He crosses briskly to where Peterson is finishing.

                            PETERSON
                  And if you have any questions
                  about recreational possibilities,
                  Ellen Brody here will be happy to
                  answer them.

                            VAUGHN
                  Len, can I see you a minute?

          Peterson excuses himself and joins the Mayor.

                            PETERSON
                  I think we got a couple of live ones.

                            VAUGHN
                  Brody's riding his tower.

                            PETERSON
                       (looking up)
                  Oh, shit.


     91     BRODY IN THE TOWER                                   91

          sweeping the water with binoculars, restless eyes trying to
          scan everything, a grim watchman high over the heads of the
          unseeing crowd.


     92     ON THE WATER                                        92

          Larry Vaughn, Jr. comes skimming in close to the surf.  Bob
          is handling the sheets, Larry is giving young Jackie sailing
          lessons -- at the moment he's showing her how the tiller
          works.  He's on her like glue.

                            JACKIE
                  This is fun!  Can we go faster?

                            LARRY
                       (to Bob)
                  Trim.

          Bob does, Larry trims the main, and the hull lifts.

                            JACKIE
                  Yay!

          She snuggles in Larry's arms.  He waves to someone.

                            LARRY
                  That's my dad!

          Jackie waves without seeing.


     93     ON THE BEACH                                        93

          Vaughn waves back, preoccupied.  Near him, Mike Brody looks
          up, his face grim, jealous, and now a little nuts.  He
          splashes paint onto the wood with angry abandon.

                            VAUGHN
                       (to Peterson)
                  Wave to my son.

                            PETERSON
                       (waving)
                  How the hell do we get him down.
                  from there?

                            VAUGHN
                  Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's
                  get them back in the bus.

          Mrs. Bryant approaches them, tugging her daughter.

                            MRS. BRYANT
                  Renee wants to know what that man
                  is doing way up there?

                            PETERSON
                  He's, ah, watching.  A lookout.

                            MRS. BRYANT
                  For what?

                            RENEE
                       (a precocious
                       little girl)
                  It's a shark tower.  I saw one in
                  Florida.  He's looking for sharks.

                            VAUGHN
                  It's an observation platform.
                  That's our Chief of Police.  He's
                  just checking it.

                            PETERSON
                  Normally,  it's used for, ah, bird-
                  watching.  Nature observation.
                  Weather measurements, that sort
                  of thing.
                       (a little
                       desperate)
                  Ellen, we're running late!

                            ELLEN
                  Okay.  Folks, if we could get back
                  on, we'll show you the country club,
                  and stop for lunch....

          At the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin
          flocking back into the van.  Peterson herds them along.

                            PETERSON
                  The country club has an 18-hole
                  course, putting greens, and twelve
                  tennis courts....

                                        CUT TO


     94     BRODY iN THE TOWER                                   94

          still scanning.  His body suddenly tenses.  There's something
          out there.  He mashes his binoculars to his eyes, trying to
          get a better look.


     95     HIS POINT OF VIEW (PROCESS)                              95

          Through the binoculars, something big and black, moving
          under the buoys and into the swimming area.


     96     BRODY AGAIN                                        96

          He can't believe it.  But looking past him, we can see it with
          the unaided eye:  a seething dark mass, moving through the
          water towards the unprotected bathers.

                            BRODY
                       (screaming)
                  Out of the water!  Everyone out
                  of the water!

          No one can hear him.  A few little faces look up, unable to
          catch what he's saying.  He starts climbing down the ladder
          shouting.

                            BRODY
                  Get out of the water!  Tell every-
                  one to get out:  Now:  Out of the
                  water!


     97     ANGLE ON PETERSON, VAUGHN, AND NICHOLS                         97

          reacting.

                            VAUGHN
                       (recalling
                       another panic)
                  Oh, my God....

                            PETERSON
                  What the hell is he doing?

                            NICHOLS
                  Oh, no!


     97-A     ELLEN, MIKE, AND SEAN                                   97-A

          looking up, startled at Brody's sudden panic.


     98     THE WATER                                        98

          The dark mass almost on top of the swimmers, who are starting
          to look around.  Most of them are oblivious to what's happen-
          ing on shore.


     99     FOLLOW BRODY                                        99

          as his feet hit the sand and he starts running for the water,
          fumbling for his gun and the speed-loader with the cyanide
          bullets.  He is bumping into people, knocking little kids
          over, stepping on blankets and umbrellas, a madman.

                            BRODY
                  Out of the water!  Now!  Everyone!


     99-A     VAUGHN                                             99-A

          running too, half-stumbling, half-believing, remembering....


     99-B     ELLEN                                             99-B

          moving after her husband, while Mike steadies Sean, holding
          the impulsive kid back.

                            ELLEN
                       (seeing
                       something)
                  Martin!  No!


     99-C     ANGLE ON BRODY AGAIN                                   99-C

          The gun is out now, he's trying draw a bead on the shape
          in the water; chest heaving, he tries to steady his shaky
          grip.  People see the gun and scream, throwing themselves
          flat on the sand, running, some of them going into the water.

                            BRODY
                  No!  Don't go in!  Stay out!
                  Stay clear!

          He fires.  Again.  Bullets ricochet off the water, howling
          towards the horizon.  Real panic now.  Four more shots.

          Reloading, ejected rounds falling bright into the sand, Brody
          on his knees, fumbling with bullets.


     99-D     ANGLE ON A LIFEGUARD                                   99-D

          standing on his platform, shocked, watching the Chief of
          Police fumbling with his gun.

                            LIFEGUARD
                  It's bluefish!  It's a school of
                  bluefish!  Chief!  It's bluefish!


     100     ANGLE ON THE WATER                                   100

          It is bluefish -- a tight mass of them, churning up the water
          in a dark, dense group.  The swimmers look around, confused
          by the shots and excitement.

                            A SWIMMER
                  What's going on?

                            ANOTHER SWIMMER
                  Fish!  Anyone got a net?

                            3RD SWIMMER
                  Someone get me a rod and reel!

          Laughter defuses the tension in the water; bathers move
          around, some getting closer to see the fish, others leaving
          the water to join friends and families on the sand.


     101     ANGLE ON THE BEACH                                   101

          where Brody is now standing, panting, coming down as a crowd
          collects at a safe distance around him:  Ellen emerges from
          a group that includes Vaughn, Peterson, and Nichols.

                            BRODY
                  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  False alarm....

          Curious crowd murmurs as they watch this lunacy.  Brody
          realizes he's fired his weapon, that spent shells litter
          the sand at his feet.

                            BRODY
                  Okay, it's all over, go on, it's
                  over.  No trouble....

          Ellen joins him.

                            ELLEN
                  It's okay.  It's over....

          Brody drops to his knees, fumbling for the cyanide bullets
          in his gun, trying to put things in order, scrabbling in
          the sand for the empty shells.

          The crowd is curious and embarrassed.  Some turn away, others
          drift back to their blankets, talking about what's just hap-
          pened, others stare rudely.  Brody is coming apart.

                            BRODY
                  It's all right, everything's all
                  right....

          Sean emerges from the crowd, and helps his daddy pick up the
          bullets, Ellen moves to disperse the rudely curious.

                            ELLEN (o.s.)
                  Let's go, everyone...Mrs. Bryant,
                  Len, please....


     101-A     CLOSE ON BRODY AND SEAN                                   101-A

          He sees Sean, his eyes fill with tears, and he grabs the kid
          in a fierce hug.

     102     INT. TOWN HALL - DAY                                   102

          A hurriedly called meeting of the town's Selectmen is in
          session:  Vaughn, Peterson, and three others:  Kaiser, an
          old man still in his grocery clerk's apron; Sansom; and
          Nichols, the woman on the beach.

                            VAUGHN
                  Brody's a good man.

                            KAISER
                  Nobody says he isn't.

                            PETERSON
                  You should've been out there.  You
                  should've seen him waving that gun,
                  like a maniac.  There were shots
                  fired!

                            VAUGHN
                  He thought he had a good reason.

                            MS. NICHOLS
                  But that's not rational behavior!

                            PETERSON
                  That's what I'm saying!

                            VAUGHN
                  How many people were there?

                            MS. NICHOLS
                  Hundred!  Literally hundreds.
                  What are they going to say about us?

                            PETERSON
                       (to Vaughn)
                  Larry, I'm a businessman, trying
                  to make a buck like anybody else.

                            VAUGHN
                  So?  So?

                            PETERSON
                  So it can't be done like that.  The
                  man's a menace, plain and simple.

                            VAUGHN
                  Look, what am I supposed to do?
                  It's done, it's over.  We have to
                  deal with the consequences.

                            SANSOM
                  That's what we're here to do.

                            VAUGHN
                  All right.  Let's go into my
                  office, where we can have a little
                  privacy.


     103     ANGLE FROM INSIDE VAUGHN'S OFFICE                         103

          as the selectmen troop into the cramped quarters.  Vaughn
          deliberately closes the door as they find seats around
          the room.

                            VAUGHN
                  I believe we have a quorum, and
                  informally, I suggest we call this
                  meeting an executive session and
                  dispense with minutes....

                                        CUT TO


     103-A     INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY                              103-A

          Brody, alone, is sitting at his desk, morosely studying a
          little gold statuette of a pistol marksman.  What's done
          is done, and Brody is trying to figure out how to live with
          it.  The phone rings, is answered in the other room.  The
          buzzer sounds.  Brody picks up his end.

                            BRODY
                  Polly, no calls, please...
                       (she insists)
                  Okay, okay.
                       (he punches
                       a button)
                  Hello...Phil?  Fogarty?. . .What
                  pictures.. I'll be right down....

          He slams down the phone and gets up to go, suddenly possessed
          with a purpose.

                                        CUT TO


     104     INT. DARKROOM - DAY                                   104

          Amid the equipment, clutter and proofs, some shots of the
          holidome opening, drying on wires.  Phil Fogarty, the indig-
          nant fat man and town photographer, is locking the door
          behind an impatient Brody.

                            PHIL
                  I don't know what you did, but that
                  kid stopped.  I haven't heard one
                  peep, not one 'breaker breaker'
                  for days.  Believe me, it's a
                  pleasure....

                            BRODY
                  You said something about a camera.

                            PHIL
                  Sure, sure -- Jeff Hendricks
                  brought in this camera, see, from
                  underwater, and I didn't know how
                  to get it open, but my brother-in-
                  law, in Montauk, he works at a hi-
                  fi store, and they sell cameras,
                  so he....

                            BRODY
                       (interrupting)
                  Did you get any pictures?

                            PHIL
                  Well, yeah, I did, that's the
                  funny thing.  You can't tell much
                  from the negatives, I was going
                  to blow 'em up.  Here's a test
                  I did....

          He holds out an 8 x 10 proof, Brody snatches it from him.


     104-A     INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH                                   104-A

          Brody stares down at it.  Sure enough, the ghostly outlines
          of the Orca, underwater, a diver on the deck making a
          gesture at the camera.

                            BRODY (O.S.)
                  Oh, Jesus.  That boat....


     105     ANGLE ON BRODY AND PHIL                                   105

                            PHIL
                  Not bad -- that's a real fast
                  lens, probably 1.4.  Look at the
                  diffusion, though....

                            BRODY
                  What else you got?

                            PHIL
                  Let's see -- you got a minute?

                            BRODY
                  Come on, Phil, don't jerk me around.

                            PHIL
                  Okay, okay -- stand over there....

          He gestures, Brody steps to one side of a table with some
          big enamel pans for washing and developing prints.  Phil
          switches to a red light, and takes some printing paper,
          putting it under the enlarger.


     105-A     QUICK CUTS:                                        105-A

          --  Enlarger light going on.

          --  Timer ticking, the hand turning.

          --  Quick negative images: water, boat, diver, hand, boat
              again, tantalizing fragments of the opening sequence
              projected on the enlarger's flat base.

          --  Hypo and Developer sloshing in a pan under Phil's hands.

          --  Brody staring down.


     106     INSERT (PROCESS)                                   106

          Quietly gaining contrast in a pan of developer, a print of
          what at first looks like seaweed, then is unmistakably the
          grinning jaws of the Great White.


     106     SUBLIMINAL FLASH CUT - SHARK                              106

          A quick nightmare vision of Brody, alone in a sinking Orca,
          trapped in a battered cabin interior; a Great White crashes
          through the glass, its head huge as it lunges.


     106-A     INSERT PHOTOGRAPH IN DEVELOPER (PROCESS)                    106-A

          The close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable
          photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the
          snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a
          memory, it would make no sense at all.  For Brody, the meaning
          is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster
          face-to-face, it's nothing.

                            BRODY (o.s.)
                       (shaken)
                  That one there.  That one....

          Phil's hands, holding plastic tongs, gently slosh the print
          in the bath.  The shark's features are indistinguishable from
          the surrounding detail.

          Brody walks into view, and starts up the steps into the town
          hall, already lit from within.  He's carrying a large envelope.

     110     INT. TOWN HALL - NIGHT                                   110

          The Selectmen (Kaiser, Sansom, Nichols), Len Peterson, and
          Vaughn are seated informally around the big table.

                            PETERSON
                       (looking up)
                  Speak of the devil.

          Brody enters, carrying the envelope with the photo.

                            BRODY
                  Thank God you guys were all together.
                  I got something for you.  Proof!

                            VAUGHN
                  Martin, this is kind of an official
                  meeting

                            BRODY
                  Perfect.  Look at this ---

          He fumbles with the envelope.

                            VAUGHN
                  Chief -- the Board of Selectmen
                  has a question only you can answer.

                            BRODY
                       (preoccupied)
                  What?

                            PETERSON
                  Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill
                  in as an interim Chief of Police
                  in your absence?

                            BRODY
                  Temporarily?  Uh...sure....

     The question's out of left field.  Why are they asking?

                            NICHOLS
                  So Jeff could handle things?  He
                  knows the routine, he has the
                  authority?

                            BRODY
                  Yeah.  Why?

                            PETERSON
                  It came up during the meeting.

                            BRODY
                  Look -- I just got this from Phil
                  Fogarty.  It was in the camera
                  belonging to the missing divers.
                  It proves I was right, all along.

          He throws the picture down in front of them.  They bend over
          to study it, pass it around, look at it.

                  KAISER     (simultaneous)        NICHOLS
          Seaweed?               It's underwater, isn't it?
                              That's why it's so dark.

                            SANSOM
                  I don't know -- what is it?

                            BRODY
                  It's a shark!  A Great White!
                  Jesus, it's right there!

          He snatches up the photo.


     111     INSERT PHOTO                                        111

          Just as before, an ambiguous pattern of light and dark; not
          proof of anything without Brody's inner vision.

                            VAUGHN (o.s.)
                  It's nothing I can see.


     112     ANGLE ON BRODY                                        112

          waving the picture.

                            BRODY
                  What are you all, blind?  It's a
                  shark.  Look -- teeth, jaw, gills.

                            PETERSON
                  Is that what it is?

                            BRODY
                  You're damn right that's what it is.

                            NICHOLS
                  I'm sorry, I just don't see it.

          Sansom and Kaiser agree, ad lib, "That's nothing...."

                            VAUGHN
                  Martin, it could be anything.

                            BRODY
                       (exploding)
                  What the hell does it take to make
                  sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus,
                  it's right there in front of you.
                  I know what a goddamn shark looks
                  like, I've been through it, don't
                  you understand?  I've seen this
                  sonofabitch before!

          The Selectmen look at each other in the face of Brody's
          agitation.  Tempers are running high.

                            PETERSON
                  What have you seen before?  This
                  is nothing.  Seaweed.  Mud.  Some-
                  thing in the lens.

                            BRODY
                  My ass!

                            VAUGHN
                  Be reasonable, please....

                            PETERSON
                       (to Vaughn)
                  Forget it, he won't listen.

                            BRODY
                  There is nothing to discuss.

                            PETERSON
                       (blowing up)
                  Will you listen to this man?
                  Will you just listen to him?
                       (to Brody)
                  You really caused a panic on a
                  public beach, you shoot up the
                  place, God knows who could've been
                  injured -- what if somebody de-
                  cides to sue us?  That could ruin
                  us.

                            BRODY
                  Is that what it is?  Dollars?
                  Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it
                  out of my salary.

                  You don't make enough.

                            BRODY
                  Maybe I don't make as much money
                  as some bullshit rip-off artists
                  around here, but I don't work the
                  same way.

                            PETERSON
                  What's that supposed to mean?

                            BRODY
                  It means I don't like all that
                  grab-ass and heavy breathing with
                  my wife, it means I know who's
                  out to screw me here, and it means
                  that I know something none of you
                  know because I've been there --
                  and I don't want to go through
                  that horror again.  Ever!

          There's a long pause.

                            VAUGHN
                  Martin, could you wait here for
                  a few minutes while we make up
                  our minds about something?

                            BRODY
                  Go ahead, whatever it's worth.

          The Selectmen file into Vaughn's office, leaving Brody
          alone in the room.  The last one in the door very carefully
          makes sure it's tightly shut.

          Brody sits alone at the table.

          They are sitting there, deliberating.

                  I won't mention his personal
                  attack on me.

                  I've never seen him like this.

                            PETERSON
                  And Hendricks is qualified, you
                  heard that from his own mouth.

                            KAISER
                  We made a motion and it was al-
                  ready seconded.

                            VAUGHN
                       (official)
                  Very well then.
                  It is moved and seconded that
                  Martin Brody be relieved of his
                  duties as Chief of Police, his
                  contract with the township be
                  terminated, and that Jeff
                  Hendricks be appointed Acting
                  Chief in the interim.  Those in
                  favor?

          All the hands go up.

                            PETERSON
                  Anyone opposed, or is it
                  unanimous?

          Vaughn's hand goes up, the sole dissent.  They stare at
          him.

                            VAUGHN
                  I'm sorry, but I respect his
                  convictions.  The motion is
                  carried.

          He goes to the door, and opens it.

                            VAUGHN
                  Martin?  Could you come in please?

          The police jeep pulls up and stops; although the engine's
          shut down, Brody still sits quietly inside the car.  Then
          his hand appears at the window, and he drops an empty beer
          can onto the lawn.  Clink.

          After a while, he drops another beer can, then another, until
          the "clinks" tell us he's polished off a six-pack on the way
          home.  Not too steady on his feet, Brody climbs out of the
          car and starts for the door to his house.

          Ellen is working at her desk in the den.  She is looking
          towards the door, expectantly -- it's been an unusually long
          pause between car arrival and husband arrival.  Brody enters.

                            ELLEN
                  Hi.  I closed a sale today, without
                  Len.  That's $1200 commission, if
                  the papers go through.

                            BRODY
                  That's great.

                            ELLEN
                  Sean's asleep.

                            BRODY
                  That's great too.  Gorgeous.

          He takes a long look at her.

                            BRODY
                  You look about 22 years old sitting
                  there.  Like you were doing homework....

          He goes to join her, bumping into some furniture in the dimly
          lit room.  Ellen has a beer and sandwich half-finished on her
          desk; Brody takes a healthy swallow from the beer.

                            ELLEN
                       (sensitive)
                  What's wrong?

                            BRODY
                  Ooohh, nothing.  I just got fired,
                  that's all.

          He tosses the photo sloppily on the desk.

                            ELLEN
                  What?

                            BRODY
                  What'd I say?

                            ELLEN
                  That you were fired.

                            BRODY
                  Then that's what I meant.  Fired.
                  Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The
                  Selectmen just made Hendricks the
                  new Chief of Police.  Just like that.

                            ELLEN
                  Because of today?  The beach?

                            BRODY
                       (expansively)
                  No sweat.  A blessing in disguise.
                  Back to the city, you can go to
                  Bloomingdale's without waiting six
                  hours for the ferryboat...we're
                  surrounded by water here, you
                  realize that?  Me, surrounded by
                  water...Ridiculous.

                            ELLEN
                  Stop that!  We're not going any
                  place.  You love it here.  Tell me
                  what the hell happened!

                            BRODY
                  Showed them the photo, showed them
                  the goddamn Shark, big as life.
                  They didn't see it.  Not like me.
                  Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch
                  who snapped this li'l picture...He's
                  out there, somewhere... I shot off
                  my gun, shot off my big mouth, so
                  they fired me....

                            ELLEN
                       (studying
                       the photo)
                  Honey, this is nothing...I don't
                  know what it is.  What did they....

                            BRODY
                       (going on)
                  ...Everybody wants the job.  No one
                  wants the authority.
                  Except Hendricks.  Fine.  He can go
                  out there in that precious boat,
                  and when he looks whitey in his
                  big mouth he can just call me.  Call
                  me in New York...tell him to kiss
                  my ass....

                            ELLEN
                       (seeing his pain)
                  They have no right to treat you
                  like that.  You've given them every-
                  thing.  For four years, you've
                  protected this town, the people on
                  this island....

                            BRODY
                  Fired me!
                       (at Ellen)
                  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm
                  responsible.  I know what I saw....

                            ELLEN
                  I know you did....

                            BRODY
                  I try.  Goddamnit, I tried...Now,
                  I'm tired...I can't keep fighting
                  it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....

          Brody's slipping under; the beers and the day have finally
          overcome him.  He slumps in Ellen's arms.

                            ELLEN
                  You're drunk is what you are....

          She eases him onto the couch, tucking a comforter over his
          inert shape.

                            ELLEN
                  Take it easy...Easy....

                  Is dad home?  I heard something....

          He comes into the darkened den.

                  Shhhh.  Go back upstairs.  Daddy's
                  sleeping.

          Sean finds the photo, and stares at it idly.

                            SEAN
                  What's this?

                            ELLEN
                  Nothing, sweetheart.  Seaweed.

          She takes him by his sleepy hand and leads him out of the
          room, leaving Brody tucked in on the couch, dead to the world.

          This is the Amity teen-ager's hangout -- a newsstand and
          pinball arcade with a minimal refreshment counter where soft
          drinks and submarine sandwiches are dispensed.  A jukebox is
          blaring some n.d. rock music.  Present are Donnie, Doug,
          Timmy, Bob, Larry Vaughn Jr., Brooke, Marge, Denise, Jane,
          Andy, and Mike.  The boys are passing around hot-rod van and
          custom boat magazines; the girls are looking at Silver Screen,
          Tiger Beat, People, and Time.  Andy and Mike are at the
          counter, splitting a sandwich.

                  Hey, Mike -- I saw your dad over at

          enter from the movies:  Patrick and Lucy, Ed and Tina, Polo

                  Let's go for it.

          There's a general ad-lib agreement to organize a day's
          sailing picnic.

                  I thought you might still be
                  painting the restrooms at the

          Laughter from the gang.

                  Anyone want a coke or anything?

          They break up into pairs and trios, some going for the soda
          fountain, others hanging out by the magazines.

                  No way.  Everybody's going sailing.
                  If you don't want to take me, just

                  That's not it.  My dad told me not
                  to go.

                            JACKIE
                  You do everything your parents tell
                  you?

                            MIKE
                  No.

                            JACKIE
                  Good.  I'll be on the dock at eight.
                       (to the gang)
                  Eight o'clock, everybody!

                       (aside to Mike)
                  I really want to to be there.

                  Who's bringing the wine?  And who's
                  got a quarter for the box?

          Brooke takes Mike aside, as Jackie goes to the jukebox.
          Larry is right there with a quarter, standing next to her as
          they select a tune.

                            BROOKE
                  She just likes to tease.  I think
                  she really likes you.

                            MIKE
                  Great.

          Ellen is asleep under the covers, Brody, still in his clothes
          from the night before, is sprawled on top; obviously he's
          stumbled upstairs sometime during the night.  There's a noise
          down the hall, from Mike's room.  Brody stirs, but doesn't
          wake up.

          Mike is holding a lamp that's almost fallen -- the noise we
          just heard.  He's almost dressed, but not quite satisfied
          with his image in the mirror.  He takes off his clean shirt,
          and checks a more comfortable, worn shirt.  A brief sniff to
          make sure it's okay for another day, and he puts it on; he
          tiptoes to the hall, where a noise stops him in his tracks.


     126     INT. BRODY HALLWAY - DAY                              126

          Mike is frozen in his part-opened bedroom door.  Sean's door
          opens, and little Sean, also fully dressed, comes sneaking
          out.

                            SEAN
                       (whispering)
                  You're going out.

                            MIKE
                  Yeah.

                            SEAN
                  You're going sailing.

                            MIKE
                  Maybe.

                            SEAN
                  Take me.

                            MIKE
                  No.

                            SEAN
                       (louder)
                  I want to go with you!

                  Quiet!  Shhh!

                            MIKE
                  Okay, okay.  Close your door.

          Sean does, and happily tiptoes with exaggerated stealth to
          Mike; the two of them start downstairs.

          Brody emerges from the bathroom, dressed in sweatshirt, and
          cutoffs:  no uniform today.  He starts downstairs, stopping
          only to look into Mike's room.  It's empty.

                            BRODY
                  Good morning, America....

          A grin crosses his face -- "My son, the Don Juan..."  He goes
          downstairs.

          Brody enters from upstairs.  He heats coffee.  Ellen enters
          dressed for work.  He pours two cups.

                            ELLEN
                  What're you going to do today?

                            BRODY
                  Turn in the car.  Clean my desk,
                  explain things to our sons, then
                  maybe get shit-faced and punch
                  your boss.

                            ELLEN
                  I'll give notice.

                            BRODY
                  Don't rush into it -- we may need
                  the income.

          She pours the coffee, they drink it for a moment.

                            BRODY
                  Mike left early.  Couldn't wait to
                  make out.  Must be a morning man.

          Ellen and Brody sip their coffee quietly for a few moments.
          Mrs. Silvera arrives, carrying groceries.

                            MRS. SILVERA
                  Morning.  Anything special today?

                  ELLEN     (simultaneously)     BRODY
          Sean's not up yet.          The sink upstairs is
                              busted.
          You know what he likes,          Try some Drano, or a
          just some Fruit Loops          plunger, maybe.  Or call
          and milk.  No candy.          your brother, the plumber,
                              what's his name....

                  Frankie.  He's my cousin.

                            BRODY
                  Frankie.  Okay.  Ask him if he
                  needs an apprentice.

          Brody and Ellen are at the door.

                            MRS. SILVERA
                  Have a nice day.

          The Kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of
          recreational offshore sailing.  Mike and Andy are readying
          his Tornado, while Sean gets in the way.  In the b.g.,
          Hendricks can be seen puttering around on the Amity police
          boat.

                            ANDY
                  If you're beached, why are
                  we doing this?  For practice?

                            MIKE
                  Yeah.

                            ANDY
                  Then why are we futzing around the
                  dock?  We can make a few bucks
                  working at the beach.

          Sean knocks something over, Mike snaps at him.

                            MIKE
                  Look -- if you're going to get in
                  the way, you can just go home.

                            SEAN
                  I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in
                  the way?

                            ANDY
                  You're always in the way.

          Marge joins them, scooping Sean up.

                            MARGE
                  This guy giving you any trouble?

                            SEAN
                  Put me down!

                            ANDY
                  Put him down in the water.

                            MARGE
                       (to Sean)
                  You want to go out in my boat?

                            SEAN
                  Yeah.

                            MIKE
                  Would you take him?

                            MARGE
                  Sure.

                            ANDY
                  You've just made someone very happy.

          Marge and Sean go over to her Lightening.  Brooke and Jackie
          come down the dock, dressed for sailing.

                            BROOKE
                  Mike!  Are you going out?

                            MIKE
                  Maybe.

                            JACKIE
                  I thought you were grounded.

                            MIKE
                  I can go out if I want to.

                            ANDY
                  You can?

                            JACKIE
                  You going to the lighthouse?

                            MIKE
                  Why not?

                            ANDY
                  I could give you a dozen good
                  reasons.

                            MIKE
                       (to Andy)
                  Shut up.

                            ANDY
                  Okay, okay, don't say I didn't
                  remind you.

                            JACKIE
                  Is there room on your boat for all
                  of us?

          Mike looks: Andy, Jackie, Brooke, himself...Timmy moves
          in, sensing the chance of a lifetime.

                            ANDY
                  Well, we're pretty crowded, and I
                  don't know when we're leaving....

          Timmy makes his move.

                            TIMMY
                  I've got room.

                            BROOKE
                  Great.
                       (to Andy)
                  That's okay -- I'll go with Timmy.

                            TIMMY
                  You will?

                            BROOKE
                  Sure.

          And she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to
          follow.  He's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune.

                            TIMMY
                  Fan-tas-tic!

          He runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're
          together again at last for the first time.  Andy is left
          shuffling with Mike and Jackie.

                            JACKIE
                  I'm ready.

          And she plops down in Mike's boat, ready to be taken.  Any-
          where.

                            JACKIE
                  Come on, you guys.

                            ANDY
                  Well, I don't know....

          Jackie flashes him one of her pouty little smiles.  Why break
          one heart when you can break two?  Or more?

                            JACKIE
                  Please come with us?

          Mike is glaring.  The message is clear, if unspoken.

                            JACKIE
                  For me...?

                            ANDY
                  What the hell.  For you....

          Andy joins them.  Mike casts off, while Andy helps, and Jackie
          sits there, looking cute.


     132     ANGLE ON LARRY AND BOB                                   132

          watching what's going on.

                            BOB
                  I thought you said she was going
                  with us?

                  Let's just go sailing, okay?

                       (casting off)
                  Want to talk about it?

                            LARRY
                  Want to swim home?

          Bob gets the message and shuts up.  The Sizzler fills its
          sails, and points out of the harbor.


     133     WIDE ON THE HARBOR                                   133

          Lots of day-sailing Kids, a few bigger, adult boats, some
          working fishermen and sport fishers; a typical recreational
          boating mix.  The Kids are finding the same general direction,
          pointing out of the harbor.


     134     QUICK CUTS                                        134

          --  Brooke and Timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he
              sets a course straight for the lighthouse.

          --  Larry, lifting a hull, almost losing Bob.

     136     REVERSE - LOOKING OUT TO SEA                              136

          The dive class boat, isolated near the channel, a group of
          Kids in wet suits and tanks assembled with three adult in-
          structors:  Tom Andrews, Crosby, and Sparky.


     137     EXT. DIVING BOAT - DAY                                   137

          Andrews and his assistant instructor, Sparky, are addressing
          the class, when Mike and Andy's "Green Machine" sails by,
          close.

                            ANDREWS
                  Hey!  Nicholas!  You're supposed
                  to be in class!

                            ANDY
                  Today I'm staying topside.  You
                  dive for me!

                            ANDREWS
                  I'm going for lobster.

                            JACKIE
                  Great!  Find one for me.

                            ANDY
                  With butter, if they got any....

          Andrews dismisses them with a good-natured wave.

                            ANDREWS
                  So long, turkies.

          He turns to his class.

                            ANDREWS
                  Sparky will take you down today.
                  If everyone's got a buddy, we'll
                  drop.

          The class dutifully lines up and starts going in, while
          in the b.g. the Kids sailboats head out to sea.  Andrews'
          two partners, Crosby and Sparky, get ready to follow the
          class over.

                            CROSBY
                       (to Andrews)
                  Let's get some dinner.

          He goes over, Andrews following.  Sparky is with the class,
          signalling "Down;" they submerge like clumsy seals.

                                        CUT TO


     138     UNDERWATER                                        138

          The class, paired up, is drifting down; Sparky offering en-
          couragement as they descend.  Andrews and Crosby are already
          disappearing, swimming away with strong kicks.


     139     FOLLOWING ANDREWS AND CROSBY                              139

          as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker,
          deeper waters.  Crosby checks his depth, his watch, looks
          around....


     140     HIS POINT OF  VIEW                                   140

          far above him, the class, going about their business.

          Below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass.
          Andrews sees it, too.


     141     ANGLE - ON ANDREWS                                   141

          Assuming Crosby is following, he takes off, following the big
          lunker.  Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem,
          misses seeing him go.  The two men are separated.  Follow
          Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper,
          losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and
          meeting, almost face-to-face, horror:


     142     BELOW HIM THE SHARK                                   142

          The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp,
          it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it
          turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red
          and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, eyes
          and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring face.

          Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes
          wide as he screams in fear into the water.  Finning backwards,
          he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on
          his safety vest.  It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging
          towards the surface.  The mouthpiece, useless, falls away
          from his lips.

          Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding
          his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby.


     143     THE DIVERS                                        143

          look over at the rocketing ascent.  What's wrong?  Sparky
          signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards
          the surface.  Crosby's already surfacing.

                                        CUT TO


     144     DECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY                              144

          Andrews is on his side, bloody froth on his lips.  One of
          the class is clinging to his legs, trying to arrest his
          convulsions.  Sparky is holding his shoulders, trying to
          administer mouth-to-mouth.

                            SPARKY
                  Get us in!  For Christ's sake,
                  get us in!

          In his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs.

          Behind them, in the water, the fin surfaces, and casually
          turns towards..the ocean.  The Shark is headed for the sea. and
          for the now distant Kids in their sailboats, dotting the
          horizon in their familiar bright colors.

     145     EXT. OCEAN - ED AND TINA'S SANDPIPER - DAY                    145

          They are alone.  In the middle distance, the rest of the
          Kids' sails can be seen, headed for the lighthouse in the dis-
          tance.  The Sandpiper's sails are luffing, they're making no
          headway.

                            TINA
                  You want to tack, or just leave
                  her pointed up like this?

                            ED
                       (snuggling close)
                  Just like this.

                            TINA
                  What about sailing?

                            ED
                  The tide's running.  It'll take
                  us to the light.

                            TINA
                  It'll take us to Budapest if you're
                  not careful.

          Ed is lashing the rudder as they continue to drift with the
          current.

                            ED
                  First things first.

          He fumbles in a cooler chest, produces a bottle of wine.

                            TINA
                  What about the others?

                            ED
                  They'll be there when we get there.
                  Might even have a fire started.

                            TINA
                  What're we going to do in the mean
                  time?

                            ED
                  I dunno.  We'll think of something.

          He pours the wine into the two paper cups.

                            ED
                  But first, a little juice....

                            TINA
                  And second?

                            ED
                       (kissing her)
                  Mmmmmm.

                            TINA
                       (resisting)
                  Wait a minute.  Promise me something.

                            ED
                  Anything.  Anything.

                            TINA
                  That you'll put down a blanket.  I've
                  got black and blue marks all over
                  my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight
                  about them.

                            ED
                  You got it.

          And he fumbles for a blanket in a locker, thumping and banging
          gear around as he rummages for it.  Tina sips wine contentedly,
          satisfied to wait.


     146     UNDERWATER                                        146

          The Sandpiper's hull, alone above us, as the Shark rises dread-
          ful certainty, attracted by the erratic sounds of Ed's hasty
          search.


     147     ANGLE ON TINA - WATCHING THE OCEAN                         147

          The terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, then
          dips and disappears.  Then, impossibly fast, the entire
          Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as
          the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror.
          Ed is knocked over the side, into the water.


     148     ANGLE ON ED                                        148

          as he breaks the surface, shaking the hair out of his eyes,
          trying to orient himself, finding the boat.  He starts to
          swim for it, Tina extending an arm to help him climb aboard.


     149     ANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED                         149

          He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes
          him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through the
          water.  Tina screams.  Before Ed can react to the pain, he is
          slammed face first into the boat.  His jaw breaks, blood
          smears his nose and lip.

          His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip.


     150     REVERSE                                             150

          Tina is staring down at the water, terror-stricken; Ed's arms
          and head are f.g., as he locks onto the boat with desperate
          hands.


     151     INSERT                                             151

          Ed's hands on the rail, knuckles white, an iron grip.  With
          awful finality, the force pulls down, and the wood shatters
          and splits away as Ed's hands are pulled down and under by
          the awful force.


     152     TINA                                             152

          her mouth working silently, unable to scream, staring down at
          the blood and froth on the water, swirling in a grim eddy
          under her, the Sandpiper rocking gently in the diminishing swell.

          On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the
          Kids are sailing in fairly close order:  The sloops (Polo,
          Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the
          faster cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc.) skimming around,
          tacking more often, faster and more maneuverable.

                  Coming about....

          She ducks under the boom, handling the jib sheets with easy
          familiarity.  They come about and scoot off on a new tack.


     153-B     CLOSE ON POLO                                        153-B

          reading the wind, trimming sail expertly, competent and
          alone.

                       (to a near-
                       by boat)
                  Great day!  I think the wind's
                  going to change....


     153-C     CLOSE ON TIMMY AND BROOKE                              153-C

          He comes about, she slides into him, he holds her to steady
          her, she snuggles into his arms.  True love, at last...He's
          thrilled.

                  Slowpoke!  Slowpoke!  Marge is
                  faster!

                            DOUG
                  I'm getting new sails, then watch
                  out.  Just a question of modifying
                  the rigging!

          Jackie, Mike and Andy, clipping along, Larry Vaughn and Bob
          in the Sizzler nearby.  Mike lifts the hull, Jackie squeals
          in delight.

                            JACKIE
                  Wheee!  Faster!

                            ANDY
                  How fast is enough?

                            JACKIE
                  I want to go faster!

                            MIKE
                  Hang on....

          He trims his sheets, the cat heels more, one hull flying,
          Andy and Jackie clinging to the trampoline.

          Larry is carefully adjusting his tiller, Bob senses what he's
          doing.

                  You coming up on him?

                            LARRY
                  You bet.  Hang on....

          They gybe sharply, running up behind the green cat.

                  Don't let him pass.  Faster!

          Mike and Larry silently fight for clean air, racing.  Water
          splashes over them.

                            JACKIE
                  My hair's getting wet!

          He veers onto a less dramatic tack, sparing Jackie's hair.
          Larry and Bob speed by, yelling.

                  When do we get to the lighthouse?

                            ANDY
                  Soon, dark eyes, soon.

                            MIKE
                  The tide's turning.

          Andy reveals a knowledgeable side to his character.

                            ANDY
                  We're going to be fighting the
                  current.
                       (he looks up)
                  Wind's backing around a few points,
                  too.

          Jackie snuggles against Mike.

                            JACKIE
                  I can't wait to get there.

                            ANDY
                  But of course.

          He goes forward to trim the jib, leaving the lovebirds snug-
          gling astern.  They pull away from us, and we:

          Ellen and Brody are in the jeep; he's driving her to work.
          There's a crowd at dockside, and the town ambulance's now-
          familiar blinking red light.  Brody, out of force of habit,
          wheels the jeep towards the action, nudging through the crowd,
          which gives way to the official blue-and-white vehicle.

                            ELLEN
                  Hey -- it's not your job any more.
                  I'm going to be late for work.

                            BRODY
                  Just one minute....

          He gets out, and pushes through the crowd, Ellen following.

          The dive boat is moored at a clumsy angle next to the Police
          Boat, where Hendricks has been pulling routine maintenance.
          The Police launch is cluttered with tools and spare parts;
          some non-essential piece of gear is stripped and laid out on
          the deck.  Hendricks is on the dive boat, kneeling next to
          Andrews.


     159     ABOARD THE DIVE BOAT                                   159

          Andrews is shaking, bloody froth on his lips and chest.  The
          shaken divers are huddled together, an ambulance attendant is
          wheeling a gurney into position.  Crosby and Sparky are
          stunned.

                            BRODY
                  What the hell happened?

                            SPARKY
                  Embolism.  Air bubbles in his blood.
                  Came up too damn fast.  Held his
                  goddamn breath!

          He is near collapse himself.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Easy....

                            CROSBY
                  He panicked!  Something scared him!

          An Ambulance Attendant is putting a blanket around Sparky.

                            ATTENDANT
                  It's okay.  We're taking care of him.

          The other attendant holds something out to Brody.  Brody
          examines it; a scuba mouthpiece, bitten in two, useless.

                            BRODY
                  How'd this happen?

                            SPARKY
                  Bite reflex, like a spasm.

                            BRODY
                  When?

                            HENDRICKS
                  Right after, the Kids went out?

                            ELLEN
                  What Kids?  Who went out?

                            HENDRICKS
                  All of them.  Mike, Junior Vaughn,
                  Brookie Peters, Pat, Lucy -- all
                  that whole gang.

                            ELLEN
                  Mike?  Our Mike?

                            HENDRICKS
                  Yep.  Looked like they were headed
                  to the lighthouse.

                            BRODY
                  How long ago?

                            HENDRICKS
                  About an hour, maybe two.
                       (thinking)
                  Let's see -- I came on about
                  eight....

          Brody is gone, pushing through the crowd.


     160     THE POLICE BOAT                                        160

          Brody is casting off lines.  Ellen is on the dock, watching
          him.

                            ELLEN
                  What're you doing?

                            BRODY
                  Going out.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Uh, Chief -- look.  You're not
                  Chief any more.

          Brody keeps working, making ready for sea.

                            HENDRICKS
                  I can't let you take her out.

                            BRODY
                  You can't stop me.

          Ellen is climbing aboard, taking off her heels.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Mrs. Brody, look -- if he can't go,
                  then you can't go.  Neither of you
                  can go.

                            ELLEN
                  I'm going.

                            BRODY
                  Mike's out there.

                            HENDRICKS
                  But I signed for the boat.  You' re
                  not authorized any more.

          Brody starts the engines with a roar, and slams it into re-
          verse.  The boat starts out of the slip, then lunges to a
          halt, shuddering on its still-fastened bow mooring line.

                            BRODY
                  Untie that rope.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Please.  It's my job.

                            ELLEN
                  I'll do it.

          And she moves purposefully towards the boat cleat.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Mrs. Brody, please....

          Brody is shifting gears, the boat is crabbing sideways as he
          puts the helm hard over.  It bumps the dock, hard.

                            HENDRICKS
                  You're too close.  Back off.

                            BRODY
                  Goddamnit, Hendricks, untie the
                  rope there.

          Hendricks goes to the bow, jumps aboard and frees the bow
          line.  The boat slips into reverse, the water boiling as
          Brody guns it away from the dock.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Let me.  Please.

          He takes the wheel, eases off on the rudder, and comes about,
          pointing the launch out to sea.

                            ELLEN
                  Hurry, please.

                            HENDRICKS
                  What the hell, they can't fire both
                  of us -- someone's got to be in
                  charge, right?  Which way are we
                  going?

                            BRODY
                  Find the Kids.  The lighthouse --
                  you said something about the light-
                  house.  Get us there.


     161     WIDE ON THE HARBOR                                   161

          The Amity Police Boat, Brody, Ellen and Hendricks aboard, is
          headed under full power out to sea.  Hendricks is pumping the
          horn, warning boats out of the way, ignoring the rules of the
          road; as small boats scatter out of the way, we can see the
          ambulance, red light flashing, pushing out slowly through the
          crowd at dockside.

                                        CUT TO


     162     ABOARD THE AMITY POLICE BOAT - DAY                         162

          As they clear the harbor mouth, Brody is on the radio, Ellen
          is crouching in the shelter of the deckhouse, Hendricks is
          steering.

                            BRODY
                  Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol, over.

                       (filtered)
                  Harbor Patrol.  Is that you, Brody?

                            BRODY
                  Affirmative.  Can you get your
                  chopper airborne?

                            PATROL VOICE
                  10-4, in a few minutes.  He's down
                  checking a buoy in the Bay Channel.

                            BRODY
                  Get him the hell over to Amity Point,
                  the old lighthouse.  Right now.

                            PATROL VOICE
                  What for?

                            BRODY
                  There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing
                  that way.  Turn them back to port.

                            PATROL VOICE
                  That's it?

                            BRODY
                  That's it.  Just do it, all right?

                            PATROL VOICE
                  10-4,   soon as I can raise him.

                            BRODY
                  If they're not at the light, look
                  for them.  I don't want them out
                  there.  Get them back to port!

                            PATROL VOICE
                       (exasperated)
                  Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the
                  Kids day-sailing back to port.  I
                  heard you.  Patrol out.

          As Brody's eyes sweep the horizon anxiously, Hendricks pours
          it on, and the police boat surges forward.

     162-A     EXT. OCEAN - DAY - KIDS SAILING                              162-A

          Donnie and Denise and Susie are sailing close to each other.

                            DONNIE
                  Hungry?

                            DENISE
                  Starving.  Let's go eat now.

                       (shouting to
                       Susie)
                  We're going in to eat!

          She nods agreement, their boats veer off from the rest and
          head towards the lighthouse.

     163     ANGLE ON THE SIZZLER                                   163

          as it sails close to the Green Machine.

                            LARRY
                  Hey!  Brody!  Want to race?

                            MIKE
                       (confident)
                  Sure.

                            LARRY
                  How about a side bet to make it
                  interesting?

                            JACKIE
                  That's fun!  Let's race for some-
                  thing!

                            MIKE
                  Name it.

                            LARRY
                  Loser sails home alone.

                            ANDY
                       (aside to Mike)
                  You're betting what you already got.

                            MIKE
                  I don't care.

                            JACKIE
                  I love it.

                            ANDY
                  Sure you do -- you win either way.

                            JACKIE
                       (simply)
                  I'm supposed to.

                            LARRY
                  It's a bet.  Once around the marker
                  buoy?

                            MIKE
                  That's the pin -- the buoy.

          Larry is confident -- he's got the air, but Mike suddenly
          gybes without warning, snapping onto a new fast tack, down-
          wind.  Larry and Bob are caught by surprise, and lose precious
          moments as they fumble with their sails.

                            ANDY
                       (pulling away)
                  Turkeys!  Eat wind!

                            MIKE
                  Yee-hah!

          He pounds with glee on the canvas trampoline as their boat
          moves ahead, a drumming sound.


     163-A     UNDERWATER                                        163-A

          The twin hulls of a catamaran's hull, the muffled, eerie
          sound of drumming, as the water carries the tempting "thud-
          thud-thud" sound down to the deep.


     164     ANGLE ON DOUG IN HIS INFLATABLE                              164

          falling behind as the boats change course for the marker
          buoy, following Larry and Mike's lead.

                  Hey!  Wait for the H.M.S. Invincible!

          Brooke and Timmy sail by him, laughing; Polo with them.

                  Mike and Larry are racing!
                  Loser goes home alone!

                  If we beat them, they can both go
                  home stag!  Single-O!  Alone!
                  Jackie can come back in this boat!

                       with a rope)
                  Your ass I will.  Besides, the
                  wind's turning with the tide.
                  Sailing back is going to be a bitch.

          It's the chopper's point of view, as the Harbor Patrol copter
          from the Cape flies towards the Kids, following Brody's
          previous instructions.  He sees the sailboats and fly that way.

          It approaches the sailboats, losing altitude fast, rotor
          blades chuffing up a storm.

          The Pilot has his microphone to his lips, and his voice is
          blaring down at them.

                  This is the Harbor Patrol.  Return

     171     THE BOATS                                        171

          The Kids look at each other, some coming about awkwardly,
          others luffing, wondering what this is all about.

                  We better go back in.

                            ANDY
                  It's not going to be easy.

                            JACKIE
                  What's wrong?

                            MIKE
                  We're fighting wind and current.
                  I though we'd be out longer, catch
                  the incoming tide.

                            ANDY
                  Putz -- that won't be for hours.

                            MIKE
                  I was counting on hours.

                            CHOPPER (v.o.)
                  Return -- to -- port.

                            MIKE
                  We're trying, we're trying.

          He waves acknowledgement, and puts about.  The others take
          their cue from him, and set a rough course back, but without
          much success.

                  Heading back?

                  Might as well.

          Polo, Timmy and Brooke, Marge and Sean.  They see the faster
          catamarans come about and try to beat back.

                  They're turning around.

                            LUCY
                  Coming about, then.

                            SEAN
                  Are we going back?

                            MARGE
                  Going to try.  Lighthouse, everybody....

          She puts about, the three of them start back towards the
          lighthouse, not making much headway.  Doug's inflatable is
          the slowest, and he is now, by virtue of his position, at the
          head of the line beating back towards the island.

          He rigs a little foot pump, and begins thumping away, trying
          to breath air back into the raft.

     183     Rushing through the seas under full power.  About three               183
          hundred yards ahead, a small, seemingly empty sailboat;
          Ed and Tina's Sandpiper.  Further off, a day-sailing power
          cruiser, sport fishing.

                            ELLEN
                  Michael?

                            BRODY
                  It's not his boat.

          Hendricks maneuvers closer, slowing the engine, reversing in
          time to bring them alongside with a gentle bump.  Ellen
          watches apprehensively as Brody drops into the little boat.

                            ELLEN
                  Be careful....

                            HENDRICKS
                  Anything?

                            BRODY
                       (on the
                       Sandpiper)
                  Nope...

                       something)
                  Hold on....

          Brody moves around on the deck of the Sandpiper, until he
          discovers Tina, cowering in shock; a sudden revealing of a
          terrorized victim.

                            BRODY
                  Tina!

                            TINA
                  No!  It's still there!

                  What is it?  What's there?

                            TINA

                  I need a hand here....

          Hendricks has gotten a blanket, and he steps over, putting it
          over the shivering girl's shoulders.  Ellen comforts the girl.

                            ELLEN
                  Tina, baby...what is it?

                  I knew it.  I goddamn well told
                  them.

          He moves abruptly, stepping up onto the police launch, snapping
          on the radio, leaving Hendricks, Ellen and Tina on the sail-
          boat moored alongside.

                            BRODY
                  Amity Launch to Harbor Patrol.

                  This is Cape Patrol -- what is it,
                  Brody?  I heard you weren't chief
                  any more.

                            BRODY
                  Skip that.  What about those kids
                  out sailing?

                            COMMANDER (v.o.)
                  It's all okay -- Colby got to them.
                  They were turning back when he left
                  'em.

                            BRODY
                  He left them?

                            COMMANDER (v.o.)
                  Sure.  He's got work to do in Bay
                  Channel.

                            BRODY
                  Get him the hell back there!  We
                  got possible fatalities!  Brody
                  out....

          His eyes wild, Brody looks over at the Sandpiper, then scans
          the nearby waters with sudden tension.


     185     BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW                                   185

          Ellen and Hendricks comforting Tina on the Sandpiper.  Nearby,
          a big cabin cruiser casually trolling by.  Brody pulls the
          police boat's air horn, the cruiser's passengers look over,
          Hendricks and Ellen jump at the unexpected blast.


     185-A     ANGLE ON BRODY                                        185-A

                            BRODY
                  I'm going out there.

                            HENDRICKS
                  Hey -- you can't do that.

                            ELLEN
                  What is it?  What's the matter?

                            BRODY
                  Mike's out there.

          Brody starts the launch's motor, throwing clear the mooring
          line that ties the two boats together.

                            BRODY
                       (to Hendricks)
                  Get her in.  Get them both in.

                  ELLEN                  HENDRICKS
          Martin, please!               Chief, be sensible....

                            BRODY
                  Where are they?

                            HENDRICKS
                  About 10 degrees off your star-
                  board bow, take a heading leeward
                  of Sand Island, and lay her north
                  by northeast....

                            BRODY
                  Never mind that shit.  Just point.

          Hendricks complies.

                            HENDRICKS
                       (pointing)
                  See where Cable Junction is?  Look
                  to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's
                  it.

                            BRODY
                  Got it.

          And he kicks the engine into gear, moving the launch away and
          out toward the sea.

                            ELLEN
                  Come back!  Martin!

          He guns the engine as soon as he's clear.  Hendricks gives
          his jacket to a suddenly chilled Ellen, and hails the cabin
          cruiser, already changing course to pick them up, sounding
          its horn.

          Ellen stares after the receding boat.

                            ELLEN
                  My purse is on that boat.

          They are trying to beat back towards the lighthouse, fighting
          wind and tide.  Only Doug's inflatable, with its clumsy little
          motor, is making any headway.


     186-A     ANGLE ON DOUG                                        186-A

                  Pump up this boat!  And shave
                  that silly moustache!

          Pumping, steering, he's floundering along.


     187     UNDERWATER - MOVING TOWARDS THE SURFACE                         187

          The Shark has fixated on something -- one outlying shape, the
          easily identifiable outline of Doug's inflatable, thumping
          and putting.  It homes in on the sound.


     188     ANGLE ON DOUG AND THE KIDS                              188

          The other kids exchange banter with Doug in his raft, as he
          clowns for their benefit.

                            DOUG
                  England expects every man to do
                  his duty...You may fire when ready,
                  Gridley...Damn the torpedoes, full
                  speed ahead....

          Despite his pumping, the bulging patch bursts with a loud
          bang.

                            DOUG
                  Oh, shit.

                            ANDY
                  Someone pop your balloon?

                            DOUG
                  No problem, no problem.

                            JACKIE
                  Want a lifesaver?

                            MARGE
                  How about a skyhook?

                            DOUG
                  You sail your boat, I'll sail
                  mine.

          A fin rises partially, almost invisible to most of the kids,
          but Mike notices it, believing it to be a porpoise.

                            MIKE
                  Hey, Fetterman -- You got company.

                            DOUG
                  Company?  The place is a mess....

          Before anyone can react, the shape rises behind Doug, striking
          his raft a terrible blow.

                            DOUG
                  Whoops.

          Not making any headway themselves, they casually watch the
          class clown, wondering what he's up to this time.


     190     DOUG'S BOAT                                        190

          a distance from the rest.  It shakes, then blows up as big
          teeth grip it from below.  Doug goes flying into the drink.
          The Shark has the inflatable in his teeth, and is shaking it
          from side to side.  Doug's eyes bug out as he sees what's
          going on.  He begins treading water, backing away as fast as
          he can, waving his arm in the air frantically -- "pick me up,
          quick...."


     191     MIKE'S BOAT                                        191

                            MIKE
                  Doug's down!

          He sails to where Doug is being carried along by the current.
          The inflatable is a mess -- shredded rubber and dead engine;
          the Shark didn't like it.

                            ANDY
                  Doug!  This way!

          Doug carefully -- oh, so carefully -- strokes over to where
          Mike and Andy can pull him abroad.  Some of the others sail
          closer to get a look.

                            PATRICK
                  What was that about?

                            MARGE

                            LUCY
                  What was that?

                            LARRY
                  So much for the rubber duck.


     192     THE GROUP, DRIFTING TOGETHER                              192

          This incident hasn't yet touched them -- no one actually saw
          what it was, except Doug, who's never been serious about any-
          thing.  Until now.

                  A shark ate my boat.

                            BOB
                  Come on.

                            DOUG
                  I'm telling you, a goddamn shark
                  ate my goddamn boat!

                            ANDY
                  If he liked your boat, I got some
                  sneakers he'll love.

          There's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the
          remains of Doug's inflatable.  Some of those jagged rents
          could be made by teeth....

                            KIDS

                  ...Jeez -- what did that?...A
                  porpoise, maybe...Nah, killer whale
                  ...I think he snagged it...I hate
                  to pop his balloon...(Etc.)

          Doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward.
          Without warning, the Shark hits.  Screams, terror, confusion.
          Mike, Andy, Jackie into the water.


     194     CLOSE ON MIKE                                        194

          His head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over.


     195     ON THE GROUP                                        195

          Patrick and Lucy ram into Timmy's boat, locking into it,
          knocking Timmy into the water as Brooke screams.

          --  Larry's red cat rams and locks onto Mike's Tornado.

          --  Marge's boat capsizes, putting Sean and Marge into the drink.

          --  Marge scrambles up on the over-turned hull, pulling Sean up
              with her, just in time.

          --  Polo, under full sail, scoops Mike out of the water before
              the Shark can get to him.

          --  The Shark dips out of sight.

          As they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping
          together, Andy is the first to gain any composure.

                            ANDY
                  Raft up!  Raft 'em up!

          He reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls Timmy's Doughdish
          towards them, tying it off as it comes close.

                            LARRY
                  Tie off to your strongest point.

                            PATRICK
                  Anyone need an extra line?

          Polo has Mike and Timmy aboard his boat.   Timmy is looking up
          from examining Mike's dazed body.

                            TIMMY
                  Mike's bleeding!

                            ANDY
                  Can you sail?

                            POLO
                       (testing his rudder)
                  Yeah!  We'll take him in!

          He starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse, on a severe,
          but manageable tack.  Polo, Timmy, and the injured Mike sail
          towards safety, leaving the others behind.

          Tackle the job at hand, concentrating on survival.  Jackie
          is strangely quiet; things are out of control....

          clearly marked:  Amity Island, Amity Lighthouse, Cable
          Junction.  Brody's nervous finger traces an approximation
          of his course.  It fumbles, pauses, stops.

          Brody, looking up from his chart, scans the ocean.  Ahead is
          the Lighthouse, his immediate destination.  Out of sight to
          the right, Cable Junction, and beyond that, 2500 miles of
          cold Atlantic.  Brody looks up from his chart, and grabs the
          radio.

                  It's me.  Any fix on those Kids?

                            PILOT (v.o.)
                  Negative.  I'm still down.

                  For Christ's sake, get going!  I'm
                  all alone out here!

                            PILOT (v.o.)
                  Brody, I got to switch frequencies,
                  call my boss.  We'll meet you over

                  Where the hell is Francis Shoal?

          Static.  No answer.  Brody realizes something

          heavy swell, Brody very much alone at the helm.

          We can see Brody's boat approaching.  It slows as it nears the
          island.

                            BRODY
                  Shit.

          He puts the wheel over, slewing the boat around.  To the left
          --  the wrong way.

          towards the open sea.  Floating on the wreckage and tangled
          boats are:  Doug, Andy, Jackie, Patrick, Lucy, Larry, Bob,
          Brooke, Marge, and Sean.

                            LARRY
                  Anyone know what time it is?

          Larry, Bob, Patrick, and Lucy (the practiced sailors) ad lib
          equal dissatisfaction.

                            JACKIE
                  What's wrong?

                            BROOKE
                  Tide doesn't turn for three hours.

                            DOUG
                  Low tide at Cable Junction is
                  7:46 p.m.

                            ANDY
                  What'd you do?  Memorize the
                  tide tables?

                            DOUG
                  I can't help it  it sticks in
                  my mind.

                            BROOKE
                       (making light of it)
                  Anyone want to play charades?

          No one does.

                            PATRICK
                  As long as we're drifting, might
                  as well go with the flow.

                            ANDY
                  Not funny.

                            PATRICK
                  Three knot current?

                            LUCY
                  At least.  And an offshore wind.

                            SEAN
                  What's after Cable Junction?

                            BOB
                  The Atlantic.  Then Ireland.

                            JACKIE
                  Can't we stop?

          Silence from the group.

                            BROOKE
                  They're probably looking for us.

                            DOUG
                  What about the fish?

                            LARRY
                  Maybe it's gone.

                            DOUG
                  They tend to follow moving things.
                  Maybe it's following Polo and
                  Timmy.

          They consider this.

                            BROOKE
                  So all we have to do is land at
                  Cable Junction and wait.

                            PATRICK
                  First we got to get there.

                            LARRY
                  How're we going to do that floating
                  on this garbage...?

                            BOB
                  Anyone got another set of sails?

          The Kids scramble to rig whatever canvas is available.

                            SEAN
                  Is that big thing still out there?

                            MARGE

          Cable Junction, then, a mile or so ahead, the raft.


     210     THE RAFT                                        210

          More sail, some improvised rigging, Patrick and Lucy trimming
          what there is, trying to steer the clumsy contraption.  From
          afar, the distant sound of an approaching chopper.

                            LARRY

          The Kids react with enthusiasm to the arrival of the rescue
          chopper.

                  Don't everyone jump around!

          But they ignore him.  The copter is descending.

          A one-man light spotter; the space next to the pilot cluttered
          with tools and floats, lashed in place.  Below, seen through
          the plastic bubble, the raft growing larger as the chopper
          sets down.

          The helicopter is creating a lot of turbulence as it sets
          down, a huge circular pattern of prop-wash on the surface as
          the rotors slow to a halt.  The Kids are waving and jubilant.

          pontoon; he speaks through a bullhorn.

                            PILOT
                  Everyone okay?  Any injuries?

          The Kids ad-lib in the affirmative.

                            ANDY
                  Can you put us on Cable Junction?

                            PILOT
                  I got no room for passengers.

                            ANDY
                  How about a tow?  Can you rig that?

          The Pilot nods.  Larry heaves a line to him, the Pilot catches
          it and makes it fast to a convenient tie-off on the under-
          carriage.

                            LARRY
                  As soon as you get us on the island,
                  you got to call in.  My dad's the

          The other Kids all chime in, adding their ad-lib shouts
          describing what happened, calling for help, etc.  It's all
          a noisy jumble, the Pilot ignores it, trying to do his job.

          Kids.

                            PILOT
                  Listen.  I'm going to give you an
                  assist to get you on Cable Junction.
                  Then I'll call in, and get the Coast
                  Guard to send a cutter.  Hang on to
                  something.

          He climbs into his bubble, shuts the door, gives the Kids a
          "thumbs up," and starts the engine.

          as it starts to lift, inexplicably.  The Pilot reacts as;


     220     THE SHARK                                        220

          attacks one of the pontoons, biting down on it, clamping
          great scarred jaws onto the bulbous floats.


     221     THE RAFT                                        221

          --  Pilot's hands jerked on the delicate controls.

          --  Med. shot, copter shaking.

          --  Closeup engine and gas tanks, rotor head spinning.

          --  Med. closeup Pilot in buffeting cockpit.


     223     RAFT AND COPTER                                        223

          The Kids watch, horror-stricken, as the giant Shark hangs
          on the roaring copter; in the b.g., Cable Junction is loom-
          ing closer.  The copter tilts dangerously, the Shark bites
          deeper, harder.


     224     ANGLE ON THE COPTER                                   224

          as it tilts.  Then, the unspeakable -- the blades touch the
          water and explode.  Chunks of murderous steel break off the
          shattered blades and whistle through the air like projectiles.


     225     THE KIDS                                        225

          reacting, ducking in terror.  Huge chunks of disintegrating
          rotors are flying all around.  Masts and sails left standing
          before are chopped into a deadly salad.  Screams.


     226     LOW IN THE WATER                                   226

          as blades skip and crash, the bubble of the overturned
          copter, Pilot trapped inside, sinks into the sea.


     227     THE COPTER COCKPIT - UNDERWATER                              227

          Pilot struggling with his safety harness, trying to hit
          switches, working on instinct.  Some air in the bubble,
          but water too, and sparks as electrical connections short
          out and burn.

          Then, the Shark, powering out of the murk.


     228     ANGLE ON THE PILOT - UNDERWATER                              228

          as grim death batters at his fragile bubble.  Screaming.
          The bubble cracks.  Water floods, teeth snap at the slippery
          plastic, the Pilot fumbles for oxygen as the Shark veers off
          into the murk.


     229     ON THE SURFACE - THE RAFT                              229

          The Kids, reacting as the broken copter sinks beneath the
          waves.  Calm for a moment, then:

                            LARRY
                  Look out!

                            JACKIE
                       (screams)
                  No-o-o-o!

          The Shark reappears, and batters at the raft.


     230     SHARK ATTACK                                        230

          The raft shudders, and begins to break up under the pounding.
          The Kids cling for their lives to masts and wreckage.
          Marge's overturned hull is struck a fierce blow from beneath.

                            SEAN
                  Help!

          He and Marge topple into the water.

                            ANDY
                  Don't struggle!

          Sean is bobbing in his life-vest, Marge strokes to be near
          him.

          Then, the fin, and the massive bulk of the killer, heaving
          up through the waves.

                            MARGE
                  Sean!

          She heaves him up out of the water, hurling him with des-
          peration towards the safety of the floating hull.

          screaming, hands and feet scrabbling like a monkey as he
          struggles for a grip on the slippery surface.  Behind him,
          Marge helping as much as she can from the water.  Then,
          behind her;


     233     THE SHARK                                        233

          rising like grey doom, then dropping out of sight.  Marge
          is gone.


     234     UNDERWATER                                        234

          Marge ducking under the bulk of the Shark, shoving off with
          panicky reserves of strength, swimming away underwater,
          while the Shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a sub-
          merged hull.

          Follow Marge as she swims.

          Huddled in the cracked plastic bubble, the Pilot is sucking
          air from his oxygen tank.  He sees Marge, and slips out of
          his bubble, headed for her.


     234-B     MARGE                                             234-B

          as the Pilot overtakes her -- a moment of horror, as she
          thinks the Shark has found her, then relief, as the Pilot
          motions to the bubble, and indicates "Air."  She follows
          him.


     234-C     MARGE AND THE PILOT                                   234-C

          scuttling like two crabs into the shelter of the broken
          chopper, buddy breathing as he passes her the oxygen tube.
          The chopper tilts, and moves, breaking up on the bottom as
          currents move it.  They struggle silently.


     234-D     ANGLE ON THE CHOPPER                                   234-D

          as it slips across the bottom, the current pulling it,
          broken parts breaking off in slow motion, dirty swirls of
          oil and hydraulic fluid clouding the water.

          A parallel struggle for survival, as the current separates
          Sean from the other Kids; Marge is gone, the little boy is
          clinging alone to the free-floating Lightening.

                            PATRICK

     234-F     ON THE SURFACE - A DISTANCE AWAY                         234-F

          Copter wreckage is bubbling up from underneath, like a sub-
          marine destroyed by depth charges; an oil slick, pieces of
          broken blade, a seat cushion, then, suddenly, the Pilot,
          and Marge, almost choked to death, their air run out.  They
          cling to a section of pontoon, panting, looking around with
          oxygen-starved eyes.

          They are alone on the ocean; a half-mile away, the distant
          sails of the broken raft, and the low-lying shape of Cable
          Junction.  Safe, for now....

          He throttles down, and the boat slumps in the water.  He
          looks around, sees nothing, in all directions.  He hits his
          radio.

          Sean is crying on his isolated perch, clinging to the upturned
          keel.  The other Kids are throwing a rope, trying to get him
          back.  Patrick heaves, and misses.

                  Sean, baby, please....

          Sean is ignoring the efforts to rescue him, paralyzed by fear,
          he shivers alone.  Jackie is near catatonia herself, Brooke
          and Doug trying to soothe her.

                  It killed her.  It ate her.

                  Goddamn it, Sean, you listen to me

                  We're throwing a rope and you better
                  catch it, hear?

          Sean nods.  The other Kids are encouraged.  The rope is thrown
          -- it misses.

                            ANDY
                       (to Bob)
                  Keep an eye out for that fish.

          Bob climbs to a vantage point, watching.

                            LARRY
                  Throw it.

                            ANDY
                  Sean!  Catch it!

          Another miss.  In his haste to help, Larry overreaches to
          fish the trailing rope out of the water, and falls headlong
          into the sea.  Shrieks of fright from the others.

          He scrambles out, hardly wet, that's how fast he's moving.

          Finally -- Patrick takes the crucial throw, and the rope
          practically knocks Sean off his perch, but he clutches and
          holds it.  As Andy carefully calls instructions, Sean secures
          the rope and the others carefully, carefully begin to pull
          him in.

          unless they can slow down or alter course, they will miss it.

     243     BRODY'S POLICE BOAT - DAY                              243

          He is rounding a sand bar off the lighthouse when he looks
          ahead and sees the bright sails of some of the survivors'
          boats.

                            BRODY
                  Thank Christ.

          He puts the helm over and heads for them.

     244     EXT. OCEAN NEAR LIGHTHOUSE - DAY                         244

          Polo's sloop is beating back towards the harbor when the
          police launch bears down, Brody leaning on the air horn.
          The Kids signal and wave.

                            POLO
                  Over here!  Yo!

                            BRODY
                  I'm coming alongside!

          The launch slows clumsily.  Timmy gets a line around a cleat,
          and pulls them fast.

                            BRODY
                  Mike?  Is that you?

                            MIKE
                  Pop.  I'm sorry.

                            BRODY
                  It's okay.  What happened?

                            POLO
                  A shark hit us out there.

                            TIMMY
                  Mike got knocked over.

          Brody goes for his radio, to report in, to call for help.

                            MIKE
                  I passed out, but I'm okay.

                            BRODY
                  At least you're safe.  What about
                  the others?

          The three boys look at each other.

                            BRODY
                  Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What
                  about the others?

                            MIKE
                       (tears in
                       his eyes)
                  Sean's still out there.

                            BRODY
                  What?

          He stops in his tracks, radio forgotten.
          heartsick.

          Mike goes on,

                            MIKE
                  He wanted to come.  It was okay,
                  wasn't it?  It was okay before....

                            POLO
                  The others are ratted together.
                  Drifting.

                            BRODY
                  Which way?

                            TIMMY
                  With the current.  Towards Cable
                  Junction.

          Brody jerks the mooring line holding them together, freeing
          it.  He starts for his controls, obsessed.

                            MIKE
                  Dad, I'm sorry....

                            BRODY
                  Stay here.  Don't go anywhere.
                  Just stay here.

          He indicates the lighthouse, then guns his engine.

                            BRODY
                  Stay at the lighthouse!

          He roars off, headed towards Cable Junction.

          approaching Cable Junction the rafted boats are
          drifting towards the Cable Junction.  Larry, Patrick and Andy are
          working on improvised tiller lines to a jury rudder made out
          of wreckage.  Lucy has another line out to a sea anchor, trying
          to slow their drift.

                            ANDY
                  Bring her to port a little.  That's
                  it -- steady.

                            DOUG
                  I think we're changing course a
                  little.

                            BROOKE
                  Can we land on it?

                            LUCY
                  If we can get to it.

                            ANDY
                  More to port.

                            DOUG
                  The wind drift is lateral.

                            LARRY
                  What's that mean?

          The group subsides, only Jackie is left, keening to herself.
          There's a distant sound of a boat's engine.  Bob spots it
          first, and waves.

          The others follow his pointing finger.

          in the boat, coming up on the Kids fast.  He throttles back,
          his bow wave almost swamping them as he slides past.

                            ANDY
                  Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!

                            DOUG
                  Back down!

          Brody fumbles with the throttle, manages to hold his boat
          steady between the raft and Cable Junction island.

                            LARRY
                  We're hung up here.  Snagged.

                            BOB
                  Can you get us a line?

          Brody finds a coil of line, makes one end fast, then throws
          it to the Kids on the raft.  They catch it, and tie it off
          to a cleat.

                            DOUG
                  We got it!

                  Be careful.

          Brody throttles forward, the police boat shudders
          under the strain as the line goes taut.

          pop ---

                            ANDY
                  Whoa!

          Too late.  The cleat rips out, Brody's boat leaps forward.

                            DOUG
                  Come around again!


     254     ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT                                   254

          as he repositions; he's now between the raft and the island,
          preparing to throw his line.  He heaves, the Kids grab, they
          have it, they tie off again,

                            ANDY
                  Hang on, hang on -- we got it.

          Brody starts to pull the raft again, when:


     255     THE SHARK                                        255

          surfaces, and moves purposefully towards the gap that separates
          the police boat from the raft.  It lunges at Brody as it passes
          the launch; the fin hits the taut rescue line, snapping it.


     256     ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT                                   256

          Brody recoils in horror as the beast rushes past, he spins
          the wheel and hits the throttle, sending the launch hard to
          port.  Out of control, it runs up on the rocks of Cable Junction.


     257     INSIDE THE BOAT                                        257

          as it tips up on the rocks.  Brody falls, equipment and loose
          material breaks loose and falls.


     258     INSERT - THE RADIO                                   258

          shatters on the deck.

     260     THE KIDS ON THE RAFT                                   260

          Their horrified reactions.


     261     BRODY IN THE BOAT                                   261

          picks himself up, and staggers to the rail, sees his predica-
          ment.

                            BRODY
                  Hang on!

                            SEAN
                  Dad!  Dad!

                            BRODY
                  I'm okay, baby, I'm here.  It's
                  okay....

          He climbs over the rail, onto the slippery wet rocks, trying
          to get to where he can help.  The Shark patrols the gap,
          waiting.

                            BRODY
                  Can you get a line to me?


     262     ABOARD THE RAFT                                        262

          the Kids find some line.  Andy coils, and throws.


     263     CABLE JUNCTION - THE RAFT                              263

          Brady catches the Kids' line.  He heaves on it with all his
          might.  Nothing.  Jackie is hysterical, some of the other
          Kids are screaming.  The Shark's fin catches the taut line,
          it slides up and over, Brody and the Kids are nearly pulled
          into the water.  The raft doesn't budge.


     264     UNDERWATER                                        264

          the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck fast.


     265     CABLE JUNCTION - BRODY AND THE KIDS                         265

          He sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the
          towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral.
          The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to
          them.

          The shark rams their raft, impatient now.  Screams and
          scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the
          beast.  Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone.  Larry
          is lashing his big buck knife to a pole, an improvised weapon.


     266     ANGLE ON THE WINCH LINE                                   266

          Unattended, it drops into the water.


     267     THE KIDS                                        267

                            ANDY
                  Get the cable in!  Pull!

          They do, but now the winch cable is snagged under the surface.
          It comes taut, but doesn't budge.  Brody watches, helpless
          for the moment.

                            BRODY
                  Son of a bitch is stuck!


     268     BRODY                                             268

          climbs back onto the boat, starts the winch engine, trying
          to pull the cable free.


     269     THE SHARK                                        269

          on the offensive now, takes an outrigger pontoon, biting it,
          tearing it off the raft, shaking everything.


     270     ON THE RAFT                                        270

          the Kids react to this fresh attack.

                            DOUG
                  It's killing us!

                            JACKIE
                  I don't want to die!  Mommy!


     271     IN THE BOAT                                        271

          The winch smokes and stalls, the weight it's pulling almost
          too much.

                            BRODY
                  Come on, you bastard, come on,
                  pull.  Pull!


     272     THE RAFT                                        272

          bursts apart from the center as the Shark lunges up through
          the canvas trampoline of the Sizzler.  The Kids, screaming,
          fall into the water as the attack forces the fragile structure
          into pieces.  Only Sean, Brooke, and Jackie are left on the
          remaining segment.


     272-A     ANGLE ON BRODY                                        272-A

          watching the destruction, seeing Sean practically alone in
          the water.

                            BRODY
                  Sean!  Hang on!

          He looks around the deck frantically, spots a rubber emer-
          gency inflatable in its case.  He wrestles it off its brackets,
          and breaks the seals urgently.  He hits the auto-inflate.

     272-B     BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN                              272-B

          alone on the raft, Brooke and Jackie helpless nearby, the
          other Kids flailing in the water.  The huge bulk of the
          Shark, fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion.


     273     OMITTED                                             273


     274     IN THE WATER                                        274

          While Brody inflates the rubber raft and throws it in the
          water, the Kids scramble for safety, swimming for their
          lives.  Each one is sure this moment is going to be his last.

                            ANDY
                  Get on the rocks!

                            DOUG
                  Swim for it!

          Andy is pulling himself towards the boat, scrambling up on
          the exposed wooden hull.

                            PATRICK
                  Lucy!  Look out!


     275     ANGLE ON LUCY AND BOB                                   275

          As she looks over her shoulder and screams -- the monster is
          sliding past her, intent on Bob.  The rough hide scrapes her,
          tearing her clothes, leaving raw bleeding lacerations on her
          torso.

                            LUCY
                  I'm bleeding!

          Larry and Patrick help her towards the rocks.

                            BOB
                  Help!

          He's clinging to a piece of broken boat; the Shark lunges at
          him.


     276     INSERT - WINCH                                        276

          grinding, smoking, hauling something out of the water --
          heavy, slimy, dripping metal cable, the main powerline from
          the mainland!


     277     BRODY IN THE WATER                                   277

          paddling the raft towards Sean with desperate strokes, heed-
          less of the danger around him.

                            BRODY
                  Hang on!  Just hang on!

          He fights to see in the gathering gloom.  Suddenly, a strange
          glare snaps on, then more illumination, in a series of es-
          calating clicks.


     277-A     CABLE JUNCTION                                        277-A

          silhouetted against the evening sky.  Automatic timers are
          turning on navigation and worklights, illuminating the barren
          rocks and rusty steel with their glare -- throwing dark shad-
          ows, putting the surrounding water into black limbo by their
          contract.



     278     ANGLE ON BRODY                                        278

          straining to see what's going on.  Looking for his son.

                            SEAN  (o.s.)
                  Dad!  Help!  Daddy!

                            BRODY
                  I'm coming!

          He looks around desperately, sees Andy safe on the launch.

                            BRODY
                  Andy!  Use the lights!  The lights!


     278-A     ANGLE ON ANDY                                        278-A

          soaked, clinging to the rail of the launch, hearing Brody,
          fumbling in the cabin, turning on worklights, the boat
          throwing erratic shafts of powerful light from its many
          lamps and searchlights.  Andy grabs one and sweeps the
          water with it, trying to help.

                            ANDY
                  Where are you?  Chief!

          His light pokes and sweeps through the gloom.

     278-B     BRODY IN THE WATER                                   278-B

          He hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking,
          as the raft pounds to pieces on the rocks.  He is blinded
          by the sweeping searchlight, the confusion of terror-stricken
          teen-agers screaming.  It's the middle of The Inferno.


     278-C     BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN                              278-C

          Sean, standing up, reaching out to him, the Shark hitting
          his fragile perch, Sean tumbling backwards, towards what
          seems to be certain death.

                            BRODY (o.s.)
                  Sean!


     278-D     ANGLE ON BRODY                                        278-D

          as he hurls his paddle at the Shark, anything to get even,
          to distract it.

                            BRODY
                  You bastard!

          He looks around him wildly, searching for a weapon, finding
          a steel boathook.  He screams at the unfeeling Shark....

                            BRODY
                  Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!

          The huge gray hulk obligingly turns towards this new irrita-
          tion.  Brody bangs on the raft, yelling, creating a commotion.
          The Shark speeds towards him


     279     THE SHARK                                        279

          lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing
          at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it
          passes....


     279-A     ANGLE ON THE STERN OF THE POLICE BOAT                         279-A

          Brody is drifting close to the cable, drawn heavy and wet
          cut of the water.  He reaches up to it.


     279-B     ANGLE ON BRODY                                        279-B

          dangling his feet in the water, holding onto the cable,
          seeing it, inspired with a lunatic idea....

                            BRODY
                  Over here!  You bastard!  Over here


     280     THE SHARK                                        280

          turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its
          scar glistening wet and terrible.  It heads for Brady.

     280-A     BRODY                                             280-A

          possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs.

                            BRODY
                  Come and get me!  Come and get me!


     280-B     THE SHARK                                        280-B

          attacking.  Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the
          way in life-or-death spasm.  The great jaws close, fastening
          onto the thick cable.  Shaking it.  The cable resists for a
          moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack
          open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure --
          then the live copper core is reached.  Zap!


     281     THE SHARK                                        281

          dying.  Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of
          volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea.  Hot
          white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks,
          sputters, and dies.


     282     BRODY                                             282

          watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when
          the shark hit the cable.  It's strangely silent.  The lights
          on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut
          down the mains, protecting the line.  Only the boat's work-
          lights provide light now.

                            BRODY
                  Sean?

          No answer.  Water lapping at the rocks, some Kids sobbing
          quietly.  Brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of
          the raft, expecting the worst....


     282-A     ANGLE ON THE WRECKAGE                                   282-A

          Timmy's Doughdish, where we last saw Sean.  There's a scrab-
          bling from inside, and Sean appears, soaked, from under
          the seat where he'd fallen.

                            SEAN
                  Dad?

          Brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking Sean
          onto his raft.  They paddle back towards the rocks.


     283     THE ISLAND                                        283

          with the Kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks;
          they're wet, scared, exhausted, but safe.  Sean hugs his
          daddy as they step onto land.

                            SEAN
                  They made me go with them.

                            BRODY
                  Sure they did....

          He kisses the damp forehead.

                                        DISSOLVE TO


     284     EXT. AMITY HARBOR - DAY                                   284

          A crowd of worried parents and adults, Ellen and Hendricks in
          the forefront, are staring towards the harbor mouth.  It's
          dawn and the sun is rising.  They see something, a cheer
          goes up.


     285     ANGLE ON THE WATER                                   285

          A big Coast Guard cutter is steaming into the harbor, a little
          group of survivors on the foredeck.


     286     CLOSE ON THE CUTTER                                   286

          Brody and the surviving Kids wave to their families on land.


                                        FADE OUT

                                        ROLL END CREDITS.
