<b>                                BLADE : TRINITY
</b>

        Over darkness a WOMAN'S VOICE speaks to us.


<b>                                ABIGAIL (V.0.)
</b>                     Italo Calvino once said that myth is the
                     hidden part of every story, the buried
                     part, the region that is still unexplored
                     because there are as yet no words to
                     enable us to get there.
                          (beat)
                     But I was there for the end.  I took part
                     in it.  And I think my words can help shed
                     light on what happened.  My name is
                     Abigail.  This is our story.


<b>            FADE IN:
</b>

<b>            EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAWN
</b>

            Harsh sunlight beats down over a bleak, unforgiving stretch of
            rocky desert.  Amidst this desolation rise the ruins of an
            ancient Sumerian ziggurat, a massive stepped pyramid of mud
            brick that was once the center of the city known as Ur.


<b>            SUPER TITLE:	SOUTHEASTERN IRAQ, DHI QAR PROVINCE
</b>

<b>                                    SIX MONTHS AGO
</b>

<b>            AN EMACIATED SHEEP HERDER
</b>

            kneels by the ziggurat, tending to a ragged band of sheep.  He
            is conducting the first of his daily prayers, listening to a
            religious broadcast from Baghdad on a tinny RADIO.


            Presently, we hear HELICOPTERS.  The sheepherder looks up --


<b>            TWO ANERICAN RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTERS
</b>

            approach from the East.  They touch down near the base of the
            ziggurat, rotors stirring up clouds of dust.


<b>            FOUR FIGURES
</b>

            disembark, their bodies covered in desert camo-gear.  They
            wear helmets with polarized face-plates and are armed to the
            teeth.  To the sheepherder they might as well be aliens.


            One of the figures turns to the East.  We can see the rising
            sun reflected in the face-plate of his helmet -- and a hint of
            a skull-like under-mask/respirator beneath the face-plate. He
            raises a gloved hand, gives the "finger" to the new day.


            Another figure (a woman) waves a hand, urging them onward.
            They mount the central steps of the ziggurat.


<b>            INT. ZIGGURAT - SHRINE - DAY
</b>

            The shrine is empty.  The woman activates a wearable computing
            device, calling up a schematic of the ziggurat.


            She kneels, studying the floor.  In the corner of the room she
            identifies a particular brick and presses it.  We hear hidden
            COUNTER-WEIGHTS shifting and the floor opens up --


            -- revealing a stone stairway leading down.


<b>            INT. ZIGGURAT - STAIRWAY - DAY
</b>

            Dark.  Sepulchral.  Spooky.  The figures descend into --


<b>            INT. ZIGGURAT - BURIAL VAULT - DAY
</b>

            -- an empty room with an earthen floor.  The sunlight from
            above barely penetrates down here.  One of the figures takes
            out a battery--powered lantern, turning it on, illuminating --


            -- walls covered with CUNEIFORM WRITING.  The male figure who
            flipped off the sun speaks via radio headset.


<b>                                MALE FIGURE
</b>                     That's great. We've got dick.
                          (turning to the others)
                     Is there any reason we had to embark on
                     this cluster-fuck during the day?


            The woman removes her helmet.  This is DANICA TALOS.  A
            vampire.  Intense, appearing to be in her 30s.  Possessing a
            regal air.  She wears a silver crucifix around her neck.


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     Night-time's too tricky, Grimwood. You
                     know that.


            One by one, the others remove their helmets.  All vampires:


            GRIMWOOD (30s), a hulking vampire with an imposing physique
            and an even more imposing set of surgical steel teeth/fangs.


            ASHER (4Os), a natural-born leader with easygoing charisma.


            WOLFE (30s), quiet and deliberative.  Right now he's readying
            a portable ground-penetrating radar unit.


            Grimwood studies the writing on the walls.


<b>                                GRIMWOOD
</b>                     What is this chicken-scratch?


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     Cuneiform. Dates back about four
                     thousand years.


<b>                                GRIMWOOD
</b>                     So why here?


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     Because this was the cradle of
                     civilization.  He would've been
                     comfortable here.


<b>                                ASHER
</b>                     I don't know, Dan.  Seems like another
                     dead-end.


<b>                                WOLFE
</b>                     I'm not so sure --


            Wolfe looks at his unit, excited.  The others gather round.


<b>                                WOLFE
</b>                     There's something beneath us.


<b>            ON WOLFE'S RADAR UNIT
</b>

            We see a cross-section image of the soil and subsurface
            features beneath them.  SOMETHING has been buried down there.


<b>                                ASHER
</b>                     Is that a body --?


            Wolfe makes a few adjustments on the unit.  The image resolves
            further.  It's definitely a BODY.  Then, we hear the low
            RUMBLING of more hidden counter-weights and --


<b>            A SLAB OF STONE
</b>

            slides down from above the stairs, sealing off the vault.


<b>                                GRIMWOOD
</b>                     What the fuck --?!


            Grimwood pounds his fist against the stone.  It's solid.  He
            tries to find a hand-hold, tries to shoulder it open in some
            way, but the barrier is unmovable.  They're trapped.


<b>                                ASHER
</b>                     Radio back-up.  See if they can open it
                     from the other --


<b>                                WOLFE (0.S.)
</b>                     Guys?


            Wolfe points at the ground.  A tiny depression has formed,
            with sand funneling into it.


            Wolfe sets his radar unit down and kneels before the hole. 
            The grains of sand are falling faster now, the depression
            gradually widening.  Curious, Wolfe leans closer --


<b>            A CLAWED, ARMORED HAND
</b>

            suddenly EXPLODES upward from the ground.  It latches onto
            Wolfe's neck.  dragging him down head-first!


            Wolfe THRASHES, his head still buried beneath the sand.  He
            knocks over the lantern, which FLICKERS, shorting out.


            Asher rushes to Wolfe's side.  Then Grimwood.  They grab Wolfe
            by the shoulders, SCREAMING, trying to pull him back.


            Asher is KICKED by Wolfe's thrashing legs.  He flies upward,
            hits the ceiling, falls back onto the ground, stunned --


            Danica joins Grimwood.  Abruptly, they wrest Wolfe free --
            headless.  BLOOD erupts from the sand.  Then --


<b>            A HELLISH CREATURE
</b>

            unearths itself, ROARING.  It's difficult to make out in the
            flickering light.  But what we do see is terrifying.  Spiked,
            demonic armor, clutching a sword.  An elongated, helmeted face
            with a blood-splattered set of hinged fangs -- hinting at an
            inhuman physiognomy within.  The hinged jaws open, coming at
            us.  And just as the lantern goes out for good we --

</b>

<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b>

            Danica moves down a modern architectural corridor lined in
            glass and steel.  VAMPIRE SOLDIERS stand ready nearby,
            outfitted in body armor, clutching automatic rifles.


<b>            AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR
</b>

            Asher, Grirnwood, and another vampire, HENDRIX are gathered by
            a titanium door outfitted with a biometric security system.


            Danica joins them, studying a VIDEO MONITOR which offers a
            darkened view of the interior of the vault.  We can just make
            out a FIGURE sitting there in the shadows.


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     What's he been doing?


<b>                                ASHER

                     brought him here.

</b>                     Hendrix, if he wanted to out of there -
                     there isn't an army in the world that
                     could keep us safe.  We didn't capture
                     him.  He allowed us to take him in.  You
                     understand?
                          (nodding to the door)
                     Now open up.


            The others look at her like she's insane.  Nevertheless,
            Danica places her hand on the biometric scanner.  Hendrix keys
            in a series of commands on a nearby computer console.  The
            vault doors open with a HUM, allowing Danica into --


<b>            AN AIRLOCK-STYLE VESTIBULE
</b>

            She steps inside.  The vault closes behind her.  We hear
            BLOWERS as the air is cycled.  A SECOND SET OF DOORS open --

            Danica steps into a nearly pitch-black "clean room".  We hear
            BREATHING.  Despite her calm demeanor, she's frightened.


            From the darkness, SOMEONE SPEAKS -- a voice low and rumbling,
            laced with an ominous gravity.

                     "My people".  You think I'm your messiah?
                     Your Savior?


            We hear MOVEMENT.  A pair of RED EYES pierce the gloom -- and
            God help us, even though he remains partially shadowed, this
            guy has to be the scariest mother-fucker we've ever seen.

</b>                     What makes you think I wanted to be
                     brought back?


            A hand emerges from the darkness, armored.  Danica wants to
            bolt.  Instead, she fights to keep herself from flinching as a
            taloned finger brushes her throat.


<b>                                DANICA

            WHOOSH!  The vault doors open and Danica stumbles out, all but
            falling into Asher's arms.  She's bone-white and there are
            fresh BITE MARKS on her throat, BLOOD staining her shirt.

</b>                     Tonight, Dr. Edgar Vance, forensic
                     psychiatrist and author of the New York
                     Times best seller "Human Health: The Whole
                     Being Breakthrough".  Also with us is
                     Martin Vreede, Chief of Police.  They're
                     here for an hour and they'll take your
                     calls.  Next on Larry King Live.


<b>            INT. LARRY KING LIVE - STUDIO - NIGHT
</b>

            Taping is underway.  Larry King sits at his desk opposite
            EDGAR VANCE (40s), a smooth-talking pundit with a magnetic
            demeanor and movie star good looks.  CHIEF MARTIN VREEDE (50s,
            square-jawed), joins via remote feed.


<b>                                LARRY
</b>                     Dr. Vance -- you're a psychiatrist and a
                     biochemist, isn't that right?


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     Yes.  I've long believed that in order to
                     achieve true health, we have to reconcile
                     the body and the mind.  Of course that
                     also requires letting go of a lot of our
                     old notions and superstitions, which is
                     what my work is all about.


<b>                                LARRY
</b>                     Let's talk about that.  How do you account
                     for the fascination with things that go
                     bump in the night?  Movies, books,
                     videogames -- seems like we can't get
                     enough of our boogeymen?


            Vance leans forward, skillfully playing to the cameras.


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     Monsters provide a means for us to
                     transfer our more primal and darker urges
                     into something external.  In the case of
                     vampires, you're dealing with taboo issues
                     like predatory rage and sexual sadism. 
                     These are scary subjects for people to own
                     up to.


<b>                                LARRY
</b>                     So we pass the buck to someone else?


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     Exactly.  Historically, people suffering
                     from medical conditions have always been
                     our psychological scapegoats.  In the
                     Middle Ages schizophrenia was often
                     attributed to demonic possession.


<b>                                LARRY
</b>                     And vampires?


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     Well, there's a hereditary blood disease
                     known as porphyria that has symptoms
                     remarkably similar to the classic vampiric
                     traits.  People suffering from this
                     disease are anemic, they become sensitive
                     to sunlight, they can't tolerate garlic --


<b>                                LARRY
</b>                     Which is too bad, since my doctor tells me
                     that's good for the heart.
                          (turning to Chief Vreede)
                     Chief Vreede?  What's your take on all the
                     recent rumors we've been hearing about
                     vampires?


<b>                                VREEDE
</b>                     The only vampires I'm worried about are
                     the ones passing the bar exam.
                          (laughing)
                     Seriously, if vampires existed, don't you
                     think we'd be on to them by now?  The
                     truth is, our streets have never been
                     safer.  Homicides, assaults -- violent
                     crime is down across the board.  If people
                     want to be concerned, they should focus on
                     criminals like Blade.


<b>                                LARRY
</b>                     Now who's this?  Tell me about him.


<b>                                VREEDE
</b>                     He's a sociopath we've been pursuing.


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     Blade is a very disturbed individual. 
                     Even the name he's chosen for himself is
                     troubling.  According to witnesses, he
                     operates under the belief that a vast
                     conspiracy of vampires live amongst us. 
                     You have to look at the psychiatric
                     underpinnings here.  What does a person
                     like Blade really want? 
                     Odds are, he's really trying to work out
                     some kind of inner trauma.  He thinks he's
                     slaying monsters, but he's really trying
                     to murder aspects of himself.


            The sound of GUNFIRE pre-laps over from the next scene as we --

            goes tumbling into the night air.  Buoyed by the explosion,
            his body flies upward, trailing fire like a human comet.


            MORE MEN (VAMPIRES) race out, some of them on fire.

            as a FORMIDABLE FIGURE resolves out of the swirling flames. 
            It's Blade, striding towards us in slow-motion, body bristling
            with weapons, the exaggerated sounds of his FOOTFALLS ringing
            out like drums of doom.


            He looks like the God of War.  WHOOSH!  We ramp back up to
            real-time.  Then faster as --


            -- a TRIO OF VAMPIRE LOW-LIFES (STONE, GEDGE, and CAMPBELL)
            run for their lives towards their vehicles.  TWO MODIFIED
            STREET RACING CARS are pulling out; a Mustang and an Eagle
            Talon.  Gedge is climbing into the Talon even as it starts to
            move, pulling the door shut.  At the same time --


            -- Stone and Campbell climb atop two stretched and lowered
            hardtail chopper cycles.  Blade starts forward, drawing two of
            his custom MACH pistols, but --


            --	the Mustang comes SCREAMING IN REVERSE TOWARDS him!


            Blade makes a SUPER-HUMAN LEAP over the speeding car. 
            Momentarily upside down, he FIRES through the windshield and
            engine block as he flips.  Within the car, the vampires ASH.
            The Mustang EXPLODES.  flipping over and --

            Blade.  Call them EMOND, DOH, DENLINGER, and ELLINGSON.


            Blade holsters his MACH pistols.  Then reaches for a wicked
            looking CHAIN-KNIFE strapped to his thigh.  The knife has a
            button on either side of the hilt.  As Ellingson RUSHES him --


            -- Blade triggers the first button.  ZZZING!  The knife-blade
            ejects from the hilt, trailing outward six feet on a razored
            chain.  The blade penetrates Ellingson's chest.  He GASPS as
            he starts to ASH.  But before his disintegration is complete --


            -- Blade hits the second button.  The knife-blade retracts,
            the razored chain WHIRRING back into the knife-hilt.  Blade
            SPINS, triggers the first button again --


            The knife-blade FLIES OUT, the razored chain whipping around
            Denlinger's throat.  Blade tugs.  The razor chain cuts through
            Denlinoer's neck, decapitates him. As he ASHES --


            -- Blade triggers the knife again.  As it ejects, he whirls it
            over his head, making a sound like a BULL-ROARER.


            Blade drops low, swinging the razored chain.  The chain slices
            through Emond's legs.  Emond's amputated legs ASH, the rest of
            him tumbling onto the asphalt.  He SCREAMS.


            Blade retracts the knife-blade, whirls, THRUSTS it through
            Doh's abdomen. who was coming up from behind.  As Doh ASHES,
            Blade returns to Emond, finishing him off --


            -- and Blade is on the move again, RUSHING after the vampires
            who escaped.

            The bike-riding vamps cut across traffic, then SCREAM down an

<b>            BACK TO BLADE,

            sprinting from the parking lot to the sidewalk.  He touches a

            hauling a semi-trailer THUNDERS beneath the overpass, sounding
            its AIR HORN.  It has safety cables running along the

            -- snags one of the safety cables atop the trailer!  He
            dangles above the asphalt then SWINGS himself into the open
            back of the trailer.  We HOLD for a beat, then hear the

            ROCKETS out of the back of the trailer, sailing right over a
            car that was tail-gating the semi, heading into three lanes of
            on-coming traffic at fifty miles an hour!


            Blade hits the brakes, sending the battle-scarred muscle car
            into a spin, clipping other vehicles in the process.

            As cars continue to brake and COLLIDE around him, Blade puts
            the pedal to the metal once again.  The Charger accelerates,

            The Charger drops from a hundred to fifty in a heart beat,
            causing Stone and Campbell to rear-end Blade.


            The vamps are ejected over the handle bars of their bikes like
            crash-test dummies.  Stone SMASHES through Blade's back
            windshield, continuing into the front seat--


            -- while Campbell tumbles over Blade's roof and across his
            hood, somehow managing to cling to one of the windshield

            Blade clutches the wheel.  He's got a HOWLING vampire in the
            front seat, upside down, covered in windshield fragments and
            another perched on his hood, obscuring his vision.


            Stone tries to right himself, clawing at Blade.  Blade
            struggles, keeping one hand on the wheel while he --


            --	reaches for a shotgun secured between the seats.  He
            FIRES.  As the vampire ASHES, Blade hits a button on the dash.

            Blade swings his shotgun over, shoving it in Campbell's

            The Talon hits the curb, riding halfway up onto a sidewalk,

            -- but again, she seems to be alone.  Thoroughly frightened
            now, Abigail scoops up her grocery bags, turns to exit and --


            -- slams right into Dingo and Proof!  She GASPS.


<b>                                DINGO
</b>                     Hey, pretty lady.


<b>                                PROOF
</b>                     Sophisticated mama.


            Dingo and Proof reveal their fangs.  Abigail SCREAMS, runs --


            -- right into the arms of Flick and Squid!  They grab her,
            RIPPING the BabyBjorn carrier from her chest, SHOVING her back
            at Dingo and Proof.


            In seconds, Dingo and Proof have Abigail on the floor. 
            They're tearing away at her clothing, LAUGHING.


<b>                                DINGO

<b>            ON FLICK,
</b>

            removing the BABY from its carrier.  He holds the baby up -
            only it's not a baby.  It's a DOLL with the words "FUCK YOU!"
            written on its chest.  Flick is briefly confused --


            -- and then the baby doll EXPLODES, covering Flick's face with
            a cloud of GARLIC GAS!


            Flick recoils, retching, wiping at his burning face --


<b>                                FLICK
</b>                     --aghhk -- it's fucking garlic!


<b>            ON DINGO AND PROOF,
</b>

            looking back, alarmed.  Then Abigail pulls her knee to her
            chest.  A SILVER SPIKE springs out from the toe of her boot.


            She KICKS UP, imbedding the spike up through the underside of
            Proof's chin.  Proof ASHES.


            Before Dingo has a chance to act, Abigail gets him in a
            leglock, FLIPPING him back onto his ass.


<b>            ABIGAIL
</b>

            jumps to her feet, shedding her coat and hat.  Long tresses of
            hair spill around her shoulders.  She's not mousy at all.  In
            fact, she's beautiful.  And cut like an Olympic athlete.  And
            equipped with a walking arsenal of weapons.


            Dingo SNARLS -- CRUNCH!  Abigail plants her heel in his face,
            SMASHING IN his nose.  She does a cartwheel, KICKS him again.
            Follows that with flurry of PUNCHES.  He goes down as --


            -- Flick and Squid come charging!  Squid gets her in a CHOKE
            HOLD.  She FLIPS him over her shoulder, KICKING him in the
            nuts as he lands.  He curls up, GROANING --


            Abigail turns back to Flick, ELBOWING him in the throat --


            -- then returns to Squid, ejecting a SILVER THROWING KNIFE
            from a spring-loaded, automated dispenser strapped to her
            wrist.  She POPs the knife through Squid's chest.  He ASHES --


<b>            FOLLOWING ABIGAIL
</b>

            as she reaches behind her, removing a CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE
            secured to her back.  She holds the crescent in the center,
            the curve pointing away from her, gives it a twist and --


            CHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping
            outward into a three-foot long metal arc.  Connecting the two
            ends of the arc is a powerful, BUZZING UV LASER.


            Abigail LASHES OUT, lopping off Flick's arm.  His arm falls,
            ASHING.  Abigail swings the arc around, pushing it forward
            through Flick's mid-section like a cheese cutter --


            Flick literally falls apart, his upper torso sliding from his
            trunk, ASHING in the foreground, his burning particles falling
            away to reveal Abigail in the background --


            Dingo scrambles to his feet, running for his life.


            Abigail gives her UV arc a twist.  It retracts.  She secures
            it behind her back once again, unholsters a strange-looking
            "bloop" GUN with a large barrel.  She FIRES --


            A rapidly-expanding spherule of ANTI-PERSONNEL FOAM splatters
            against Dingo's legs, hardening instantly, tripping him up --


            Dingo goes down again.  He panics, trying to scrape the gunk
            off his legs, manages to get one of his hands stuck to the
            hardening mess in the process -- like a mouse in a glue-trap.


            Abigail calmly approaches.  She stands over Dingo, staring
            down at him with a look of cruel indifference.  She holsters
            her bloop gun, withdraws another SILVER STAKE --


<b>                                ABIGAIL

            -- and SLAMS the stake into his chest.


<b>            WIDEN OUT
</b>

            Abigail turns, surveying her work.  The ashen remains of the
            vampires are popping and crackling like campfire embers.  In
            thirty-seven seconds she's managed to eliminate them all.


            A train approaches, pulls into the station.  PASSENGERS
            disembark, flood the platform.  They tramp all over the ashes
            of the vampires, completely unaware of the recent slaughter.


            Abigail walks against the stream of traffic, boards the train. 
            She is the sole passenger as the train pulls away.


<b>            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - WHISTLER'S ROOM - NIGHT

            Whistler sits on a cot, contemplating the tarnished wedding
            ring on his hand.  He slowly spins it around his finger.


<b>            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BLADE'S ROOM - NIGHT

            Blade sits before a small Buddhist shrine, meditating. 
            Incense burns.  His sword rests in a ceremonial holder.  Near
            silence punctuated by the intermittent ocean swell outside.


<b>            CLOSE ON BLADE'S FACE
</b>

            We hear the SOUNDS OF VIOLENCE -- ECHOING SCREAMS, GUNSHOTS. 
            These are Blade's thoughts.  The inner demons he is constantly
            trying to tame.  The sounds CRESCENDO and --


            --	Blade opens his eyes.  He listens.  Something is wrong.


<b>            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT

            Blade creeps into the outer room, sword drawn.


            NOISE behind him, turns to see --

            standing in the shadows, clutching a handgun.

            They listen.  Just the sound of the ocean swell.  Then --


<b>            A WINDOW SHATTERS
</b>

            TWO ARMORED SWAT AGENTS lower in on rappelling lines. 


<b>            TWO MORE AGENTS
</b>

            CRASH through a bank of windows on either side, swinging in. 
            They FIRE cannisters of TEAR GAS.  As Blade moves to engage
            them, Whistler RUSHES into the heart of the armory --


            A reinforced door EXPLODES inward.  MORE AGENTS storm inside. 


<b>            FROM THE WATER,
</b>

            a military Zodiac (inflatable boat) roars up one of the wooden
            boat ramps, laden with gun-toting AGENTS.  They jump out,
            fanning all over the boat house.


            He hears a

            Whistler FIRES at them, then makes a run for it.  The agents
            RETURN FIRE, but Whistler ducks behind a concrete pillar --


<b>            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>

            Cop cruisers, unmarked cars, and SWAT trucks sweep in, SIRENS
            blaring, disgorging a small army of POLICE and FBI AGENTS.
            POLICE BOATS are pulling up to the dock.


<b>            AGENTS CUMBERLAND AND HALE

            emerge from an unmarked, wearing bullet-proof vests,
            brandishing firearms.  Cumberland barks orders into a radio.

            On the rooftops above, various SWAT SNIPERS take position.


<b>            INT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT

            Blade BRAWLS with a half-dozen agents, sending them flying in
            all directions.  He grabs one agent, HEAD-BUTTS him, THROWS
            him into the path of two others --


            Then he reaches for another, THROWING him THROUGH a window at
            the rear, out into the river which runs below --


<b>            ON WHISTLER
</b>

            as he moves with increased urgency.  The armory is filling up
            with tear gas.  Coughing and half-blind, he hurries to a bank
            of computers, types in a series of commands --


<b>            THE VARIOUS COMPUTER MONITORS
</b>

            around him synch up, showing the same protocol message:

            In response, a rack of network storage equipment and removable
            hard drives EXPLODES.  Then a second rack of equipment
            EXPLODES as well.


<b>            EXT. BLADE'S REFUGE - BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>

            From their vantage point below, Cumberland and the others can
            hear the explosions. Cumberland is on his radio, SHOUTING:

            Whistler keeps moving.  An agent gets a clear shot at him,
            FIRES -- Whistler is hit in the chest.


            Blade SEES Whistler take the hit, but he's cut off from the
            old man, being swarmed by agents --

            Whistler staggers, keeps moving.  He makes it to another bank
            of computers, launches the same protocol.


<b>            ON MORE MONITORS
</b>

            Erasing information, purging themselves.  We see commands:

                         --	Workstation 2 protection enabled


            With each successive command, the workstations themselves
            begin self-destructing, EXPLODING one after another.


            Another agent gets a bead on Whistler, FIRING a round into
            Whistler's thigh.  Whistler SCREAMS --

            in anguish as he sees his mentor being slaughtered.  Then two
            agents are RUSHING HIM, tackling Blade.  As one they fall

            CRASH!  The three of them come FLYING DOWN in a spray of
            glass, landing atop one of the police cruisers below.  The

            aim.  BA-BANG!  Four projectiles expand out from the barrel,
            carrying a STEEL NET which has been strung between them.


            The netting hits Blade, wrapping around him, restricting his
            movements.  Immediately, a small army of agents DIVE on top of
            him, PUMMELING AWAY, trying to beat him into submission --

            On the verge of losing consciousness, Whistler props himself
            against a piece of machinery.  He's bleeding, been shot to
            hell.  One of his hands is closed, clutching something.


            Agents warily close in around him, guns raised.

                     however, I need to ask you some questions.
                          (beat)
                     Now.  Can you tell me what day it is?


            Blade just stares daggers at Vance.

</b>                     What about the President?  Do you know
                     who's in the White House at the moment?

            On the other side of the mirror, Cumberland and Hale have
            joined Chief Vreede.  We hear Blade and Vance via speakers:


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     There's nothing to tell.  They exist.

            Vance sits forward, drawing closer.


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     What about blood?   When you drink it, do
                     you find yourself sexually aroused?


            Blade just glares at Vance.


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     You see, it strikes me that this business
                     of vampirism has strong connotations of
                     sexual confusion.  Bodily fluids being
                     exchanged, that sort of thing.  You have
                     to ask where that comes from.  I'm
                     wondering, for instance, what your
                     relationship was like with your mother.
                     Were the two of you close?


            Blade glares.  If he escapes, he's going to kill this guy.

            Dr. Vance steps into the observation room, joining Chief
            Vreede, Cumberland, and Hale.


<b>                                VREEDE

<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     He's psychotic, with paranoid features,
                     possessing dangerous levels of sociopathy. 
                     He's exhibiting disorganized behavior.  He
                     obviously doesn't have a properly formed
                     conscience --
                          (spreading his hands)
                     For his safety and the public's, I'm
                     recommending that he be transferred to

<b>                                CUMBERLAND

                     connection with a laundry list of federal
                     crimes.  I need him on a plane to the

            Cumberland and Hale look to Vreede with disbelief.


<b>                                HALE
</b>                     Chief, we've got a federal arrest warrant

                     with that, you take it up with the local

            Dr. Vance shrugs as if to say he's sorry.

</b>                     I'm sorry, gentlemen, but the call has
                     already been made.  A team from the
                     hospital should be here momentarily to
                     oversee the transfer.


<b>            INT. POLICE STATION - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT
</b>

            Asher, Danica, and Grimwood enter, followed by FOUR VAMPIRES
            dressed as orderlies.  The orderlies carry a straightjacket,
            various restraints, and a collapsible transport gurney.


            Danica approaches the DESK SERGEANT, flashing a hospital ID.


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     Hi.  We're here to transfer a patient to

            Vance enters once more.  He opens the leather case on the
            table, removing a syringe and an ampule of fluid.


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                          (speaking softly now)
                     Just a little something to keep you
                     compliant.  The normal dose is two, maybe
                     three hundred milligrams.  But for a
                     strapping young hybrid like yourself --


            Vance pokes the needle of the syringe into the ampule.


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     -- I think we'll kick it up to a couple
                     thousand.


            Vance reaches for Blade's arm.  Blade struggles, tries to pull
            back, but Vance manages to inject him nonetheless.


<b>                                VANCE

                     You're weak, aren't you?  In need of your
                     serum.  Who would've guessed a mere human

                     You're with them -- a familiar --

</b>                     Going on five years now.


            Vance extends his arm, pulling back his shirt cuff a little to
            reveal a VAMPIRE GLYPH tattooed on the underside of his wrist. 
            Then he pulls his cuff back down, smiles at Blade.


<b>                                VANCE
</b>                     It's the end-game, Blade.  All their plans
                     are finally coming to fruition.  So just
                     sit back and enjoy the show.


            Blade looks to the one-way mirror, SCREAMS.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     He's one of them!  Damnit, he's working
                     for them!


            Vance looks to the one-way mirror as well and shrugs as if to
            say -- "The man's deranged.  What can I do?"


<b>            INT. POLICE STATION - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>

            On the other side of the glass, Blade looks like a raging
            lunatic.  Vance enters.  He extends his hand to Vreede.


            They shake.  As they do so, we SEE a vampire GLYPH on the
            inside of Vreede's wrist as well.  Another familiar.


<b>            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>

            Blade stares at his own reflection in the mirror.  He blinks,
            trying to focus -- but the drug is starting to kick in.


<b>            INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>

            An elevator door opens.  Asher, Danica, and Grimwood exit,
            followed by the orderlies who are now wheeling the gurney.  As
            they move down the corridor, they pass --


            -- Cumberland and Hale, who are chasing down Chief Vreede.


<b>                                CUMBERLAND
</b>                     Just hold it right there --


            Danica shoves Cumberland aside, hard, keeps moving past him.


            Cumberland looks to Hale.  Something isn't right about this.


<b>            INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
</b>

            Blade struggles, in the full throes of the drug now.


<b>            BLADE'S POV
</b>

            His vision is blurring, various objects in the room leaving
            trails as he shifts his head from side to side and --


<b>            ASHER, DANICA, AND GRIMWOOD
</b>

            enter, followed by two of the orderlies.  Despite his
            incapacitation, Blade attempts to rise.  Danica plants her
            heel in his chest, shoving him back down.


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     Easy, lover. You're not going anywhere.


            She draws closer, enjoying herself.


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     We moved the humans around like, pawns,
                     Blade.  Used them to flush you out.


            Blade tries to LUNGE from his chair at her and -- WHACK!
            Grimwood punches Blade across the jaw.  A brutal blow.


<b>                                GRIMWOOD
</b>                     Don't worry, Captain Sunshine.  Soon as we
                     get you out of here, you'll get a chance
                     to play.


            Danica motions to the two vampire orderlies.  They step
            forward with the straight-jacket, start to put it on Blade. 
            Blade THRASHES madly.  Asher LAUGHS, enjoying this.


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     Don't make this any harder than it has to
                     be.  You're all alone, Blade.  No one can
                     help you now.


            BA-BOOM!  The one-way mirror SHATTERS, exploding outward in a
            shower of SLOW-MOTION GLASS FRAGMENTS, carrying with it --


            -- a BODY, one of the vampire mental health flunkies --


            ASHING in mid-air as he sails into the room!  Seconds later --


<b>            A MAN

            VAULTS through the blown-out window, simultaneously drawing
            two high-tech electronic pistols.
            Meet HANNIBAL KING (30s), an audacious vampire hunter with an
            irrepressible grin.  Slapped to his chest is a "Hello, my name
            is" sticker with the words "FUCK YOU" written where the name
            should be.


<b>                                KING

            Danica spins, enraged, recognizing King instantly --


<b>                                KING
</b>                     He kept biting his own lip.


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     King!


            The lights go out.  Immediately, backup lights come on,
            followed by FIRE ALARMS.  In the ensuing confusion ~ both
            pistols at Asher, who drops, allowing one of the vampire
            orderlies behind him to take the hit.


<b>            THE VAMPIRE ORDERLY ASHES
</b>

            But unlike Blade's victims, he disintegrates from the inside
            out.  (The reason is King's signature bullets -- SUN DOGS,
            explosive rounds that give off concentrated UV light.)


            King whips around, FIRING at --


            -- Danica, who LEAPS behind the table.  She quickly upends it,
            using it as a shield, FLINGING it at King.


<b>            ON BLADE
</b>

            He shifts his weight, throwing himself and the chair he's
            sitting on to the floor.  Then he KICKS OUT AND UP --


            -- connecting with Grimwood's mid-section, sending him FLYING
            BACKWARDS -- straight through the wall into the next room!


            King holsters one of his pistols and hauls Blade up.  At the
            same time, he FIRES on Asher again, missing him --


<b>                                KING

            King drags Blade to the door --


<b>            INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>

            -- into the neighboring corridor.  Cumberland and Hale SEE
            them.  They reach for their weapons --

            King FIRES into the room behind him, then pulls a GRENADE
            secured to a bandolier and tosses it through the doorway --


            An EXPLOSION rocks the interrogation room, filling the
            corridor with smoke, knocking Cumberland and Hale back.


            King turns his attention to Blade's handcuffs, FIRING between
            them, freeing Blade's hands.  Blade collapses against the
            wall.  He's shaking, close to passing out.


<b>                                KING

            King drags Blade up.  They continue down the corridor to --


<b>            ABIGAIL, THE FEMALE VAMPIRE HUNTER
</b>

            we met earlier.  She's engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a
            half-dozen UNIFORMED OFFICERS.  Three of them are already
            down.  In seconds, she finishes off the other three.


<b>                                KING

            Whistler?  Abigail spins, dispatching the last officer with a
            kick to the mid-section while tossing a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR at
            King.  He snatches it, places it in Blade's hands.


            Blade injects himself in the neck.  Moments later, he's
            reenergized.  He looks to King, clear-eyed.


<b>                                KING

            Blade responds by PUNCHING King across the jaw.

                     fucking brain damage.


            King massages his jaw, tossing Blade a pistol even as --


            --	Grimwood rounds the corner, hungry for blood, TWO MORE
            VAMPIRE ORDERLIES behind him.


            Blade FIRES round after round of EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, causing
            Grimwood and the others to fall back.  Blade and King move,
            joining Abigail.  MORE SMOKE, darkness, only the emergency
            lights to illuminate the station.


<b>            UP AHEAD,

            a group of POLICEMEN spill from a stairwell, armed with bullet
            proof vests.  They OPEN FIRE --


            Blade, King, and Abigail retreat into an alcove.  They're
            pinned down between the vampires and a group of policemen.

            As King and Blade lay down COVER FIRE, Abigail reaches behind
            her, withdrawing a device that's been secured there.  She
            gives it a SNAP and it springs open, taking the shape of a --

            Crafted from aluminum, its limbs imbedded in key positions
            with vibration-dampening modules, this bow is capable of
            firing an arrow upwards of 300 feet-per-second.


            Abigail withdraws a SILVER ARROW with a time-delay explosive
            tip from her quiver, nocks it in her bow and takes aim at --


<b>            A FIRE EXTINGUISHER

            mounted at the end of the corridor.  She lets her arrow fly --

            down the side corridor where it embeds itself in --

            come racing out of the alcove.  They reach a stairwell.  Blade
            RIPS a steel door clear off its hinges, tossing it down the
            stairwell at a phalanx of COP REINFORCEMENTS who are charging
            up the stairs.  The cops go down like ten-pins.


            Blade and company have an opening.  But as they charge
            downward --


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                          (as King and Abigail
                          freeze)
                     My sword.  They still have it.


<b>                                KING
</b>                          (apoplectic)
                     Are you insane?!  We're practically home
                     free!  We can't go hunting for your
                     fucking butter-knife now!


            But Blade is already heading back the way they came and --


<b>                                KING
</b>                     Hey!  HEY!!!  COME BACK HERE!!!  This is
                     supposed to be a rescue!


            -- Abigail grabs King's shoulder, pulling him to the stairs.


<b>                                ABIGAIL
</b>                     Forget it, King.  Let's move.


<b>            POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</b>

            King and Abigail rush outside.  The station is gated. FLASHING
            POLICE CARS are surging through the mouth of the gate. 
            They're trapped.  Then --


<b>            CRASH!
</b>

            A window on the third floor of the station EXPLODES OUTWARD. 
            Blade drops three stories, landing before King and Abigail in
            a cat-like crouch.  With his sword in his hand.  He looks at
            King, grins, flips him off.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     Now we can go.


<b>                                KING
</b>                          (nudging Abigail)
                     Is he epic or what?


            The police close in around them, pinning the trio down with
            FIREPOWER.  Yet King and Abigail seem unconcerned because --


<b>            HEADLIGHTS
</b>

            are washing over them.  A beefed-up, 70s Land Cruiser is
            SCREAMING up the street.  The Cruiser jumps onto the sidewalk,
            SMASHES right through the gated wall.  SCREECHES to a stop
            between our trio and the police cars.


<b>            A DRIVER (DEX)
</b>

            leans out his window, gives a little wave as the rear doors
            pop open.  Gruff and compact, he looks like a prize-fighter.


<b>                                DEX
</b>                     My name is Dex.  And I'll be saving your
                     ass this evening.


            Blade, King, and Abigail scramble into the back of the Land
            Cruiser.  Dex reverses, backing out the way he came.


            The police from the squad cars are FIRING, but the Land
            Cruiser is armored and the bullets harmlessly SPARK off.


<b>            INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT
</b>

            In the backseat, Abigail looks through the rear windshield --


<b>            ABIGAIL'S POV
</b>

            Grimwood is running after them, actually gaining on the Land
            Cruiser.  Chewing up the asphalt like a cheetah.


<b>            EXT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT
</b>

            Abigail leans out the rear window, nocking a non-UV arrow in
            her bow.  She takes aim at Grimwood, lets the arrow fly --


            SHUNKT!  The arrow sinks into Grimwood's eye.  He goes down,
            his somersaulting figure quickly receding into the background
            as the Land Cruiser speeds away.


<b>            INT. LAND CRUISER - NIGHT
</b>

            Safe for the moment, King basks in the adrenaline rush of a
            battle well fought.  Meanwhile, Dex is on a cell phone.


<b>                                DEX
</b>                     We have him.  We'll be there soon.


<b>                                KING
</b>                          (to Blade)
                     So my entrance back there -- what do you
                     think?  Too flashy?  Right on the money?


            King unhuckles his combat harness, revealing a bullet-proof
            vest bereath it that's been riddled with imbedded slugs.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     Who are you people?


<b>                                KING
</b>                     My name's Hannibal King.  I'm a hunter,
                     like you.
                          (re: Abigail)
                     And this little hellion is Abigail
                     Whistler.


            Abigail just stares back at Blade, silently appraising him.


<b>                                KING
</b>                     That's right, Blade.  You're not hearing
                     things.  She's Whistler's daughter.  You
                     see, Abby, Dex, myself -- we're all part
                     of Whistler's "contingency plan".


            King reaches into an inner pocket, pulls out a pack of gum. 
            He selects a stick, offers one to Blade.


<b>                                KING
</b>                     Juicyfruit?


<b>            EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT
</b>

            The Land Cruiser rockets away, disappearing into the night.


<b>            EXT. LUNA PARK - NIGHT
</b>

            The Land Cruiser moves across an abandoned lot towards the
            weed-choked ruins of an old amusement park.  We pass by the
            skeletal remains of a roller-coaster, a tilt-a-whirl, the
            vandalized and wood-rotted remnants of a carousel.


            Finally, the Land Cruiser turns towards a motorized loading
            door in the side of a large warehouse and disappears inside.


<b>            INT. WAREHOUSE/GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>

            As the door grinds closed, the Land Cruiser stops.  King and
            Abigail lead Blade through the darkness.  In the gloom we see
            a half-dozen vehicles in various stages of being retrofitted
            with armored panels and weaponry, etc.  SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
            mounted above track their progress.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     I thought the vampires murdered
                     Whistler's family.


<b>                                ABIGAIL
</b>                     They did.  I'm the product of an earlier
                     fling of my Dad's, born out of wedlock. 
                     After the murders happened, he kept me
                     hidden.  He wanted me safe.  Away from all
                     of this --
                          (gesturing around them)
                     -- but I guess hunting just runs in our
                     blood.


            As King and Abigail lead Blade towards a stairway, Blade
            catches sight of --


<b>            A LITTLE GIRL (5)
</b>

            peering down at him from atop one of the rafters.  As soon as
            he spots her, she ducks into the shadows.


            They reach the stairway.  AUTOMATED GUNS mounted on swivel
            arms lock on them with infra-red targeting beams.


<b>                                ABIGAIL
</b>                     When I came of age, I tracked my Dad
                     down, told him I wanted in.
                          (beat, shrugging)
                     Been doing it ever since.


<b>            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>

            We enter a sprawling industrial facility that is equal parts
            mechanics shop, firing range, and laboratory.  We glimpse a
            virtual arsenal of new weaponry and medical equipment,
            including DNA sequencers, microfuges, and electroporaters.


            The new equipment fights for space alongside the old -
            mountains of mothballed parts from the park's broken thrill
            rides.  Here and there we see the oversized fiberglass head of
            a grinning fun-house creature or the mildewed torso of a
            fortune-telling mannequin, frozen in its upended booth.


<b>                                KING

</b>                          (looking around)
                     How do you bankroll this place?


<b>                                KING
</b>                     Internet porn.  See, we're using cock
                     suckers to pay for the blood-suckers.  
                          (off Blade's look)
                     Joke.  Come on, man.  This isn't some
                     piddly little hoopty-ass operation, Blade. 
                     We take our jobs very seriously.


<b>            UP AHEAD,
</b>

            TWO OTHERS pause in their work as King approaches.  Dex falls
            in behind them.


            HEDGES (20s) is an engineer, always lost in his own world.


            SOMMERFIELD (30s) is a frail-looking geneticist.  She's also
            blind, operating her computers via a voice-synthesis program
            and Braille keyboard.


<b>                                KING
</b>                     You met Dex.  This is Hedges, Sommerfield--


            King gestures to them in turn.  They're all refugees in one
            way or another, sharing a common guardedness, their lives
            having been shattered by the vampires.


<b>                                KING
</b>                          (nodding back)
                     The runt you saw earlier is Sommerfield's
                     daughter, Zoe.  We call ourselves the
                     Nightstalkers.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     You sound like rejects from a Saturday
                     morning cartoon.


<b>                                KING
</b>                     We were gonna call ourselves the Super
                     Friends, but that was taken.


            Abigail rids herself of her weapons -- bow, arrows, silver
            stakes and knives.  She hands her compound bow to Hedges.


<b>                                ABIGAIL

</b>                     I'll run it through the bow press.


            Blade examines some of the equipment being developed.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     How many of you are there total?


<b>                                KING
</b>                     Enough.  We operate in sleeper cells. 
                     When one goes down, a new cell activates
                     to pick up the slack.  Consider us your
                     reinforcements.


<b>                                BLADE

<b>                                SOMMERFIELD
</b>                     I don't think you understand, Blade.
                     Whistler meant for us to help you.  When
                     he died, he activated an emergency
                     protocol.  All his knowledge --


            She gestures to the computer equipment around her.


<b>                                SOMMERFIELD

<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     And what makes you think you know so much
                     about killing vampires?


            King reaches for his collar, pulling it down to reveal a
            telltale mass of scar tissue in the shape of a BITE MARK.


<b>                                KING

</b>

<b>            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - NIGHT
</b>

            We soar through the night sky, diving down towards a cluster
            of gleaming, high-tech spires.  As we isolate a penthouse
            apartment atop one of them we hear an ANGRY SCREAM.


<b>                                DANICA (O.S.)
</b>                     Fucking Hannibal King!


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>

            An impressively decorated loft bespeaking of money, power, and
            a certain perverse esthetic.  Danica slams her fist straight
            through the wall, then spins around, enraged.


            Asher and Grimwood are there too, their wounds being treated
            by Hendrix and a VAMPIRE TECHNICIAN.  At tie moment, they're
            trying to remove the arrow protruding from Grimwood's eye.


            An enormous ROTTWEILER sits nearby, attentively watching. A
            TRIO OF GUARDS flinch with every act of violence. Danica is
            strong.  Clearly, no one wants to get in her way.


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     I should've ripped his ripped his
                     bleeding heart out when I had the chance!
                          (pointing at Asher)
                     And don't you dare tell me "I told you
                     so"!


            Asher raises his hands as if to say "no harm, no foul". 
            Danica continues her tantrum, SMASHING a statue apart,
            SHATTERING a heavy glass tabletop.  Finally, she gives it a
            rest, collapsing into a chair, shoulders sagging.


<b>                                ASHER

<b>                                ASHER
</b>                     Face it, Dan.  We got caught with our
                     pants down.  We underestimated the

                     ass-raped us!


            Grimwood GRUNTS in pain as the arrow is removed.  Asher
            broaches a more serious subject.


<b>                                ASHER
</b>                     Has he been told yet?

</b>                     About your failure?


            A MAN (30s) enters the room.  The same being we glimpsed in
            the vault.  He has a haunting gaze and a commanding presence.
            We will learn who he is momentarily.  But for now, it's enough
            to know that everyone in the room pays him deference.


<b>                                MAN
</b>                     Yes, I've been told.


            He places a hand on Danica's shoulder.  She tenses.


<b>                                MAN
</b>                     Perhaps it's time I entered the fray.

            CLOSE ON King buttoning his collar back up.  Blade, Abigail,
            and Sommerfield are gathered around him.


<b>                                KING

                     off but you still ask for her number? 
                     Well that's all I ever hook up with.  But
                     this betty blew 'em all away in the
                     shitstorm sweepstakes.


            King reaches out to a keyboard, calling up a piece of
            surveillance footage on a nearby monitor.  The footage
            features Asher and Danica and Grimwood.  It's been slowed to a
            near standstill and now advances frame by frame.

                     earlier.  The man on her left is Asher,
                     her brother.


            King types a command.  The image ZOOMS IN, tracking Grimwood.

                     Grimwood.


            King freezes the footage on Danica's grainy, pixelated face.

                     That's called turning a frown upside

            King tosses a TOMB OF DRACULA comic book over to Blade.  Blade
            glances at the cover, then looks at them, incredulous.

<b>            EXT. MESOPOTAMIA - NIGHT
</b>

            FLASH!  We see the man we met earlier (DRACULA/DRAKE) on the
            banks of the river Euphrates, striding towards us, engaged in
            fierce battle with UBAIDIAN SOLDIERS.  He's clutching the same
            sword we saw in the ziggurat, clad in the same armor.


<b>                                KING (V.0.)
</b>                     Dracula's only one of the names he's gone
                     by.  Now they call him Drake.  If you
                     believe the legends, he was born in
                     ancient Sumeria.


            As Drake SLASHES his sword downward we CUT BACK TO --

            progresses we will INTERCUT with Drake's own progression
            through history.  Brief, violent FLASHBACKS.


            (NOTE:  The backgrounds surrounding Drake will be
            expressionistic, digital composites, constantly shifting.  The
            focus of the flashes is Drake himself, fighting a shadowy
            horde, his attire continually evolving through time.)


<b>                                KING
</b>                     Nobody really knows the specifics of his
                     origin.  But we do know this:  he was the
                     first of his kind.  The patriarch of the
                     hominus nocturna.


<b>            EXT. EGYPTIAN DESERT - NIGHT
</b>

            FLASH!  We are in Egypt now, circa 1650 BC.  Drake wages war
            against the HYKSOS.  He is closer to the camera.  And will
            continue to move closer with each successive flashback.

                     And just like the Great White shark, he's
                     never had to evolve.  This guy was born

<b>            EXT. THRACE - NIGHT
</b>

            FLASH!  The Peloponnesian War, Southern Thrace, circa 405 BC.
            We see Dracula battling ATHENIANS.  Even closer now, his face
            spattered with blood.  At the same time, the SOUNDTRACK is
            gradually swelling, expanding in complexity and volume.

<b>            EXT. HUNGARIA - NIGHT

            FLASH!  5th century AD, battling the GOTHS.  With every swipe
            of his sword, we WIPE FORWARD into the future.


<b>                                KING (V.0.)
</b>                     -- you'll find countless references to

<b>            EXT. EUROPE - NIGHT
</b>

            FLASH!  8th century AD, the reign of Charlemagne.  Battling
            the VIKINGS.  The FLASHBACKS come faster now, assaulting us
            with ever-increasing rapidity.


            Drake continues striding forward while the rest of the world
            evolves around him, centuries whizzing by via computer
            generated time-lapse photography.

            soundtrack is THUNDEROUS.  Drake has become a bloody blur of

                     ago the trail went cold.  Then we heard a
                     rumor.  The vampires were searching for
                     him -- trying to find the place where he'd
                     retreated.  According to our information,
                     they found him in Iraq about six months
                     ago.

                     And he was pissed.


<b>            EXT. DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL DISTRICT - NIGHT
</b>

            Grime.  Neon.  Near-silence as the cacophonous soundtrack
            recedes into the background, replaced by the steady drone of
            inner-city TRAFFIC.


<b>            ON DRAKE,
</b>

            viewed through a long-lens, clad in modern, casual attire,
            striding in SLOW-MOTION down a PEDESTRIAN-CHOKED sidewalk.


            Slower.  A HEARTBEAT.  The pulse of the people.  And over
            this, intruding, the Doppler effect WAILING of an approaching
            car as it rushes past us in a SCREEN WIPE until we are --


<b>            OUTSIDE A GOTH STORE
</b>

            Drake studies a window display.  Halloween merchandise. 
            Costumes and monster masks and -- VAMPIRE NOVELTIES.  We see
            vampire lunchboxes, Dracula plush dolls, plastic fangs, key
            chains.  Even Dracula bobbleheads.


            Drake stands in stark contrast to the mass-marketed caricature
            on display before him.


<b>            INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT
</b>

            Drake enters. The store is crowded with low-end junky goods
            that might appeal to tourists visiting Hollywood Boulevard.


            A pallid, Goth-guy CASHIER sits behind a counter, eating from
            a takeout container.  He's wafer thin, with a detached
            attitude.  A snot.  Further back is a sultry GOTH VIXEN.


            Behind them, on a TV, a cartoon is playing. An animated
            vampire cavorts -- "LITTLE BIT" (like the Hot Stuff devil from
            Ritchie Rich comicbooks)


<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     In the window -- you sell vampire
                     merchandise?


            Goth Guy looks up, wiping his mouth with a napkin.  Doesn't
            want to engage with Drake at all.


<b>                                GOTH GUY
</b>                     Uh, yeah -- look around, we might have a
                     few things.


            He and the Goth Vixen have a snicker at Drake's expense.  Then
            she tries to be a little more helpful.


<b>                                GOTH VIXEN
</b>                     We've got Dracula lunchboxes.  Did you
                     see those?  And there're bobbleheads, Pez
                     dispensers.  We've got just about
                     anything --
                          (selecting a vampire-
                          shaped vibrator, playful)
                     -- even vampire vibrators.


            As Drake looks around, what he sees matches his ascending
            rage.  Costumes, candles, vampire Christmas ornaments. 
            Posters from different films -- Nosferatu, Lugosi, Lee -- then
            Love at First Bite and The Little Vampire.


<b>                                GOTH VIXEN

            She reaches into a case, pulling out a soft-drink.  The label
            reads: "DRA-COLA" and has a stylized vampire on it.


<b>                                GOTH VIXEN
</b>                     "Dracola".  Makes you want to cry,
                     doesn't it?


            Drake just stares at the can.  His mind seems to have
            retreated elsewhere.  Back through the ages.


<b>                                GOTH VIXEN
</b>                     Was there something special you needed?


            Drake doesn't respond.  A kind of melancholy has settled over
            him.  He's an outsider now.  The world has moved on.


<b>                                GOTH-GUY
</b>                     Hey, guy, she's talking to you.


            Drake looks up as Goth Guy pours a bowl of Count Chocula.


<b>            EXT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT
</b>

            CRASH!  Goth Guy comes flying through the display window, his
            trajectory taking his body clear across the street and into
            the display window of the store opposite us.


<b>            INT. GOTH STORE - NIGHT
</b>

            Goth Vixen SCREAMS.  Drake LASHES out.  hauling her over the
            counter.  He sinks his teeth into her throat, drinking her
            blood with wild abandon.  He consumes it so quickly that his
            skin flushes BRIGHT RED.


            Then Drake tears his head away, lifting his face upward as he
            flings the girl aside, unleashing an ear-splitting ROAR.  And
            for a brief moment, the bones of his face seem to shift, once
            again hinting at another shape Drake might take.

            DRAKE's ROAR echoes through the canyons of downtown.

                     talk about some kind of vampire 'Final
                     Solution'.  But I could never figure out
                     why they'd want to destroy their food
                     source.  I mean, seems stupid, right? 
                     They've always had plans for the human
                     race.  Seems likely that whatever they're
                     cooking up, Drake's return is a part of
                     it.

                     We've tried it on a number of captive

                     progenitor of the vampire race, his DNA is
                     still pure.  It hasn't been diluted by a
                     hundred generations of selective mutation. 
                     It still has all the necessary cellular
                     compounds for the virus to code to.  We

            Establishing.  The Sun at it's zenith


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - DAY
</b>

            A darkened room, relatively austere.  The only source of light
            are a series of small, slitted skylights in the ceiling above. 
            From these skylights, narrow, blinding white shafts of
            sunlight knife downward to penetrate the gloom.


<b>            DRAKE
</b>

            sits in a chair, his body partially illuminated by one of the
            sunlight shafts, his face turned upward into its brilliance.


            FOOTSTEPS.  Drake opens his eyes, SEES Danica hovering in the
            darkness, just on the edge of a shaft of light.


<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     This world sickens me.  The humans have

                     We can bring the old world back.


            Drake just stares at her, not convinced.


<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     Come closer.

</b>                     And do you know why?
                          (off Danica's silence)
                     Once, all of my kind could brave the day. 
                     We were true predators.  The world was
                     ours.  And then, somewhere along the way,
                     the purity of our bloodline became
                     diluted.  Polluted with human DNA.


<b>                                DANICA
</b>                     That's impossible --


<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     Is it?


            Drake stands, drawing close to Danica.  He grips her wrist --


<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     You are bastard children.  No longer as
                     pure as you pride yourselves on being.


            -- and pulls her hand towards one of the sunlight shafts.  To
            her credit, Danica keeps staring at Drake.  She'll be damned
            if she will give him the satisfaction of seeing her break.


            Drake pulls her hand closer to the light -- to the very edge. 
            And the tips of Danica's fingers begin to burn.  She winces,
            clearly in agony --


            -- and Drake releases her hand.  She cradles it against her
            chest, blinking away tears that have welled up in her eyes.


<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     My people.  How far you have fallen.


            Drake reaches out, brushes a tear from Danica's cheek, then
            turns and walks away -- through the alternating shafts of
            sunlight and darkness.

<b>            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - ARMORY - DAY
</b>

            Blade, King, and Abigail stand before a table where an
            assortment of weaponry and ammunition has been laid out on
            display.  Hedges is there too, assisting them.  Zoe watches.


<b>                                HEDGES
</b>                     We've got a wide assortment of ass-
                     kickery for your viewing pleasure --
                          (hefting a pistol)
                     Electronic pistol.  Comes with a built-in
                     fingerprint security system.  Fires a
                     three-shot burst in 1/500th of a second.
                     Bullets can also be triggered remotely.


            King tosses Blade a bullet.  He studies it -- it's more
            complex than a standard round.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     Explosive rounds?


<b>                                KING
</b>                     But with a concentrated burst of UV light
                     instead of your standard hollow-points.  I
                     call 'em sun dogs.
                          (to Hedges)
                     Hedges -- super-size me, baby!


            Hedges tosses King one of the four-barreled firearms.  On the
            stock is an irreverent decal of the mud-flap girl silhouette.


<b>                                KING
</b>                     This little mamacita -- a modified
                     version of the Army's Objective
                     Individual Combat Weapon.  Pick your
                     poison -- stakes, sun dogs, heat-seeking
                     mini-rockets.  Whatever gets you hard,
                     this puppy will pump out.
                          (gesturing to Blade's
                          sword, sarcastic)
                     Of course it doesn't have the range of a
                     sword but --


            Next, Hedges shows Blade the CRESCENT-SHAPED DEVICE that
            Abigail used.  He gives the device a twist and --


<b>                                HEDGES
</b>                     We call this the UV arc --


            CHINKT!  The device extends from either end, telescoping
            outward.  Connecting the tips is a concentrated UV LASER.


<b>                                HEDGES
</b>                     You hold the arc in the center, curved
                     away from you.  Connecting the tips is a
                     powerful UV laser beam.  Because of its
                     high focus, the laser cuts through vampire
                     flesh like a knife through butter.


<b>                                KING
</b>                     We're still trying to sort out fact from
                     fiction when it comes to Dracula.  Turning
                     into mist?  Kinda doubt it.  But general
                     shape-shifting?  Maybe.


<b>                                HEDGES

                     Not into a bat or a wolf or anything like
                     that.  But another human, someone with the
                     same approximate body mass -- given enough
                     practice it might be possible.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     How?


<b>                                HEDGES
</b>                     He wouldn't have a traditional skeletal
                     structure.  Probably something more like a
                     snake, with thousands of tiny bones in the
                     place of a normal array.  Commensurate
                     with this would be an exquisite control of
                     electrical potential across his tissues,
                     resulting in an ability to effectively
                     change shape at will --

            Blade, King, and Abigail, newly suited up for war, moving
            towards the Land Cruiser.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     Time to apply some pressure.  The weak
                     link in the vampire chain of command has
                     always been their familiars.  Vampires
                     can't go out in the day, so they get
                     humans to do their dirty work for them

                     whatever --

                     We bleed the wanna-be vampires, they'll
                     lead us to the real thing.


            Blade starts the ENGINE.


<b>            INT. LAND CRUISER - DAY
</b>

            Blade looks to Abigail, who sits in the back.  She has a
            laptop on her knees and is assembling an MP3 playlist.


<b>                                KING
</b>                     She's making playlists.  Likes to listen
                     to MP3s when she hunts.  Her own internal
                     soundtrack, you know?  Dark-core, trip
                     hop, whatever kids these days are
                     listening to.  Me?   I'm more of a Kenny G
                     fan.


            Finished, Abigail slips her earbuds into her ears, turns on
            her portable MP3 player.  MUSIC CUE.  The smoking bassline of
            Jurassic 5's 'A Day At The Races' kicks in as --


<b>            EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY

            -- Blade, King, and Abigail cruise the streets in a jagged
            fast-forward montage.


<b>            EXT. SEEDY BAR - DAY
</b>

            The Land Cruiser jumps the curb, SCREECHING to a stop in front
            of a scuzzy bar.  Amidst a wall covered with graffiti and
            flyers we see a vampire glyph.


<b>            INT. SEEDY BAR - DAY
</b>

            BANG!  Blade KICKS open the door.  A couple of LOW-LIFES take
            notice.  Blade moves around the bar, opening a refrigerator -
            we see packs of REFRIGERATED BLOOD inside.


            One of the low-lifes takes off running, back past the
            bathroom, shouldering a door at the rear --


<b>            EXT. SEEDY BAR - REAR ENTRANCE - DAY
</b>

            --	STUMBLING right into Abigail's arms.  She trips him up,
            swinging him around, pinning an arm behind him.  She pulls the
            back of his collar down, sees a VAMPIRE GLYPH --


            We can't hear what the familiar is saying, but he's squealing,
            raising his hands in a "please don't hit me anymore" manner.


<b>            EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS - DAY
</b>

            The Land Cruiser rockets down the streets.


<b>            EXT. VAMPIRE SAFE HOUSES - VARIOUS - DAY

            In quick succession we see a half-dozen underworld dives --


            -- a pool hall --


            -- an internet cafe --


            -- an electronics repair shop --


            All are fronts for vampire operations, featuring back rooms
            with refrigerated blood and high-tech coffin-like beds where
            the vampires can safely sleep through the day unmolested.


            In each new location, Blade, King, and Abigail resort to
            oldfashioned strong-arm tactics:


            -- Blade HEAD-BUTTS a familiar.


            -- King PUNCHES a familiar across the jaw.


            -- Abigail KICKS a familiar in the stomach.


            Cut to a flurry of EXTREME CLOSE-UPS of VAMPIRE GLYPHS being
            exposed on the backs of familiar's necks, one after another --


<b>            THEN A MONTAGE OF FACES

            as familiars have their heads cainfully SMASHED against --


            -- walls --


            -- car hoods --


            -- pool tables --


            -- into windows and doors and garbage cans.


            The bullying moves come faster, the shots becoming more and


            more abstract until --


<b>            EXT. CITY ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>

            -- WHAM!  Blade tosses HOOP, a skinny familiar, off a roof. 
            It's a four story drop.  Hoop falls, SCREAMING -- but then
            jerks to a stop about twenty feet down, dangling upside down.


            We see now that Hoop has rope tied around one of Hoop's
            ankles.  And Blade is clutching the other end of the rope.


            Blade hauls Hoop back up -- but still keeps him dangling
            upside down.  King and Abigail look on.

            Blade prepares to drop Hoop again --


            -- but a CELL PHONE in Hoop's jacket RINGS.  Blade fishes it
            out.  The screen reads:  EDGAR VANCE, 555-5631.


<b>            EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>

            Dr. Vance, the psychiatrist who gave Blade the mental
            evaluation, is cruising in his Pacific Blue XKB convertible
            Jaguar.  He's wearing sunglasses, talking on his cell phone.


<b>                                VANCE

<b>            EXT.  CITY ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>

            Blade ends the call, then looks to Hoop, smiling cruelly.


            Blade lets Hoop drop.  The familiar PLUNGES four stories,
            SCREAMING.  Lands dead-center in a Goodwill box below.

            Blade, King, and Abigail approach, taking note of Vance's
            Jaguar (complete with vanity plate), parked in front.

            The trio enter, drawing stares from a number of PATIENTS
            gathered in a reception area.  Nearby is a large display with
            Vance's grinning face.  Beneath it, text reads:

            Nearby is a bank of monitors showing a snazzy video featuring
            a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG COUPLE marvelling at a sunrise.

            The image cuts to Vance himself, poised on the edge of his
            desk, smiling.  As Blade and company move through the
            institute, the video plays counterpoint to their progress.

            Past the RECEPTION DESK are the elevators with more monitors
            showing the video greeting.  As Blade, King, and Abigail
            approach, TWO SECURITY GUARDS move to intercept them.

            The trio continue.  A DOCTOR steps out of a doorway.  King

            -- nearly colliding with TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS.  Blade

            Blade aims his shotgun at the door leading to Vance's office.
            He FIRES at the keycard lock, KICKS down the door --

</b>

            --	startling Dr. Vance himself, who is rising up from behind
            his desk.  Vance is wiping his mouth, not dressed like a
            doctor would normally be.  But we hardly notice this as --


<b>                                VANCE

            smiles, seemingly unconcerned as --


            --	Abigail circles around the other side, getting a view
            behind Vance's desk where --


<b>            VANCE'S BODY
</b>

            lies on the floor.  His throat has been ripped out.  And this
            body is dressed like a doctor.


            King puts it together first, reaching for a silver stake even
            as we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE coming from beneath
            the Vance double's flesh --


<b>                                KING
</b>                     Jesus, it's him!  It's Drake!


            The Vance double jumps atop the desk and swats the muzzle of
            Blade's shotgun aside, re-directing the BLAST, which SHATTERS
            a glass window.  Then he KICKS Blade in the chest, KNOCKING
            him clear across the office as --


            --	King advances.  The Vance double's face WARPS, the bones
            in his head shifting around.  He reaches for King, SLAMS him
            onto the desk, TWISTS the stake from King's hand and brutally
            SHOVING it into King's rib cage, pinning him to the desk top.


            Then the Vance double whirls around to engage Abigail -- only
            we see that it's Drake now, having taken Vance's shape.


<b>            DRAKE
</b>

            BACK-HANDS Abigail across the face, a teeth-jarring blow.


            She spins, falling --


            -- and Drake is moving like a hurricane, LEAPING through the
            window that was shattered by Blade's shotgun blast.


<b>            BLADE
</b>

            gives chase.  He looks out the window, SEES Drake landing on
            the ground, some three stories below.


<b>            EXT. VANCE INSTITUTE - REAR ENTRANCE - ALLEY - DAY
</b>

            Drake runs with inhuman speed.  He effortlessly scales a chain
            link fence, then BARRELS straight through a wooden barricade,
            sailing over a trash dumpster.  Seconds later, Blade follows,
            catching sight of Drake rushing out into --


<b>            EXT. STREET MARKET - VARIOUS - DAY
</b>

            -- a crowded urban market.  What unfolds is a foot-chase at
            super-human velocity.  Vampire and hunter are moving at least
            twenty miles an hour, BATTERING ASIDE various pedestrians,
            SMASHING through and over stalls of merchandise.


<b>            EXT. BUSY STREET - DAY
</b>

            Drake emerges onto the sidewalk of a busy street, four lanes
            of rush-hour traffic WHIZZING PAST.


            Abruptly, Drake cuts into the traffic, LEAPING atop the hood
            of an oncoming car.  The car's HORN sounds, brakes SQUEAL.


<b>                                BLADE FOLLOWS,
</b>                     jumping onto the hood of another car. More
                     HORNS sound.


            In this manner. Drake and Blade race across the flowing
            traffic itself. using the hoods and roofs of the cars like
            moving stepping stones.


<b>            ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET
</b>

            Drake mounts the steps of an older apartment building,
            THUNDERS his way through the main entrance --


<b>            INT. OLDER BUILDING - STAIRWELL/CORRIDOR - DAY

            Blade is on Drake like a shadow.  We're internal now, the
            sound of Blade's LABORED BREATH moving to the foreground of
            the soundscape.


            Chaos.  A BARKING DOG darting from a doorway.  Up ahead, an
            OLD MAN has been knocked over.  An insane dash up two flights
            of stairs, then down a corridor, passing MORE TENANTS. 
            Somewhere, a WOMAN SCREAMS.  We hear GLASS BREAKING and --

</b>                     My baby


            -- there's another open door --


<b>            INT. OLDER BUILDING - APARTMENT - DAY
</b>

            -- Blade tears into an apartment, passing a HYSTERICAL WOMAN,
            an upended crib.  He SEES a broken window by a fire escape --


<b>            EXT. OLDER BUILDING - FIRE ESCAPE - DAY
</b>

            Cut onto the fire escape.  A glimpse of Drake overhead.


            Blade clambers up the fire escape, moving in a near-blur.  One
            story of steps up the rickety metal ladder --


            SMASH!  A LARGE PLANTER comes down from above, nearly striking
            Blade.  He lets go with one hand, swings outward --


            -- then he's climbing again.  A CLOUD OF PIGEONS take wing,
            flapping frenetically about him, momentarily blinding him.


            Another story, a third, a fourth.  As he reaches the top,
            Blade jumps, catching the edge of the roof above him --


<b>            EXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>

            -- FLIPPING himself over and onto the roof.  He lands in a cat
            stance, drawing his sword, quickly scanning the area.


<b>                                DRAKE (O.S.)
</b>                     So you're the hunter they all fear.


            Blade spins --


<b>            DRAKE
</b>

            stands on the ledge of the roof, cradling an INFANT in his
            arms.  In the full glare of the afternoon sun.


<b>                                DRAKE

                     Just so we understand each other,
                     Daywalker.


            With his free hand, he massages his jaw.  We hear a few more
            Pieces of POPPING CARTKAGE as the very last of Drake's
            cermanent features seem to settee into clace.


<b>                                BLADE

                     liabi1ity.


            Drake nods at Blade's sword --


<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     Your sword -- I've seen that hilt before. 
                     Eight or nine centuries ago.  The hunter
                     who carried it was an accomplished
                     fighter.

            Drake in his armor, head to head with a 14th century VAMPIRE
            HUNTER.  The hunter has BLADE'S SWORD.  Drake tears the sword
            from the hunter's grasp, turns it around, thrusts it back
            through the man's chest.  And as the man GASPS we are --


<b>            EXT. OLDER BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY (THE PRESENT)

<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     You lie.  You're part of a grand
                     tradition, Blade.  You hunters have

                     walked the earth.  And I have vanquished
                     them.  One by one.


            Blade pauses, looking for some kind of opening.

                     they can all become Daywalkers.


            Drake glances down at the street people.  Throngs of PEOPLE
            are massing there, pointing up at him.


<b>                                DRAKE

                     them down there.  Lives brief as
                     fireflies.  Do you think they can ever
                     grasp what it means to be immortal like

                     And every one of them's seen the end of my

                     Catch.


            Drake tosses the infant at Blade.  Blade twists around to
            catch it, scooping it safely up.  But when he looks back --


            -- Drake is gone.

                     fucking lose.


            Abigail ignores King, cuts open his shirt.  She removes a
            small aerosol cannister from her belt.


<b>                                BLADE

            King's voice trails off as he passes out.  Abigail triggers
            the dispenser, spraying a jet of compressed foam into it.  The

                     decided to go after the vampires' food

                     about vampires is that they have to drink

                     If we manage to pull this off, we'll be
                     able to contaminate every blood source on

                     hereditary factor in Drake that makes him
                     immune to sunlight, they'll require
                     certain kinds of laboratory equipment and
                     provisions.  For instance, there's an

            Danica has her limbs wrapped around Drake, holding on for dear

            The two of them climax.  Drake withdraws, studying Danica. 
            She's naked but for the tiny silver crucifix she wears around
            her neck.  Drake nudges the crucifix with his finger.

            Drake draws her in, biting her gently on the neck, sinking his
            fangs into her flesh.  He pulls his head back.  Two rivulets
            of BLOOD trickle from the fresh wounds.


<b>                                DRAKE

            Drake reaches for the sheet, pulling it away from Danica's

            Hendrix, the vampire doctor we saw earlier, sits at a computer
            workstation.  Chief Vreede confers with him.  We hear a KNOCK
            at the door.  Hendrix looks to Vreede.  They obviously weren't
            expecting anyone.


            Hendrix moves to the door, checking a surveillance monitor. 
            He can't see anyone outside.  He shrugs, turns to leave and --


            CRUNCH!  The door is SMASHED inward, taking much of the door
            frame with it, flattening Hendrix.


            Blade and Abigail step inside.  As Blade hauls Hendrix up from
            the ground, Abigail points her already drawn gun at --

            Blade nods to Abigail.  She reaches onto Vreede's jacket to

            Blade PUNCHES Hendrix in the face.  Hendrix sags for a moment,
            stunned.

            Abigail FIRES her UV gun with blinding speed and --


            -- Hendrix is dead before he knows it.  ASHING all over Blade.


            Blade brushes Hendrix' s remains from coat collar, shoots

            Blade looks to the floor.  Aside from some cinders, all that
            remains of Hendrix are his glasses and a singed keycard.

            At the same time, Sommerfield is reading aloud to Zoe, who
            sits nearby.  The book is The Emerald City of Oz and it's in
            Braille.  Sommerfield scans with her fingers.

                     they do not try to be good.  Now, the Nome
                     King had never tried to be good, so he was
                     very bad indeed.  Having decided to
                     conquer the Land of Oz and to destroy the

            We see Whistler approaching through the garage.

            The steel door slides open and Whistler enters.

            King drowses on a cot.  He hears a NOISE, opens his eyes.
            Whistler stands in the doorway.

            Whistler doesn't respond.  King tries to sit up -- but
            Whistler places his hand on King's mouth, shoving him down,
            starting to smother him.  King struggles, confused.

            Dex manages to steal the ball from Hedges, makes a shot.

            Abruptly, the sounds of the one-on-one game stop.  We hear a

            Sommerfield looks to the storage area.  The silence is
            unnerving.  She turns off her voice-synthesis program.  Then
            closes the book.

<b>            ON THE DOORWAY
</b>

            The basketball comes bouncing out.  It rolls, coming to rest
            against a workbench.  There are BLOOD SPATTERS on the ball.


            Sommefrield reaches for her cane.  She TAP-TAPS her way to the
            baLl, feels the blood.  Knows what it is.

            Zoe hesitates.  Sommerfield senses it and lashes out with her
            cane, BANGING a rack of equipment, startling the girl.

            The girl scurries away.  Sommerfield TAP-TAPS with her cane,
            moving towards the storage area.  She finds a gun cabinet,
            feels around with her hands, locates an electronic pistol.


<b>            INT. NGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - STORAGE AREA - NIGHT
</b>

            Sommerfield enters.  Dex and Hedges are sprawled on the floor
            before her, having been slaughtered.  Blood is everywnere. 
            She doesn't see them, of course.  But we do.


<b>            THE CAMERA SHIFTS AROUND,
</b>

            revealing Whistler crouched right behind her!


            She's unaware of his presence.  And as we watch, his facial
            features shift.  We hear the sickening sounds of CARTILAGE
            POPPING and we realize that it's Drake, not Whistler.


            With mounting dread, Sommerfield turns towards the sound.  And
            then Drake is upon her, rushing forward with a GROWL.


<b>            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>

            As Sommerfield's AGONIZED SCREAMS echo through the warehouse,
            Zoe rushes into the bathroom, looking for a place to hide. She
            considers the lockers, discounts them.  Then settles on --


<b>            A HEATING GRATE
</b>

            near the floor.  It's about fourteen inches wide -- just
            barely big enough for her to squeeze into.


            Zoe kneels, prying the grate off.  Inside, a heating duct
            extends four feet before making a ninety-degree turn upward.
            Zoe climbs into the duct feet first, scooting her body
            backwards.  Then she reaches for the grate, securing it back
            on, sealing herself inside.


<b>            INT. HEATING DUCT - NIGHT
</b>

            Zoe waits.  It's cramped and claustrophobic inside the duct. 
            She's managed to force herself all the way back to the ninety
            degree turn by curling up into a near fetal position.

</b>

            Mostly tile floor and a small portion of the open doorway
            leading to the hallway outside.


            She listens, trying to hear past the sound of her own


            BREATHING which has been magnified because of the ducting.


            The screams from the outer rooms have stopped.  Then --


<b>            ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)
</b>

            A pair of boots appear in the doorway -- Drake.


            Zoe holds her breath.  We HEAR Drake searching the bathroom,
            opening the lockers and bathroom stalls.

                     again, closer, tn~s time. They pause for
                     an interminable moment --


            Zoe shuts her eyes.  She can't stand it.  Finally, we hear
            Drake's FOOTSTEPS receding away.  Relieved, Zoe takes in a
            breath and opens her eyes --


<b>            ZOE'S POV (THROUGH GRATE)
</b>

            Drake's face is right there.  pressed up against the other
            side of the grate, staring at her!


            Zoe SCREAMS.  With a ROAR, Drake rips the grate off.  He tries
            to climb inside, but the width of the duct is too narrow to
            accommodate the size of his upper body.


            Instead, he reaches his right arm in, extending his clawed
            hand as far as he possibly can.  Zoe WHIMPERS, trying to
            compress her mass into an even tighter ball --


<b>            ON DRAKE'S HAND,
</b>

            having reached the limits of its extension -- his fingertips


            only a few scant inches from Zoe's face.


            Zoe's been allowed a moment's reprieve.  He can't reach her!


            But then we hear the sound of POPPING CARTILAGE.  Of TINY
            BONES shifting beneath Drake's flesh.  Drake's fingers are
            elongating, snake-like Reaching for Zoe's face, rapidly
            closing the space whici1 separates them --

            Blade and Abigail enter.  The place is dark.  They know
            instinctively that somethong is wrong.


            Blade tries a nearby light.  The power is out.  They both draw
            their weapons.  Blade turns on a FLASHLIGHT.  They move onto
            the darkness --


            SHADOWS loom everywhere.  It's like a tornado touched down
            inside.  Equipment lies smashed, tables and chairs have been

<b>            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - SHOWER AREA - NIGHT

            Blade and Abigail enter.  A thin stream of BLOOD snakes its
            way across the shower tiles.  Taey follow it, discovering --


<b>            SOMMERFIELD,

            her body propped up mock-crucifixion style in the showers.  On

            He knows damn well who left him the message.


            As tears streak down Abigail's cheeks, she rushes to
            Sommmerfield's body.  Together, she and Blade get her down.


            Abigail clutches Sommerfield, slowly rocking the body in her
            arms.  Blade puts a hand on her shoulder.

            King's smile falters for a moment.  Maybe she does know.  She
            rubs her cheek against his.

<b>            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS' HEADQUARTERS - SHOOTING RANGE - NIGHT
</b>

            Abigail sits in her workshop area, restringing one of her
            bows.  Nearby is a table with an assortment of equipment -- a
            bow press, vise stand, string jig, bow scales and wrench sets.


            Across the way is a shooting range with a variety of targets
            set up, a wall of netting behind them to catch stray arrows. 
            There's also a chronograph outfitted with a ballistic computer
            to measure arrow speed.


            CLOSE ON Abigail's hands as she works with a quiet precsion,
            re-setting the arrow rest, making minor adjustments to the
            center-shot position and wheel timing, etc.


<b>            BLADE
</b>

            appears in the doorway, watching her.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     You alright?


<b>                                ABIGAIL
</b>                          (brusque)
                     I'll be fine.


            Blade nods.  He's going to leave her alone -- but then he
            hesitates, wrestling to say something.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     Don't let it turn inward.


            Abigail takes a deep breath, pausing in her work.


<b>                                ABIGAIL
</b>                     It already has.  Since I can remember
                     I've had this knife of sadness in my
                     heart.  As long as it stays there, I'm
                     strong.  I'm untouchable.  But the moment
                     I pull it out --
                          (turning back to him)
                     -- I'll die.


            Blade nods.  He understands all too well.  He leaves.


<b>            ON ABIGAIL
</b>

            She stands, moving to the shooting range.  She straps on a
            quiver, takes aim at


<b>            A 3-D HUMAN-SHAPED TARGET
</b>

            about a hundred feet away.  Just in front of the target is the
            chronograph, which looks like a miniature set of goal posts.


            WHOOSH!  Abigail FIRES an arrow.  It flies through the arms of
            the chronograph, sinking into the targets s chest.  On the
            screen of the ballistic computer, the arrow's speed is clocked
            at 240 feet per second.  We move CLOSER to her now as--


            WHOOSH!  Abicail FIRES again. The speed is 242 fps. CLOSER --


            WHOOSH!  Now the speed is 269 fps. EVEN CLOSER --


            WHOOSH!WHOOSH!WHOOSH!  285 fps.  302 fps.  315 fps!  The arrow
            speed creeps up and up as we move CLOSER AND CLOSER to Abigail
            until we --


            -- PULL BACK.  Abigail has fired every arrow in her quiver. 


<b>            ON THE TARGET
</b>

            The arrows have formed a cross in the target's chest.  One
            vertical grouping running up, another horizontal grouping
            bisecting it.


<b>            INT. NIGHTSTALKERS HEADQUARTERS - GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>

            Blade stands at the open entrance.  Abigail steps out.  Looks
            like she's made peace with herself for the moment.


<b>                                ARIGAIL
</b>                     I'm ready to go.


            HEADLIGHTS appear in the distance.  Another Land Cruiser
            approaches, weaving through the amusement park.  It pulls to a
            stop in front of them.  The driver's side window rolls down.


<b>            A MAN (CAULDER)
</b>

            sits behind the wheel.  He raises a hand in greeting.


<b>                                CAULDER
</b>                     My name is Caulder.  And I'll be your

<b>            INT. CAULDER'S LAND CRUISER - NIGHT

            Caulder's Land Cruiser glides through the streets.


<b>                                BLADE
</b>                     Where are you taking us?

<b>                                ABIGAIL
</b>                     We told you, Blade.  We operate in sleeper
                     cells.  When one goes down, a new cell
                     activates to pick up the slack.


<b>            EXT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - NIGHT
</b>

            Caulder pulls up in front of a fish supply store.


<b>            INT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - NIGHT
</b>

            Caulder unlocks an accordion security gate, opens the door. 
            He leads Blade and Abigail through the darkened aisles.  There
            are fish tanks on either side, aerators BUBBLING, aquatic
            animals of every kind swimming about.


<b>            IN THE BACK
</b>

            is another arsenal/lab area.  This one is smaller than the
            Nightstalkers' main headquarters.  Caulder moves to a
            computer, calls up a file.  A dialogue box for a media player
            opens.  Caulder activates a video file.


<b>                                CAULDER

<b>            ON THE MONITOR
</b>

            The video plays.  We see Sommerfield's face on the screen. 
            She looks grave, as if she might have been crying.


<b>                                SOMMERFIELD

                     If you're watching this, I'm already dead.
                     If Zoe's still alive, I want you to
                     promise you'll take care of her.  I've
                     been reading her The Oz books every night. 
                     We just started The Emerald City of Oz,
                     the one with the Nome King --


            Her voice cracks and she pauses, wiping away a tear.


<b>                                SOMMERFIELD
</b>                     I think I've managed to cultivate a
                     workable strain of the Daystar virus.  As
                     a precaution, I transmitted the genetic
                     sequence to Caulder, in case our main
                     stock was destroyed.  In order for it to
                     achieve maximum lethality, you'll need to
                     interfuse it with Drake's blood.  If it
                     works, any vampires in the immediate
                     vicinity should die almost instantly. 
                     After that, it should take only a few
                     weeks for the virus to spread throughout
                     the rest of the world.


            Zoe hesitates, deciding how to broach the next subject.


<b>                                SOMMERFIELD
</b>                     There's one other thing, Blade.  You need
                     to know that there's a chance the virus
                     could destroy you too.  Because you're a
                     hybrid, I'm not sure whether your immune
                     system will be able tolerate it.
                          (beat)
                     I'm sorry.  We didn't have enough time to
                     properly test it.


            The video cuts to STATIC.  Abigail turns off the monitor,
            looking to Blade.  God only knows what he's thinking.


<b>                                CAULDER
</b>                     Take a look at the plague arrow.


            Caulder reaches for a refrigerated aluminum case, snapping it
            open.  Inside, resting on a bed of form-fitting foam, is a
            glass ampule that's been fitted into a stake-like contraption. 
            It looks like the head of a high-tech harpoon.


<b>                                CAULDER
</b>                     I only had time to fabricate a small batch
                     of Daystar.  I outfitted it with a
                     compressed gas projectile, so you should
                     be able to fire it from one of the
                     fourbarrel rifles or a bow.
                          (beat)
                     Just make sure the shot counts, cause we
                     don't have enough for a second try.


<b>            A SERIES OF DISSOLVES
</b>

            Abigail sits before a laptop, creating another custom MP3
            playlist.  We watch as she hi-lights songs with her mouse,
            moves them over to her portable device with a few CLICKS.


            Abigail unhooks her MP3 device, slips her earbud headphones
            into her ears.  The SOUNDS of Fluke's track Atom Bomb fade up,
            gradually shifting from tinny source music to SOUNDTRACK.


<b>            MORE DISSOLVES
</b>

            Blade and Abigail suit up, arming themselves.  We SEE:


            Blade loading rounds into his pistols.


            Abigail selecting arrows, checking the range-dials.


            Blade sliding silver stakes into his bandoliers.


            Abigail working with Caulder, affixing the plague capsule to
            one of her arrowheads.


            Blade polishes his sword.  Finished, he sights down the length
            of it, takes a practice swing, then secures it in his back
            scabbard with a flourish.


<b>            EXT. DEEP-SIX AQUARIUM STOCK - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>

            We hear the RUMBLE of two motorcycles.  Blade emerges from the
            alley astride his signature Ducati ST2 crotch-rocket.  Abigail
            appears a moment later on her own customized bike.


            Blade revs his engine.  Then the two bikes take off.

<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

            Drake sits before Zoe, who has been shackled to the wall, his


            right arm encased in one of the armored gauntlets from his
            burial armor.  The rest of the armor has been propped up on a
            stand nearby.

            Drake smiles at this.


<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     The Nome King.  I like that.
                          (leaning closer)
                     Tell me, child.  Do you want to die?


            Zoe is terrified but tries to remain defiant.


<b>                                ZOE

                     No happy ending for good little girls.
                     The only thing you have to look forward to
                     is nothingness.


            As Drake talks his pupils seem to widen -- until the darkness
            nearly occludes the whites of his eyes.  Zoe stares at him. 
            Can't tear her gaze away.  His eyes are hypnotic.


<b>                                DRAKE

                     if you could remain a child forever?


            He reaches out, running a sharp fingernail over her cheek.

            Behind Danica, Grimwood and Asher both COUGH.


            King lifts his bruised face, staring up at Danica through
            blood-shrouded eyes.  For the first time, we get a sense of
            his true hatred for her.

            feeling the effects too.  And Grimwood's face is smoking!


<b>                                KING

            Danica keys into the RUMBLE of the air-conditioning system and
            a HISSING SOUND beneath that.  She looks up --


<b>                                KING
</b>                     It's being pumped into the building's air
                     conditioning system.


<b>            ANGLE ON THE HEATING REGISTER ABOVE
</b>

            We GO MACRO, shrinking down until we see a CLOUD OF TINY
            SILVER PARTICLES blowing into the room.  The particles are
            dusting the vampires, being unwittingly inhaled by them and --


<b>            WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL
</b>

            as the vampires react en mass, suddenly gagging, their throats
            and faces on fire.


<b>                                KING

<b>            GRIMWOOD
</b>

            has caught the worst of it.  A whole lung-full.  He SHRIEKS as
            He coughs up blue-tinged FLAMES, the flesh on his face
            simultaneously burning away and --

</b>

<b>            THE SKYLIGHT ABOVE THEM
</b>

            SHATTERS as Blade crashes down.  He lands in a cat-like
            stance, then flips over into a cartwheel, KICKING Grimwood in
            the face.  As Grimwood goes down, Asher and Danica scatter --


            Blade tackles Grimwood, sending both of them over the railing
            into the lower level of the penthouse.


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>

            ALARMS are ringing.  Asher and Danica rush down the hall,
            trying not to breathe the silver-contaminated air.  We SEE
            other vampires staggering from doorways, COUGHING, GAGGING.


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>

            Drake hears the ALARMS.  He reaches for his sword, which rests
            in a nearby stand.  As he heads out, he strides past Zoe,
            still chained to the wall.


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>

            On the lower level, Blade and Grimwood are going at it.


<b>            REINFORCENENTS
</b>

            flood in from multiple entry ways.  It's an all-out melee. 
            Blade is seriously overwhelmed, but the sheer number of
            vampires and humans is actually slowing them down.


            Blade takes on a half-dozen of them at once, stunning one of
            the familiars, using him as a human shield, TOSSING him aside
            to trip up another on-rushing pair.


            Then he pauses, instantly calculating the geography of the
            room, the relative positions of the other combatants,
            assessing decorations and furniture as possible weapons.  His
            battle plan ready, Blade engages his enemies once again.


<b>            MEANWHILE, ON THE UPPER LEVEL
</b>

            Abigail appears at the lip of the smashed-in skylight.  She
            lowers herself down on a rope, rushes to King's side --


<b>                                ABIGAIL
</b>                     You alright?

                     fix.


            Abigail hits the release switch on the high-tech pillory and
            the cuffs around his wrists open.  As Abigail helps King out:


<b>                                ABIGAIL
</b>                     Zoe --

</b>                     Drake's got her.


            Abigail nods, handing King her pistol.  Then she's out the
            door.  Seconds later, King follows --


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAYS - VARIOUS - NIGHT
</b>

            Abigail pauses, slipping her earbuds in, turning on her MP3
            player.  The bumping-strains of Fluke's Absurd track kick in. 
            Abigail uncilps her UV arc, telescopes it outward and --


            -- suddenly it's like we're in a first-person shooter video
            game.  She moves through the corridors with mathematical
            precision, feeling the MUSIC in her bones, slicing through
            every vampire she encounters with deadly efficiency.


<b>            VAMPIRES AND HUMAN FAMILIARS
</b>

            are coming out from every doorway.


            Abigail PUNCHES one in the solar plexus, DECAPITATES another,
            finishes off the first.  Then she's moving on, taking down a
            third, fourth, and fifth vampire with her rapid-fire stake
            dispenser.  Throwing stakes with blinding speed.


            After a half-dozen stakes, her dispenser is empty.  Without
            missing a beat, she presses a tab on the dispenser, ejects the
            clip, then reaches to her belt where a back-up is secured and
            slaps it in place.  The mayhem continues.


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
</b>

            Blade unsheathes his sword.  He parries two combatants with
            clubs, then whirls around, DEFLECTING a GUNSHOT from a third
            with the flat of his sword.


            Grimwood is furious.  His men are tripping all over
            themselves.  He grabs an antique battle axe that's secured to
            the wall.  He sees an opening, SWINGS at Blade's head --


            -- Blade drops and the axe slices through one of Grimwood's
            own men.


            In an eye-blink, Blade is up again, advancing.  He cuts down
            another familiar, pushes forward, cuts oown a second --


            Now Blade and Grimwood are face to face.  Grimwood swings his
            axe again.  Blade hooks his sword beneath it, FLIPPING it from
            Grimwood's hands.


            Blade sweeps his sword around in a wide arc, CUTTING straight
            through Grimwood's mid-section.  The upper half of Grimwood's
            body topples away --


            -- then he rights himself.  A half-vampire.  He's still alive,
            running forward on his hands, trailing viscera.  He SPRINGS UP
            at Blade, all claws and gnashing teeth.


            Blade catches Grimwood by the throat, whirls him around --


            --  and manages to IMPALE what's left of Grimwood with his
            sword-point.  Grimwood ASHES in Blade's arms.  The only thing
            left are his steel teeth, which CLATTER to the floor at
            Blade's feet.


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - DRAKE'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>

            Abigail enters, SEES Zoe.  TWO VAMPIRES GUARDS stand nearby. 
            In a flash, Abigail flings TWO SILVER STAKES at them.  Both
            stakes hit their mark and the vamps crumple to ASH.


            Abigail hurries over, SHOOTS apart the lock on Zoe's shackle.
            Zoe wraps her arms around Abigail, hugging her tight.  Abigail
            takes Zoe by the hand, pulling her towards the door.


<b>                                ABIGAIL

<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

            King stumbles out into the hallway, pulling his shirt back on. 
            As he limps down the corridor, a GROWL makes him pause --


<b>            KING'S POV
</b>

            Beau, the vampire rottweiler, lopes around the corner.  Then --


<b>            TWO MORE ROTTWEILERS
</b>

            emerge behind Beau.  They're all GROWLING now.


<b>                                KING

                     Fuck.  Me.  Sideways.


            The three of them break, BARKING like crazy, snouts splitting
            open as their jaws flower apart.

            Blade moves into the upper gallery of a vast atrium.


<b>            DRAKE
</b>

            stands before him, waiting, sword in hand.  He extends it,
            touching the tip to the floor.  A challenge.


<b>                                DRAKE
</b>                     Are you ready to die, Blade?

                     Then allow me to accommodate you.


            Drake does a back-flip over the balcony.  Forty feet down.


            Blade follows, drawing his sword as he LEAPS --


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>

            -- and lands.  Now the two warriors face each other, swords
            raised, eyes locked, their stances frozen.  Like classic
            samurai.  Whoever moves first, loses.


            Beat.  MOVING IN on both men, CIRCLING around them.  Slow the
            heart.  Slow the breath.  Find the opening.


<b>            DRAKE
</b>

            breaks first, bringing his sword over in less time than it
            takes to blink an eye.  No one could possibly deflect the
            blow.  And yet --


<b>            BLADE
</b>

            manages a COUNTER-STROKE with super-human grace.  He advances,
            parries, his sword CLANGING and SINGING like a blacksmith's
            hammer on sheet metal.


            Cut, thrust, block, diagonal downward slashes.  The moves come
            faster.  Drake DUCKS, barely avoiding being decapitated. 
            Blade's sword cuts right through a column instead.


            Drake retaliates.  Blade locks swords with him.  For a moment,
            the two warriors are nose to nose.  Then Blade twists his
            sword free, cutting open Drake's cheek --


            Drake GROWLS, back-flipping up onto a ledge.  He touches his
            fingertips to the cut, tastes his own blood.  Then we hear the
            telltale sounds of CARTILAGE POPPING.  For a brief moment, his
            facial features shift, giving us yet another glimpse of his
            true form.  As his anger increases, Drake begins to devolve.


            He DIVES at Blade, HOWLING, raking his CLAWS at Blade's face. 
            He strikes out, KNOCKING Blade across the atrium.  He SPRINGS
            forward, dragging Blade up by his throat, sinking his fangs
            into Blade's shoulder.  Blide SCREAMS and we --

            are quickly gaining on him.


<b>            UP AHEAD
</b>

            It's a dead-end.  Just plate glass windows and a whole lot of
            nothing beyond.


            The dogs are almost on King when suddenly, King JUMPS,
            snagging an overhead pipe.  As he swings his body upward --


<b>            THE DOGS
</b>

            skid on the floor, unable to stop their momentum, and CRASH
            straight through the plate glass window.


<b>            EXT. PHOENIX TOWERS - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

            An EXPLOSION OF GLASS as two of the vampire rottweilers tumble
            into the night.  They fall like stones -- twenty stories down
            into the traffic-clogged intersection below.


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT

            King drops back to the floor, cackling, pleased with himself. 
            It takes him a second to realize that --


<b>            ONE OF THE ROTTWEILERS (BEAU)
</b>

            -- didn't take a swan dive out the window.  He's right behind
            King.  And now he's SPRINGING FORWARD --


            WHAM!  King is hit in the chest by the SNARLING beast.  He
            drops the pistol as he's knocked back onto the floor.  The dog
            LUNGES again --


            With one arm, King struggles to keep his face from being bit
            off, while searching blindly for the discarded pistol.  King
            locates it, FIRING into the beast's chest --

            ASHES, disintegrating all over King's face.  King gets a
            mouthful of the charcoal remains, tries to SPIT them out.

            Abigail emerges onto the gallery with Zoe.  She spots an
            alcove, indicates that Zoe should hide.  Then she slips a
            silver stake into Zoe's hand.  Just in case.


            Abigail rushes to the handrail, looking down at Blade and
            Drake.  Her view is obscured.  She can't get a good shot.


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

            Drake digs his fangs into Blade's shoulder.  Blade struggles,
            manages to slip a stake from his bandolier --


            WHAM!  Blade SLAMS the stake into Drake's ear canal.  The
            beast SHRIEKS in pain, dropping Blade.  But all the gambit has
            done is drive Drake into a berserker rage.


            Drake swings his fist.  Blade ducks.  Drake's fist goes
            through the wall, PUNCTURING a steam pipe.  Steam vents --


            Drake reaches in, RIPS an eight-foot section of the pipe from
            the wall, bringing a SPARKING nest of electrical cables along
            with it.  He swings the pipe section around, WHACKING Blade.


            KRUNCH!  Drake swings the makeshift club again.  He's a one
            man demolition crew, decimating everything in his path.  He's
            SMASHING holes in the floor, the walls, plowing through

<b>            A SERIES OF LIGHTING GANTRIES
</b>

            span the length of the atrium ceiling.


            Abigail balances on the handrail, then jumps out into space --


            -- catching hold of one of the crosspieces.  Like an acrobat,
            she monkey-swings her way beneath the gantry.  If she loses
            her grip, she'll fall more than fifty feet.


            BA-BANG!  A bullet strikes just in front of Abigail, showering

            King tries to ward of f the blows, but he's sorely outmatched.
            He swings his electronic pistol up --


            Danica twists it from his grip, ejecting the clip from the
            stock.  King's sun dog bullets spill out all over the floor. 
            She tosses the gun aside, reaches for King again --


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT

            Back to Abigail.  She's breathing heavily, trying to call up
            new reserves of strength.  She glances down --


            Big mistake.


            She forces herself to look back up.  She swings herself
            pendulum-style, manages to snag yet another crosspiece.  A
<b>            SHOT RINGS OUT --
</b>

<b>            ANGLE ON ASHER,

            King reaches a palsied hand for his discarded pistol, points
            it vaguely in Danica's direction.  She LAUGHS.


<b>                                DANICA

            King pulls the trigger.  The scattered sun dog bullets ERUPT
            with UV LIGHT.  Danica SHRIEKS, trying to shield her already
            burning face from the glare.  She runs, horribly wounded.

            Drake pummels Blade, flinging his body about like a ragdoll. 
            He grabs Blade by his ankle, swings him upwards some thirty
            feet --


            SMASH!  Blade collides with the underside of a massive hanging
            glass chandelier/lighting fixture.


            Blade FALLS back to the ground, stunned, dropping his sword. 
            Drake pounces on him.  Blade can barely fend off Drake's blows
            anymore.  In desperation he digs his fingers into Drake's
            eyes.


            Drake swings both fists downward, Hulk-style, SHATTERING an
            entire section of the limestone flooring.


            A SHOCK-WAVE ripples out from the point of impact, sending
            waves of two-foot stone tiles flipping up into the air,
            knocking Blade off his feet.

            King loads a sun dog into his pistol, steadies his aim on the
            railing, and FIRES at Asher --


<b>            THE SUN DOG
</b>

            screams across the atrium, striking dead-center in Asher's
            open mouth.  The bullet EXPLODES.  UV LIGHT causes Asher's
            skull to burn up from the inside out.  His headless corpse
            falls forward over the gallery railing.  Then it too
            carbonizes and BURNS UP.


            Relieved, King sinks to his knees.


<b>            BEHIND KING,
</b>

            we SEE Zoe slip from the alcove.  She makes for the stairs.


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT
</b>

            King has bought Abigail more time.  She swings her body
            forward, hooking her legs over the next crosspiece.  Then she
            lets go with her hands.  Now she is hanging upside down,
            secured only by the tension in her calves.


            Abigail reaches behind her, removes her bow.  BLOOD from her
            wounded shoulder drips down over her collar bone, reaching her
            cheek, briefly obscuring her vision.  She wipes it away.  Then
            she reaches back once more and --


            -- because her quiver is pointed downward, a number of arrows
            slide out. Abigail panics, twisting her body --


            -- managing to lust barely snag the ~la~ue arrow as it tumbles
            Past her!


            Beat.  Abigail shuts her eyes, trying to find her center. 
            With her eyes closed, she nocks the arrow and draws the bow
            back.  Then she opens her eyes.


            She's only going to get one shot -- and she's going to have to
            take it while hanging upside down.

            On Drake and Blade below, locked in combat.  She tracks their
            progress, waits for Drake to move into a better position --


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>

            Drake shoulders a support column, SNAPPING it in two.  An
            entire section of the gallery walkway above comes CRASHING
            DOWN, burying Blade in debris --


            -- but it's not enough for Drake.  He LEAPS forward, fishing
            Blade out, hauling him up --


            Drake head-butts Blade -- once, twice.  Blade's eyes roll to
            whites.  Drake looks down, SEES Blade's discarded sword. 
            Drake scoops it up, STRIKES at Blade --


            Blade manages to roll to the side, avoiding the blow.


            Drake STRIKES again, dealing Blade a glancing blow --


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - LIGHTING GANTRY - NIGHT
</b>

            ON ABIGAIL.  Waiting.  More blood has trickled down her neck,
            into her eyes.  But she can't wipe them anymore.  She's
            already got her bow drawn.  She's committed to the shot.


            We can hear ABIGAIL'S HEARTBEAT as she settles.  She takes a
            final breath, holds it -- and lets the plague arrow fly.


<b>            ON THE PLAGUE ARROW
</b>

            as it streaks downward, hurtling towards Drake at more than
            300 feet per second.  Then, at the last possible instant	--


<b>            INT. PHOENIX TOWERS - ATRIUM - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>

            CHINGG!  Drake deflects the arrow with his sword.  It
            harmlessly falls to the floor, rolling a few yards away.


<b>            ON ABIGAIL,
</b>

            stunned, her expression melting into despair.


<b>            BACK TO DRAKE
</b>

            swinging Blade's sword around.  PLUNGING it into Blade's side.
            As he pulls it back out again --


<b>            BLADE
</b>

            GASPS, sinking downward.  He's on his knees now, in shock.


            Drake ROARS again shifting, conjuring up seventy centuries of
            violence and predation.  And the nightmare shape that was only
            hinted at before, finally takes center-stage.


            BLOOD suffuses Drake's flesh, turning his skin crimson.  His
            canines elongate, his lower jaw distends. 
            Jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body -- like he's growing
            a suit of razor-sharp thorns.  He doesn't need a sword
            anymore.  He's become a living weapon.  Drake is gone.  Now he
            is --


<b>            THE BEAST
</b>

            Drake swings the sword overhead.  He's going to decapitate
            Blade.  And just as the sword reaches the top of its arc --


<b>            ZOE
</b>

            emerges from the shadows behind Drake, clutching a silver
            stake.  She SHOVES it into Drake's back,  pushing with all the
            strength her little body can muster.


            Drake staggers.  The blow wasn't lethal, but it hurt all the
            same.  He turns on Zoe, enraged, his attention distracted for
            one crucial second --


<b>            ON BLADE,
</b>

            summoning the last of his reserves.  He pitches his body
            forward, managing to snag the end of the plague arrow.  And
            before Drake even realizes what is happening --


            WHAM!  Blade sinks the plague arrow deep into Drake's chest. 
            Drake drops the sword, turning back to face Blade --


            Exhausted beyond measure, Blade sags.


<b>            INSIDE DRAKE'S CHEST - MACRO SHOT
</b>

            as the arrowhead dispense the bio-weapon.  We SEE the virus
            flooding Drake's internal organs, causing them to blacken as
            his circulatory system carries it throughout his body.


<b>            ON DRAKE'S FACE,
</b>

            letting loose an INHUMAN SCREAM, vomiting up a spray of blood
            mist.  His monstrous features begin to melt, reshaping into
            his more familiar face.  At the same time we --

            Shrinking until we are amidst the spray of blood Drake
            expelled.  We continue shrinking until we are moving with the
            individual molecules of Drake's breath as the plague virions
            latch onto them, causing them to blacken and become necrotic. 
            Moving with the twirling molecules until they are inhaled by --

            having retreated from her defeat by King.  She clutches her
            throat.  We can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny
            BLACK THREADS expand across her face.  She sways, falling onto
            the floor.  She reaches a beseeching hand towards King --


            -- then dies, a final still-born curse on her lips.

            are feeling the effects now too.  One by one they drop,
            choking, going into convulsions.  As they writhe on the floor,
            we watch the Daystar virus ravaging their bodies.


<b>            BACK TO BLADE AND DRAKE
</b>

            Drake slumps against the wall.  Hero and villain are now
            separated by only a few feet.  Both at death's door.


<b>                                DRAKE

            Blade stares back.  At this point, he's just trying to remain
            conscious.  He's lost a ton of blood.

            As the helicopters touch down in the plaza we see a small
            convoy of POLICE and FBI VEHICLES converging around them.


            Cumberland and Hale are among the first out.  They rush
            towards the Phoenix Towers entrance, guns drawn, DOZENS OF

            The first rays of sun penetrate through the atrium windows

            through the atrium, all they find are a series of corpse

            they find Blade.  He's dead, slumped against a wall.  There's
