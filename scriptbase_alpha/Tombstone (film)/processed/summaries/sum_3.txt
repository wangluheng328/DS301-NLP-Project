Wyatt Earp along with his brothers and their wives move to Tombstone to start a new life putting his life as a lawman and gunslinger behind him.
Also coming to Tombstone is Wyatt's good friend, Doc Holliday.
However, it turns out that "The Cowboys" a group of men, among whose members include The Clantons, pretty much act as if they are above the law.
Wyatt would be asked to be Marshall but rejects the offer but his brother, Virgil who can't stomach the violence around him accepts the job over Wyatt's objections.
Eventually a confrontation between them and The Cowboys is going to happen.
And who will survive?
