A disturbing portrayal of teenage life, AIDS, and the Kids of New York City.
Controversial in its content, the film exposes the grim reality of a group of skate-boarders in the space of 24 hours.
Primarily the story consists of Telly (Leo Fitzpatrick) a 17 year old slacker whose mission is to de-flower as many young girls as possible, whilst unprotected.
Things turn bad when an old flame finds out she has tested positive for HIV and the only person she has had sex with is Telly.
She chases through New York to find him but is too late as he has already de-flowered yet another innocent pre-teen.
