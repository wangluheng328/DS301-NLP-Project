Kids follows a group young, unsupervised, not mature, but all-too-grown-up kids in New York.
One girl has just been diagnosed with HIV and is trying to notify the boy who gave it to her, who is on a quest to sexually prey upon innocent girls.
The film follows these characters and their friends through the day, hanging out, playing, carousing, and going to parties.
Each scene is intriguing and disturbing -- conveying an urban reality that includes drugs, sex, guns, and disease; and yet never letting you forget these are *kids*, some of them barely in puberty.
