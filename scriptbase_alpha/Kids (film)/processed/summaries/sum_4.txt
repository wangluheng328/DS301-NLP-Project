The movie Kids is a view of a city kids world.
You watch Telly, a unsupervised teen in the streets of New York taking advantage of innocent young girls not knowing he has HIV but one of the girls he slept with a year before does.
In knowing this she runs the streets looking for him while he plans to deflower another young girl.
And in the midst of all this, you see kids as young as 10 or 11 using drugs and alcohol with some of the older kids.
Kids is basically a movie that warns you what the hell could be happening to your very own child.
