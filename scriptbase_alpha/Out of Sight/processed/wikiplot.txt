A career bank robber, Jack Foley (George Clooney), and a U.S.
Marshal, Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez), are forced to share a car trunk during Foley's escape from a Florida prison.
After he completes his getaway, Foley is chased by Sisco while he and his friends—right-hand man Buddy (Ving Rhames) and unreliable associate Glenn (Steve Zahn)—work their way north to Bloomfield Hills, a wealthy northern suburb of Detroit.
There they plan to pay a visit to shady businessman Ripley (Albert Brooks), who foolishly bragged to them in prison years before about a cache of uncut diamonds hidden in his home.

A vicious criminal named Maurice Miller (Don Cheadle), who also spent time in jail with Jack and Ripley, is planning on hitting up Ripley's mansion with his own crew, including Kenneth (Isaiah Washington) and White Boy Bob (Keith Loneker).
A romantic interlude between Foley and Sisco takes place in a Detroit hotel, but the question of whether she is really pursuing Foley to arrest him or for love ends in a showdown during the robbery at Ripley's home and adds to "the fun" Foley claims they are having.
