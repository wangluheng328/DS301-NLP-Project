	ELECTION by Alexander Payne &amp; JIM Taylor
<b>	
</b>	Third Draft July 22,1997
<b>	
</b>	Based on the novels by Tom Perotta
<b>	
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT. MILLARD HIGH -- DAWN
</b><b>	
</b>	The school stretches out before us, slumbering in the overcast morning 
	air.
<b>	
</b>	Along the front sidewalk, a lone JANITOR trundles a garbage bin filled 
	with overstuffed hefty bags.
<b>	
</b>	A weathered FORD ESCORT pulls into the empty PARKING LOT and comes to 
	a stop near the athletic field.
<b>	
</b><b>	A TEENAGE GIRL'S VOICE -
</b><b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO) 
</b>			None of this would have happened if Mr. 
			McAllister hadn't meddled the way he 
			did.  He should have just accepted 
			things as they are instead of trying to 
			interfere with destiny.  You see, you 
			can't interfere with destiny.  That's 
			why it's destiny.  And if you try to 
			interfere, the same thing's going to 
			happen anyway, and you'll just suffer.
<b>	
</b>	JIM MCALLISTER, a teacher in his mid to late-thirties, emerges from 
	the car in running clothes and carrying a briefcase, gym bag, and 
	coffee mug.  On his way to the field, he crosses paths with the 
	janitor.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Morning, Lowell
<b>	
</b>	Lowell nods, hoists a bag and tosses it into a dumpster.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD -- DAWN
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM CIRCLES THE TRACK, sweating and panting.
<b>	
</b>	ON THE GROUND JIM does sit ups
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Twenty-one... twenty-two.
<b>	
</b>	He collapses onto his back.  His head rolls to one side, and he 
	glances past the fence at --
<b>	
</b><b>	THE PARKING LOT
</b><b>	
</b>	Where a second CAR is just arriving.  JIM watches as TRACY FLICK, a 
	junior, and her MOTHER get out.
<b>	
</b>	The mother helps remove a CARD TABLE and a big plastic sack from the 
	trunk before Tracy heads toward the school.
<b>	
</b><b>					MOTHER
</b>					(distant)
			Good luck!
<b>	
</b>	JIM turns his gaze toward the sky, closes his eyes, sighs.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.    BOYS'    LOCKER   ROOM   --   DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Naked in the showers, JIM pumps liquid soap from the wall- mounted 
	metal dispenser.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.   HILLARD   HALL  DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	THE LEGS OF A CARD TABLE - as Tracy spreads them open and locks them 
	into place.
<b>	
</b>	STICKS OF GUM from a Plen-T-Pack are emptied into a FISHBOWL-
<b>	
</b>	SCOTCH TAPE is wrapped around the end of a pen to attach a piece of 
	string
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOM	DAY
</b><b>	
</b><b>	AT THE MIRROR
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM adjusts the knot of his tie, notices a little shaving cream in his 
	ear.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MILLARD HALL	DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	FOUR CLIPBOARDS  with pens and lined sheets of paper are being placed 
	in a row like little soldiers. The top of every sheet reads "Tracy 
	Flick for President: Official Nomination Signatures."
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. FACULTY LOUNGE -- MORNING
</b><b>	
</b><b>	AT THE REFRIGERATOR
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM tries to place his lunch inside, but the shelves are too crammed 
	with old take-out containers. He opens one and smells it. Disgusted, 
	he drags a garbage can over and begins throwing things away.
<b>	
</b>	Lowell appears in the doorway wheeling his squeaky maintenance cart 
	and watches JIM conduct his purge as A CHINESE FOOD BOX misses the can 
	and rolls on the floor.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MILLARD HALLWAY -- DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Tracy is seated behind her card table strategically placed near the 
	school's main entrance.  A sign taped to the wall behind her reads, 
	TRACY FOR PREZ.  SIGN UP FOR TOMORROW, TODAY!  She checks her watch, 
	readies herself.
<b>	
</b>	JIM walks around the corner whistling vaguely.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>					(chirping)
			You know what they say about the early 
			bird.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Yes, I do.
<b>	
</b>	An awkward moment passes between them.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Well, good luck there, Tracy
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Thanks, Mr. M.
<b>	
</b>	AS JIM turns and walks away, Tracy watches him.  He stops and picks up 
	some litter, tosses it in a nearby garbage can.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			No matter what he says, Mr. McAllister 
			had it out for me from the start.  Oh 
			sure, he was all smiles and good wishes 
			and everything, but underneath he was 
			just as unfair and petty as anybody 
			else.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM	DAY 
</b><b>	
</b>	Alone in his room, JIM studies the Omaha World-Herald
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D) 
</b>			He'll probably tell you how committed 
			he was to teaching and democracy and 
			integrity and all. Don't be fooled.
<b>	
</b>	After laying the paper down to circle an article, JIM leans back in 
	his chair and momentarily loses himself in thought.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			It's hard to remember how the whole 
			thing started, the whole election mess. 
			What I do remember is that I loved my 
			job. I was a teacher, an educator, and I 
			couldn't imagine doing anything else.
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly a VOICE --
<b>	
</b><b>					VOICE (OS)
</b>			Hey, Mr. M. Mr. M.!
<b>	
</b>	JIM glances OUT THE WINDOW and sees a kid -- PAUL METZLER -- pointing 
	at him. Paul walks with a LIMP. Behind him, other STUDENTS approach 
	the school.
<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL
</b>			Stop daydreaming! Get back to work!
<b>	
</b>	JIM enjoys the affectionate joshing and gives the kid  a wave. He 
	returns to his newspaper, a contented man.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			The students knew it wasn't just a job 
			for me.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. MILARD HIGH FOOTBALL STADIUM	-- NIGHT 
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM sits in the bleachers, clapping his  hands  over his head.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			C'mon, wolverines!  Defense!  Let's 
			hold 'em back!
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			I got involved. And I cared.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MILLARD GYM    DAY  AT A PEP RALLY -
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM is dressed as a WESTERN VILLAIN, and his black hat reads "Lincoln 
	South." With a menacing grimace he approaches a group of FOOTBALL 
	PLAYERS at a poker table.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			And I think I made a difference.
<b>	
</b><b>	A CORNER OF THE SCHOOL    DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM has a comforting hand of the shoulder of a CRYING GIRL
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			I knew I touched the students' lives 
			during their difficult young adult 
			years, and I took that responsibility 
			seriously.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT 
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM trots up the stairs to receive a plaque. He beams.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			In the twelve years I taught U.S. 
			History, Civics and current Events at 
			Millard, I was voted Teacher of the Year 
			three times - a school record.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM -- DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Mr. McAllister reads aloud from the newspaper as he paces in front of 
	his class of high school juniors, Tracy Flick among them. The seats 
	are arranged in a SEMI-CIRCLE.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			Standing in front of a room full of 
			young people, trying to make them think 
			that's how I wanted to spend the rest 
			of my life,
<b>	
</b>	JIM slaps the newspaper for emphasis and addresses the class
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM 
</b>			So would this be an ethical situation 
			or a moral situation? What's the 
			difference between ethics and morals, 
			anyway?
<b>	
</b>	Tracy shoots her hand into the air.  JIM notices but keeps looking 
	around.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (CONT'D)
</b>			Anybody
<b>	
</b>	Other hands rise tentatively
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (CONT'D)
</b>			Derek
<b>	
</b><b>					DEREK
</b>			Uh, ethics is like when you, uh, do 
			what society tells you is right and 
			morals are like, uh...
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			You're on the right track,  who can 
			help him out?
<b>	
</b><b>					DEREK
</b>			..morals are when...
<b>	
</b>	Tracy's hand goes higher.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Michelle?
<b>	
</b><b>					MICHELLE
</b>			Morals are like lessons, you know, like 
			the moral of a story; it's what you 
			learn from a story or a fable or 
			something. . .
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Or a life experience.  Good.  And 
			ethics?
<b>	
</b><b>					MICHELLE
</b>			That's more like, urn... Ethics is how 
			you use the morals... that you learn 
			from a story?
<b>	
</b>	JIM weighs the answer, tries to be encouraging.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Okay.  But we're still missing 
			something key here.  What are we 
			missing?
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>					(hand still raised)
			I know.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>					(finally)
			Tracy.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Ethics are...
<b>	
</b>	FREEZE FRAME on Tracy, her hand lowering, her mouth agape.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			Tracy Flick.  Tracy Flick.  I've never 
			met anyone quite like Tracy Flick.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. STUDENT COUNCIL ROOM -- DAY -- ONE YEAR PREVIOUS
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM sits to one side, monitoring the student council MEETING about to 
	convene.  A younger Tracy enters briskly and, unlike her casual teen 
	comrades, has made an attempt to dress for success.  She takes a seat 
	right up front and opens her backpack.
<b>	
</b>	After preparing her notepad and pen, Tracy puts a MICROCASSETTE 
	RECORDER on the table in front of her and pushes RECORD.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			She first showed up in my life as a 
			freshman delegate in student council. 
			I'd seen a lot of ambitious students 
			come and go over the years, but I could 
			tell right away Tracy Flick was 
			different.
<b>	
</b>	JIM observes Tracy, trying to size her up.
<b>	
</b>	ON TRACY -- putting all her little things in order, finally folding 
	her hands to wait.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			It wasn't long before everyone knew who 
			Tracy Flick was.  She made sure of that.  
			Her drive was astonishing.  Even scary.
<b>	
</b><b>	A FAST-PACED MONTAGE BEGINS UNDER TRACY'S VOICE-OVER:
</b><b>	
</b>	INSERT	HILLARD HIGH YEARBOOK It fans open to the INDEX.
<b>	
</b>	PAN DOWN to Tracy's name followed by countless page references
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>			Some people say I'm an overachiever, 
			but I think they're just jealous.
<b>	
</b>	A page number turns BOLD, and the other numbers drop away
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly we are on that page, and we PAN to a headline: "Spanish Club 
	says Oh La!"
<b>	
</b>	PAN to the group shot and ZOOM in on Tracy smiling in a big SOMBRERO.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>			My Mom always tells me I'm different -- 
			you know, special. And if you look at 
			all the things I've accomplished so far, 
			I think you'd have to agree.
<b>	
</b>	We see Tracy on other pages too: "Yearbook Staff goes for it!" "Junior 
	Achievers put on the dog!" "Student Council meets the challenge;" 
	Oklahoma's a hit!
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D) 
</b>			Here I am in Oklahoma.
<b>	
</b>	The STILL of Tracy in Oklahoma suddenly COMES TO LIFE.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MILLARD HIGH AUDITORIUM	NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	On stage, Tracy wears a cowgirl outfit and hams it up with exaggerated 
	gestures.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>					(off-key) 
			I'm just a girl who can't say no...
<b>	
</b><b>	TV INSERT/INT. CAFETERIA	DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	It's the closed-circuit school NEWS BROADCAST. Tracy is delivering a 
	stand-up report from the crowded cafeteria. Her dress and makeup are 
	an obvious if lame emulation of a professional newswoman.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			And here I am on KMHS, our student-run 
			TV station.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (ON TV)
</b>			..that's why Principal Hendricks made 
			the controversial announcement that the 
			littering must stop.  Tracy Flick 
			reporting.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. STUDENT COUNCIL MEETING ROOM -- AFTERNOON
</b><b>	
</b>	A Student Council meeting is underway led by the president, LARRY 
	FOUCH.  A girl, ASHLEY, is speaking.  JIM observes from the side.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			But it was in SGA, the Student 
			Government Association, where I made my 
			biggest mark.  I never missed a meeting, 
			and I volunteered for every committee as 
			long as I could lead it.
<b>	
</b>	Before Ashley can finish, Tracy STANDS UP
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			I agree with Ashley.  We should rent 
			the barrels at least a day beforehand.  
			What happened last time was a travesty,  
			I mean, we were --

			I think you should know.

<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			Her pussy gets so wet you can't believe 
			it.
<b>	
</b><b>	WIDE -
</b><b>	
</b>	Dave is leaning across his desk to speak with JIM at an adjacent work 
	area.  They eat sack lunches.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			A few months before the election, she'd 
			had an affair with my best friend Dave 
			Novotny.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Don't tell me that.  I don't want to 
			know that.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			She's incredible.  Everything just gets 
			soaked.
<b>	
</b>	INT. JIM'S BASEMENT	DAY Dun-dun-DUN... Dun-dun-DUN
<b>	
</b>	JIM and Dave are playing the opening notes of "Foxy Lady" through 
	cheap, distorting amps. JIM plays bass. Dave plays guitar and sings 
	into a microphone. They're bad. As in not good.
<b>	
</b>	The basement is typical of a Midwest middle-class young couple -- half 
	storage and laundry, half makeshift roc-room.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			Dave came to Millard the year after I 
			did, and we hit it off right away. We 
			backed each other up in teachers' 
			meetings and shared an interest in 60's 
			music and micro-breweries.
<b>	
</b>	CLOSE ON DAVE really getting into it, playing to an unseen stadium. 
	Behind him JIM is very careful with his chords.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			You could tell Dave was one of those 
			guys who taught because they never 
			wanted to leave high school in the first 
			place, and that could get a little 
			irritating sometimes, but basically he 
			was a real good guy.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE 
</b>					(singing)
			Foxy. . . Foxy. . . You know you're a 
			cute little heartbreaker... Foxy... You

</b><b>	
</b>	CAMERA DRIFTS from the open basement stairway door and toward DIANE 
	MCALLISTER and SHERRY NOVOTNY seated at the kitchen  table. They are 
	fussing over little six-month-old DARRYL NOVOTNY in his highchair.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			Our wives became best friends too. And 
			when Dave and Sherry's son Darryl was 
			born, they asked us to be godparents.

</b>	At a particularly grating note from downstairs, Diane gets up and 
	closes the basement door.

</b><b>	
</b>	AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE is being drawn on the blackboard and bisected. 
	PULL  OUT to reveal Dave explaining.
<b>	
</b>	The class is taking notes, and we zero in on a younger Tracy.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>			YOU probably think the worst - that Mr. 
			Novotny was just taking advantage of one 
			of his students, but it wasn't like that 
			at all. Our relationship was based on 
			mutual respect and admiration. I mean, 
			during my sophomore year in geometry it 
			was strictly professional between us -- 
			I mean, nothing.

	with six other students.
<b>	
</b><b>	TWO KIDS  DISSOLVE OUT OF FRAME,

	same way, until only Dave and Tracy remain.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>			One night he took us editors out to 
			celebrate after a deadline. Eventually 
			Dave and I were left alone and we got to 
			talking - not like teacher and student, 
			but like two adults.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			You know, Tracy... I don't know how to 
			say this, but...
<b>	
</b>	Dave's finger traces the rim of his frosty root beer mug.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			what?
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			Well, I notice you don't seem to have 
			any close friends at Millard. You seem 
			to be kind of a loner.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			I know.  I know its not by choice.  I 
			just mean, well, being the kind of 
			person you are, it must be really 
			difficult to find someone you can talk 
			to.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			What do you mean? What kind of person 
			am I?
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			What kind of person?
<b>	
</b>	Dave looks directly into her eyes.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE (CONT'D)
</b>			Tracy, I've been watching you for going 
			on two years now, and I think you are 
			one of the most talented, hard-working, 
			sensitive, attractive, brilliant 
			students -- no, human beings -- I have 
			ever met.  I mean, you're the real 
			thing.  Special.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>					(embarrassed, low)
			Thank you.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			And I know sometimes people like you 
			have to pay a price for their greatness, 
			and that price is loneliness.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy nods in quiet recognition.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE (CONT'D)
</b>			I don't know.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But it 
			seems like you might need a friend.

</b>	DISSOLVE through the door and TRAVEL through an empty room to discover 
	another door with a sign that reads DARKROOM.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			Since I grew up without a dad, you 
			might assume psychologically I was 
			looking for a father figure.
<b>	
</b>	DISSOLVE through the darkroom door to
<b>	
</b>	DAVE AND TRACY bathed in red light.  Tracy is sitting on Dave's lap as 
	they make out hungrily.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>			But that had nothing to do with it at 
			all.  It was just that Dave was so 
			strong and made me feel so safe and 
			protected.

</b><b>	
</b>	Dave drives.  Tracy sits in the passenger seat.

	behind him.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. NOVOTHY LIVIMG ROOM
</b><b>	
</b>	Dave stands up from his squat at the STEREO, and the sexy sounds of 
	Sade set the mood.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy is seated awkwardly at one end of the sofa, a Diet Dr. Pepper in 
	one hand.  Dave walks slowly toward her, a sexy, knowing look in his 
	eye.  The music is sexy.  Tracy is sexy. He's sexy.  Keeping his eyes 
	locked on Tracy's, he takes the pop can from her hand and takes a sip 
	himself.  Sexy.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  NOVOTHY STAIRCASE	DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Dave and Tracy walk up the stairs and down the hall.  Dave enters the

</b><b>	INT. NOVOTNY BEDROOM	DAY

</b>	IN QUICK TIGHT CUTS we see Dave and Tracy DISROBING
<b>	
</b>	Tracy's head and naked shoulders lay themselves on Dave's pillow.  She 
	looks toward the foot of the bed at -- DAVE, unable to believe his 
	eyes.  He looks at naked Tracy up and down, up and down, his breath 
	quickening.  Sade wafts up the stairs.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE 
</b>			Look at you.
<b>	
</b>	He descends out of frame.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			When I think back on my relationship 
			with Mr. Novotny, what I miss most. is 
			our talks.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. DAVE'S BASEMENT	DAY 
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM is riveted by Dave's story; he is both horrified and titillated
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			You did it at your house?  Your own 
			house?
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all 
			seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, 
			you know, for the... for the sex and the 
			danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, 
			what I'm trying to tell you is that 
			Tracy and I are totally, totally in 
			love.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			In love?
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she 
			inspires me in ways Sherry never has.  
			She even wants to read my novel.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			But you haven't written your novel.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			That's the whole point. It's all in my 
			head; it's right here.  I just got to 
			get it out there. Tracy wants me to 
			write it so she can read it.  It's 
			beautiful.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Dave, I'm just saying this as your 
			friend.  What you're doing is really, 
			really wrong, and you've got to stop.
<b>	
</b>	Dave draws a heavy sigh and buries his head in his hands perhaps JIM 
	has reached him.  Perhaps not.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			You're not just jealous, are you?  I 
			mean, we both used to talk about her
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>					(exploding)
			That was just talk!  Fantasy talk! What 
			are you, nuts?  We talk about girls all 
			the time, but it doesn't mean anything.  
			I would never. . . I mean, I take very 
			seriously our strict moral code.  The 
			line you've crossed is... it's illegal 
			and it's immoral.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, 
			okay?  I know what --
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm 
			talking about morals.
<b>	
</b><b>	CLICK.  SQUEAK.  STEP STEP STEP.

</b>			Peek-a-boo!
<b>	
</b>	Sherry comes down the basement stairs with Darryl in her arms.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>					(to Jim, 
					whispering)
			Look, I appreciate your concern. I 
			really do.  But like I said, I got it 
			under control.
<b>	
</b>	As Sherry approaches them, Dave rises to take Darryl, the perfect 
	father:  hug, tickle, kiss.

</b>			I guess I don't have to tell you how 
			all this turned out.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  PRINCIPAL HENDRICK'S OFFICE	DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	CLOSE ON DAVE slumped in a chair.  He is lost in agony: all he can do 
	is look down and draw short, gasping breaths.
<b>	
</b>	Principal Walt Hendricks is at his desk, examining a little BOOKLET.  
<b>	JIM
</b>	sits on the vinyl sofa.
<b>	
</b>	CLOSE ON -- the small makeshift booklet whose cover reads, "There's a 
	place for us" in overdone fancy cursive.
<b>	
</b>	THE SECOND PAGE shows a cutout from a travel magazine of a swanky 
	BEACHFRONT HOTEL.  One room has been circled with the words "you and 
	me" written next to it.  Below: "A time and place for us."  We HEAR 
	Walt clearing his throat, swallowing.
<b>	
</b>	THE THIRD PAGE has glued to it a POSTCARD showing a couple hand-in-
	hand on the beach at sunset and reading, "Maui is for lovers." Below: 
	Take my hand and we'll soon be there.
<b>	
</b>	THE LAST PAGE has a cutout of a bouquet of flowers.  It reads, "Tracy,  
	See you in paradise?  Love, your 'teacher' David.  P.S. I really, 
	really need you now."  The booklet is lowered.
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			Tracy's Mom -- she doesn't understand.
<b>	
</b><b>					WALT
</b>			No, I'd say she doesn't.  I don't think 
			I've ever seen a mother quite so upset.  
			We're all very, very lucky she doesn't 
			want this public.
<b>	
</b>	Dave looks at JIM for help. JIM looks away. Dave's breaths grow more 
	convulsive. Finally -
<b>	
</b><b>					DAVE 
</b>			But we're in love
<b>	
</b><b>					WALT 
</b>			Dave. Dave, look at me
<b>	
</b>	Dave looks slowly up.

</b>			After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him 
			out of the house and filed for divorce.
<b>	
</b><b>					SHERRY
</b>			Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
<b>	
</b>	Dave follows Sherry as she takes the baby into their bedroom and slams 
	the door in Dave's face. Dave pounds on the door, eventually sinking 
	to his knees and crying.

</b><b>					DAVE
</b>			Sherry   Sherry  Sheerrry. ...

<b>	
</b>	At the bell, students instantly shut their textbooks and collect their 
	things.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Okay.  We'll pick up here next time
<b>	
</b>	Tracy is miffed as she puts her things away: slam, stuff, zip. She 
	slings her backpack over her shoulder and heads toward the door.  She 
	looks back at --
<b>	
</b>	MR. MCALLISTER who himself now FREEZES as he talks to a couple of 
	students
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			Now that I have more life experience, I

<b>	
</b>	CLOSE-UP FROZEN DETAILS - of Jim's appearance - his slightly frayed 
	collar and bad tie; the heels of his old docksiders worn down at 
	irritating angles; the faded impression his too-big wallet has made in 
	his khakis; his growing bald spot; his ear hairs.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			I mean, anyone who's stuck in the same 
			little room saying the exact same things 
			year after year for his whole life, 
			wearing the same stupid clothes, while 
			his students go on to good colleges and 
			move to big cities and do great things 
			and make loads of money has got to be at

			sabotage the strong.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy turns and walks out the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  TRACY'S HOUSE -- DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	CLOSE ON A SMILING LITTLE TRACY - in a Sears-style portrait.  PAN 
	across a wall full of other framed photos of Tracy accepting awards, 
	dancing in a recital, poised to dive at a swim meet.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>			One thing that's important to know 
			about me is that I'm an only child.  So

			but couldn't.
<b>	
</b><b>	AT THE DINING ROOM TABLE
</b><b>	
</b>	Tracy's mother, BARBARA FLICK, finishes a letter and puts it in an 
	envelope.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>			See, Mom used to be a stewardess for 
			Northwest and now works as a para-legal.  
			She likes to write letters to successful 
			women like Janet Reno and Elizabeth Dole 
			and ask them how they got to be where 
			they are and what advice do they have

</b>	CLOSE ON BARBARA'S TONGUE as the envelope flap slides across it.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MILLARD HALLWAY	DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A politician's SMILE plastered to her face, Tracy is at her card table 
	vigorously gathering signatures.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO CONT'D)
</b>			Nine times out of ten they say you have 
			to hold on to your dreams no matter

<b>	
</b>	A shabbily dressed BURNOUT -- DOUG SCHENKEN -- walks past and grabs a 
	huge handful of gum.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			One per person!  Put those back I

<b>	
</b><b>	INT. HILLARD LIBRARY -- DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	While other students sit in groups around her, Tracy sits apart at her 
	own table, concentrated and alone. She is writing little numbers by 
	her signatures.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Ninety-seven.. .ninety-eight.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			But you know,  winning isn't

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM

</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Here they are.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			You can put those in my box.  I'll look

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>					(resigned)
			Right
<b>	
</b>	He cursorily flips through the bound pages and offers them back to 
	Tracy.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (CONT'D)
</b>			Looks good to me.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Aren't you supposed to keep them?
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			NO, that's fine
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			I thought you were supposed to keep

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM 
</b>			Okay, fine. Sure
<b>	
</b>	JIM throws his briefcase and Tracy's folder into the backseat.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Thanks for everything.
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>					(cheery, awkward)
			I can't wait to start campaigning.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Should be easy.  So far no competition.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's

			I guess that's how come they stay number 
			one.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Yeah.  Okay.  well, good luck Tracy
<b>	
</b>	They exchange a long, curious stare.  There's a tone at once 
	confrontational and vaguely sexual about this moment.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			You know, Mr. M., when I win the 
			presidency, that means you and I are 
			going to be spending a lot of time 
			together next year.  And I for one would 
			like that time to be harmonious and 
			productive. Wouldn't you?
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Sure
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Okay. That's good. I just wanted to

<b>	
</b>	Out of his window come yellowed newspapers, balled-up fast food bags, 
	and other detritus. He speeds away.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			Thank God for Diane.  She was my best

			Oh sure, we'd had our share of bumpy

</b><b>	
</b>	In the darkness a light pops on, and JIM quietly pads down the stairs.
<b>	
</b>	He opens an old CEDAR TRUNK, lifts out a few blankets and a piece of 
	cardboard to reveal a row of PORNO TAPES cleverly concealed in the 
	bottom of the trunk.
<b>	
</b><b>	ON THE TV SCREEN -
</b><b>	
</b>	A FOOTBALL PLAYER in uniform and helmet filets a CHEERLEADER in a 
	locker room.
<b>	
</b>	JIM watches with detachment, as though watching the news.  He sips a 
	can of PEPSI.  The football stud continues to bump and grind.  Looking

			don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL
</b>			What do you mean?
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Let me give you a clue.  You're a born 
			leader.  You're one of the most popular 
			students at Millard.  You're honest and 
			straightforward.  You don't choke under 
			pressure, as we all saw in that amazing 
			fourth quarter against Westside.  The 
			other kids look up to you.  What does 
			that spell?
<b>	
</b>	Paul furrows his brow and looks around, searching for an answer.  His 
	lower lip is wet.

</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Yeah, no, she's a go-getter, all right.
<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL
</b>			And she's super-nice
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Yeah.  But one person assured of

			dictatorship, like we studied.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL
</b>			Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Okay, let's say
<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL
</b>			No, wait -- apples.  Apples.
<b>	
</b>	JIM draws illustrative circles on the board as he speaks.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was 
			apples.  Apples, apples and more apples.  
			You might think apples were pretty good, 
			even if you occasionally got a rotten 
			one. Then one day there's an orange. And 
			now you can make a decision. Do you want 
			an apple, or do you want an orange?  
			That's democracy.
<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL
</b>			I also like bananas.
<b>

	microphone. His head lists to one side, and he takes  long breaths as 
	he speaks.
<b>	
</b><b>					JERRY
</b>			I love Millard High, and I will be a 
			dedicated vice President. A vote for 
			Jerry Slavin is a vote for good 
			government. And even if I can't really 
			stand up for you, I will.
					(cracks himself up)
			Thank you.
<b>	
</b>	Jerry motors away amid scattered applause and coughs.  JIM steps 
	forward, clapping, and raises the mike.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Thank you, Jerry, and good luck. Again, 
			Jerry is running unopposed for Vice 
			President. So we'll move on now to the 
			presidential race with three candidates 
			running. The first in alphabetical order 
			is Tracy Flick.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy steps forward with a small stack of index cards. During her 
	speech she flips the cards over one by one but rarely looks at them.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Poet Henry David Thoreau once wrote, "I 
			cannot make my days longer, so I strive 
			to make them better."  With this 
			election, we here at Millard also have 
			an opportunity to make our high school 
			days better.  During this campaign I 
			have had the opportunity to speak with 
			many of you about your concerns.  I 
			spoke with freshman Eliza Ramirez, who 
			told me how alienated she feels from her 
			own homeroom.  I spoke with sophomore 
			Reggie Banks, who said his mother works 
			in a cafeteria and can't afford to buy 
			him enough spiral notebooks for his 
			classes.  I won't bore you with long-
			winded promises about all the new and 
			innovative things I will definitely 
			achieve during the year in which it will 
			be my honor and privilege to represent 
			each and every one of you, but I can say 
			that my years of experience on the 
			student council have taught me the three 
			most important attributes the president 
			needs to possess;  commitment -
<b>	
</b><b>					DOUG SCHENKEN
</b>			Eat me
<b>	
</b><b>					DOUG'S BUDDY 
</b>			Eat me raw!
<b>	
</b>	There is  scattered laughter. Tracy pauses, wait Hendricks bounds up 
	and grabs the mike.
<b>	
</b><b>					WALT
</b>			If you can't be adults and give these 
			candidates the courtesy they deserve, 
			then you don't deserve to be called 
			adults but children* Because that's what 
			children are. And you'll be treated like 
			children. So let's all listen up.
<b>	
</b>	Walt backs away to his seat. Tracy resumes
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			The three most important attributes the 
			president needs to possess are: 
			commitment, qualifications, and 
			experience.  I'll add one more; caring.  
			I care about Millard, and I care about 
			each and every one of you, and together 
			we can all make a difference.  One of 
			the things I would like to establish is 
			a regular open forum where any student 
			can come and voice their concern about 
			issues we face here at Millard.  I and 
			the rest of the student council would 
			then interface with the faculty and 
			staff, so a continuous dialogue would 
			exist.
<b>	
</b>	Walt whispers to Jim.
<b>	
</b><b>					WALT
</b>			I'd say she knows a thing or two about 
			student-faculty dialogue.
<b>	
</b>	JIM nods solemnly
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			When you cast your vote for Tracy Flick 
			next week, you won't just be voting for 
			me.  You'll be voting for yourself and 
			for every other student Our days won't 
			be any longer, but they can sure be 
			better.  Thank you.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy smiles and walks back to her folding chair.  There is polite 
	applause and a few whistles.  JJJB comes back to the microphone.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy takes her seat next to Paul and glances at him.  Paul scares 
	straight ahead, a fat bead of sweat on his forehead. One of his legs 
	is jiggling.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			The next candidate for student body 
			president is Paul Metzier.  Paul?
<b>	
</b>	Paul awkwardly makes his way to the mike.   Though by no means 
	thunderous, his applause clearly exceeds Tracy's.  A small cluster of 
	jocks "woof" for him, shaking their fists in the air.  Paul manages a 
	weak grin for his buddies.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy shifts in her chair, her smile stiff and forced
<b>	
</b>	Lisa smiles and nods at Paul from the bleachers, giving him 
	encouragement and a silent reminder to remember what they talked 
	about.
<b>	
</b>	Tammy's eyes dart between Lisa and Paul. She shows no emotion, reveals 
	nothing.
<b>	
</b>	The applause quickly dies, and after a moment Paul remembers to look 
	at the white paper in his hand. He speaks in a barely audible 
	monotone, never once glancing up.
<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL
</b>			As many of you know I broke my leg 
			pretty bad thi3 year and the experience 
			has made me reevaluate what I want to do 
			with my life and that is help people 
			when you think about it a school is more 
			than a school it's our second home where 
			we spend all cur time and grow as 
			individuals and a community but is our 
			school everything it could be I want our 
			school to reach its true potential that 
			is why I am running for president.
<b>	
</b>	JIM pinches the bridge of his nose, clearly pained
<b>	
</b>	A few loud SOUND EFFECT SNORES saw through the air, and Walt points a 
	stern finger at - you guessed it -- Doug Schenken.
<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL
</b>			I know what it is to fight hard and win 
			like when we almost went to state last 
			fall and I threw that fourth-quarter 
			pass against Westside for the touchdown 
			that won the game by three points I 
			won't let you down like I didn't then I 
			promise we can all score a winning
					(big breath)
			touchdown together. Vote Paul Metzier 
			for president thank you.
<b>	
</b>	Paul now gets considerably less applause, but his jock friends remain 
	loyal.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Okay, Paul. Now our final candidate for 
			President - another one of the Metzier 
			clan -- sophomore Tammy Metzier.
<b>	
</b>	Tammy approaches the mike. There are scattered mocking whistles and 
	catcalls.
<b>	
</b>	Tammy calmly looks over the crowd, waiting for the jeers to subside. 
	She makes eye contact with Lisa, who stares back.
<b>	
</b><b>					WALT 
</b>			People.  People I
<b>	
</b>	The room quiets down.  Tammy puts her lips close to the mike,
<b>	
</b><b>					TAMMY
</b>			Who cares about this stupid election?
<b>	
</b>	NOW there's something worth listening to.
<b>	
</b><b>					TAMMY (CONT'D)
</b>			We all know it doesn't matter who gets 
			elected president of Millard. You think 
			it's going to change anything around 
			here, make one single person happier or 
			smarter or nicer? The only person it 
			matters to is the one who gets elected.  
			The same pathetic charade happens every 
			year, and everyone makes the same 
			pathetic promises just so they can put 
			it on their transcripts to get into 
			college.  So vote for me, because I 
			don't even want to go to college, and I 
			don't care, and as president I won't do 
			anything.  The only promise I make is 
			that if elected I will immediately 
			dismantle the student government, so 
			that none of us will ever have to sit 
			through one of these stupid assemblies 
			again!
<b>	
</b>	There is a sudden huge cathartic eruption of cheers and applause.  
	Tammy has set them free.  Even cynical old Doug Schenken and his 
	buddies join in.
<b>	
</b><b>					STUDENTS 
</b>			Tammy!   Tammy!  Tammy!
<b>	
</b>	In total control, she steps back from the mike and CURTSIES.
<b>	
</b>	Walt shoots an angry, confused look at Jim, who shrugs. Tracy is 
	clearly upset, but her smile remains eerily fixed Paul just looks 
	confused and ashamed.  Jerry Slavin is convulsed in laughter and 
	chants along with the multitude.
<b>	
</b>	Tammy quickly grabs the mike for one final exhortation.
<b>

	NOVOTNY peers proudly from behind two of the taller students. A CURSOR 
	in the shape of tiny SCISSORS makes a small circle around Dave's face.  
	Suddenly, the cursor turns into a tiny HAND and drags Dave's dislodged 
	head into the TRASH.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy concentrates as she deftly controls the mouse.

</b><b>	INT. MILLARD HIGH HALLWAY -- NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Tracy is heading down the hall toward the exit when she rounds a 
	corner and, suddenly deeply troubled, sees that
<b>	
</b>	HER NEW "WHO CARES?" BANNER has come loose on an upper corner and is 
	drooping.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy puts down her things and JUMPS up to slap the corner back into 
	place.  Satisfied, she turns away.  But then - SHOOP!  The banner 
	fights back, peeling even further from the wall.  Tracy prepares for 
	battle.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. YEARBOOK OFFICE	NIGHT 
</b><b>	
</b>	Tracy enters and grabs a long aluminum STRAIGHT-EDGE.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. HALLWAY	NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Standing on an overturned GARBAGE CAN and wielding the straight-edge, 
	Tracy tries to smooth the banner. But she's not holding the ruler flat 
	against the wall and -- RIP! -- she slices the banner lengthwise. Now 
	the plastic garbage can begins to buckle. Struggling to retain her 
	balance, Tracy accidentally hooks the banner and as she TUMBLES yanks 
	the whole thing down.
<b>	
</b>	Overcome with anger and frustration, she thrashes around on the ground 
	and TEARS UP what remains of her banner.
<b>	
</b>	PAUL METZLER smiles down at Tracy from his poster across the hall.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy looks up at it. Instantly she is on her feet, lunging for the 
	poster. She jumps up, TEARS it down, and RIPS Paul's head into pieces.
<b>	
</b>	Blood issues from a thin paper cut on one hand. Tracy regards it at 
	first without comprehending, then raises it to her mouth. While 
	sucking her wound, her gaze falls on --
<b>	
</b>	ANOTHER SMILING PAUL mocking her pain.
<b>	
</b><b>	ANGLE FROM WAY DOWN THE HALL
</b><b>	
</b>	Hurricane Tracy begins a savage assault on the fragile coast of 
	Millard High. Paul's campaign posters fill the air, shredded to pieces 
	by the powerful winds of jealousy and rage.

</b>	to Tracy even farther down the hall, still jumping, still ripping.
<b>	
</b>	TRACK FROM OVERHEAD - THE HALLWAY FLOOR - where a thousand bits of 
	Paul lie scattered -- a grinning mouth here, an eye there.
<b>	
</b>	TILT UP finally to Tracy, sweating, panting.  She finishes ripping a 
	poster and looks to find another.  But there are no more Paul posters: 
	she has destroyed them all.  Tracy raises her hands and sees they are 
	streaked with Blood.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. GIRLS ' BATHROOM	NIGHT

</b>	With a big shove Tracy sends the bag cartwheeling down the hill 
	Breathing hard but clearly relieved, Tracy watches the evidence of her

</b>	as Tammy draws near. She pauses at first, but intrepid curiosity 
	conquers her fear. She unties the knot.

<b>	
</b><b>	NOW AT THE SINK
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM washes his hands.  Sherry glances between JIM and the water 
	running in the shower.  It's getting steamy.
<b>	
</b><b>					SHERRY
</b>			Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			No, I... uh, didn't know that

</b>			We'll let it run awhile

	another.
<b>	
</b><b>					SHERRY 
</b>			This one's clean.
<b>	
</b>	JIM takes it and dries his hands.  Sherry now stands very close to 
	him.  JIM
	sets the towel on the sink.  It's a little awkward as they look into 
	each other's eyes, standing so near.
<b>	
</b><b>					SHERRY (CONT'D)
</b>			I guess you'd better get to work huh?  
			You're going to be late.
<b>	
</b>	She slowly wraps her arms around Jim's neck and pulls him to her, a 
	hug of gratitude and warmth -- nothing sexual here, just the embrace 
	of two people in need of shelter from the storm of life.  No, nothing 
	sexual at all.
<b>	
</b><b>					SHERRY (CONT'D) 
</b>			Thank you, Jim.

	wander, cheek brushes cheek.  Finally lips meet, tenderly at first.  
	And then it is a deluge.

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			I guess you know why you're here

</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			If it's about the posters, I think it's

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, 
			because I think you did it.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Wait - are you accusing me? You're not 
			serious. 
					(indignant)
			I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have 
			worked together on SGA for three solid

</b>			Mr. M., I am running on my

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Were you or were you not working in the 
			Watchdog office over the weekend?
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			I was.  So?  Mr. Pecharda let me in.  
			As you know, with all my

			But I left very early, around 6:30.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			6:30.  How do you know what time the

<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			I don't.  I just know they were there 
			when I left.  I'm giving you helpful 
			information is all.  You know, instead 
			of wasting time interrogating me, we 
			should be out there trying to find out

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did 
			it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			well, I don't know.  It could have been

			subversive elements around Millard.  You 
			know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck 
			and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken -
			what about him?  Or what about Tammy
			Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti-
			this and anti-that.
<b>	
</b>	JIM shifts gears
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			You're a very intelligent girl, Tracy.  
			You have many admirable qualities.  But 
			someday maybe you'll learn that being 
			smart and always being on top and doing 
			whatever you need to do to get ahead, 
			and yes, stepping on people to get 
			there, well, there's a lot more to life 
			than that.  And in the end, you're only 
			cheating yourself.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Why are you lecturing me?
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			This isn't the time or the place to get 
			into it, but there is, for just one 
			example, a certain former colleague of 
			mine, who made a very big mistake, a 
			life mistake.  I think the lesson there 
			is that, old and young, we ail make 
			mistakes, and we have to learn that our 
			actions, all of them, can carry serious 
			consequences.  You're very young, Tracy 
			underage, in fact -- but maybe one
			day you'll understand.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			I don't know what you're referring to, 
			but I do know that if certain older and 
			wiser people hadn't acted like such 
			little babies and gotten all mushy, 
			everything would be okay.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			I agree.  But I also think certain 
			young and naive people need to thank 
			their lucky stars and be very, very 
			grateful the whole school didn't find 
			out about certain indiscretions which 
			could have ruined their reputations, and 
			chances to win certain elections.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			And I think certain older persons like 
			you and your "colleague" shouldn't be 
			leaching after their students, 
			especially when some of them can't even 
			get their own wives pregnant.  And they 
			certainly shouldn't be running around 
			making slanderous accusations.  
			Especially when certain young, naive 
			people's mothers are para-legal 
			secretaries at the city's biggest law 
			firm and have won many successful 
			lawsuits. And if you want to keep 
			questioning me like this, I won't 
			continue without my attorney present.

</b><b>	
</b>	JIM enters the back door and sets his satchel down in the usual place.  
	He opens the refrigerator, grabs a beer.  As he closes the door, 
	something catches his eye.  He reaches inside and throws a plastic 
	container away.  Rooting around noisily, he finds other things to 
	dispose of.  Suddenly --
<b>	
</b>	A BABY CRY stops him cold.
<b>	
</b>	JIM stiffens, his good eye widening as the horrible truth sinks in.

</b>	together on the living room sofa, staring at him.  Their eyes are red 
	from crying.  Little Darryl squirms in Sherry's lap.
<b>	
</b>	Caught, JIM emerges from his hiding place.  No one speaks. Finally, he 
	looks down, sucks in air, blows it out again, nods a little.

	and alone.  The camera slowly CRANES UP, eventually looking down on 
	him from a great height.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			As I walked out of my home that 
			evening, unsure if I'd ever return, my 
			entire life in question, I somehow 
			discovered within myself a place of 
			perfect peace.   Oddly, in my solitude I 
			felt more than ever a sense of communion 
			with every human being - past, present 
			and future.  Because no matter what we 
			tell ourselves, no matter what illusions 
			of friendship and family we create, each 
			of us is always and forever profoundly 
			alone.

			the election tomorrow, because I deserve

			I'm asking that You go that one last

			Your will on Earth as it is in Heaven.

			I want people to be nicer to each other.  
			I want Lisa to realize what a bitch she 
			has been and feel really bad and 
			apologize for how she hurt me and know 
			how much I still love her.  In spite of 
			everything, I still want Paul to win the

			things, like good health, nice parents, 
			a nice truck, and what I've been told is 
			a large penis, and I'm very grateful.  
			But I sure am worried about Tammy.  In 
			my heart I still can't believe she tore 
			down my posters, but sometimes she does 
			get so weird and angry.  Please help her 
			be a happier person, because she's so 
			smart and sensitive, and I love her.  
			Also, I'm nervous about the election 
			tomorrow, and I guess I want to win and 
			all, but I know that's totally up to 
			You.  You'll decide who the best person

<b>	
</b>	Now cradling his head on the roof of his car, JIM gathers what little 
	strength he has, gets in, and tries to start the cold engine.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			I had no choice but to go home. I

			weeks, you've heard candidates for the 
			various offices make their speeches and 
			tell you where they stand.  You've 
			probably seen their posters.  Maybe 
			you've even had a chance to speak with 
			them personally.

</b>			Phil you ready?
<b>	
</b><b>					PHIL
</b>			Ready.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy exits the booth and heads toward the BALLOT BOX.  She inserts 
	her ballot halfway and freezes, smiling.  Phil snaps a picture, but -
<b>	
</b><b>					PHIL 
</b>			Just a second.  My flash.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy remains perfectly still while Phil fiddles with his camera.  A

</b>	THE BALLOT BOX is being carried through the halls and up some stairs

</b><b>	
</b>	JIM is hunkered over his desk.  He's a wreck: dark, dark circles under

	And he's near tears.
<b>	
</b>	Larry Fouch and his retinue enter cheerfully
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			Okay, Mr. M.
<b>	
</b>	Larry drops the ballot box on Jim's desk
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			What?  Right.  So let's start counting.
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			Well, I thought that... well, the way 
			it always works is that SGA president 
			does a count, then the SGA advisor, you 
			know, for the two independent counts.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Fine.  So do your count.  Start with 
			president, and I'll be right back.
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			You have the key, Mr. McAllister.

</b>	JIM doesn't understand at first, then
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Right.  I know.
<b>	
</b>	JIM proceeds to sort through his cluttered desk drawers but can't seem 
	to find the key.  The council members exchange concerned looks as 
	Jim's search becomes frenzied.

</b><b>					LARRY 
</b>			Are you okay, Mr. M.?
<b>	
</b><b>					ANOTHER STUDENT 
</b>			What happened to your eye?

<b>	
</b>	JIM emerges from the drawer wielding a VISE GRIP.  He goes to the box 
	and TEARS the entire hardware assembly off.  Holding the mangled lock, 
	he turns to the students, who look back STUNNED.

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>					(impatient)
			What d'you got?
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			I'm not supposed to tell. Not until 
			you've counted too. We're each supposed 
			to make an independent count.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			You're kidding, right?
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			I thought those were the rules, Mr.

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Larry, we're not electing the fucking 
			Pope here. Just tell me who won.
<b>	
</b>	Jim's use of profanity scares Larry, and he responds reluctantly
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			It's a squeaker, Mr. M. I've got Tracy 
			by a vote. Just one vote.
<b>	
</b>	Jim, who hasn't cared about any of this today, suddenly takes note. He 
	stares blankly at Larry as the news sinks in.
<b>

</b>			Mr. M.?

</b>			Sputnik.
<b>	
</b>	MR. FLAGG is lecturing, really trying to make history come alive.  
	Tracy takes notes, but she is noticeably distracted.
<b>	
</b><b>					MR. FLAGG 
</b>			Right.  And what year was that?
<b>	
</b><b>					DALE
</b><b>			1958?
</b><b>	
</b><b>					MR. FLAGG
</b>			Almost.  1957.  So the point here is 
			when we found out about Sputnik, we got 
			really scared.  It seemed like no matter 
			what we had and kept secret, they could 
			develop it too.  A-bombs, h-bombs, 
			rocket ships.  And this time we were 
			behind them.  So -- February 1961, 
			Kennedy tells Congress and the American 
			people he wants to go to the moon.  May 
			1961, the Apollo program is announced...
<b>	
</b>	Tracy just can't take it anymore.  She abruptly stands up, takes the 
	GIANT HALL PASS off the lip of the blackboard, and starts to leave.  
	Mr. Flagg gives her a small nod.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT.  RAILWAY	DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Tracy nears a room, a special room.  She slows down and peeks in the 
	window of the door.  She sees --
<b>	
</b>	LARRY FOUCH  sitting at the back of the classroom, staring front.  
	Tracy presses her face to see what Larry is staring at --
<b>	
</b>	JIM at his desk counting ballots
<b>	
</b>	LARRY catches sight of Tracy in the window.
<b>	
</b>	TRACY crosses her fingers by her ears and gives a questioning look
<b>	
</b>	LARRY sneaks a guilty look at Jim, absorbed in his counting.  Then, 
	against his better judgment flashes Tracy a quick, furtive double 
<b>	THUMBS-UP.
</b><b>	
</b>	TRACY suddenly disappears from the window.
<b>	
</b>	IN THE EMPTY HALLWAY - Tracy pogos with unbridled joy
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			You know that moment when they announce 
			the winner of a beauty pageant?  When 
			Miss Texas or whoever suddenly realizes 
			she's Miss America, and all she can do 
			is scream and weep and hug the losers?  
			I had my moment in the hallway that 
			Tuesday afternoon with no one to hug but 
			myself.
<b>	
</b>	She pulls herself together enough to peek through the window of the 
	OTHER DOOR to Jim's classroom, the window behind which JIM
	is still busily doing his count.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JIM'S CLASSROOM -- DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM counts out the last of the ballots, mouthing the numbers to 
	himself.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			I was at the end of my count when it 
			happened.  I'd come up with exactly the 
			same numbers as Larry:  Tracy had won 
			the election by a single vote, 256 to 
			257.  I was about to announce my tally 
			when...  
<b>	
</b>	JIM looks up and sees
<b>	
</b>	TRACY in the window, her face exploding with joy.  She FREEZES.
<b>	
</b>	We move closer to Jim in SLOW-MOTION.  What actually occurs in a 
	split-second is suspended in time
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			The sight of Tracy at that moment 
			affected me in a way I can't fully 
			explain.  Part of it was that she was 
			spying, but mostly it was her face. 
			Looking at her, you might think she was 
			a sweet, innocent teenage girl. But she 
			wasn't sweet.  And she wasn't innocent. 
			She was selfish and cynical and 
			ambitious and thought nothing of 
			destroying the lives of others to get to 
			the top. who knew how high she would 
			climb in life, how many people would 
			suffer because of her? I had to stop her 
			now.
<b>	
</b>	Tracy UNFREEZES and darts out of sight. JIM glances at Larry. Larry is 
	writing in a notebook.
<b>	
</b><b>	JIM'S HAND
</b><b>	
</b>	creeps up from his lap and onto the pile of TRACY VOTES.  His fingers 
	nimbly count two ballots and pull them off the desk.
<b>	
</b>	JIM coughs as beneath his desk he CRUMPLES THE BALLOTS into a ball and 
	drops them into the wastepaper basket.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Larry?
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY 
</b>					(looking up) 
			Yeah?

<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			No way I It doesn't make sense.
<b>	
</b><b>					WALT
</b>			Sorry. My figures work out exactly the 
			same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for 
			Tracy.
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			And 290 "disregards," right?
<b>	
</b><b>					WALT 
</b>			If you say so.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Mostly Tammy fans
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			See, it doesn't add up. There are only 
			801 ballots but 803 people voted. Two 
			votes are missing. Check the register.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			He's right. Two people must have 
			pocketed their ballots. Usually it's 
			more.
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			But, they were there I counted 803 
			votes.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			It happens, Larry. People make

<b>

</b>			I didn't make a mistake. Every vote was

<b>	
</b><b>					WALT
</b>			Whoa! Easy, Fouch. I don't like where 
			you're going.
<b>	
</b><b>					LARRY
</b>			I'm telling you. Dr. Hendricks, every

<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>					(stern)
			Larry? We've got twenty-five minutes 
			until the assembly, and we still have to 
			do counts for VP, Treasurer and 
			Secretary. Mr. Hendricks and I have both

<b>	
</b>	The students quiet down
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (CONT'D)
</b>			Some contests are so well fought that 
			is seems unfair for someone to win and 
			someone to lose.  I think that's the 
			case with all the candidates you see 
			before you today.  All of them are 
			highly qualified and embody the, uh, the 
			integrity we expect from our school 
			leadership.
<b>	
</b>	OS TRACY - Jim's voice momentarily recedes.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (VO)
</b>			Act surprised. Walk slowly to the 
			podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this 
			incredible honor.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			That said, the whole point of an

<b>	
</b>	The crowd breaks into applause -- and laughter
<b>	
</b>	ON TRACY - AS she sits, her smile belies her horror and humiliation
<b>	
</b>	Paul begins his acceptance speech.  We cut alternately to a thrilled 
	Lisa; a stunned Tracy, tears forming at the corners of her eyes; and 
	to JIM, who watches the events with shifty eyes, his mouth dry and 
	tasting of metal.
<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL
</b>			Geez, you guys, thanks a lot.  I mean, 
			wow, thanks.  I promise to do my best 
			and really do a good job and be a good

</b><b>	EXT.  MCAILISTER  HOME	 NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	JIM stands at his own back door, beaten and ashamed.  He lifts a hand 
	and knocks.  After a moment the door opens, and there is Diane.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Diane, I...
<b>	
</b>	Diane looks at JIM in silence.  Her face reveals nothing, but there is 
	a deadness in her eyes.  After a moment, she turns back inside, 
	leaving the door open.
<b>	
</b>	JIM follows his wife inside, closes the door.  The camera moves to 
	peek in the kitchen window, from where we watch JIM and Diane but 
	cannot make out anything they say.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			I don't know how Diane and I made it 
			through that night, but we did.  Our 
			marriage had gone right to the brink, 
			but in the end I guess it was saved by 
			one simple fact: we truly loved each 
			other.  So we made a commitment to begin 
			the painful process of piecing our lives 
			back together.  The worst was over; the 
			mistakes of the past were behind us.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MILLARD HIGH	JIM'S CLASSROOM -- NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A WASTE BASKET peeks out from under Jim's desk.
<b>	
</b>	We hear a distinctive rhythmic squeak, and a shadowy head appears in 
	the window.  Keys jingle.  The door opens, and Lowell turns on the 
	lights.  He approaches the waste basket and slides it out.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. MILLARD HIGH TRACK	DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	FROM OVERHEAD - JIM circles the track.
<b>	
</b>	ON THE GROUND -- JIM does pushups. Then sit-ups.

<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MILLARD OFFICE	DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Now all clean and refreshed and whistling a merry tune, JIM pops in to 
	check his box, giving a wave to Miss Seeder.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Hi, Linda.
<b>	
</b>	JIM continues to whistle as he looks through his mail.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)

</b>	JIM stops cold. Walt is not alone. Barbara Flick and a bleary-eyed 
	Tracy are there. So are Larry Fouch, Ron Bell, and Lowell the janitor. 
	Prominently displayed on Walt's desk are TWO CRINKLED BALLOTS. JIM 
	takes an eternal few seconds to absorb what is happening.

<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL (VO)
</b>			I don't know why, but finding out there 
			was a mistake and I hadn't won the 
			election after all didn't bother me that 
			much. Winning had seemed kind of unreal

</b>			She's okay. It's about the election.
<b>	
</b>	Walt closes the door in our faces. We hold on the door.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			After Paul got the bad news, Walt asked 
			for a few minutes alone with me. It was 
			very simple, really. I offered my 
			resignation, and he accepted. Very 
			quietly, it was all over for JIM 
			McAllister at Millard High - twelve 
			years of hard work down the drain.
<b>	
</b>	The door opens revealing that only wait and JIM remain. The office 
	staff is hushed as JIM the Zombie Cyclops emerges into the office and 
	walks somberly toward Miss Boeder. His voice quavers at half-volume.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Walt will be speaking with you about 
			this, but I need you to find someone to 
			take over my classes. The lesson plans 
			for the rest of the year are in my top

<b>	
</b><b>					MISS BEEDER 
</b>			Okay, Jim. I understand.

</b><b>					JIM
</b>			Thanks. Well. I'm going home now.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. HILLARD HIGH (REAR PROJECTIOH) -- DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	As JIM moves toward the parking lot, the school recedes in an odd REAR 
	PROJECTION that suggests he is floating. The MUSIC here reinforces the 
	gravity of the moment, the inevitability of his fate.
<b>	
</b>	JIM stops walking, and a disembodied STEEPING WHEEL floats into his 
	hands. The scene behind changes to:
<b>	
</b><b>	INT./EXT. JIM'S CAR REAR PROJECTION - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The city passing by outside is another strange REAR PROJECTION. JIM 
	grips the floating steering wheel and makes turns wildly out-of-sync 
	with the background.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO)
</b>			I don't remember driving home, or much 
			of anything that happened in the next 
			few days.

	back to camera to face -

</b><b>	
</b>	JIM drifts toward his house, and it absorbs him through the front 
	door.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MCALLISTER LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	We're no longer in rear-projection land: reality has caught up with 
	Jim. As he walks across the room, he strips off his shirt, shoes, 
	socks, and finally pants. Left only in his underwear, he walks through 
	the house and out into the -
<b>	
</b>	EXT. MCALLISTER BACKYARD	DAY and flops down in the grass, facing 
	the sky.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			There were news stories in the paper 
			and on television, former students 
			calling with their support, endless 
			hours of doing nothing, thinking 
			nothing.
<b>	
</b>	A shadow falls over Jim's face, and a hand offers him a glass of iced 
	tea. Grateful, JIM takes it, and looks up at -
<b>	
</b>	DIANE, her head blocking the sun.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			Diane stood by me through the entire 
			humiliating ordeal, in a way, it sort of 
			evened things out between us.
<b>	
</b>	Diane leaves. JIM looks up at the sky.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM (VO CONT'D)
</b>			Soon school was over, and summer

<b>	
</b><b>					PAUL (VO CONT'D)
</b>			The only really bad thing about senior

	with his friends and admirers.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Paul, will you sign my yearbook?

	looks for her picture.  When she finds it, it's almost completely 
	obscured by part of some ASSWIPE 'S long, illegible, exclamation 
	point-filled message.  Finally, she locates an available space and 
	begins to write.
<b>

</b>			Would you sign it for me?
<b>	
</b>	Tracy reaches over the parking brake and flips the yearbook to the 
	blank pages at the beginning.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			What a surprise.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			Take as much room as you want
<b>	
</b>	JIM removes a pen from his breast pocket and uncaps  it. He considers 
	what to write.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY (CONT'D)
</b>			I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel 
			ready for college.
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			You'll be fine.
<b>	
</b><b>					TRACY
</b>			I hope so
<b>	
</b><b>					JIM
</b>			You will.
<b>	
</b><b>	CLOSE ON JIM
</b><b>	
</b>	He looks at the yearbook. He looks at Tracy. He looks out the 
	windshield. It's all so odd.
<b>	
</b>	CLOSE ON THE BLANK PAGE JIM begins to write:
<b>	
</b>	"Dear Tracy,"
