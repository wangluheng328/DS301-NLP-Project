Tracy Flick is the most driven student at Carver High, who just happens to be having an affair with one of her teachers.
Another teacher--Mr. McAllister--is having an affair with his wife's best friend.
Student Elections are under way, when Mr. McAllister persuades football jock Paul to run against Flick for his own pleasure.
Flick, of course, is mortified that Paul is even trying to compete.
Tammy, Paul's lesbian sister who got dumped by her girlfriend to go with Paul, decides that running against her brother is the best revenge.
Who will win the election this year?
