Divorce attorney Miles Massey has everything, a jet, a jet washer, three gardeners (or "those little lawn people" as he puts it), and even a marriage contract (The Massey Prenup) named after him.
He seems to be unstoppable and completely invincible.
That is, until he meets the beautiful, dangerous Marylin Rexroth.
After being completely destroyed in court, Marylin formulates a plan that puts Miles in a position where he doesn't know what to do.
For the first time in his life, he doesn't have what he wants the most.
