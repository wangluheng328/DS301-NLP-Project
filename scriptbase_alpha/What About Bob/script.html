               "Medical journals report only 31 cases in history of people 
               swallowing their toothbrushes. The champion toothbrush 
               swallower was a Soviet psychiatric patient who downed 16 in 
               1984. The all-time champion swallower of any object swallowed 
               2533 objects in 1927."

<b>               ECU: A TOOTHBRUSH - CREDITS ROLLING
</b>
               We HEAR a man clearing his throat. He enters and a shiny 
               glob of toothpaste is squeezed onto the bristles.

<b>               INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING
</b>
               BOB WILEY, thirties, anxious, begins brushing his teeth. 
               Suddenly, in trying to brush a back molar, Bob looses control 
               of the toothbrush and swallows half of it whole. Choking, 
               gasping, he tries to pull the toothbrush out.

<b>               EXT. BOB WILEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING, SAME
</b>
               PAN and TILT up from a woman walking her dog on the streets 
               of Manhattan to a third floor apartment window. There is Bob 
               struggling frantically with the toothbrush.

<b>               INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING
</b>
               Bob is losing the battle, and in three excruciating swallows, 
               like a mouse going down the throat of a snake, the toothbrush 
               disappears down his throat. Bob pounds his chest, swallowing 
               as he does. Then, delicately, he belches. He takes a deep 
               breath, relaxes somewhat, and opens the medicine cabinet. 
               There sit ten packaged toothbrushes. Bob opens one.

               (or is it the car alarms?). Shrinks and their wives sit around 
               an intense doctor in his forties.

               Dr. Feinberg exits the building with his suitcase. To his 
               horror an angry horde of men and women, looking like a 
               sadistic lynch mob, swarm him and attack.

                         me...!

               As Feinberg runs to get away he is dragged down then overrun

               The SOUND of BIRDS segues to car alarms. We're on the streets 
               of New York, CRANING and ZOOMING like a bird up and into a 
               sweltering apartment.

<b>               INT. BOB WILEY'S APARTMENT, SAME

               Bob Wiley sits on his bed in boxer shorts. On his night stand 
               are cardboard plaques: one lists the warning signs of 
               diabetes, another lists cancer's seven warning signals. 
               Stacked by the bed are psychology books and a few bottles of 
               prescription pills. In front of Bob is a vaporizer. Bob holds 
               his cheeks and twists them in small circles in front of the 
               steam.

<b>               INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, DAY
</b>
               The striking thing about DR. LEO MARVIN's office is order 
               and neatness. As Marvin talks on the phone, he unconsciously 
               adjusts the already meticulously placed gewgaws on his desk. 
               Marvin is mid-forties, authoritative, stiff, perfectly 
               manicured. Adorning the office are diplomas, personal 
               mementos, primitive masks, Mondrian-like paintings, his framed 
               medical school grades, a bust of Freud, and diplomas. On his

               of Marvin's book. The conversation INTERCUTS.

               Bob hangs up, finds a blood pressure gauge and takes his 
               blood pressure. That done, he stands, paces, then stops and 
               sprinkles food into a gold fish bowl.

               GIL the GOLDFISH nibbles the food. Bob sits on his bed, takes 
               a deep breath, then dials the phone. As he waits for an 
               answer, he flips through his "organizer" which is crammed 
               with notes and papers.

<b>               INT. BOB'S APARTMENT, LATER

               Bob is now dressed to go out. A clock reads 1:45pm. Bob is 
               pacing at the door. He stops, glances at the clock, faces 
               the door, opens it, closes it. He paces, opens the door, 
               takes some deep breaths, twists his cheeks, then like a man 
               jumping into cold water, bolts out.

               Bob exits his apartment, uses a Kleenex to close the door,

               push the elevator button, then paces nervously. The elevator 
               arrives and the door opens. The elevator is filling up with 
               passengers. Bob doesn't move.

               We see a descending steel staircase and stairwell door marked 
               "Floor 40". We hear footsteps -- rhythmic and determined -- 
               getting closer and closer.

               Clair sits behind her desk reading a book. Bob enters, red-
               faced and out of breath, taking his pulse.

               Dr. Marvin is at his desk. Claire shows in Bob.

               Claire exits. Bob looks around then notices a framed photo 
               on Marvin's shelf. Using his Kleenex, Bob picks it up. He 
               smiles.

               Bob stares at the chair. There is a box of Kleenexes on the 
               arm. Bob reaches in his pocket, takes out a Kleenex, and 
               uses it to move the box of Kleenexes to the table. He then 
               sits. Marvin walks to Bob and holds out a trash can. Bob 
               drops in the used Kleenex.

               Marvin puts the trash can next to Bob's chair then sits. He 
               stares at Bob. He's waiting.

               Suddenly Bob removes an air sickness bag from his pocket. He 
               opens it and pauses a long time as though he were about to 
               vomit into it. He doesn't. He puts the air sickness bag away. 
               Marvin leans in. Bob does too.

               Bob fakes a heart seizure -- very convincingly -- and falls 
               to the floor. After a moment, he sits back in the chair as 
               if nothing had happened.

               There are twenty copies of Marvin's book on the shelf behind 
               Marvin. Marvin holds one up. Bob sees the cover. We see the

               say, let it pass. Anna continues to flirt with the boy in 
               line. Marvin pushes a couple of buttons on his organizer and

                         my brother right away.

                         I'm not allowed to give out that 
                         number. Don't you have it?

               A PULL BACK REVEALS BOB standing beside the prostitute, 
               wearing his face mask, waiting anxiously. Bob whispers in 
               the prostitute's ear. She nods.

                         give it to me. Look, honey, it's 
                         urgent. I'm at: 790-8864.

               She reads the number off the pay phone. Bessie reacts to the 
               fact that it's a different number from Bob's. She shakes her 
               head and sighs.

               The prostitute hands the phone to Bob. He sprays the phone 
               with disinfectant then hands her some money.

               The prostitute shakes her head and walks away.

               The moonlit lake is in the far background. In the near

               holding the telephone, looking concerned, walks off by

                         here again.

               Marvin hangs up. BACK TO SINGLE SCREEN. Bob stands in the 
               phone booth, banging his hand on his head.

                         smart...

               He walks out of the booth shaking his head. He exits screen 
               left. Momentarily he crosses back through screen, muttering 
               to himself.

               Marvin and Siggy march to the end of the Marvin dock. There 
               is a diving board. Siggy stands in a black terry robe and 
               flip flops.

                         this death fixation.

               Siggy reluctantly takes off his black robe. Under it he wears 
               a black t-shirt and black bathing suit.

               Siggy reluctantly mounts the board. He stands, feet together, 
               then takes a step with his right foot.

               Siggy sighs then starts again. He awkwardly takes two steps 
               then stops at the end of the board, staring into the water, 
               afraid to dive.

<b>               INT. MARVIN SUMMER HOUSE, SAME

               The decor is New England cottage-y with a strong dose of Leo 
               Marvin: incredibly ordered. On a pedestal is a bust of Sigmund 
               Freud. On the mantle sit the family puppets: -- Anna, Siggy, 
               Fay, and Leo. Anna is at the family stereo, selecting a CD. 
               Fay is on the chordless phone at the kitchen window, giving 
               milk to some stray cats.

                         vacation was Dr Ruth.

               Siggy enters and walks upstairs. Marvin enters and heads to 
               the living room chair. Fay hangs up.

               Marvin stares at Anna. She puts on raucous heavy metal.

                         It's educational.

               Marvin turns down the volume, sits in his big easy chair, 
               then takes a deep breath. He picks up Freud's Understanding 
               Dreams. Anna puts on headphones and dances around wildly. 
               Marvin tries to read. Suddenly a face appears in the window. 
               It is Bob. He sees Marvin and taps on the window. Marvin 
               looks up and sees Bob.

               Marvin goes to a drawer and pulls out a prescription pad. He 
               writes.

               Bob exits. Marvin closes the door and looks up at the ceiling. 
               He takes a deep breath then turns back into the room. There 
               is a knock at the door.

               Bob strides into the kitchen and takes his fish. Sigmund, 
               now in his clothes, enters from upstairs.

<b>               INT. THE MARVIN LIVING ROOM, SAME

               Marvin, Fay and Siggy stand frozen, like artist's models, 
               staring at something. Is this suddenly a Godard movie? Are 
               we now in a Becket play? Finally:

               Marvin moves to the couch and pulls it out from the wall 
               about three inches.

               follows. Ditto Anna who starts cooking pancakes.

               Marvin goes back to making minuscule adjustments: adjusting 
               diplomas, etc. At the front door is a knock.

               George's sailboat heels by. From it wave Anna and some of

               Stunned, Marvin drops Siggy into the water. Siggy does a

               Marvin walks along the shore towards the pier in time to see 
               Anna and a wobbly Bob disembark George's sailboat.

               Anna sees her father. She says good-bye to George and her

               Marvin starts walking away from the sailboating party towards 
               the town green. He puts his arm around Anna so that she has

               Anna looks back at her friends and Bob. She shrugs then turns 
               back to her father. From his pockets Marvin removes the Leo

               Fay holds Marvin's head in her bosom, stroking him.

               Applause from outside can be heard in the room. Fay goes to

               Marvin looks out the window. He sees:

               Bob releases Siggy for another perfect dive.

               Siggy stands at the end of the board, more confident now, 
               getting ready to do another dive. Bob holds Siggy again but 
               this time Siggy doesn't need much help if any. Marvin charges 
               down the dock, Fay right behind him.

               Marvin leaps onto the diving board, shaking it. Bob loses 
               his grip and Siggy falls off the board, doing a back buster. 
               Bob falls in too.

               Everybody looks at Marvin, standing alone on the board. He 
               realizes that he's lost all control, something he never does. 
               He looks at the Guttmans.

               Anna and Fay dive into the water. They go under looking for 
               Bob.

<b>               EXT. THE MARVIN HOUSE DECK, AFTERNOON

               Bob is off a bit by himself, wringing out his clothes. Fay, 
               Anna and Siggy sit toweling off. Marvin comes out of the 
               house and talks in low tones to his family.

               There is a pause. Anna and Siggy and Fay look at each other.

                         no one thought he could do.

               Anna, Fay and Siggy are silent.

               at the outdoor shower, rinsing off his clothes. He can't

               Fay heads towards Bob. Marvin turns to her. He keeps his 
               voice low to keep from being heard by Bob, but inside he is 
               about to explode.

               Dusk has descended over Lake Winnipesaukee. The glow of the 
               moon, the stars, and lights from the other cottages along 
               the lake shore provide peaceful illumination. The Marvin 
               family -- and Bob -- are dining out on their deck overlooking 
               the lake. Marvin sits silent, holding in his anger. Bob, 
               swinging at occasional moths, sits next to Siggy.

               Anna smiles and hands the first plate of food to Bob. Marvin 
               sees this and crosses his arms. He shoots a death stare at 
               Anna. She defiantly shoots it right back. Bob sees this

               Marvin snaps the salt down next to Bob. Bob looks helplessly 
               at Fay. Fay puts a hand on Bob's arm.

               Marvin chokes on the food he's eating. Siggy slaps his dad 
               on the back. Marvin keeps coughing.

               Marvin turns red and points to his throat. He falls to the 
               deck on his side. Bob stands.

               Bob hurries to Marvin, lies beside him, and administers the 
               Heimlick maneuver. On the second try, Marvin's throat clears. 
               Marvin lies in Bob's arms, coughing.

               Marvin stands staring out the window like he'd like to murder 
               the rain that is still coming down in torrents. Bob is on 
               the couch, sitting alone, wearing Marvin's yellow slicker, 
               looking unwanted. Anna, Siggy and Fay sit quietly, watching

               puts a sympathetic hand on Bob's.

               There is a crash of thunder that shakes the rafters. Marvin 
               reaches out and slowly scratches the window, creating a tiny

               air sickness bag, Marvin clutching a copy of his book. 
               Marvin's diplomas and art are displayed prominently on the

               Marvin shoots Bob a dirty look. Bob smiles innocently. 
               Suddenly Bob takes out his air sickness bag and holds it out 
               as if to throw up in it. After a long beat, Bob puts it back.

               Marvin looks at Bob. A tiny, sadistic smile comes across his 
               face. There are a million things he'd like to say about Bob --

               Marvin keeps sailing away. But Bob's boat is faster and it's 
               gaining. Marvin sees this, jerks the rudder again, and turns 
               ninety degrees. He stands and shouts at Bob.

               Marvin bobs in the water. The pilotless sailboat heels away. 
               Bob dives in, swims to Marvin, and grabs him by the chin in 
               a traditional life-saver hold. As Siggy gains control of the 
               sailboat, Bob begins doing the side stroke towards the distant 
               shore with Marvin in tow.

               Marvin is a prisoner in tow. He drags himself under water.

               Lights go on. Thirty people stand around the room with party 
               favors and drinks. In unison they yell:

<b>                                     PARTY GUESTS

                         to you! Happy Birthd...

               The singing tapers into silence. Flabbergasted by Marvin's 
               disheveled appearance, the party guests stare. Fay and the 
               kids approach, tentatively.

               Fay is speechless. So are Siggy and Anna. Not wanting to let 
               things sink, party-hardy well-wishers approach Leo.

</b>                         I couldn't miss your birthday!

               Marvin suddenly leaps at Bob and grabs him by the throat. He 
               pushes him through three rooms of the house, choking him.

               Marvin falls on the floor on top of Bob. Guests go to pull 
               him off.

               Marvin lies in bed in the darkened room. He can hear the 
               party guests huddle outside in the hall, whispering. A guest 
               whom we recognize as the Doctor 3 from the boat, (the man 
               who is telling this story), enters carrying his doctor's 
               bag. He approaches Fay who is wringing her hands. Both speak 
               in whispers loud enough for Marvin to decipher.

                         Wiley being the cause of all his 
                         problems and I don't know what to

                         book, his interview which frankly 
                         didn't go so well, his birthday. 
                         That's a lot to bite off all at once. 
                         I'll give him a sedative and he'll 
                         be fine.

               Anna sits next to Bob. Bob sees George Stark, standing across 
               the room, smiling at Anna.

                         learned about psychiatrists: they're 
                         brilliant manipulators. I trust your

                         listened. In my opinion, George 
                         Stark's smile is not Oedipal 
                         regression and it's not confused 
                         libido. It's one good looking guy

               Anna smiles then summons her courage, and smilingly approaches 
               George. He is clearly delighted. A woman walks up to Bob.

               bowl and Bob's bag of clothes. Marvin sits on the floor, 
               filling a pair of milk cartons with gray powder.

                         "Bob fell in to a Burning ring of 
                         fire. He went down down down And the 
                         flames went higher. And it burned

                         The ring of fire."

               Marvin removes a wired mechanism from the bag and a timer. 
               He delicately pushes the wires into the milk cartons then 
               carefully ties on some fuse wires. He puts the milk cartons 
               and wired mechanisms into a BACKPACK and puts it under Bob's 
               bed. He begins laying the fuse wire along the floor towards 
               the door.

               Marvin passed Gil, sitting on a table. Marvin picks up the 
               bowl and puts it under the bed next to the bomb. He then 
               goes back to laying the wire into the kitchenette.

               Marvin lays the fuse wire across room and out the door. He 
               closes the door and starts to set the timer when he spots a 
               note hanging on the nearby mailbox:

               Marvin seethes. He thinks a moment then heads back into the 
               cottage. Momentarily he returns carrying the back pack and 
               the long wire fuse.

               Bob watches as the Marvin family walks away. They wave. Bob 
               waves back, sadly. He shuffles across the room. He stops at

               Bob shuffles to Marvin's chair. He stares at the book Marvin 
               has been trying to read, Freud's Understanding Dreams then 
               casually opens it. He reads for a moment, gets interested in 
               it and sits down. He sits back in Marvin's chair, reading.

               Momentarily, the front door to the cottage is kicked open

               The family look at each other. Tears well. They hug.

<b>               EXT. THE DOCTORS ON THE BOAT
</b>
               The doctors look at each other in astonishment.

<b>                                     DOCTOR 2 (V.O.)
</b>                         Wait a minute. You're not telling me 
                         that Bob Wiley is Dr. Robert S. Wiley, 
                         the psychologist?!

<b>                                     PHIL
</b>                         That's exactly what I'm telling you.

               A BIG HOUSE BOAT goes by. Phil yells to it.

<b>                                     PHIL
</b>                         Hey Bob! Hello, BOB!!

<b>               ANGLE ON THE BIG HOUSEBOAT
</b>
               Bob is surrounded by Lily Marvin, three toddlers and lots of 
               friends. Smiling, Bob waves at the doctors.

<b>                                     FEINBERG (V.O.)
</b>                         Wrote that huge best seller? What's 
                         it called?

               Bob's boat turns. On it's stern, in huge letters is it's 
               name: "Vacation Therapy".

<b>                                     FEINBERG (V.O.)
</b>                         Vacation Therapy!

<b>                                     PHIL (V.O.)
</b>                         Exactly. Sold 2 million copies.

               who are dark green with envy.

<b>                                     DOCTOR 2
</b>                         I don't believe it!

<b>                                     DOCTOR 1
</b>                         Pinch me!

<b>                                     FEINBERG
</b>                         I'll never take another vacation as 
                         long as I live!

<b>               ANGLE ON BOB'S HOUSEBOAT
</b>
               As the other doctors second in agreement, WE SEE Bob's hugely 
               happy houseboat motors off. We see Bob's big smile as he 
               passes out Kleenex to his family then waves good-bye to the 
               doctors.
