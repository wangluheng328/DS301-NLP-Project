Bob Wiley is a neurotic and manipulative man who has a habit of clinging onto his therapists.
His last one, not being able to deal with him, sends him to Leo Marvin.
After having just one session, Bob thinks the world of Dr. Marvin.
However, the doctor's leaving to spend the rest of the summer with his family, which throws Bob into utter despair.
He calls the doctor constantly demanding to see him, but the doctor says he is on vacation and cuts Bob off.
He manages to find out where he is and goes there.
The doctor's family takes a liking to him but the doctor feels that he is just intrusive.
And no matter what he does, Bob just won't go away, and everybody thinks that Leo is being mean.
