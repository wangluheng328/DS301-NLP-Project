Teenagers go to the one and only Camp Crystal Lake for a campout in Cabin 13 but what they don't know is that a little boy drowned there because the councilors weren't paying attention.
His name was Jason Voorhees and now he comes back for revenge on his birthday "Friday the 13th" to kill the councilors!
Beware - the teenagers don't know that a machete slaughtering maniac is out to get them!
