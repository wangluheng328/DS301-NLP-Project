</b><b> 
</b><b>         1    EXT.  ROAD - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>              The TRACK is SILENT.
<b> 
</b>              The CAMERA looks at a sign.  It reads:
<b> 
</b><b>                                    CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE
</b>                                     Established 1935
<b> 
</b>              Gradually we can begin to hear, in the BG, the SOUNDS of
              CHILDREN playing.
<b> 
</b><b>                                                       CUT TO:

</b><b> 
</b><b>         2    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>              In the BG a few dozen CHILDREN, in camp uniforms, are enjoying
              a game of softball.
<b> 
</b>              In the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone.  CLAUDETTE is 17
              years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant
              Counsellor" written on it.  She fills out the shirt very well.
<b> 
</b>              Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks
              quickly in the opposite direction.
<b> 
</b>              The CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we
<b>              SUPERIMPOSE:
</b><b> 
</b><b>                                       JULY 4, 1958
</b><b> 
</b>              The CHILDREN'S VOICES FADE slowly.
<b> 
</b><b>                                                       CUT TO:

</b><b> 
</b><b>         3    EXT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>              ECU as a COUNSELLOR squeezes off a shot.
<b> 
</b>              The paper target is ripped in the black.
<b> 
</b>              The COUNSELLOR hands the weapon to a CAMPER who snaps in at the
              line.
<b> 
</b>              CLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  CLAUDETTE
</b>                      Have you seen Barry?
<b> 
</b>              The COUNSELLOR smiles.  Shrugs.

<b>                                  COUNSELLOR
</b>                      He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time
                      I saw him.
<b> 
</b>              CLAUDETTE leaves.  The COUNSELLOR smiles.
<b> 
</b><b>                                                       CUT TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>         4    EXT. MAIN LODGE - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>              Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.  CLAUDETTE
              passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE.
<b> 
</b>              BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms
              behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE,
              and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with
              cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out
              an Everly Brothers hit.
<b> 
</b>              BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not
              ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  CLAUDETTE
</b>                      We've got to talk.
<b> 
</b>              BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.  Nods.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  BARRY
</b>                      Okay.
<b> 
</b>         5    BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his
              shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former.
<b> 
</b>              The Everly Brothers continue as we:
<b> 
</b><b>                                                       CUT TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>         6    EXT. LAKE - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>              From over the tops of a rack of canoes we see BARRY and
              CLAUDETTE walking along the shore.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  CLAUDETTE
</b>                      You said we were special.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  BARRY
</b>                      I meant everything.
<b> 
</b>              In the BG, CHILDREN leap into the water.

<b>                                  BARRY
</b>                            (continuing)
                      You know what I said, though.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  CLAUDETTE
</b>                      I can't, Barry...
<b> 
</b><b>                                                       CUT TO:
</b><b> 
</b><b> 
</b><b>         7    EXT. FOREST - DAY
</b><b> 
</b>              The TRACK goes SILENT.
<b> 
</b>              BARRY &amp; CLAUDETTE walk along a path.  This is not an aimless
              walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go.  He leaves
              the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing.
              CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  BARRY
</b>                      I care very much.
<b> 
</b>              He puts an arm around her and draws her close.  They kiss.
              They separate.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  CLAUDETTE
</b>                      Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?
<b> 
</b>              BARRY decides to be politic.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  BARRY
</b>                      I wouldn't know.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  CLAUDETTE
</b>                      Oh, you...
<b> 
</b>              She kisses him and they are locked.
<b> 
</b>              A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
<b> 
</b>              The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE:  Just beyond the thicket of
              lacy vines.  It is a slow tracking shot which gives the
              impression that we are watching the action from the POV of
              another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged
              Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
<b> 
</b>              This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
<b> 
</b>              BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her
              breast.  She reaches up to take his hand away.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  BARRY
</b>                      Claudette...

<b>                                  CLAUDETTE
</b>                      Somebody'll see.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  BARRY
</b>                      No, they won't...
<b> 
</b>              He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so
              that part of her bra is exposed.  He seals her protesting lips
              by kissing her.
<b> 
</b>              From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle.
              A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear
              the field of vision.  A branch pops.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  CLAUDETTE
</b>                            (in a thick whisper)
                      Somebody's there, Barry.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  BARRY
</b>                      Come on, Claudette.  A man's not made of
                      stone.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  CLAUDETTE
</b>                      Let's go back, Barry...
<b> 
</b><b>                                  BARRY
</b>                      I need you so much, Claudette.
<b> 
</b>              BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra.  They kiss again,
              passionately.
<b> 
</b>              The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of
              foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as
              the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
<b> 
</b>              Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It
              swells.  Closer.
<b> 
</b>              QUICK CUT to BARRY &amp; CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the
              perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
<b> 
</b>              Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
<b> 
</b>              A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the
              blow.
<b> 
</b>              The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him

</b>              In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet.  The snake
              is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
<b> 
</b>              ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has
              been since we met her.
<b> 
</b>              The room is small.  There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden
              dresser with a cloudy mirror on top.  The walls are a light
              blue, freshly painted.  The wall on the inside does not go all
              the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on
              in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
<b> 
</b>              ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what
              she sees.  She pushes her hair so that she looks a little
              sexier.  She smiles at herself.
<b> 
</b>              She reaches out in CU.  Open a drawer.  Takes out a towel.
<b> 
</b>              ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker.  Bends down and opens
              it up.  Takes out a terrycloth robe.
<b> 
</b>              She closes the footlocker, stands up and heads out the door.

              towel-turban.  She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for
              her hairbrush.  She takes her towel off and lets her tangled
              hair fall down.

              at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier
              as having a Navajo bracelet on it.  The snake strikes the
              bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free.  The snake
              falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.
<b> 
</b>              There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away.
              Her scream is loud.

              BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward.
              Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the

</b>              CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal
              switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a
              perfect connection running through his body.  There is a
              sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK
              screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are
              streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet
              shoes.
<b> 
</b>              BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and
              continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims
              at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop-
              kick on his friend, severing the contact.

              JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The
              machine stops.

                      The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can
                      hear the sound.  I try to close my ears

                      louder.  The rain turns to blood and the
                      blood washes down in little rivers.  And
                      the sound stops.
<b>

<b>

<b>

              forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking.
              This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long

                      those two others were killed?  An
                      accident?  It was inadequate supervision.
                      The counsellors were not paying enough
                      attention... They were making love when
                      that boy drowned.

                      Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?

              MRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes.  While her
              voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip
              into her other manifestation.  All of this is in concert with
              the visibility of her weapon.

                      supervision...
<b> 
</b>              ALICE starts to become increasingly anxious.  She can't see the

<b> 
</b>              ALICE bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the

<b> 
</b>              ALICE swings the poker back and forth.

              bright overhead lights come on.
<b> 
</b>              ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to
              reveal her hiding place.
<b> 
</b>              She looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it,
              then stops and turns and dives under an arts &amp; crafts table.

              feet.

</b><b> 
</b>              When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across
              her path like a barred door.  Before ALICE can think twice,
              MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that
              now ALICE is sandwiched between them.

              She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end--
              the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.
<b> 
</b>              ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf.  On the shelf is a box.
<b> 
</b>              MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables.
              Her machete is coming up in an attack.
<b> 
</b>              ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of
              leather-working tools.  She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard
              as she can.
<b> 
</b>              MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning
              knives.  One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low

</b>              ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.

</b>              ALICE covers her head with her arms.

              The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very
              slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand
              finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is
              almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.
<b> 
</b>              The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  JASON (O.S.)
</b>                      Come out, come out, wherever you are...
<b> 
</b>              ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small
              room.
<b> 
</b>              Fists bang in a rage on the floor.
<b> 
</b><b>                                  ALICE
</b>                      Please...
<b> 
</b>              ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
<b> 
</b>              The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
<b> 
</b>              The silence is interrupted by a new sound:  MRS. VOORHEES has
              begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the
              door to the larder.
<b> 
</b>              REACTION SHOT:  ALICE... oh, my God...
<b> 
</b>              At first we see nothing on our side.  Then, gradually, we see
              little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's
              eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
              anything...
<b> 
</b>              Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
              to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.
              She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near
              the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
              inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
<b> 
</b>              ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and
              picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
              her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
              come through the entrance.
<b> 
</b>              MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the
              blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
              head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
              able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
              a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
              sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
              floor.

              ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses
              carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
              the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
<b> 
</b>              ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a
              small puddle of blood under her head.
<b> 
</b>              ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
              slowly out of the room.

</b><b> 
</b>              The moon comes out from behind a cloud.  ALICE pushes a canoe
              into the water and paddles, as rapidly as her tired body will
              permit, out in the lake to safety.

</b><b> 
</b>              The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the
              horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day.  The birds are
              up, foraging for food.
<b> 
</b>              As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky
              reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake.  The canoe
              holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the
              surface of the lake.

</b><b>       138    EXT. LAKE - DAWN
</b><b> 
</b>              ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not
              changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The
              water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,
              she wakes.  She opens her eyes.
<b> 
</b>              The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
              boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.

              They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe
              rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
              lapping water.
<b> 
</b>              Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
              and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
              VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
              barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
<b> 
</b>              The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
              try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES
              is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get
              up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
              ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle
              floating near her.
<b> 
</b>              MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
              waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.
              Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her
              mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.
<b> 
</b>                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                      Mommy!  Mommy!  Mommy!
<b> 
</b>              ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES,
              who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
              ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
              to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
              using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts
              the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
              another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
              throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out
              of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the
              water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
              stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and
              under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.
<b> 
</b>              Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
              for ALICE.  She is screeching madly.
<b> 
</b>                                  JASON (Lipsync)
                            (continuing)
                      Kill her, mommy!  Kill her, mommy!
<b> 
</b>              ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in
              one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies
              off into the water.
<b> 
</b>              The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.
<b> 
</b>              ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to
              shore.

<b>       139    EXT. CAMP ROAD/SIGN - MORNING
</b><b> 
</b>              ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp.  We hear
              the sound of a car approaching.  Now it comes into view.  It is
              a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door
              that says "State Department of Health and Safety".  There are
              two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.
<b> 
</b>              ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.

              and come around to help ALICE.
