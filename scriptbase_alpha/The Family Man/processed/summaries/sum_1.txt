On Christmas Eve, two days before he pulls off a multi-billion-dollar merger, Wall Street hot-shot Jack Campbell gets a phone message from a woman he almost married 13 years before.
He also tells a gun-toting street tough that he has everything he needs.
The punk laughs.
Christmas morning, Jack wakes up next to his old girlfriend, in some sort of parallel universe, in a 12-year marriage.
Over the next few weeks, he gets a glimpse of what his life would have been like if he'd married her: a house in Jersey, two children, bowling trophies, a job at his father-in-law's tire store, and a lot of love from his wife Kate.
When this Dickensian adventure ends, what will he do?
