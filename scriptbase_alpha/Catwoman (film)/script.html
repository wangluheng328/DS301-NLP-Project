<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>INT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT
<br/></b>
<br/>START ON THE FACE of A GOLDEN CAT STATUE. This is the cat-
<br/>god BAST, lithe, noble, beautiful. CAMERA MOVES to reveal
<br/>the statue is 50 feet tall, dominating this space. Other
<br/>images of CATS -- hieroglyphics, ceramics -- abound, as do --
<br/>REAL CATS, hundreds of them, slinking in the shadows on ramps
<br/>cut into the sandstone walls of this Egyptian temple.
<br/>At Bast's feet, EIGHT ACOLYTES in GOWNS kneel in a semi-
<br/>circle around a flaming BRAZIER. Some of the women WEEP,
<br/>others PRAY or stare stoically ahead. From outside, we now
<br/>hear DISTANT SCREAMS, the sounds of MARAUDERS. There's a
<br/>RHYTHMIC BANGING at the massive BRONZE TEMPLE DOORS.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>EXT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT
<br/></b>
<br/>THE TEMPLE is an impressive place of worship -- tapered
<br/>columns and an ornate Egyptian facade -- at the apex of a
<br/>hilltop VILLAGE, in FLAMES, under ATTACK by a PERSIAN ARMY.
<br/>
<br/><b>SUPERIMPOSE:   "496 B.C."
<br/></b>
<br/>WHAM! THE STEEL PRONG of a mounted BATTERING RAM swings into
<br/>the ornate DOORS of the temple. PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the
<br/>brutal siege engine, SLAM the doors again and again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>INT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT
<br/></b>
<br/>The HIGH PRIESTESS wears a special HOODED WHITE GOWN that
<br/>mostly conceals her face. She moves from one ACOLYTE to the
<br/>next, pours a DARK LIQUID from a bejeweled decanter into
<br/>golden goblets, then pours one for herself. She raises her
<br/>goblet toward BAST, as do the others -- they drink in unison.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>HIGH ANGLE as the GOBLETS CLATTER to the floor and the WOMEN
<br/>SLUMP to the ground... dead. PULL BACK -- we're watching
<br/>this from the PERSPECTIVE of an EGYPTIAN MAU CAT -- slim,
<br/>elegant, dark-spotted gray and black fur, a SCARAB MARK on
<br/>its head.
<br/>

<br/></b>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>CONTINUED:
<br/></b>
<br/>THE MAU lets out a CRY... which prompts an eerie, growing
<br/>CHORUS of MEOWS and HOWLS from the other CATS.
<br/>THE CATS emerge from the hiding places en masse, leaping from
<br/>niches, converging on the bodies. The MAU leads the way,
<br/>moves to the high priestess and puts its mouth to hers...
<br/>ON THE TEMPLE DOORS - at last they BUCKLE and swing open.
<br/>THE SOLDIERS, bearing TORCHES and SWORDS, storm inside. They
<br/>grab anything of value, SMASH and DEFACE everything else.
<br/>At the foot of BAST lie nine ROBES... but there's no sign of
<br/>the women who wore them. SOLDIERS slash the robes with their
<br/>swords anyway, then snatch up the goblets for booty.
<br/>An unearthly CRY -- half-human, half-feline -- from somewhere
<br/>high above the rampaging soldiers. They freeze, looking
<br/>around frantically. More EERIE CRIES echo off the walls,
<br/>from all directions. The SOLDIERS raise their weapons,
<br/>clustering defensively. From out of the shadows above them,
<br/>DARK HUMAN FORMS suddenly leap down with impossible agility.
<br/>STAY ON THE FACE OF BAST, peering down impassively. The
<br/>torch-cast SHADOWS of the violence below play upon the
<br/>statue's golden surface... FLAILING SWORDS, the swift
<br/>SILHOUETTES of NAKED WOMEN. We hear the GUTTURAL CRIES of
<br/>the soldiers, clearly outmatched in this mortal combat.
<br/>MOVE TO THE CATS, perched above the fray, looking downward as
<br/>they pace the temple's ledges and ramps excitedly. THE MAU
<br/>takes a final look at its handiwork, then leaps up, slinks
<br/>through a crevice at the roof, and emerges on --
<br/>
<br/><b>                                                           CUT TO:

<br/>

<br/>
<br/><b>A ROOFTOP

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>We hear the modern SOUNDS of passing AUTO TRAFFIC.    CAMERA
<br/>ROTATES to reveal --
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>EXT. EDNA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
<br/></b>
<br/>THE MAU settles by a SATELLITE DISH, looking down on a
<br/>present-day suburban street, a busy main drag. MARSHLAND and
<br/>WATER are visible not far away, light RAIN FALLS.
<br/>
<br/><b>                                                     (CONTINUED)

<br/></b>
<br/>The MAU watches as, ACROSS THE STREET, a BUS pulls away from
<br/>the curb to reveal a WOMAN in a HOODED WHITE PONCHO
<br/>-- the outfit recalls the high priestess of Bast.
<br/>The HOOD is thrown back, revealing PATIENCE PRICE, 25-35,
<br/>attractive but inclined to conceal her looks -- hair over her
<br/>face, baggy clothes under her poncho. She's cautious, eager
<br/>to please, to do what's expected of her
<br/>-- a bit of a doormat.
<br/>Patience looks up from an address scribbled on a scrap of
<br/>paper, and straight toward the cat on the roof -- almost as
<br/>if she'd sensed its presence. She smiles.
<br/>THE MAU holds her gaze for a beat, then slinks out of sight.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>EXT. EDNA'S HOME - DAY
<br/></b>
<br/>An eccentric, ramshackle home amongst neat, well-kept houses.
<br/>PATIENCE moves to the front door, RINGS. As she waits, she
<br/>notes the lawn GRASS grown high, CLIMBING CAT SCULPTURES on
<br/>the shingles. A SIGN by the door: "FELINE RESCUE SOCIETY."
<br/>EDNA POWERS opens the door on a chain. She's 50-70, a former
<br/>academic, intelligent, charming, but quite intimidating.
<br/>
<br/><b>                              EDNA

<br/>             Hi, Edna Powers?
<br/>                     (off her nod)
<br/>             I'm Patience Price, I called about adopting a cat?

<br/>EDNA undoes the chain, opens the door for her.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

<br/>PATIENCE, out of her poncho, fills out a questionnaire on a
<br/>clipboard. Numerous CATS roam the premises. Feline artwork
<br/>and curios, scratching posts, furry toys... cat paradise.

<br/>             You may call me Edna.

<br/><b>                           PATIENCE
<br/></b>
<br/>             Edna. Some of these questions are... kind of
<br/>             personal. Do you really need to know how many, um,
<br/>             partners I've had in the past year?
<br/>
<br/><b>                           EDNA
<br/></b>
<br/>             I'm not interested in your love life. But I do
<br/>             want to know what sort of home environment you're
<br/>             offering, your degree of commitment...

<br/></b>
<br/>             Guess I wouldn't need the cat if...
<br/>Patience forces a laugh, fills in a ZERO and passes the
<br/>clipboard to EDNA. The woman puts down the cat food, slips
<br/>on the reading glasses she wears on a chain around her neck.
<br/>
<br/><b>                           EDNA
<br/></b>
<br/>             The application is mostly a formality.   I have a
<br/>             sense about people.
<br/>
<br/><b>                           PATIENCE
<br/></b>
<br/>             Well, I've always liked animals.
<br/>                     (not enough)
<br/>             Cats specifically. I mean, I love them... worship
<br/>             them, even.
<br/>EDNA seems satisfied, returns to reading Patience's answers.
<br/>THE MAU, meanwhile, comes around a corner into the room,
<br/>peering curiously at Patience -- who dangles her hand
<br/>invitingly. He rubs his face against her hand.
<br/>PATIENCE smiles, coos at the cat -- which grabs her hand hard
<br/>in his CLAWS. PATIENCE stifles a yelp, yanks her hand back.

<br/>A smile appears on Patience's face. She quickens her step,
<br/>crossing the empty street, almost to the sidewalk when --

<br/>with   a SCREECH, nailing the MOUSE, we hear its SQUEAL.
<br/>PATIENCE, frightened at first, becomes increasingly delighted
<br/>by her heightened senses. She spots --
<br/>MIDNIGHT in the tall grass. The cat turns, looks over her
<br/>shoulder once -- her EYES catch moonlight and GLOW. Patience
<br/>is clearly meant to follow.
<br/>PATIENCE follows MIDNIGHT on all fours, tenuously at first.
<br/>But as she proceeds, her shoulders and hips roll in
<br/>distinctly feline fashion. Her body seems slimmer, more
<br/>muscular. She rises on two legs, moving in a slinky crouch.
<br/>MIDNIGHT pauses to sharpen her claws on the bark of a gnarled
<br/>old TREE. PATIENCE follows Midnight's lead, leans forward
<br/>against the trunk, arms straight out, head arched back. She
<br/>stretches her neck, her back -- her every movement is
<br/>graceful, sensual, the awkwardness gone.
<br/>She tries to pull her hands from the tree -- but can't for a
<br/>moment, finding her FINGER-NAILS stuck into the bark (like a
<br/>cat at a scratching post).
<br/>A DOG BARKS -- without thinking about it, PATIENCE scrambles
<br/>up the side of the tree like a streak.
<br/>HER POV FROM TREE -- A LARGE DOG tugs on its OWNER'S leash,
<br/>some distance away. The dog walker yanks the dog onward.
<br/>PATIENCE takes this in, hears a MEOW --
<br/>MIDNIGHT is perched above her, very Cheshire Cat-like.
<br/>PATIENCE looks around, self-conscious for a moment -- what is
<br/>she doing up a tree? Bad idea to think. She loses her
<br/>balance, clutching at branches, tumbles out of the tree --
<br/>IN MIDAIR for an instant, she flails spastically, letting out
<br/>a SHRIEK -- then her body instinctively TWISTS and --

<br/>on the fence -- then teeters and TUMBLES to the other side.
<br/>MIDNIGHT looks disappointed. Patience jumps up again
<br/>quickly, as if pretending this never happened, this time
<br/>managing to hold her balance.
<br/>MIDNIGHT gives her a look and leads onward. At first she's
<br/>like a tightrope walker, careful of falling, but her steps
<br/>become more confident. Soon she's moving as quickly and

<br/>MIDNIGHT waits impatiently on the other side, tail twitching.
<br/>PATIENCE makes a dubious SOUND, but manages to slip a foot --
<br/>then a leg -- into the opening, twisting and contorting.
<br/>Amazingly, she's succeeding, her torso ripples and contracts
<br/>as she insinuates herself between the bars. Finally only her
<br/>head is on the wrong side. With a final TUG, she's through.

<br/>TIPPY THE LAP DOG, curled up in the center of the otherwise
<br/>unoccupied bed, SNORING away. The dog awakens, raises its
<br/>head, and starts BARKING FURIOUSLY.
<br/>CATWOMAN hisses at the creature.   It cringes and shivers,

<br/>LAUREL tentatively pokes at the prone, black-clad Catwoman

<br/>CATWOMAN moves around the side of the building, keeping low,
<br/>ducking behind parked cars. Fewer COPS here, but the place
<br/>looks impregnable, no way to scale the walls. She tries an
<br/>EMERGENCY DOOR -- locked, no good. She hisses in
<br/>frustration, starts to move on when --
<br/>THE DOOR OPENS behind her.     CATWOMAN spins to see --
<br/>LAUREL, her face hidden with dark glasses and a wide-brimmed
<br/>hat. She gestures frantically. Catwoman darts inside.

<br/>             Cats is next month...
<br/>UNIFORM COPS are clustered near a FORMAL STAIRCASE, blocking
<br/>her access to the right-hand side of the hall.
<br/>CATWOMAN bares her teeth in frustration. She hurries toward
<br/>a VELVET ROPE, the sign, "BOXES - PRIVATE." She slips past

<br/>HER POV, ZOOMING from box to box -- finding GEORGES in a box
<br/>on the opposite side of the hall. DRINA is rising, heading
<br/>out the door.
<br/>CATWOMAN climbs up the CURTAINS around the box, levering
<br/>herself upward to the elaborate FRIEZE that wraps around the
<br/>top of the hall -- GREEK GODS in various dramatic poses.
<br/>WIDER, FROM BELOW, as CATWOMAN climbs and creeps near the
<br/>ceiling, moving over the PROSCENIUM ARCH above the stage,
<br/>heading toward GEORGES.
<br/>A POLICEMAN at ground level spots her -- he lifts a radio to
<br/>his lips, calling for backup.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>The BALLET below is reaching a crescendo. COPS are filing in
<br/>from the back of the theatre, trying to be discreet.

<br/>GEORGES rushes for the exit -- but CATWOMAN gets there first,
<br/>shoves a CHAIR under the doors.

<br/>At that, she grabs Georges and slams him against the wall of
<br/>the box, behind a curtain, partly concealed from view. The

<br/>the TOMBSTONES and GRAVES.
<br/>CATWOMAN winds up in a corner on a MESH PLATFORM, no way out

<br/><b>INT. AVENAL HQ - SHOWROOM - DAY
<br/></b>
<br/>WESLEY, XAVIER and the MERCS are on the ground, SCRATCHED and
<br/>BLEEDING. They raise their hands for the puzzled, gun-
<br/>wielding COPS.
<br/>
<br/><b>                        WESLEY
<br/></b>
<br/>          Thank God you're here...

<br/>
<br/><b>INT. AVENAL HQ - PARKING GARAGE - DAY
<br/></b>
<br/>ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN in this parking garage. PATIENCE/
<br/>CATWOMAN pulls LONE out, he seems woozy, his arms around her
<br/>neck. They collapse together against a wall.
<br/>She tears the DUCT TAPE off Lone's mouth.   He winces.
<br/>
<br/><b>                         LONE
<br/></b>
<br/>          Who are you?
<br/>PATIENCE/CATWOMAN hesitates, about to answer -- but instead
<br/>gives him a long kiss. Then she darts OUT OF FRAME.
<br/>LONE reels from the kiss, then collects himself and pulls the
<br/>duct tape from his eyes.
<br/>WIDE SHOT -- he's alone, no sign of her.

<br/><b>EXT. AVENAL HQ - DAY
<br/></b>
<br/>OVERHEAD ANGLE as COPS hustle XAVIER and the OTHERS into
<br/>police vehicles. CAMERA KEEPS PULLING UP, until we see the
<br/>ruined ROOF of the building, IN FLAMES. The "A" in "AVENAL
<br/>BEAUTY" has been knocked out by the conflagration ... for a
<br/>few moments the sign reads "VENAL BEAUTY," until the whole
<br/>thing EXPLODES and SPARKS OUT.

<br/><b>INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY
<br/></b>
<br/>EDNA lies on the couch, a hand over her eyes, asleep in a
<br/>robe. She stirs as a TONGUE laps at her face. As she sits
<br/>up, dozens of CATS are all over her, begging for attention.
<br/>She laughs and cries at the same time then sees --
<br/>CATWOMAN, masked again, who has entered behind the cats.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/></b>
<br/>             A promise is a promise.
<br/>Her tone is soft, more like Patience's.       EDNA takes in the
<br/>blood on her, her torn clothes.
<br/>
<br/><b>                           EDNA

<br/>             I found out the truth.
<br/>Edna notes the SUNLIGHT pouring through the window, eyes her.
<br/>
<br/><b>                           EDNA
<br/></b>
<br/>             But the sun is up... you're still Catwoman?
<br/>CATWOMAN pulls off the mask and looks at it, puzzled.
<br/>
<br/><b>                            CATWOMAN/PATIENCE
<br/></b>
<br/>             Yeah.   But I'm Patience, too... with or without the
<br/>             mask.   I don't think there's a difference any more.
<br/>
<br/><b>                           EDNA
<br/></b>
<br/>             Maybe there never really was.
<br/>CATWOMAN/PATIENCE nods and smiles at this thoughtfully,
<br/>accepting her dual nature at last.

<br/>SALLY is ostensibly lending a hand, but is mostly interested
<br/>in the men's muscles. As she picks up a tiny box --

<br/>SALLY winks at PATIENCE as she follows the man out the door.
<br/>Patience looks good, no trace of the old awkwardness -- she's
<br/>integrated her cat side. The PHONE RINGS, she snatches it up
<br/>in a swift, feline fashion.
