   <title>GODZILLA first draft by Dean Devlin &amp; Roland Emmerich</title>





   <pre>









                            <b>GODZILLA</b>

                               by

                  Dean Devlin &amp; Roland Emmerich










                                               First Draft 2/19/96





<b>     FADE IN:
</b>
     An iguana...

     Crawling off its nest, leaving its eggs exposed.


<b>  1  EXT. MORUROA ATOLL ISLANDS, FRENCH POLYNESIA - PACIFIC       1
</b>
     Grainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary
     footage of a beautiful Polynesian island. We SEE quick
     shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons
     all in their natural tropical environment.

     Super: <u>Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June</u>
     <u>1968</u>

     Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a
     static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down
     in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the
     island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously
     move about.

     Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a
     nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.

     We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the
     over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the
     French government held in this tropical region.

     Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One
     building after the next, accelerating in momentum,
     culminating in one final EXPLOSION.

     The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like
     fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands
     below.

     We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile,
     unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the
     lizard's eggs.

     Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to
     clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the
     eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE
     continue to push in, getting closer...closer...

<b>                                             SMASH CUT TO:
</b>

<b>  2  EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - OIL TANKER - RAINSTORM - NIGHT          2
</b>
     Smashing through the choppy waters, barely by the storm
     we SEE the CORI AKIDO, a Japanese oil supertanker.

     Super: <u>Pacific Ocean, present day</u>


<b>  3  INT. CORI AKIDO - BRIDGE - NIGHT                             3
</b>
     We TRACK across the complicated computerized
     navigational console that is actually steering the
     immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v.
     program playing.

     At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an
     overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy
     satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match.

     Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled,
     the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to
     the console.

     The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly
     toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a
     KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the
     radio/intercom.

<b>                            SKIPPER
</b>                      (in Japanese)
               Captain. This is the bridge. We have
               an emergency.


<b>  4  INT. SUPERTANKER'S HALLWAYS - SAME - NIGHT                   4
</b>
     Alarms BLARING. The crew rushes out of their quarters
     and into the hall. Quickly they race for the upper
     decks.


<b>  5  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - BY KITCHEN                              5
</b>
     The ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the
     kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by.

<b>                            COOK
</b>                      (in Japanese)
               What's going on? What's happening?

     Before anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an
     enormous THUD as something hits the side of the immense
     ship. The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY.

     The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up
     nervously.


<b>  6  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   6
</b>
     The CAPTAIN enters quickly, joining the Skipper at the
     console.

<b>                            CAPTAIN
</b>                      (in Japanese)
               What was that!?

<b>                            SKIPPER
</b>                      (in Japanese)
               I can't tell...

     Again, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is
     HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain
     and Skipper to the floor.

     Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of
     our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in
     the Captain's eyes at the sound.


<b>  7  INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                           7
</b>
     The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the
     horrible WAILING SOUND.

     Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something
     enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew
     members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS.

     Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly
     filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the
     crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases
     them.


<b>  8  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   8
</b>
     The ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights
     and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls
     in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system.

<b>                            CAPTAIN
</b>                      (in Japanese)
               Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the
               lifeboats...

     But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS
     across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE
     GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big.


<b>  9  EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT                              9
</b>
     The doors BURST open as the crew and the Cook rush out
     onto the deck. Again, the ship is HIT, ROCKING it
     violently.


<b>     A TARP
</b>
     is ripped away, revealing a life boat. Two more life
     boats are revealed behind it as the crew desperately
     tries to hoist them up and over the side.


<b>     ANGLE - WATER BESIDE THE TANKER
</b>
     Something ENORMOUS jolts out of the water towards the
     ship. Through the rainstorm it is hard to make out what
     it is, but it SLAMS into the side of the ship, RIPPING
     INTO IT, pulling down the starboard side as it does.
     Could that have been a CLAW?


<b>     THE CREW
</b>
     Are thrown backwards. The lifeboats swing WILDLY,
     several of them SMASHING INTO BITS as they slam against
     the ship.


<b>     THE CLAW
</b>
     Or whatever it is, RIPS INTO THE SIDE AGAIN. This time
     the entire ship begins to FLIP OVER.


<b>     A LIFEBOAT
</b>
     Bounces off the deck and slides off the side. Following
     it is the Cook.

     Desperately, the Cook grabs onto the ship's side railing
     to keep from falling off. He looks back and SEES
     something so horrible that he SCREAMS IN TERROR and lets
     go of the railing.

     The old Cook slides over the side as the enormous tanker
<b>     FLIPS OVER.
</b>
<b>                                             CUT TO:
</b>

<b>     WINDSHIELD WIPERS
</b>
     Clearing at their highest speed, we see through the rain
     doused windshield, DR. NIKO "NICK" TATOPOULOS. Music
     blares from the tiny headphones of his Walkman.

<b>                            NICK
</b>                      (singing)
               ...I'm singing in the rain, just
               singing in the rain...

<b>                                             CUT TO:
</b>

<b> 10  INT. RUSSIAN TOWN - RAIN - DAY                              10
</b>
     The utility van races through this small Russian town
     right past a roadblock marked with the international
     signs for "no trespass" and "nuclear radiation."

<b>                            NICK
</b>               ..."What a glorious feeling. I'm happy
               again..."

     As the van disappears down the road, we CRANE UP
     revealing a city sign reading: CHERNOBYL, RUSSIA.


<b> 11  EXT. CHERNOBYL DIRT PARK - RAIN - DAY                       11
</b>
     With the infamously crippled nuclear power plant in the
     distance, the utility van slides to a muddy stop by this
     field of dirt.

     Nick hops out quickly and rushes to the back of the van.
     He opens the back of the van and grabs several metallic
     cases.

     Walking a few yards away from the van, he dumps the
     cases on the ground, opening them to REVEAL an
     assortment of sophisticated scientific equipment.

     Taped to the inside are several photos of a girl we'll
     meet later. Some of the photos are of her looking young
     and beautiful. Others are of the two of them happily
     together.

     With a switch he turns on the equipment which comes to
     life. Inside one of the cases are several cables
     attached to long SPIKES. He grabs them and dashes away.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               ..."I'm laughing at clouds, so dark up
               above..."

     Nick rushes over to a small patch of land and begins to
     SHOVE the spikes into the muddy earth.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               ..."The sun's in my heart and I'm
               ready for love..."

     Once firmly in the ground, he rushes back over to the
     van and pops the hood.


<b>     CLOSE - VAN'S ENGINE
</b>
     We SEE the steaming engine and a large electric car
<b>     BATTERY.
</b>
<b>                            NICK
</b>               ..."Let the cloudy skies chase..."

     He attaches the cables to the battery and they SPARK!
     Nick YELPS and jumps back. Shaking off the shock, he
     rushes back over to the mud pit, dropping down to his
     knees.

     Suddenly, raising from the mud we see DOZENS OF
     EARTHWORMS. Excitedly Tatopoulos grabs a big empty glass
     jar and begins filling the jar with worms, happily in
     his element.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               ..."I'm singin' in the mud, just
               scooping up my worms..."

     Unable to hear over his Walkman, he is oblivious as an
     enormous RUSSIAN MILITARY HELICOPTER lands right behind
     him.

     From the intense wind kicked up by the helicopter,
     Tatopoulos finally turns in time to see several RUSSIAN
     OFFICERS coming toward him. Nick scrambles to his feet.

<b>                            NICK
</b>                      (broken Russian)
               Good day. I am here with
               permission...I have a, a...
                      (in English)
               Permit. How do you say permit?

     He goes through his pockets looking for his permits.

     In the corner of the large room we see the old Cook from

     Raymond enters and moves close to the old Cook, kneeling
     down in front of him, inspecting his distant glare. The

     and forth. Raymond nods to another Official who comes
     forward.

     The Second Official ask him in Japanese, but the old
     Cook does not respond. He asks again but the old Cook
     seems to be in a world of his own.

               Whatever happened to that tanker put
               him in a complete state of shock.

     Raymond takes out his lighter and ignites it on high.
     The old Cook's eyes slowly come back to life, transfixed
     by the fire. Slowly he brings the flame close to the old
     Cook's face.

     Marching up the shore to greet Nick is MAJOR TONY HICKS,

     The Major gestures to the many villagers who are being
     attended to. Some are injured, others are being examined
     for radiation. The village has been decimated.

               hit them 'til is was over.

     A jeep pulls up and PETERS, a young researcher, comes

     Part military, part scientific command post. Lots of

     This is all too overwhelming for him. He turns from the

     He stops at his door. Audrey is startled.

               Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra
               research for you after hours and
               weekends for nearly a year. And I've
               never asked for anything but this job
               is really important to me. I'm too old
               to be an assistant anymore. I need to
               know this job is going someplace.

<b>                            CAIMAN
</b>               So have dinner with me tonight.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               I can't.

<b>                            CAIMAN
</b>               It's your choice.

     Caiman shuts the door on her. She turns and is face to
     face with the standee of Caiman. She takes out her
     chewing gum and plasters it on his nose.

     Taking up nearly the entire beach, an enormous cargo
     ship lays on its side in the sand. Two gigantic holes,
     ripped into its hull.

     Nick hops out and joins Major Hicks et al as they push
     past the gathered crowd of onlookers. The group gives a
     collective gasp as they see the ship for the first
     time.

     Three men (who we'll recognize from the Tahiti hospital)
     take measurements of the holes in the ship.

     The Major walks away. Raymond studies him as he does.

     Nick can't take his eyes off the enormous holes in the
     hull. He steps closer and turns to Peters, who's taking
     radiation counts of the ship.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Mind if I borrow this?

     Peter hands him his Geiger counter and walks into the
     cracked hull of the ship.


<b> 22  INT. CARGO HULL - CONTINUOUS - DAY                          22
</b>
     Inside is eerily dark and creepy. The guts of the ship
     are tangled inside. Holding a Geiger counter, he gets
     readings from all over the area. One particular spot,
     above him, seems slightly stronger.

     Nick SEES something there. He opens his knapsack and
     puts on some rubber gloves, removing a glass jar (like
     the ones from Chernobyl)

     Carefully he climbs the debris until he reaches a sharp
     shard of metal. Clinging to it he finds a MEATY CHUNK OF
<b>     REPTILE FLESH.
</b>
     He tries remove it but he only gets half. He places it
     into his jar. Just as he reaches for the other half,
<b>     SOMETHING GIVES WAY.
</b>
     With a JOLT, the section above him collapses. A rush of
     water falls and a HUMAN BODY swings down, just in front
     of him.

     Nick tumbles backwards, his heart pounding. The body
     swings lifelessly as it hangs from above.

     The others rush to his side, checking to see if he's all
     right.

<b>                            PETERS
</b>               You okay, Nick?

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Yeah, I'm...wait...I lost...

     Nick looks around frantically when the glass sample jar
     is suddenly handed to him.

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               Are you looking for this?

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Thanks.

     Raymond studies Nick as he joins the rest outside.

     his throttle.

     of their own ship.

<b> 26  EXT. THE GROUCHO - SAME - DAY                               26
</b>
     The captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on
     his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to
     him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules
     slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps.

<b>                            DECK HAND
</b>               The nets are full!

<b>                            JULES

<b>                            DECK HAND
</b>               We can't. She won't budge!

     Jules gets up to move aft when THUD, again the ship
<b>     ROCKS.
</b>

<b>     ALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL
</b>
     Arthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon
     all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long
     beat.

<b>                            ARTHUR
</b>               What is going on?

     Then with another JOLT all three boats begin to move

<b>                            FIRST MATE
</b>               What the hell did we catch?

     The three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS
     in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches
     begin to CRACK under the building pressure.

     The boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards.
     Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto
     the decks of the ships.

<b>                            JULES
</b>               Cut us free! Cut the nets!

     The same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs
     an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines.

     Jules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are
     brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets.
     Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats
     are dragged helplessly backwards.

<b>                            ARTHUR
</b>                      (screaming at his men)
               Cut the damned cables!


<b>     A CABLE SNAPS!
</b>
     Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either
     cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops.


<b>     ANOTHER CABLE SNAPS!
</b>
     Leonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is
     freed.


<b>     THE HARPO
</b>
     Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards,
     faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then
     suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN,
     dipping into the water.

     With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER
     WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is
     CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly <u>DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE</u>
     <u>SEA</u>.

     For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just
     happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath.

     Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out
     of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on
     its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves
     of Jules and Leonard don't.

     Quickly stepping over him a young SOLDIER rushes over to
     Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the
     plane's opposing benches. The Solider interrupts their
     discussion.

<b>                            SOLDIER

               position, forty seven degrees

<b>                            SOLDIER
</b>               The trawler was pulled under.

     The team exchanges worried glances. Hicks moves over to
     a map where the other incidents have been marked. He
     traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits
     the 47th parallel. Just off the East Coast.

</b>               The radiation is not an anomaly, it's

<b>                            ANIMAL &amp; LUCY

               Oh my God!

     Everything turns to see what Audrey is looking at.
     Audrey gets up and rushes over to a television above the
     counter.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>                      (excitedly)
               Turn that up, turn it up.

     The waitress does. On the t.v. plays the same news story
     we saw from before from Panama. This time we SEE Nick
     and Major Hicks walking on the beach.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               It's Nick! I know that guy. I know

<b> 31  EXT. NEW YORK FISH MARKET - BELOW JFK HIGHWAY - DAY         31
</b>
     Even in the rain doesn't keep people away. Buyers haggle
     with sellers. A large MARKET, truck loads of fish. No
     one seems to notice the river across from them...


<b>     MOUTH OF THE EAST RIVER
</b>
     Enormous turbulence in the water. Slowly something
     begins to LIFT, sheets of water fall. Bursting out, the
     backside TALONS of the enormous reptile pierce through.
     The TAIL slices through the turbulence.

     Two ships anchored at dock begin to LIFT UPWARDS as the
     beast below them begins to rise.


<b>     ANGLE FISH MARKET
</b>
     A groaning WAIL ROARS, echoing. The people of the fish
     market turn just in time to see...


<b>     THE ANCHORED SHIPS
</b>
     Lifting impossibly into the air above the pier. Suddenly
     a TIDAL WAVE of water comes CRASHING down, flooding the
     fish market.


<b> 32  INT. TRANSIT BUS - P.O.V. THROUGH WINDSHIELD - RAIN -       32

</b>
     Through the swinging windshield wipers of the bus we see
     the JFK highway in front of us. Suddenly we see...


<b>     AN ENORMOUS FOOT
</b>
     Comes crashing down atop JFK highway, crushing it. The
     TRANSIT BUS tumbles off the demolished highway.

     The man in the MARKET TRUCK is TOSSED and ENORMOUS TEETH
     puncture the top and bottom of his truck as it's LIFTED
     IN THE AIR. The man LEAPS from the open back of the
     truck.

     He lands, HARD, down in front of one of the fish market
     stores as hundreds of fish RAIN DOWN from above. With a
     loud CRASH, the demolished truck SLAMS to the ground
     nearby.


<b> 33  EXT. POLITICAL RALLY - BUILDING STEPS - RAIN - DAY          33
</b>
     With a large RE-ELECT MAYOR FAUSTINO poster behind him,
     the MAYOR is at the podium. Before him is a sea of
     umbrellas.

<b>                            MAYOR
</b>               I'd like to thank you all for coming
               out on this beautiful New York City
               day.

     Some in the crowd laugh as others applaud. Lost in the
     sounds of the crowd we HEAR a soft THUMPING in the
     distance.

<b>                            MAYOR
</b>               When I came into office four years
               ago, people didn't think we could
               reduce crime and I did.


<b>     ANGLE - COP IN BACK OF CROWD
</b>
     leaning to the cop next to him.

<b>                            COP
</b>                      (sarcastic)
               Yeah, <u>he</u> did.

<b>                            MAYOR
</b>               People didn't think I could restore
               order...

     This time the THUMPING is HEARD, growing much louder.

<b>                            MAYOR
</b>               ...and I did. The city is a safer
               place today...

     Before he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with
     fear as the THUMPING grows LOUDER and CLOSER. Suddenly
     with a large CRASHING SOUND a building nearby begins to
<b>     CRUMBLE.
</b>
<b>                            MAYOR
</b>                      (to his aides)
               What the hell....

     People SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the
     falling BUILDING litters the area. The Mayor is pulled
     inside by his security men.

     Bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we
     SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris
     out of its way.


<b>     SIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT
</b>
     Several cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET
     of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and
     SCATTER, flipping toward us, from the weight of the
     beast. We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast.

     After it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the
     doorway to see the demolished street scene.

<b>                            MAYOR
</b>               What <u>was</u> that?


<b> 34  INT. WNEW - CAIMAN'S OFFICE - SAME - DAY                    34
</b>
     Caiman's on the phone as his SECRETARY enters with some
     files. Rain and thunder continue outside.

<b>                            CAIMAN
</b>                      (into phone)
               I don't give a crap about some war in
               a country I can't pronounce. That's
               not a lead story. Find me a damned
               story, will ya!

     Just then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade
     SHAKING and the light FLICKERING. She hears the THUMPING
     approaching. She turns and SEES...


<b>     GIGANTIC TEETH
</b>
     The enormous head of GODZILLA growls as it passes by
     Caiman's office window.

<b>                            SECRETARY
</b>               Mr. Caiman. I think your story just
               walked by the window.

     Caiman turns but there's nothing there. He's confused,
     she's dazed.

<b>                            CAIMAN
</b>               What?

     Just then the TAIL WHIRLS past with a THUNDERS whip.


<b> 35  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     35

     Animal, Lucy and Audrey are at the cashier paying.

<b>                            LUCY

<b>                            AUDREY

               some boring egg head who spends his
               summer picking apart cockroaches. I
               wanted to have some adventure, some
               fun...

<b>                            LUCY
</b>               And now you live the glamorous life of
               Caiman's assistant. Life's a bitch,
               ain't it?

     In the distance we can HEAR the THUMPING approaching.

<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>               How long where you and dis guy goin'
               steady?

<b>                            AUDREY

<b>                            LUCY
</b>               Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he
               didn't ask you to marry him.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               That's the problem. He did.

     Suddenly the THUMPING gets LOUDER very quickly. Everyone
     in the diner reacts.

<b>                            LUCY
</b>               Tell me that's not another goddamned
               parade.

     The next THUMP RATTLES the entire diner. Things begin to
     fall. Through the window we see people RUNNING in
<b>     PANIC.
</b>
<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>               That's ain't no parade...

     Before anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING.
     Through the front window we SEE...


<b>     GODZILLA'S FOOT
</b>
     Smashing down directly outside the window. Cars are
     SMASHED. One car SAILS directly INTO THE WINDOW,
     shattering it.

     Animal uses his size to COVER the girls from the falling
     debris. As the danger passes, Animal charges for the
     door.

<b>                            LUCY
</b>               Victor, wait!


<b> 36  EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS - RAIN - DAY                       36
</b>
     Animal comes rushing out. Water sprays from displaced
     fire hydrants, debris still falls, cars burn. Animal
     goes over to his NEWS VAN that has been partially
     crushed.

     He pries open the rear door and takes out his video
     camera and takes off running. Audrey and Lucy arrive too
     late to stop him.

<b>                            LUCY
</b>               Victor, don't!


<b>     ANIMAL RUNNING
</b>
     Turning the corner Animal runs full speed through the
     debris, trying to jam a video cassette into his camera.
     It won't fit. He SEES up ahead...


<b>     P.O.V. THE TAIL
</b>
     Just as it disappears around the corner a few blocks
     ahead. Thinking quickly, Animal bolts down a small
     alleyway.


<b> 37  EXT. OTHER STREET - CONTINUOUS                              37
</b>
     His camera damaged, Animal struggles to get the tape
     inside as he exits the other side of the alley. He darts
     out into the street to get his shot.

     The THUMPING is OVERPOWERINGLY LOUD. He looks up to see,
<b>     CARS FLIPPING, PEOPLE SCATTERING.
</b>
     Then, for the first time, we can clearly see the entire
     massive creature that is...


<b>     GODZILLA
</b>
     as he comes barreling towards us. The titanic lizard is
     ferocious and agile. Swiftly he moves closer.

     Animal's hands fumble with the tape. He JAMS it in,
     sweating. He fingers the POWER BUTTON, the red light
     goes on. Quickly he shoulders the camera.


<b>     P.O.V. THROUGH CAMERA - GODZILLA
</b>
     Nearly on top of him, Godzilla's own image is suddenly
     covered by his own immense foot as it's lifted and about
     to come down directly on us.

<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>               Oh shit!

     Before he can do anything about it...


<b>     GODZILLA'S FOOT
</b>
     Towering above him. He has no time to flinch as the
     gargantuan foot SMASHES DOWN.

     In terrifying amazement, Animal remains standing IN
     BETWEEN THE BEAST'S TOES. Abruptly the foot LIFTS
     again. Animal is unscathed and frozen with fear.


<b>     ANGLE - ANIMAL
</b>
     Close on Animal as the endless TAIL of the creature
     DRAGS just past him. It seems to go on forever. Finally
     it disappears.


<b>     WIDE ANGLE - TABLEAU OF A DEMOLISHED STREET
</b>
     Deserted and demolished. Cars burn, debris falls.
     Animal, the lone figure, just stands there, his chest
     heaving, hyper ventilating.

<b> 38  EXT. NEW JERSEY STREETS - LOW ANGLE - AFTERNOON             38

     A military CONVOY with Police escort RACES past us.

     Sirens BLARING, the convoy and escort speed onward.


<b> 39  INT. MILITARY SEDAN - THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SAME             39

     Just as they arrive at a military roadblock. Crowds have
     gathered as the military try to keep them at bay.


<b> 40  EXT. NEW JERSEY SHORE - CLIFF SIDE - DAY                    40
</b>
     The guards let the convoy pass. The military is putting
     up a number of large tents. A SERGEANT moves over
     quickly to greet the team as they exit their vehicles.

<b>                            SERGEANT
</b>                      (quick salute)

<b>                            MAJOR HICKS
</b>               Any word from the Mayor's office?

     Just then dozens of NEWS VANS pull up. Reporters and
     camera crews come rushing toward them. The guards rush
     to intercept. Stepping out of the next car in the
     convoy, Nick and Elise join Major Hicks.

<b>                            SERGEANT
</b>               They've agreed to evacuate the city.
               They've called out the National Guard
               and riot police are on alert.

     As they walk towards the tents the crowd crushes close.
     Nick and Elsie are overwhelmed.

<b>                            ELSIE
</b>                      (aside to Nick)

               million people. Has that ever been
               done before?

<b>                            NICK
</b>               I don't think so.

     Several military guards have to clear a path for them as
     they enter the tents.

<b>                            SERGEANT

<b>                            SERGEANT
</b>                      (nervous)
               After the initial attack he
               just...disappeared.

<b>                            OFFICER
</b>                      (interrupting)
               Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on
               the line.

     This takes Major Hicks off guard. The last person he
     wants to talk to. Nick walks over to the Sergeant.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               I don't understand. How can something
               that large just disappear?

<b>                            SERGEANT
</b>               We're not sure. We're scanning the

               Just like everywhere else we've been,
               we're always one step behind.

     Nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open
     revealing a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline.
     Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               I don't think so.

     Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from
     the destruction. Military helicopters scan the city.
     Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An

               no other island in the world, this is
               a place where he can easily hide.

     A SOLDIER comes rushing in.

     He rushes over to a bank of monitors, turns one on. On

     We SEE the room is in disarray from packing up cartons
     of boxes and equipment. The workers have taken a break
     from the packing as they watch the t.v. broadcast. The
     station manager, MURRAY enters anxiously.

<b>                            MURRAY

               Okay, Caiman, Devoe and Animal, you're
               on the helicopter. Everyone else we'll

     Animal hurries out after him. Audrey and Lucy go back to
     packing. Audrey looks up at the t.v. just as they replay
     the footage of Nick and Elsie being led into the command
     tent.

     Surprised at first, Audrey suddenly becomes very
     excited. She SEES Caiman exiting the studio at the end
     of the hall. She rushes over to him.

     Audrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the
     elevator.

     With that, Caiman walks into the elevator. Pissed,
     Audrey just stares at him.

     Audrey THROWS the bag at him, knocking him backwards as

     With that he gently pats the Mayor on the back, leaving
     a small, nearly undetectable DEVICE on the Mayor's
     collar.

     speak but waits for the opportunity.

               Mr. Mayor, if he's not in one of those
               buildings then we give the all clear.
               But not until we've checked each

<b>     A SIGN READING: SUBWAY STATION: 23RD STREET - SUNSET
</b>
     We CRANE DOWN to reveal several military sedans pulling
     up into FLAT IRON SQUARE (where Broadway meets 5th).
     Sergeant O'Neal leads the team out of the cars and down
     a subway entrance.


<b> 61  INT. SUBWAY STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS - SUNSET                 61
</b>
     Marching down the stairs, the team enters into the very
     large subway station. For all we see it seems like a
     normal subway station except for the fact that every one
     of the team members look ASTONISHED.

<b>                            SERGEANT O'NEAL
</b>               Lt. Anderson and his men found this
               late this afternoon.

     The camera makes a hundred and eighty degree turn as we
     suddenly SEE what the team is staring at...


<b>     AN ENORMOUS HOLE
</b>
     The four normal subway tunnels have been CARVED OUT
     making one GIGANTIC TUNNEL. Debris and crumbled brick
     are everywhere. Several SOLDIERS with flashlights
     approach the hole.

     Lt. Anderson moves over to the astonished group. Some of
     the scientists fan out, examining the area.

<b>                            LT. ANDERSON
</b>               We were checking the office building
               above when we discovered the floor was
               gone.


<b>     LOW ANGLE - REVEALING THE HOLE IN THE CEILING
</b>
     We SEE that not only is the ceiling gone but the
     building above is hollowed and torn to shreds. Another
     hole in the building leads to the street.

<b>                            LT. ANDERSON
</b>               When we learned he could burrow his
               way through the tunnels we realized he
               could be out of the quarantined zone.

<b>                            MAJOR HICKS
</b>               Christ. How many tunnels lead off the
               island?

<b>                            LT. ANDERSON
</b>               Only five, Sir. We've checked them
               all. He hasn't used any of them.

<b>                            MAJOR HICKS
</b>               Have them sealed off.

<b>                            LT. ANDERSON
</b>               And how should we do that, Sir?

<b>                            MAJOR HICKS
</b>               Fill them with cement, brick them up,
               put land mines in them, bombs, I don't
               know, just make sure that goddamned
               thing doesn't leave the island!


<b>     ANGLE - INSIDE DARKENED TUNNEL
</b>
     As the SOLDIERS slowly move down deeper into the
     tunnels, their flashlight beams scan the area. Could
     they stumble onto something dangerous?


<b>     ANGLE - NICK
</b>
     as he approaches Major Hicks and Sergeant O'Neal.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               You know, he's not an enemy trying to
               evade you. He's just an animal.

<b>                            MAJOR HICKS
</b>               What are you suggesting?

<b>                            NICK
</b>               When I needed to catch earthworms, I
               knew the best way to catch them was
               not to chase them. I had to draw them
               out.


<b>     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS
</b>
     Still moving deeper into the tunnel we get the feeling
     these soldiers may just waken a sleeping giant.


<b>     BACK TO TEAM
</b>
     Nick moves to the edge of the platform, looking off into
     the dark tunnel.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               All we need to do is find out what it
               wants, what it needs, and he'll come
               to us.


<b>     ANGLE - SOLDIERS - DARKNESS
</b>
     The lead Soldier SEES something. Cautiously he moves
     forward thinking he's onto something. We HEAR something
     MOVING in the darkness.

     We FOLLOW his beam as the noise grows clearer. The beam
     falls onto something on the floor...


<b>     A FISH
</b>
     Flopping on the ground is a large FISH. As the beam
     moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead.

     A master of the obvious. Sergeant O'Neal shoots him a

     into a building at the edge of the square.


<b>     SOLDIERS

     Loading up rifles, taking positions. GAS MASKS being

     The TANKS move into their final positions. The National

     positions.

<b>     STEAM VENT

     Through a steam vent in the streets. Nick sees STEAM
     lifting into the air. He notices several other vents
     doing the same thing around the square. Quickly Nick
     rushes over to a YOUNG OFFICER.

<b>                            NICK

     One by one the steam pillars begin to disappear as the
     vents are turned off. There is a long tense moment of
     waiting. When will it come? <u>Will</u> it come?

     Before the Young Officer can stop him, Nick rushes over
     to a manhole cover in the center of the street. The
     cover is to heavy. He yells back.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               We need to open all the manhole covers
               in the area. Let the scent waft down.

     The Young Officer signals other soldiers. Nick steps
     back and lets the soldiers go to work. As he walks back,
     he spots another manhole cover at the next intersection
     down a side street. He runs over to it.


<b>     ANGLE - SIDE STREET - MANHOLE COVER
</b>
     A particularly heavy one in the center of this
     intersection (a block away from Flat Iron Square), Nick,
     alone, wrestles to remove it. With all his might, he
     drags it clear.

     Suddenly, through the hole he HEARS some STRANGE NOISES
     from below. Rattled, he slowly backs away from the hole.
     The NOISES grow increasingly louder.

     Then with a DEAFENING ROAR, the ground behind Nick
     ERUPTS and GODZILLA RISES, ripping up the boulevard as
     he does.

     Nick SPINS only to find himself face to face with the
     gigantic creature. Godzilla's head slopes down,
     apparently looking Nick in the eye.

     All around foot soldiers appear, guns trained, shoulder
     hoisted rocket launchers prepared.

     Out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees all this. He
     gently signals with his hands that they should NOT fire.

     Sensing no danger from Nick, Godzilla simply STEPS OVER
     Nick.


<b>     NICK'S POV - UNDER GODZILLA

     Nick turns and RUNS, following him.

     They DROP them down the long barrels of air cannons,
     preparing to fire.


<b>     SAND BAG FORTIFICATION - SAME

     Nick runs past the fortification, trying to get a closer
     look. The Young Officer yells after him.

<b>                            YOUNG OFFICER
</b>               Where're you going? Nick!

     Nick stops briefly as the Young Officer TOSSES a gas
     mask to Nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a
     closer spot. Suddenly SAILING OVER HIS HEAD we SEE...


<b>     GAS CANISTERS
</b>
     Firing from the air cannons, the GAS CANISTERS streak
     across the sky landing behind Godzilla. The Yellow gas
     forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards.


<b>     ANOTHER ANGLE - OPPOSITE CORNER
</b>
     Across the way eight MORE CANISTERS are FIRED at the
     beast. Quickly Godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes.


<b>     ANGLE - NICK
</b>
     Frustrated at his inability to see through the smoke, he
     DASHES forward over to a large BRONZE STATUE.


<b>     GODZILLA
</b>
     The smoke annoying and distracting him, Godzilla spins,
     his tail waving the smoke away. But the smoke returns.
     Godzilla YELLS OUT. Frustrated he rears back and
<b>     BLASTS!
</b>
     For the first time we SEE the infamous POWER BREATH of
     Godzilla. With amazing FORCE the smoke, canisters, cars
     and anything that isn't nailed down SAILS BACKWARDS from
     the intense pressure.

     Nick is HIT by the WAVE of air pressure and is sent
     FLYING BACKWARDS, impossibly high in the air.

     An enormous fabric BANNER advertising this season at the
     MET, catches Nick who SLIDES down the banner, hitting
     the ground, HARD. Just as he looks up he SEES...


<b>     A LARGE TRUCK

     Tumbling toward him from the power breath. Nick
     SCRAMBLES to his feet just in time as the rolling Truck
     SMASHES into the building behind where he just sat.

     The troops have to SCATTER as the tumbling trucks and
     cars are FLUNG AT THEM, disabling their attack forces.
     Trucks and rocket launches are CRUSHED by the tumbling
     debris.

     Godzilla CONTINUES to BLOW at everything around him.
     Cars and trucks ROLLING. Soldiers DIVING for cover. It's
     chaos.

     The glass in all the surrounding buildings SHATTER,
     shards of glass raining down. Windows, street lamps, all
     blown out by the tremendous gale force winds.

     As the FIREPOWER begins around Godzilla, he takes a hit
     in the shoulder and SCREAMS OUT. Suddenly he LEAPS away
     just as several MISSLES HIT the Flat Iron Building
     behind where Godzilla was standing only moments
     earlier.

     Dashing down a side street, Godzilla LEAPS over the
     waiting tanks who cannot adjust their cannons in time.
     <u>WE'VE NEVER SEEM HIM MOVE THIS QUICKLY</u>. Several tanks
     are SQUASHED as the beast bull dozes right through the

     Under heavy bullet firepower and the choppers nearly on

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Yes. The first of its kind. I found
               this blood sample earlier this
               evening...

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               Blood sample? How close did you get to
               that thing?

<b>                            NICK
</b>               I got pretty close.

</b>               What else do you know about it?

     Nick finishes his concoction, adding the blood sample
     into it He takes the piece of litmus paper from one of
     the home test boxes and dips it in.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Well, we know he eats fish, he's of
               reptile genus, he's a burrower, he's
               amphibious and...

     Nick points out the litmus paper. It turns RED.

</b>               ...he's <u>pregnant</u>.

</b>                      (thrilled)
               Well, obviously these tests weren't
               designed for this but fundamentally
               they're looking for the same hormonal
               patterns that would indicate
               pregnancy.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               I don't get it. If it's the first of
               its kind, how can it be pregnant?

     Excitedly Nick begins to pace.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               The ultimate expression of evolution,
               it reproduces asexually. Think about
               it, all kinds of creatures have been
               known to travel great distances for
               reproduction. That's why he came to
               New York. Like every species of
               insufficient progenitors, he's
               nesting!

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               Nesting?

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Yes. Do you realize that a creature
               like this could lay as many as a dozen
               eggs at a time!

     Nick moves to the front exit of the tent.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Forgive me but I've got to get this
               into the lab, to confirm all this.
               I'll be right back.

     Nick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but
     poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to
     the roof of the case she SEES...

     Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's
     touched.

     Feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back
     down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled
     FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and
     turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook
     appears.

     She hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous
     footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees
     the beached cargo ship in Jamaica.

     Audrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back
     out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the
     tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front.

</b>               General Anderson, the problem was the
               terrain. If we lure him out into a
               more open area such as this portion of

</b>               That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I

</b>               Well, yes. I did. Clearly he was

               situation's more complicated than
               that. The blood I recovered revealed
               that the creature is either about to
               lay eggs or already has.

               this, the "virgin lizard?"

     There's a smattering of laughter in the room.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               No, it reproduces asexually. That's
               why we must find the nest. If we
               don't, dozens will be born, each one
               capable of laying eggs of its own.
               Very quickly we could be looking at an
               enormous population.

<b>                            MAJOR HICKS
</b>               So after we kill the creature we'll
               begin a search for the nest.

     Reluctantly Nick nods acceptance and exits out into the

     stops and turns back to her.

     overcoat.

     He starts going through his drawers, taking out battery
     packs, tapes, etc, and putting it in his pockets.

     Animal walks up to the door, ready to exit.

               Audrey, I'm going after them. You can
               come with me or not.

     Conflicted, Audrey is not sure what to do. Animal opens
     the bedroom window and begins to climb out.

     Nick marches out of a changing room dressed in a
     military uniform. As he moves into the room we SEE all
     of Raymond's men dressed similarly.

     As they climb into their vehicles, Raymond hands each a
     stick of chewing gum. Nick gets in the passenger seat of
     one of the vehicles, Raymond climbs in behind the
     wheel.

     The door creeps open. Animal leans out to find the
     tunnel deserted. He and Audrey step out and into the
     tunnel. We FOLLOW them as they are headed for the exit
     of the tunnel into Manhattan.

     meadow.

     The enormous pile of fish is getting dumped in the
     center of the field as many others are planting land
     mines. Tanks, rockets and soldiers align the area.

     The convoy of vehicles turn onto the meadow but Raymond
     and his men keep going straight. They drive slowly right
     past the trap sight and out of the park.


<b>     TIRES SQUEALING TO A STOP
</b>
     Doors slam and immediately boots march past. We WIDEN to
     reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and
     heading down the subway entrance.

     Raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who
     nearly topples from the weight.

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               Be careful with that.

     Nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked
     EXPLOSIVES. Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's
     gone. Nick regains his breath and follows.

</b>
     Older and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the
     tunnel before. We FOLLOW the beam to its owner and find
     Nick. We WIDEN to reveal that we're....

     The crisscrossing beams from the assault team's
     flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team
     cautiously into the depth of this tunnel. Periodic fish
     are found along the way. Suddenly the faint HUMMING
     sound in the tunnel STOPS.

     Everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction. A
     familiar SMELL passes over them as they sniff the air.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               They've turned off the ventilation

               They're down there. Let's go.

     Animal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of
     the tracks. Audrey squeamishly follows.

     Nick kneels down to inspect some debris. An old
     SCREECHING SOUND is heard in the distance. Suddenly the
     ground begins to quake. Dust falling. The SCREECHING
     gets louder and louder.

     Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in
     nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds
     the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them.

     Bursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His
     enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and
     into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team.

     The team DIVES into a cross tunnel just as the colossal
     beast BLASTS past them, barely missing them.


<b>144  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - TUNNEL ENTRANCE          144

     Audrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel

     panic.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               Animal, let's get out of here.

     But Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as
     SOMETHING is moving TOWARDS them. Audrey is tugging at
     him as the shaking gets more violent. With all her
     strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving
     backwards.

     Just as they're out of the tunnel, the CREATURE BLASTS
     outward. Audrey and Animal DIVE into the maintenance
     ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision.


<b>     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL
</b>
     Animal is shielding Audrey with his body. She looks up
     just in time to SEE Godzilla CRAWLING UP and out through
     the ceiling. An amazing site.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               Shoot! Shoot it!

     Animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it
     disappearing from view. Once gone, they both break into
     enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter.

     tunnel. They near the hole Godzilla just created,
     examining it. Nick climbs into the hole.

<b>                            NICK

     Godzilla has spent most of his time. Scattered fish
     abound.

     High above, there is a immense black hole in the tall

     contingency of MOBILE ROCKET LAUNCHERS waiting. They
     FIRE. Godzilla DODGES and the rockets <u>DESTROY PLANET</u>

     Godzilla is heading straight for it, the helicopters

</b>               We do not have enough explosives.

     Raymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a
     group of eggs. Raymond goes towards him.


<b>     ANGLE - AUDITORIUM FLOOR - HOLE - SAME
</b>
     Crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor,
     Animal and Audrey appear. They're stunned at what they
     see. Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film
     as an amazed Audrey walks through.


<b>     ANGLE - NICK AND EGGS - MID-LEVEL DECK

     Kneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them.
     Raymond approaches.

</b>               Nick, we have a problem.

     Nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to
     listen to the egg. He leans his ear against the shell.
     Suddenly we HEAR a loud CRACK. Nick jumps backwards.

     The shell RUPTURES and an large FISSURE opens up across
     the egg. As we hear other CRACKS O.S., Nick turns and
     SEES more eggs beginning to open all around them.


<b>     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL
</b>
     Hidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in
     close to one getting video footage of it cracking.
     Audrey nervously watches. What she doesn't see, however,
     is a BABYZILLA, fish hanging from its jaw, as it
     approaches from behind.


<b>     ANGLE - NICK AND RAYMOND
</b>
     Stunned, they can only stare as the BABYZILLA BREAKS
     FREE of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous
<b>     WAIL.
</b>
<b>                            RAYMOND

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Good idea.

     The BABYZILLA kneels down and immediately starts
     GOBBLING UP the dead fish laying nearby. Cautiously Nick
     and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough
     distance, they they break into a run and head for the
     exit.


<b>     ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL
</b>
     The Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears
     Audrey. Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg.

<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>                      (whispered)
               One more second. This is fantastic.

     Just then Animal turns to SEE the Babyzilla right behind
     Audrey.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               Don't you think we have enough?

<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>               Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.

     Audrey turns to see what Animal is staring at. Her eyes
     go WIDE as she backs up into Animal. Another BABYZILLA
     appear on the other side of them.

<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>               Just be calm. Don't startle them.

     Animal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way
     towards the large "team" entrance at the end of the
     floor. The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin
     to SNIFF the air.

     Audrey moves up the isle. An egg CRACKS and an ARM
     breaks out through a shell, GRABBING HER LEG. Audrey
     FREAKS and frantically she KICKS herself free. They both
     suddenly take off running.

     he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near
     them begin to CRACK. Quickly he and his partner take off
     running.


<b>190  INT. FAR BACK WALL - LOWER LEVEL - SAME                    190

     Two other men are still laying cables for the

     near the eggs.

<b>                            R-MAN #3
</b>               One moment. I've almost got this.

     Just then a BABYZILLA pops up behind the eggs, a fish in
     his mouth. He SWALLOWS the fish and begins SNIFFING THE
     AIR. He turns and stares directly at the slowly
     retreating R-MAN #3.

     He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like
     fish, quickly he turns and RUNS.

     But Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and
     LEAPS onto R-MAN #3's back. R-MAN #2 begins to FIRE at
     Babyzilla just as another one TACKLES HIM from the
     side.

     In moments, they are both devoured.

     turn back just as...

     Audrey SEES something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls
     him to one of the Locker room doors. It's open.

     Through the door we SEE the Babyzilla approaching as
     Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind
     them. There is a sudden THUD against the door.

     Animal rushes over to a large LOCKER CABINET and, with
     all his strength, PUSHES it over, blocking the door.

<b>                            AUDREY

     inside.

     Dozens and dozens of eggs HATCHING. BABYZILLAS
     everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to
     devour all the fish. A Babyzilla appears only feet away
     and turns and stares directly at us.

     Quickly Raymond slams the doors shut as they both
     retreat back into the hallway. Raymond SMASHES the glass
     covering of a nearby FIRE HOSE and raps it around the
     door handles, locking it closed.

     Suddenly a loud THUD as something begins to BANG against
     the locked doorway.

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               We've got to lock them inside while we

               help!

     Nick nods in agreement and takes off down stairs. The
     rest of the team SNAP TOGETHER their automatic rifles
     and prepare for a fight.

</b>               There's got to be another way out of

     Audrey climbs up onto a table and yanks out a grate
     covering the air vent.

<b>                            AUDREY

     Jean-Claude sends Luc up ahead as they guard the
     doorways. A loud THUMP is heard on the door they are
     guarding. Each turns their weapon towards the doors.
     Suddenly a portion of WALL BETWEEN THEM COLLAPSES.

     A DOZEN BABYZILLAS leaping through the plaster. As they
     spill out into the hall, Jean-Claude attempts to open
     FIRE. One of the Babyzilla's is HIT.

     His brothers ATTACK. Luc from the other side tries to
     lay down cover fire but he's overrun by the herd.

     Nick comes racing down the stairs and into the hallway.
     Just then, he passes a locked door, BANGING on the other
     side.

     Just up ahead he can SEE the main lobby. But before he
     can get there, a LOUD CRASH is heard as the locked door
     in front of him SMASHES TO BITS as...


<b>     DOZENS OF BABYZILLAS
</b>
     Flood into the main lobby only a few yards ahead. Nick
     slams on the breaks and quietly tries to back away. He
     turns to run the other directions when...


<b>     MORE BABYZILLA
</b>
     Come BURSTING THROUGH the locked door behind him. Pinned
     down with no way out. Nick SEES the elevator nearby and
     races over, slamming his hand against the button.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Come on, come on.

     The Babyzillas by the front door spot Nick. A couple of
     them start to SNIFF THE AIR and start to move towards
     him. Behind, the Babyzilla also catch the scent and
     turn.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               This is not good.

     Just then the elevator doors open, Nick LEAPS inside.

     painfully slow to react.

</b>               I hate these things!

     Just then the Babyzillas appear. They're just about to
     move in when the doors finally CLOSE. Nick breaths a
     sigh of relief just as a loud THUD is heard as one of
     them SLAMS against the door. It's too late, the elevator
     begins to rise.

     Climbing upward, Animal reaches a plateau and crawls
     into cross vent. He reaches back and grabs his camera.
     Putting it down he turns back and helps Audrey up and
     in.

<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>               You okay?

     Out of breath, she nods. Animal takes the lead again,
     pushing his camera in front of him. He reaches another
     vent that looks down. He's about to pull it free when
     something catches his eye.

     Standing guard, automatic rife in hand, Raymond appears
     with his back toward us. Animal lifts his camera to
     shoot.

     around ready to shoot. Frightened, Nick throws his hands
     in the air.

     down through the grating.

</b>               They're loose. They're allover the
               main lobby. I couldn't get out.

     Just then the vents above COLLAPSES and Animal and
     Audrey come tumbling down. In a flash, Raymond has his
     weapon trained on their heads.

<b>                            RAYMOND

     Raymond turns his gun towards the fallen video camera
     and FIRES, ripping the camera apart.

<b>                            RAYMOND

<b>                            NICK
</b>               I was wrong.

     Just then a LOUD THUMP is heard against the near locked
     door. The THUMPING gets louder and heavier.

               a message out of here.

     The door BURSTS OPEN and TWENTY BABYZILLAS stampede into
     the hallway. Audrey is fast on her feet.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               This way.

     She takes off running and they follow. The Babyzillas
     give chase. Animal, hangs back and runs over to the
     destroyed video camera and PULLS OUT THE TAPE. Just as
     he does, the Babyzillas are nearly on top of him. He
     dashes off.


<b>     ANGLE - END OF HALL - BACK DOOR

     Audrey gets there first and opens the small doorway that
     leads to a back stairwell, she ushers the rest inside.

     She slams the door behind her as the Babyzillas appear
     and begin to SNIFF the doorway.

     The Babyzillas are gathered by the doorway SNIFFING. One
     of the more aggressive ones starts to CLAW at the door,
     RIPPING into it. Another charges it, THUD.


<b>208  INT. LUXURY BOX HALLWAY - SAME                             208

     They rush up to a door marked BROADCAST BOOTH. Audrey
     tries the door, it's locked. Animal charges his shoulder
     into it, but it doesn't give.

     Raymond gently moves Animal out of the way and SHOOTS
     the lock to pieces. He opens the door for everyone to
     enter.

     terminal. Raymond moves some equipment against the door,
     securing it closed.

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               Anyone care to join me?

     Animal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on
     his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond.

     away from us.

     Audrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long
     drop down. The door is begging to give way from the
     repeated THUMPING. Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses
     Nick.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               In case I can't later.

     With that she JUMPS out, repelling downward. Nick is
     stunned by the unexpected kiss. Suddenly the door GIVES
     and the Babyzilla FLOOD into the room. Nick jumps.

     Audrey hits the ground followed by Nick. Raymond leads
     as they make their way out.

     On the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a

     Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit.

     Raymond, guns in each hand, comes rushing into the

     hall and gestures for the group to go the other way.

     Raymond backs away, guns trained on the Babyzillas who
     SNIFF the air and decide to pursue. Raymond turns and
     runs.

     As they tear forward they nearly run smack into a heard
     of several dozen Babyzillas who are tearing the
     concession stands to ribbons looking for food.

     Spotted, the Babyzillas LEAP forward after the team.
     Raymond spots the escalators across the hall.

</b>
     The team races into the corridor. Animal reaches down
     and hits the POWER button near the moving stairs. The
     escalator comes to life.

     The team runs down the "down" escalators as the
     Babyzillas flood into the corridor. Some try to go down
     the "up" escalator and fall all over themselves. Others
     are spooked by the moving down escalator. Finally, the
     brave ones begin to LEAP down the "down" escalator.

     Racing out of the escalator corridor the team moves into
     the main lobby and FREEZES. They are surrounded on all

     Like the scene in Hitcock's "The Birds" it is eerily
     still as everyone freezes.

     As several SNIFF THE AIR, they begin to CLOSE IN. The
     Babyzillas from the escalator corridor finally get to
     the ground level and rush over from behind.

     Raymond spots the large hanging CHANDELIERS in the front
     lobby. He FIRES a short BURST, SLICING the cable
     supporting the chandelier.

     The chandelier DROPS and SHATTERS in the center of the
     main lobby. The Babyzillas scatter, opening a pathway to
     the front door.

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               Go! Now!

     Raymond PUSHES the team forward as he takes the rear
     through the pathway which begins to close up as they
     pass through.

     The Babyzillas recover and begin to charge. As Raymond
     passes some CANDY MACHINES, he grabs one and SMASHES IT
     to the ground.


     <u>THOUSANDS OF GUM BALLS</u>

     Scatter all over the floor. As the Babyzillas run, they
     begin to stumble allover each other, tripping on the
     gum balls.

     Animal is the first to reach the main door, he opens it
     and Audrey and Nick are the first to exit. Raymond,
     FIRING MADLY behind as he rushes for the door.

     Raymond exits and Animal shuts the door behind him. The
     Babyzillas SLAM against the doors. It takes all of
     Animal's and Raymond's strength to hold the doors
     closed.

     Raymond slides his rifle barrel between the handles as a
     temporary lock. He pulls Animal away and they take off
     running.


<b>     BOMB'S P.O.V. - MADISON SQUARE - NIGHT

     Rapidly approaching the famous forum.


<b>     ANGLE - RAYMOND, ANIMAL
</b>
     Not far behind Nick and Audrey as they race from the
     building. Behind them we SEE...


<b>     BOMB AND BUILDING
</b>
     Collide and an ENORMOUS EXPLOSION ERUPTS, engulfing the
     entire building in a mountain of flame.

     Raymond, Animal, Audrey and Nick are THROWN several feet
     forwards, toppling to the ground from the incredible
     impact.

     As the building CRUMBLES in FLAMES we HEAR several of
     the Babyzillas SCREAMING. Soon they are silenced.

     Slowly Nick sits up and turns to Audrey. They're both
     shaken up. Nick touches her cheek gently.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Are you okay?

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               Really? I'd like to find out.

     She hugs him tightly. Nick smiles. Animal turns to
     Raymond who has cut above his eye.

<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>               Hey Man, you all right?

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               I could use a coffee.

     We begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting
     upwards when suddenly...


     <u>THAT FAMOUS WAIL</u>

     Is heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes,
     a very angry <u>GODZILLA</u> emerges!

     Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and
     nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the
     first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression
     of Godzilla's face; pain.

     But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he
     focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and
     accusingly, at our heroes.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Ohhhhhhhh.....shit.

<b>                            ANIMAL

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               Running would be a good idea.

     And they do just as Godzilla POUNCES. Fortunately our
     team DARTS around a corner just in time.


<b>238  EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME                                    238
</b>
     As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla
     BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing
     off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley.


<b>     ANGLE - ALLEY WAY
</b>
     Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to
     large brick buildings. They run for their lives as
     Godzilla appears behind them.

     His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he
     BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as
     he marches forward.

     Bricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just
     they make their way to the other side.

     Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla
     SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path.


<b>239  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      239

     Racing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked

     In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his
     belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column
     and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's
     amazing.

     As he does this the others pile into the car. Not even
     completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the
     engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out.


<b>241  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      241

     Just as GODZILLA bursts out from between the buildings
     the CAB DARTS away, squealing around the next corner.


<b>242  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                       242
</b>
     Power sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow
     Cab FISHTAILS onto 8th Ave. Whipping around the corner
     behind them Godzilla appears.

     As he's MUCH faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a
     single LEAP but the cab SWERVES AGAIN moving down
     another street.


<b>243  EXT. 27TH STREET - SAME                                    243

     building.

     HIT THE CAR. Again, the Cab darts down a small side
     street.

     Using this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out
     onto the next main street (28th). Godzilla rushes down
     the side street, his TAIL shattering buildings as he
     does.

     Animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power
     up. The light goes ON and Animal quickly holsters it and
     begins filming out the shattered back window.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               But we can get to the west side
               faster.

     Through the rear window we SEE Godzilla SNAPPING down
     trying to take a bite. The cab, again, SWERVES wildly,
     darting down a side street.

<b>                            RAYMOND

     disoriented Godzilla who looks around to find the cab.
     He moves up a block and begins to look around.

     The cab POWER SLIDES right past and out of the Meadow
     again just as GODZILLA STOMPS directly into the clean up
     crew. Soldiers DIVE for cover as others scramble out of
     the way.

     Godzilla MARCHES after the cab, his tail SWIPING several
     vehicles which tumble, crashing into the troops.

     In a flash, Godzilla disappears back into the forest on
     the other side. O'Neal grabs his radio.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               Gun it! Gun it!

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               I'm trying!


<b>     C.U. CAB'S WHEELS
</b>
     Spinning in vain against the gigantic tongue that pushes
     against it, LIFTING the REAR of the vehicle.


<b>267  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA - SAME                             267
</b>
     Like a dog with a bone, Godzilla SHAKES his head trying
     to rip the rest of the highway free. The portion of
     highway in front of the cab TEARS FREE, lifting.


<b>268  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      268
</b>
     From the cab we SEE the horizon LIFT as the road begins
     to give way. The sign above CRUMBLING FURTHER.

     Nick turns and SEES...


<b>     ELECTRIC CABLES - SPARKS
</b>
     Sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign,
     Nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab. He
     takes off his jacket, wraps it around his hand and opens
     the cab door.

     Grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he JAMS THE
     CABLE DOWN into Godzilla's TONGUE. SPARKS FLY! Nick
     leans back inside, slamming the door shut.


<b>269  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA                                    265
</b>
     He temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just
     before he is about to SLAM his jaws shut again...


<b>     C.U. TIRES - SUDDENLY CATCHING
</b>
     As the tongue momentarily retreats from the SHOCK, the
     wheels CATCH and the CAB LURCHES FORWARD.


<b>270  EXT. GODZILLA - CONTINUOUS                                 270
</b>
     As the sign CRUMBLES and the JAWS CRUSH DOWN, the cab
     SAILS OUT OF HIS MOUTH as the beast SWALLOWS the piece
     of highway.

     Landing, hard, onto the pavement, the cab PEELS OUT,
     burning rubber as it enters the George Washington
     Bridge.

     Godzilla SWALLOWS only to realize he didn't get them.
     Seeing the cab on the bridge Godzilla gives chase.


<b>271  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE                              271
</b>
     The cab races towards us when Godzilla STEPS ONTO THE
     BRIDGE. His enormous weight makes the entire bridge
<b>     WOBBLE.
</b>
     The Cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to
     the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them. It's
     as though they were driving during an earthquake.

     With each stride Godzilla takes, the bridge becomes more
     unstable.


<b>272  EXT. SKIES ABOVE THE HUDSON - F-18'S - SAME                272
</b>
     Swooping down the F-18's head directly towards the
     bridge. We see Godzilla about to overtake the Cab.


<b>273  INT. COCKPIT                                               273
</b>
     The HUD begins to FLASH, LOCKED ON!

<b>                            PILOT #2
</b>               We are red and free. Stallion 10, Fox
<b>               2.
</b>

<b>274  EXT. BRIDGE - CAB AND GODZILLA                             274
</b>
     Only a stride away from being overtaken.


<b>275  INT. OTHER COCKPIT - SAME                                  275
</b>
<b>                            PILOT #3
</b>               Stallion 12, Fox 2.


<b>     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON
</b>
     All at once they FIRE. Missiles heading right at
     camera.


<b>     GODZILLA
</b>
     opens his mighty jaw about to CLAMP DOWN on them.

     The missiles CONNECT, SLAMMING INTO HIS CHEST,
     EXPLODING. His torso, rips apart. He SCREAMS OUT. His
     WAIL a painful death cry.

     His foot STOMPS DOWN as he tries to retain balance. The
     impact of the stomp acts like a shockwave that KNOCKS
     the Cab into a SPIN.

     SLAMMING into the guard rail, the cab bounces back into
     the road and keeps going.

     The injured Godzilla bites the bullet and continues
     pursuing, his gait slowing. The cab is able to make some
     distance.


<b>     ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON
</b>
     Again they FIRE. A group of missiles darting out.


<b>     GODZILLA
</b>
     The missiles HIT, ripping into him. Again GODZILLA
     SCREAMS out, his forward motion stopped.


<b>276  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                     276
</b>
     Where the blockade and angry mob still wait and watch in
     horror. The Cab SLIDES INTO A SPIN as it comes to a stop
     just in front of the crowd.

     Nick jumps out first, staring back at Godzilla. Audrey
     comes up from behind.


<b>     NICK'S P.O.V. - GODZILLA
</b>
     His eyes rolling back into his head as he SCREAMS OUT.
     Slowly he TUMBLES.


<b>     ANGLE - BRIDGE
</b>
     Godzilla's enormous head comes CRASHING DOWN in front of
     us. The tremendous impact sends TREMORS across the
     bridge.


<b>277  EXT. OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                 277
</b>
     The gathered crowd is ROCKED from the impact of the
     toppled Godzilla.


<b>     GODZILLA
</b>
     His last breath escaping. Defeated and weary, his eyes
     blink slowly as we watch his life slip away.


<b>     NICK AND AUDREY
</b>
     Oddly, Nick stares sympathetically at Godzilla's sad and
     lifeless face.

     The stunned silence melts away as the mob behind them
     begins to applaud nervously, then vigorously. The mob
     breaks through the blockade and rushes over to our
     heroes, surrounding them. Cheering enthusiastically.


<b>278  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     278
</b>
     The room is going berserk, everyone slapping hands. Lucy
     turns and gives a "high-five" to everyone around her.


<b>279  EXT. JERSEY SIDE OF THE BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT              279
</b>
     Cameras flash like mad. Several news crews fight their
     way through the crowd.

<b>                            REPORTERS
</b>                      (overlapping)
               How did you discover the nest? Dr.
               Tatopoulis, can you tell us what
               happened back there?

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Sorry, guys, I've promised my story as
               an exclusive to another reporter.

     Nick winks at Audrey. Caiman pushes his way through the
     crowd of reporters over to her.

<b>                            CAIMAN
</b>               We did it! We've got the exclusive!
               Way to go, Audrey!

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               We? I don't think so.

<b>                            CAIMAN
</b>               I want that story, Audrey. Remember
               you work for me.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               Not anymore. Mr. Caiman, I quit.

     Audrey waves goodbye as Animal walks over, checking his
     camera and his coat pocket.

<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>               Audrey, did you take the tape out of
               the camera?

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               No.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Where's Raymond?

     They look around, but he's gone. Nowhere to be seen.

<b>                            ANIMAL
</b>               I couldn't have just lost it?

     A phone begins to RING. Nick checks his pockets and finds
     Raymond's cellular phone. Nick answers.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Hello?

<b>                            RAYMOND (O.S.)
</b>               It's Raymond.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Where are you?


<b>280  EXT. PAY PHONE - DOWN THE BLOCK - SAME - NIGHT             280
</b>
     Raymond watches the mob scene from a distance.

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               Tell your friends I will send the tape
               after I remove a few items from it.


<b>     NICK AND AUDREY
</b>
     Nick nods to Audrey that it's Raymond.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               I understand.

<b>                            RAYMOND
</b>               I just wanted to say, au revoir and
               thank you for your help, my friend.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Wait.
                      (line goes dead; to
                      himself)
               Au revoir.

<b>                            AUDREY
</b>               Who was that French guy, anyway.

<b>                            NICK
</b>               Oh, just some insurance guy.

     Off Audrey's confused expressions we PULL BACK, farther
     and farther. We see the mob, the military, the command
     tents and finally we pull back far enough to reveal
     Godzilla's mighty head laying on the end of the bridge.

<b>                                             CUT TO:
</b>

<b>281  INT. PENN STATION - SAME - NIGHT                           281
</b>
     We FLOAT through the demolished station almost as though
     we were a moving point of view. We travel thorough the
     debris of the station into one of the tunnels.

     We travel deeper and deeper into the distance. A shaft
     of light up ahead. We move closer to it.

     As we get nearer we realize it's one of Godzilla's
     gigantic EGGS. WE move closer and closer to the solitary
     egg. Just as we are about to collide with it. <u>CRACK</u>. <u>IT</u>
     <u>OPENS</u>.

<b>                                             FADE OUT:
</b>

<b>                              THE END
