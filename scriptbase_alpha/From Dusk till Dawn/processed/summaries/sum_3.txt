The Gecko brothers are fugitives, and are on the run after a very interesting bank robbery.
They kidnap the Fuller family, and drive to a Mexican bar to meet with other on-the-run criminals.
It turns out the crooks in the bar are vampires, and if the Gecko brothers and the Fuller family can survive from dusk until dawn, the "crooks" will let em' go.
