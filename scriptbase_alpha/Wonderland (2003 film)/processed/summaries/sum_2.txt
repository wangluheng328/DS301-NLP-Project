The movie looks at the events that led up to the infamous Wonderland Murders in Los Angeles on July 1, 1981, as well as the investigation.
What is known for sure is that four people were murdered in their Wonderland Avenue apartment, apparently as retaliation for their robbery of a notorious L.A. nightclub magnate named Eddie Nash.
What is not known is what part porn star John Holmes played in the murders.
The police investigation relies on the testimony of two men: Holmes himself, and a biker named David Lind who took part in a robbery of Eddie Nash's house two days earlier, and whose girlfriend, Barbara, was one of the victims.
Lind claims that Holmes had to have taken part directly in the murders (and, in fact, his hand print was found at the crime scene).
However, Holmes claims that he only set up the robbery and the hit, but wasn't in the apartment at the time of the murders.
Now the police are caught in a dilemma: who are they supposed to believe?
A biker with a heroin habit who has a personal ax to grind against Holmes, or a porn star with a notorious cocaine habit who is also known in many circles as a pathological liar?
