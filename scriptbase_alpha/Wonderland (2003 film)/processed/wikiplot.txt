The underage girlfriend of John Holmes, Dawn Schiller (Kate Bosworth), is on the streets and picked up by a holy roller (Carrie Fisher) after she and Holmes break up.
She eventually calls Holmes to come and get her.
Holmes arrives at the apartment and they have sex and snort cocaine in the bathroom.
While in a motel room, Dawn sees a newscast that states four people were murdered at a rowhouse on Wonderland Avenue, the same one she had earlier been in with Holmes.
The story eventually moves on to two city detectives (Ted Levine and Franky G) investigating the crime and their contact with Holmes.
Another officer (M. C. Gainey), a colleague of Holmes, intervenes in the investigation.
