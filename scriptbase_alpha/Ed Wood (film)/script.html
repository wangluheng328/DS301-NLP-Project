<b>                             ED WOOD
</b>

               by Scott Alexander &amp; Larry Karaszewski




                      Directed by Tim Burton





                                                     <u>FIRST DRAFT</u>

                                                     November 20, 1992






<b>     FADE IN:
</b>
<b>     INT. HAUNTED MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT
</b>
     We move through a spooky shrouded parlor, as a storm rages
     outside.  THUNDER roars, and lightning flashes in the giant
     windows.  in the center of the room lies an oak coffin.

     Suddenly the lid starts to creak open. A hand crawls past
     the edge... and then the lid slams up!  Famed psychic CRISWELL
     pops out.  Criswell, 40, peers at us intently, his gleaming
     eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair.  He intones,
     with absolute conviction:

<b>                             CRISWELL
</b>               Greetings, my friend.  You are
               interested in the unknown, the
               mysterious, the unexplainable...
               that is why you are here. So now,
               for the first time, we are bringing
               you the full story of what
               happened...
                       (extremely serious)
               We are giving you all the evidence,
               based only on the secret testimony
               of the miserable souls who survived
               this terrifying ordeal.  The
               incidents, the places, my friend, we
               cannot keep this a secret any longer.
               Can your hearts stand the shocking
               facts of the true story of Edward D.
               Wood, Junior??

<b>     EXT. NIGHT SKY
</b>
     Lightning CRACKS.

     We drift down past the dark clouds... through the torrential
     rain... and end up...

<b>                                                    OPTICAL:
</b>
<b>     EXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT
</b>
     We've landed in Hollywood, 1952.  We're outside a teeny, grungy
     playhouse.  The cracked marquee proclaims "'THE CASUAL
<b>     COMPANY,' WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY EDWARD D. WOOD, JR."
</b>
     Pacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD, 30, our hero.
     Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style
     handsome, Ed is a human magnet.  He's a classically flawed
     optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons
     within.

     The doors open, and Ed's pal JOHN "BUNNY" BRECKINRIDGE, 45,
     hurries out.  Bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a
     string of pearls.

<b>                         [PAGE 2 MISSING]
</b>
     Suddenly the rest of the cast runs up, frantically upset.  In a
     flowing white dress is DOLORES FULLER, 23, a sharp, hungry-
     for-a-career ingenue.  She's near tears.

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               Eddie, my dove just flew out the
               window!

<b>                             CREW MEMBER
</b>               She goes on in two minutes! What
               are we gonna do??

     They all look to Ed, awaiting a response.  He thinks a second,
     then excitedly CLAPS his hands.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Dolores, give me your shoes.

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               What?

<b>                             ED
</b>               The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u>
               <u>me your shoes</u>!

     She hands Ed her white shoes.  He snatches one, grabs a pair of
     scissors, and starts CUTTING up the shoe.  Everyone is baffled.
     He keeps cutting the shoe... and it slowly takes on the shape
     of a dove!

     Ed then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and
     sprints into the dressing room.  He takes some green eye shadow
     and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners.  Ed then hurries
     back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe...
     and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth!

     The cast is flabbergasted.

<b>                             CREW MEMBER
</b>               Wow.

<b>     BACK ONSTAGE
</b>
     The soldiers suddenly look up.

<b>                             ACTOR #1
</b>               Hey, I think I see something!

     Dolores floats down onto the stage, holding out the dove.

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               I offer you mortals the bird of
               peace, so that you may change your
               ways and end all this destruction.

<b>                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>     INT. SCRUFFY COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT
</b>
     Ed and his gang celebrate opening night in a dirty 24-hour
     diner.  They're noisily slugging down drinks, in a big red
     booth.

<b>                             ED
</b>               What a show!  Everyone was terrific!
               Paul, your second-act monologue
               actually gave me chills,

     He grins at Actor #1, aka PAUL MARCO, a young eager beaver
     who's loyal like a dog.

<b>                             PAUL MARCO
</b>               Aw thanks, Eddie.

     Actor #2, aka CONRAD BROOKS, a friendly, simple-minded lug,
     runs up waving a newspaper.

<b>                             CONRAD
</b>               I got the early edition!  It was just
               dropped off at the newsstand.

<b>                             ED
</b>                       (he smiles at everyone)
               This is the big moment...!

     Ed opens the paper to the entertainment page.
<b>      
</b>     INSERT - THE NEWSPAPER.  Ed turns to a column, "The Theatrical
     Life, By Victor Crowley."  Under this is a photograph of an old
     man with an ascot.

<b>     WIDE
</b>
     Everybody excitedly crowds around and starts reading.   A
     moment... and then their faces drop.  Clearly, this is a
     disastrous review.  Their faces get sadder, and sadder... and
     then they finish.  A melancholy beat, until --

<b>                             BUNNY
</b>               What does that old queen know?  He
               wasn't even there!
                       (he knocks back a drink)
               Sending a copy boy to do his dirty
               work.  Well <u>fuck him</u>!

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               Do I really have a face like a horse?

<b>                             PAUL MARCO
</b>               What does "ostentatious" mean?

     Ed calmly waves his arms for attention.  He tries to smile.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Hey.  Hey, it's not that bad.  You
               just can't concentrate on the
               negative.  He's got some nice things
               to say...
                       (he scans the review)
               See, "The soldier costumes are very
               realistic."  That's positive!

     Everyone kind of stares at their drinks, depressed.  Ed
     launches into an upbeat speech.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Hell, I've seen a lot worse reviews.
               I've seen ones where they didn't even
               like the costumes!  Like, that last
               "Francis the Mule" picture -- it got
               <u>terrible</u> notices.  But it was a huge
               hit.

<b>                             PAUL MARCO
</b>               Lines around the block.

<b>                             ED
</b>               So don't take it too seriously.
               We're all doin' great work.

<b>                             CONRAD
</b>               You really think so?

<b>                             ED
</b>               Absolutely!  It's just the beginning.
               I promise this: If we stick together,
               one day I'll make every single one
               of you famous.

     He smiles at everyone at the table.  They all believe what he
     says, and there is a hushed moment of dream-filled hope.

<b>                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>     INT. DOLORES' APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     Ed and Dolores lie in bed, in the dark.  He stares vulnerably
     at her.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if
               I just don't have it?

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               Ed, it was only one review.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Orson Welles was 26 when he made
               "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               Ed, you're still young.  This is the
               part of your life when you're
               <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.

<b>                             ED
</b>               I know... But sometimes I get scared
               this is as good as it's gonna get...

     Ed jumps up.  We WIDEN, revealing he's in a giant greenhouse,
     packed with rows of potted plants and shrubs.  Ed grabs a small
     palm tree and hurries out.

</b>
     Ed strolls across the busy movie lot, lugging the palm.  He
     passes a soundstage and notices the stage door open a crack.
     Ed glances around, then puts down the palm and hurries in.

     A big-budget foreign legion movie is shooting, with a huge cast
     and crew. A giant desert set has been erected, with camels and
     real sand dunes. Ed is blown away.

     Ed continues across the lot, carrying his palm tree.  An OLD

     The footage is totally random: Giant explosions, buffalos
     stampeding, tanks, an octopus swimming, etc.

               See, the story opens with these
               mysterious explosions.  Nobody knows
               what's causing them, but it's
               upsetting all the buffalo.  So the
               military is called in to solve the
               mystery.

</b>               You know, I saw you perform
               "Dracula."  In Poughkeepsie, in 1938.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Eh, that was a terrible production.
               Renfield was a drunk!

<b>                             ED
</b>               I thought it was great.  You were
               much scarier in real life than you
               were in the movie.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Thank you.

</b>               I waited to get your autograph, but
               you never came outside.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               I apologize.  When I play Dracula,
               I put myself into a trance.  It takes
               me much time to re-emerge.

     A CITY BUS approaches.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Oh, there's my bus.
                       (he checks his pockets)
               Shit, where's my transfer?!

<b>                             ED

     with smoke from his big cigar.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               I have no next picture.

<b>     EXT. BELA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

     Ed drives past pumping oil wells and into a seedy neighborhood.
     They reach a tiny, well-manicured house.  Ed and Bela get out.

<b>                             BELA

               They don't want the classic horror
               films anymore.  Today, it's all giant
               bugs, giant spiders, giant
               grasshoppers -- who would believe
               such nonsense!

<b>                             ED

<b>                             BELA
</b>               They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry
               to them.
                       (he lowers his voice)
               And you know what else?  The women
               prefer the traditional monsters.

<b>                             ED

<b>                             BELA
</b>               The pure horror, it both repels and
               attracts them.  Because in their
               collective unconsciousness, they have
               the agony of childbirth.  The blood.
               The blood is horror.

<b>                             ED
</b>               I never thought of that.

<b>                             BELA

               "score" with a young lady, you take
               her to see "Dracula."

     Bela's eyes twinkle.  He reaches his front door and unlocks it.
     INSIDE... it's awful.  Squalid, dark, with skulls and strange
     voodoo objects scattered about.  Up front hangs a large
     photograph of shockingly young Bela, handsome and regal.

     Ed is stunned by this dismal place, but doesn't say anything.
     Within, DOGS start BARKING crazily.

<b>                             BELA

     The dogs BARK louder.

     huge console.

<b>     INT. BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

     ON THE TV, one of Bela's old '30s horror films plays.  Bela's
     evil character is hypnotizing somebody: His eyes stare the
     famous stare, then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture.

<b>     ON ED AND BELA
</b>
     They are entranced.  The men drink beers in silence.  Bela's
     TWO DOGS lie at his feet.

<b>     ON THE TV
</b>
     The old movie suddenly stops, and VAMPIRA appears on the TV
     screen. Vampira, 25, is the sexy "Creature Feature" hostess,
     a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress.

     She leers in front of a corny fog-shrouded set.  There is a
     pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading "Happy Halloween."

     hand gesture at the TV.

     Bela becomes fatigued.

     Bela smiles.  He gets up, shuffles across the room, and steps
     <u>behind a curtain</u>.  Ed is puzzled.  Bela's thin arm appears and
     draws the curtain tight.  We hear mysterious CLANGING, drawers
     opening and closing, and then silence.

     Ed sits, waiting.

     Behind the curtain, something DROPS.  We hear a muffled "Shit!"

     Ed is getting worried.  But then the curtain whips open, and
     Bela bounds out, grinning.  He's a bundle of energy.

<b>                             BELA

     Bela puts on his famous cape, then gets a pair of fangs and
     sticks them in his mouth.

<b>     OUTSIDE

     Little kids in Lone Ranger and Howdy Doody costumes giggle
     expectantly.

     Suddenly the door flies open, and standing there is Count
     Dracula!  The <u>real</u> Count Dracula.  YEOWWWW!!!  The kids SCREAM

</b>               Well how about <u>these teeth</u>?!!

     Ed RIPS HIS TEETH out of his head and thrusts them at the
     kid.  The boy SCREAMS in terror and races away.

     Bela is wowed.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Hey, how'd you do that?

     The moonlight shines down on a rickety old cemetery.  The wind

     Ed and Bela reach the locked gates.  They glance at each other,

     Ed peers nervously.

     Bela looks like a child on Christmas morning.  He takes another

     Ed's eyes light up.  He starts chasing after Bela.

     Bela's heart is racing.  He zig-zags past ancient crypts.
     Gargoyles peer down.  The wind howls through the skeletal
     trees, silhouetted against the cloudy sky.

     Ed runs through the shadows, trying to catch up.

     Bela flaps his cape up and down.  We almost think he's going to
     fly.

     Ed races up, then quietly stops.  He eagerly watches Bela,
     practically expecting him to turn into a bat.  It's a magical,
     crazed moment.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               I am DRACUlA!  I will LIVE FOREVER!!!

     Bela laughs, then lies down on the grass.

<b>     WIDE
</b>
     Ed slowly walks over and lies next to Bela.  They're happy,
     eyes alert, on top of the world.

     Ed peers in wonder at his new friend.

     Ed sits across from Georgie.  Ed's very excited.

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               So what's the big news you couldn't
               tell me over the phone... again?

     Ed gulps excitedly.  He has a spiel all planned out.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what
               you said, about how all your movies
               have to make a profit.  And I
               realized, what's the one thing, that
               if you put in a movie, it'll be
               successful??

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>                       (he thinks)
               Tits.

<b>                             ED
</b>               No.  Better than tits -- a <u>star</u>!

     Georgie shakes his head.

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               Eddie, you must have me confused with
               David Selznick.  I don't make major
               motion pictures.  I make crap.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Yeah, but if you took that crap and
               put a star in it, you'd have something!

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               Yeah.  Crap with a star.

<b>                             ED
</b>                       (impassioned)
               No!  It would be something better!
               Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest
               moneymaker you've ever had!

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               Fine, maybe you're right.  But it
               doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't
               afford a star, so I don't even know
               what we're talking about.

     Ed grins.

<b>                             ED
</b>               What if I told you you could have a
               star for $1000??

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>                       (skeptical)
               Who?

     Ed opens his valise and whips out an 8x10 GLOSSY OF BELA.

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               Lugosi?

<b>                             ED
</b>               Yeah!  <u>Lugosi</u>!

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               Isn't he dead?

<b>                             ED
</b>                       (annoyed)
               No, he's not dead!  He lives in
               Baldwin Hills.  I met him recently,
               and he wants to be in our picture.

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               OUR picture?

<b>                             ED
</b>                       (sheepishly)
               Uh, yeah.  Our picture.

     Georgie mulls this over.  He's interested.

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               Why would Lugosi want to be in a
               sex-change flick?

<b>                             ED
</b>               Because he's <u>my friend</u>.

     Georgie stares carefully at Ed, then finally smiles.

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               Alright, fine!  You can direct it.
               I want a script in three days, and
               we start shooting a week from Monday.

     He leaps up euphorically.  He eagerly pumps Georgie's hand.

<b>                             ED

     CU on a ROYAL TYPEWRITER.  Ed's hands whirl across the portable
     typewriter, frantically feeding in pages as fast as be can
     type.  We PULL OUT.

     Ed sits on the bed, typing.  He's a blur of activity, juggling
     a cigarette, coffee, and a telephone, while he writes.

                             ED (on phone)
               But Bunny, you're perfect for this
               job!  You're so good at organizing.

     His adrenalin is pumping.  Ed pours some booze into his coffee.

<b>                             ED
</b>               You know these people.  I need all
               the transsexuals and transvestites
               you can get.
                       (he sucks on his cigarette)
               No, I don't care if they're not
               actors.  I want realism.  I want this
               film to tell the <u>truth</u>!  I've waited
               my whole life for this shot, and I'm
               not gonna blow it.

     There's a KNOCK at the door.  Ed carries the phone on a long
     cord and answers it.  Bela hurries in, smiling broadly.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!

               You'll love your character!
                       (back into the phone)
               Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the
               bars, work some parties, and get me
               transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!

     Ed hangs up and resumes typing.  Bela is puzzled.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Eddie, what kind of movie is this?

<b>                             ED
</b>               Well, It's about how people have two
               personalities.  The side they show
               to the world, and then the secret
               person they hide inside.

<b>                             BELA
</b>                       (delighted)
               Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde!  Ah, I've
               always wanted to play Jekyll and
               Hyde!  I'm looking forward to this
               production.

     Ed stops typing.  He pours Bela a drink.

     The crew members put down their things and gather in a circle.
     In the middle, we reveal Ed, in complete drag.  Dress, nylons,
     pumps, lovely blonde wig... he's quite a sight.  Like an eager
     Scoutmaster, he addresses his troops.

               After lunch, we'll bring in the
               Inspector and the Doctor.  The Doctor
               is very important to the plot, so we
               might have to spend time on retakes.
               But it's worth it.  Scene totals for
               the first day is thirty-four.
                       (he catches a breath)
               Day Two, we'll be a little busier --

     Veteran CAMERAMAN BILL, an old guy with thick glasses, speaks.

<b>                             CAMERAMAN BILL
</b>               Excuse me Eddie, I don't mean to
               interrupt... but I'm gettin' a little
               worried about those clouds.

     He points up.  Everybody looks at the sky.  The clouds are
     gray.

     Ed nods in agreement.

<b>                             ED
</b>               <u>Good thinkin'</u>.  We'll talk about Days

               that first shot off!  It's Scene 17,
               Glenda looking in the window.

<b>     THE CREW
</b>
     disperses.  Ed quickly runs in his heels over to the burly
     make-up man, HARRY.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Okay, do I need any touch-up?

<b>                             ED
</b>                       (irritated)
               Harry, we've discussed this a million
               times.  I don't want to look like a
               girl.  I want to look like myself.

               Fine.  Then you look <u>beautiful</u>.

     Harry humorlessly powders Ed's nose.  Ed turns away and
     suddenly SHOUTS into a giant megaphone.

<b>                             ED

     A pause, and then Ed, <u>in character as Glenda</u>, calm and
     dignified, steps out and walks down the sidewalk.

     Ed stops at a store window.  He's totally in shadow.

     A grip grimaces.  He TURNS ON a light

     Ed lights up.  He looks in the window, admires a dress on
     display, then silently walks out of frame.

     A beat.  Ed SCREAMS.

<b>                             ED

     Suddenly a police car turns the corner.

     The company is now shooting inside a dinky soundstage.  There
     are dirty mattresses tacked on the walls.  They prep Bela's
     set: A fishnet-draped armchair in front of a flat.  Ed is
     perched high in his director's chair, back in men's clothes.

<b>                             ED

                       (nobody is listening; so Ed uses

               Now everyone, when he walks on the
               stage, treat him normal.  I know Bela
               Lugosi is a world-famous star, and
               you're all a little excited, but
               we're professionals.  So if you treat
               him with respect, everything will be
               alright.

<b>     AT THE STAGE DOOR
</b>
     The door swings open, and Bela strides in, looking dapper.  He
     glances at the teensy stage, and his face falls imperceptibly.

     Ed runs up, bounding with enthusiasm.

<b>                             ED

     Ed and Bela step over to a corner.

<b>     ACROSS THE ROOM

     From a distance, Ed pulls a wad of money from his pocket and
     peels off a few bills for Bela.  The crew watches, fascinated.

     Bela is seated in the ratty armchair on the set.  Harry does
     his make-up.  Harry glances at Bela's arm, and it is full of
     TRACK MARKS.  Harry grimaces, but doesn't say anything.

     Conrad eagerly scurries up.

<b>                             CONRAD
</b>               Mr. Lugosi, I know you're very busy,

</b>                       (cordial)
               Of course.

     Conrad hands him a scrap of paper.  Bela signs it.

<b>                             CONRAD
</b>               You know which movie of yours I love,

               You were great as Karloff's sidekick.

     Bela's face suddenly hardens.  He snaps.

     Ed is frozen in fear.  He glances across the stage.

     Georgie is flabbergasted.  He points urgently at his watch.

     Ed nods.  He motions to Conrad: Get out of here.  Conrad runs
     away.  Ed leans in to Bela.

<b>                             ED

     It's dead quiet.  Nobody knows what's about to happen.

     WE MOVE IN TO BELA.  And... he suddenly assumes character.
     Like the consumate pro he is.  Bela gets a wicked, sinister
     leer, then starts intoning threateningly:

               your "Written, Directed, and Starring
               Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Why?!  I did all those things!  Hell,
               I even built the props.

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               And you did a bang-up job, too.  But
               you don't want other producers to
               know that's you in drag.  Trust me.
               It's a career killer.

     Ed is quite upset.

<b>                             ED
</b>               But I'm proud.  I wrote, directed,
               and starred in it just like Orson
               Welles in "Citizen Kane"!

<b>                             GEORGIE
</b>               Yeah??  Well Orson Welles didn't
               wear angora sweaters, did he??!

     Ed is beaten.

     It's the cast and crew screening!  The eager two-dozen people
     are packed into a tiny screening room.

     The lights dim, and the movie starts.  A LIBRARY MUSIC fanfare,
     and then: "Bela Lugosi in GLEN OR GLENDA"

     Everyone APPLAUDS excitedly.  Bela smiles.
<b>       
</b>     Credits continue: "Featuring Daniel Davis and Dolores Fuller"

     The audience is audibly baffled.  Bunny BLURTS out.

                             DOLORES (on screen)
               "Glen.  Is it another woman?"

     Ed as Glen nervously ponders his response.

     But suddenly -- MUSIC THUNDERS in.  The movie cuts to <u>buffalo</u>
     <u>stampeding</u>.  Bela's angry face is superimposed over this.

                             BELA (on screen)
               "Pull the string!  Pull the string!"

<b>     IN THE AUDIENCE

     People are impressed by this technique.  Bela nods in approval.

<b>     ON-SCREEN
</b>
     Out of nowhere, CHEAP JAZZ MUSIC starts, and the movie abruptly
     cuts to SLEAZY STAG PARTY-STYLE FOOTAGE!  A bare-chested man
     whips a bound woman!  A woman dominates another tied to a large
     stick!  A brunette violently rips off her dress and does a
     hoochie-coochie dance!

<b>     IN THE AUDIENCE

     Ed looks back at Georgie, who's wearing a big satisfied grin.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Georgie, what's with the stag

     Ed rolls his eyes.  He turns back to the movie.

<b>     INT. PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT

     Everybody is CELEBRATING, with a raucous party.  People are
     boozing it up.  BIG BAND MUSIC plays.  Ed dances with Dolores.
     Paul smokes a joint.  Conrad falls over a table and breaks a
     lamp.  Bela dances happily with a cute young REDHEAD.

     We're outside a cute little Spanish bungalow house.  Ed and

<b>                             DOLORES

     The house is moved in.  Ed's unkempt dogs run about.  Pumped-up
     Ed sits on the bed typing fiendishly fast while wearing an
     angora sweater.  A cigarette dangles from his mouth, and a
     bottle of booze lays in his lap.  Bela sits quietly nearby.

<b>                             ED

               He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing

               Well... can't I play the romantic
               part?  I'm tired of always being the
               bad guy.  You know, back in Hungary,
               I played Romeo!  I would like to be
               the lover again -- me, in a boat,

     Ed considers this.

<b>                             ED

               Something we <u>know</u> the audience will

<b>                             ED
</b>               Of course!

     Ed crabs a pen and excitedly scrawls out the word "DRACULA."
     Bela frowns.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Those bastards at Universal.  I made
               so much money for them, and now I
               can't get the time of day.

<b>                             ED
</b>               So let's make another "Dracula."
               Let's make "The Return of Dracula"!

<b>                             BELA
</b>               We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches

</b>               They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a
               way to get around that...

     Ed's mind is working.  He holds out the paper and stares at
     it.  Suddenly, he grins.  He grabs the pen and makes a period
     after the "DR."  It now says "DR.ACULA"

<b>                             ED

               wear the cape, have the fangs...
               but you're a doctor!  Not a count.

<b>                             BELA

     and starts typing.

               at your little opus.  Maybe we can
               do business together.

     Ed is elated.

<b>     INT. STUDIO SCREENING ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Feldman and his fellow SMARMY EXECUTIVES sit in a plush
     screening room.  They are viewing "Glen Or Glenda."

     ON-SCREEN, Ed is in drag.  A SOLEMN NARRATOR within the movie
     speaks:

<b>                             SOLEMN NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>               "Give this man satin undies, a dress,
               and a sweater... and he's the
               happiest man in the world.  He can
               work better, think better, even play
               better -- and be more of a credit to
               his community and his government."

<b>     ANGLE ON THE EXECUTIVES
</b>
     They are stupefied.  Yikes!

<b>                             EXECUTIVE #1

<b>                             EXECUTIVE #2

     Matches!

     In the stands are Ed, Dolores, Bunny, and Bunny's new YOUNG
     MALE "FRIEND."  Seated around them are hollering truckers and
     ex-Marines.  Bunny giggles and nudges gloomy Ed.

     The crowd suddenly ROARS and jumps up.  A favorite wrestler has
     entered the ring, massive TOR JOHNSON, 50.  Tor is an
     incredible sight: A bald, lumbering behemoth.

                             RING ANNOUNCER (amplified)
               Now entering the ring, in the gold

               pure strength, the "Swedish Angel"...
               Tor Johnson!!!

     The crowd goes apeshit.  The stands are going to collapse from
     the SHOUTING.

     Ed's eyes are the size of saucers.

     The bell RINGS.  Tor quickly grabs his OPPONENT, a man in a
     blue mask, and throws him at the ground.  Then Tor jumps onto
     his stomach, easily picks him up, and heaves him at the ropes.

     People CHEER.  Ed is flabbergasted.

               be like in a movie?

     He screams maniacally in Swedish.  Tor lifts the Opponent over
     his head and tosses him into the stands.  Three rows of chairs
     get knocked over.

     Bela and Ed sit in his dressing room, running lines.  Bela is
     in his Count outfit: Cape, jet black hair, red lips, etc.  They

     Ed and Bela stand in the wings.  Onstage is the SHOW HOST, a
     cheesy comedian.  He is doing a routine with Criswell, the
     famed psychic who opened this movie.  Criswell wears a tux and
     a turban and is acting mysterious.

<b>                             HOST
</b>               Sounds like a heck of a way to beat

     Audience LAUGHS.  Criswell rubs his temples enigmatically.

<b>                             CRISWELL

     We're out in the audience.  The curtain rises on a SPOOKY SET:
     Shadows, cobwebs, and a coffin in the center.  The Host walks
     onstage, to huge APPLAUSE.  He's playing his "Slick" character,
     a befuddled moron in a funny hat.  The Host shines a flashlight
     around, and then the coffin opens.  Bela sits up.  There's more

     The audience HOWLS with laughter.  Bela is totally lost.  He
     seems incredibly confused.

<b>                             BELA

</b>               I told you we should've gotten

     They shuffle away... until Criswell and his snazzy ENTOURAGE
     burst around a corner.  Even in person, Criswell is ethereal
     and quite self-important.  He is delighted to see Bela.

     Ed turns to Tor and Loretta.  She wears a wedding gown.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're
               in a trance.  You glide in and get
               on the operating table.  Now Tor,
               you're supposed to tie her down.  But
               you have an angora fetish... and
               when you rub that swatch of angora,
               it makes you refuse so Bela has
               to discipline you.

<b>                             TOR
</b>               Okey-dokey.

                             BELA (as VORNOFF)
               "Now we are ready for the girl."

     Bela does his patented hypnotic arm wave.  He actually has a
     powerful intensity.  Loretta staggers in, eyes glazed.  Like a
     zombie, she climbs onto the operating table.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               "Dear, you are a woman of super

               of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"
                       (he breaks character)
               Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't
               remember all this.  I'm an old man.
               It's too long.

<b>                             ED
</b>               That's fine, Bela.  We're still
               rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're
               lovely."

<b>                             BELA
</b>                       (he snaps back into character)
               "Dear, you're lovely."
                       (he turns to Tor)
               "Strap her to the table."

     Tor starts to tie Loretta down, then gets distracted by a piece
     of angora hooked to his waist.  He rubs it lovingly, calmed,
     then suddenly refuses.

     Bela is furious.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               "Do as I command you!"
<b>         
</b>     Bela pulls out an oversized BULLWHIP and starts WHIPPING Tor.
     Tor screams in agony.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               "I'll teach you to disobey me!"

</b>     Bela chases Tor around the set, WHIPPING him.

</b>               I love being movie star!
<b>         
</b>     Tor jubilantly hugs Loretta.  She grimaces.

<b>                             LORETTA
</b>               Ow.  Not so hard, Tor.

     A SURLY STAGE MANAGER strides over to Ed.

     The large stage door SLAMS shut.

     Ed looks totally dazed.  He blinks in the bright sunlight.

     The whole crowd is there, dressed up.  Bela sits in the corner,

<b>     ON ED
</b>
     Ed stands with a circle of POTENTIAL BACKERS.  He has an edge
     of desperation we've never seen before.

<b>                             ED
</b>               ...lemme tell you, you can't lose.
               It's scary!  And if you don't like
               that, it's romantic!  Bela Lugosi
               portrays Dr. Vornoff, and lovely
               ingenue Loretta King is reporter
               Janet Lawton.

               Which role is Vampira playing?

     The guy points.  Ed turns and looks and Vampira is standing
     <u>in the next room</u>.  She's at a different party.

<b>                             ED

     Ed dashes from the room.

<b>     NEXT ROOM OVER

     Vampira is drinking with a bunch of artsy-fartsy types.  She's
     in street clothes, but clearly recognizable.  Ed runs up.

               You don't know me, but my name is Ed

               currently in production on a
               science-fiction piece, with Bela
               Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor
               Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I
               thought: Kismet!

     Vampira stares, totally uncomprehending.

               maybe I should explain: We started
               shooting, but then after three days
               we got shut down.  So we're having
               a backers party, to raise some more
               money.  Perhaps you'd like to come
               next door and meet some of the
               backers...?

     Vampire glances at her friends.  They uncomfortably turn away.

<b>                             VAMPIRA
</b>               Uh, look, I'm with some friends, and

               You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and
               meet my backers!  There's a really
               nice dentist from Oxnard...

               real offers from real studios.  I
               don't need to blow some dentist for
               a part.  So forget it!

<b>     BACK AT THE PARTY
</b>
     The backers glance into the next room.  Ed is in front of
     Vampira, begging on his hands and knees.

<b>                             BACKER

               I'm getting a bad feeling about this.
               Let's get out of here.

     The backers pick up their coats.  Through the doorway, Ed sees
     this.  He jumps up and frantically runs back in.

<b>                             ED

     Ed and Bela stroll through a parking lot.  Ed is sobered up and
     remorseful.  Bela wears a beret and smokes a huge cigar.

     based quasi-religious temple.  Bela puts out his cigar, and
     they enter the oversized doors.

<b>     INT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME

     Sphinxes and Bodhisatvas peer down from the marble walls.  A

     elderly women in fur coats.  As the lecture continues, Ed

               Years ago, the Hungarians contacted
               me.  The government wanted me to come
               home, to be Minister of Culture.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Correct.  So instead, I stayed here,
               waiting for my comeback.  Always
               hoping... the next film, the next

     Ed walks down an aisle with DONALD E. McCOY, a wealthy Texan

     McCoy SPITS his tobacco.

                             OLD MAN McCOY
               Okay, two things.  Number one: I want
               the movie to end with a big
               explosion.  Sky full of smoke.

               Not anymore.  And number two: I've
               got a son.  He's a little slow -- but
               a good boy.  And something tells me

               permission.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he
               was in meetings all day.  But this'll
               be great, I promise!

     Ed smiles at Conrad.  Conrad shrugs.  Tor struggles.

<b>                             TOR
</b>               I'm no good at climbink.

     Tor gives up, and simply BASHES through the locked gate.
     Everyone is amazed.  Tor laughs.

<b>                             TOR
</b>               I'm good at bashink!!

</b>               Hey, keep it down.  My publicist will
               throttle me if we get caught.

     They all sneak across the shadowy lot.  Remnants of old scary
     sets tower over them.

<b>     OUTSIDE A SOUNDSTAGE
</b>
     They reach a stage door. Ed tries it -- but it's locked.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Oh.  I thought they kept this open.

     A pause.  Everyone looks at Tor.  He grins.

<b>                             TOR
</b>               Lobo will fix!

     Tor grabs the heavy door and easily SNAPS the lock.

<b>     INT. SOUNDSTAGE - SAME TIME
</b>
     This place is <u>the</u> mythic eclectic prop room.  Guillotines,
     rocketships, a stuffed vulture... strange mysterious props from
     untold movies loom everywhere in the darkness.

     It's a place of wonderment and fear.

     The men stare in awe.

<b>                             CONRAD
</b>               Wow.

<b>                             PAUL MARCO

</b>               Not so fast.  First we have to get
               it down.

     Ed gestures above.  Everyone glances straight up.

<b>     THEIR POV
</b>
     A giant OCTOPUS is lashed to the ceiling.

<b>     LATER

     Conrad and Criswell are way up on the catwalk, holding onto
     dangling Paul by his belt.  Paul leans way out, reaching for
     the octopus.  He shouts nervously.

<b>                             PAUL MARCO
</b>               You're sure this is gonna work?

</b>
<b>     WIDE VIEW
</b>
     Standing straight below is Tor.  The Swede has his arms
     outstretched, waiting.

     Ed supervises a good distance away.  He motions to Paul.

     Paul gulps, then unties the octopus.

     It drops incredibly fast.  The thing must weigh half a ton.

     Tor's eyes widen.

     And the octopus smashes straight on top of him.

<b>     BAM!
</b>
     Tor is gone from sight.  One of the eight tentacles snaps off.

<b>     UP IN THE CATWALK
</b>
     Criswell moans.

<b>                             CRISWELL
</b>               Oh my God.  We killed him.

<b>     ON THE GROUND
</b>
     Ed runs to the octopus and looks for Tor underneath.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Tor!  Are you okay?!

     A beat.  And then the octopus flips over.  Tor sits up,
     battered but smiling.

<b>                             TOR
</b>               Bedder than wrestlink!

<b>     EXT. REPUBLIC STUDIOS - NIGHT
</b>
     The five men hurry across the lot, carrying the hubongous
     octopus on their shoulders.

     Suddenly, a FLASHLIGHT shines on them.

<b>                             ANGRY VOICE
</b>               Hey!  What are you doing?!

     The men jump with fear.  They break into a fast waddling run.

<b>                             CRISWELL
</b>               Thank God Tor broke the fence.

     The team runs through the busted gate and escapes.

<b>     EXT. STUDIOS - NIGHT
</b>
     The Cadillac SCREECHES away.  The octopus flops on top of the
     five men.

<b>     EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT
</b>
     The movie crew is setting up for a big night shoot.  Lights and
     generators are sprawled across this isolated area.

     Tony McCoy perches goofily on his own personalized chair.  He
     runs lines by himself.

<b>                             TONY
</b>               "Now Janet, I want you staying away
               from the old Willows Place."

     The octopus lays in a dried-up riverbed.  There's only about an
     inch of water.  Ed yells at Conrad.

<b>                             ED
</b>               You don't understand!  The octopus
               is supposed to live in a <u>lake</u>!

<b>                             CONRAD
</b>               This is kind of a stream--

<b>                             ED
</b>               NO!  It has to be UNDERWATER!

     Ed storms away.  Conrad scratches his head.

<b>     IN A DUSTY PARKING LOT
</b>
     Bela sits inertly in the back of an open car.  He weakly hails
     over Ed.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know

<b>                             ED
</b>               Nonsense!  You look great --
                       (suddenly he catches himself; he
                        speaks more sincerely)
               Look, uh, why don't you lie down and
               take a little nap?  We'll film around
               you for a while.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Thanks, buddy...

     Ed smiles warmly, then walks off.

     Bela stares after him, then absent-mindedly searches through
     his pockets.  Finally, he finds what he's looking for -- a
     rubber tube.  Bela looks to make sure no one's around, then
     ties the tube around his upper arm...

<b>     AT THE SET - LATER
</b>
     Crew members have dammed up the end of the river, and Bunny
     fills it with a hose.  There is now <u>a foot of water</u>.

     Ed stands at the shore, admiring it.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Hey.  This is looking good!
                       (he turns to Paul)
               Paul, where's the octopus motor?

<b>                             PAUL MARCO
</b>               What octopus motor?

<b>                             ED

               anything about no motor when I was
               up on that ceiling!

     Bela stumbles up, with a dazed smile.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do

</b>               Out <u>there</u>?!
                       (he points at the water)
               What happened to the stream?

<b>                             ED
</b>               This'll look a lot better.  We have
               to match the stock footage of the
               octopus underwater.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Oh, for Christ's sake.

     Bela rolls up his pants and wades out, into the water.  He
     screams.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Goddamn, it's cold!

<b>                             ED
</b>               Once you're in it, it warms up.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Fuck you!  <u>You</u> come out here.
                       (beat)
               Hey, toss me that J.D.

     A crew member throws Bela a bottle of Jack Daniels.

     Bela pops the cap and chugs half the bottle in one swig.  He
     licks his lips, then climbs onto the octopus.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?

<b>                             ED
</b>               Bela, somebody misplaced the motor.
               So when you wrestle the octopus,
               shake the legs a bit, to make it look
               like it's killing you.

     Bela stares, deadpan.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Do you know I turned down
               "Frankenstein"?

<b>                             ED
</b>               Huh?

<b>                             BELA
</b>               After I did "Dracula," the studio
               offered me "Frankenstein"!  But I
               turned it down, the part wasn't sexy
               enough.  It was too degrading for a
               big star like me.

     The crew glances at Ed.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Bela, I've got twenty-five scenes to

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Don't let me slow you down.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Alright!  Let's put it on film.
<b>               CAMERA!  SOUND!

     Bela takes another swig of J.D., then throws it off-camera.

<b>                             ED
</b><b>               ACTION!
</b>
     Bela starts flailing around the octopus legs and SCREAMING in
     horror.  This image is truly ridiculous.     

     Ed is pleased.                              

     Some crew members nod: Pretty good.         

<b>                             ED

     Everybody cheers.

     Then suddenly the dam walls BURST.

     WHOOSH!  The water rushes from the lake and floods the park
     below.

     somber scene with an actor playing PROFESSOR STROWSKI, a
     threatening European.

               "My dear Professor Strowski, twenty
               years ago I was banned from my home

               a "Bride Of The Atom" party, whatever
               that means.

     They open the large steel door, and INSIDE is the wild bash.

<b>     INT. PARTY
</b>
     Across the room, Paul and Conrad chat.

<b>                             PAUL MARCO
</b>               "Glen Or Glenda," now that was a hell

</b>               Well, this new one's gonna be a

<b>                             PAUL MARCO
</b>               Is that possible?

     Dolores overhears this.  She stares in disbelief.

<b>     AT THE TURNTABLE
</b>
     Someone changes the record.  Brassy STRIPPER MUSIC begins.

     A door opens, and Ed struts out, in full gaudy drag.

     Everybody turns.  They start WHISTLING and HOLLARING.

     Ed grins, and starts into a wacky bump-and-grind.

<b>                             VOICE
</b>               Go, baby, go!

     Bunny runs up and sticks a dollar bill between Ed's fake tits.
     People LAUGH hysterically.

     Dolores is appalled.

     Ed shimmies to the music, blowing kisses all around.  He sees
     Vampira and waves.

     Vampira's jaw drops in recognition.

<b>                             VAMPIRA
</b>               I don't believe it.  It's <u>him</u>!

     Ed sashays up to Bela and dances a few steps with him.  The
     music is building to a climax.  Ed hurries off to center stage
     -- and as the MUSIC ENDS, he does a final swing of his hips,
     then suddenly yanks out his teeth!

     This brings down the house.  Everyone STAMPS their feet and
     CLAPS crazily.

<b>     ANGLE - DOLORES
</b>
     Everyone, except Dolores.  Suddenly, she explodes.

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               You people are INSANE!  Take a look
               around -- you're all FREAKS!

     The room quiets.  Dolores has snapped.

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               You're wasting your lives making
               SHIT!  Nobody cares!  These movies
               are TERRIBLE!
                       (beat)
               I can't take it any longer!

     The group is shocked.  Nobody speaks.

     Dolores runs out of the party.

     Ed just stands, dumbstruck.  Then he chases after her, in his
     high heels and dress.

<b>     EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - SAME TIME

     Dolores runs across the parking lot, in tears.  Ed catches up
     with her.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Dolores, wait!

               Did you really mean those things you
               said..?

     Dolores stops.

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               I'm tired of living on the fringe.

<b>                             ED
</b>               But you used to say --

<b>                             DOLORES
</b>               Ed... I just stuck it out so you
               could finish your movie.
                       (pause)
               Now that it's done, so am I.

     She turns and walks away.  Ed is crushed.  He stands
     motionless, in his dress, in the dark.

     Ed's new home is a single apartment, still filled with moving
     boxes.  Half-eaten plates of food are scattered about.  Ed lies
     asleep in bed, unshaven, in the middle of the day.

     The phone RINGS.  Ed awakens and woozily answers it.

<b>                             ED

<b>     EXT. TOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Ed drives his Nash though a tract Valley neighborhood and
     reaches Tor's little house.  Ed gets out, still looking groggy.
     He walks up the tulip-lined path and rings the DOORBELL.
     Clanging SWEDISH CHIMES bong inside.

     The door flies open, and Tor appears, beaming.

<b>                             TOR

     Tor gives Ed a back-breaking hug.

<b>     INT. TOR'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
</b>
     Ed steps in.  The house is filled with cuckoo clocks and little
     Swedish knick-knacks.  Tor gestures proudly.

<b>                             TOR
</b>               I'm so happy you visit.  Meet my
               family!  Greta, Karl, and Connie!

     THREE COLOSSAL PEOPLE lumber out.  Tor has the largest family
     we've ever seen.  Not fat -- but <u>big-boned</u>.  GRETA is Tor's
     gigantic Swedish wife, and KARL and CONNIE are their two
     elephantine children.  They ADLIB greetings: "Hallo!"
     "Welcome!" "Is a pleasure!"

     Ed cannot believe what he's seeing.

<b>     INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Everyone noisily eats dinner.  The table looks like a
     Smorgasbord.  Entire hams, turkeys, a full case of beer,
     incredible quantities are being shoveled in.  Tor empties a
     beer in one gulp, then opens another.

<b>                             CONNIE
</b>               Pass the meatballs.

<b>                             KARL
</b>               This strudel is delicious, Mama.

     Ed is stupefied.  He picks at a little dainty serving.

<b>                             TOR
</b>               Hey!  You're not eatink.

               Oopsy.  That cabbage goes right
               through me.

     Tor stands and hurries from the room.  Ed awkwardly makes
     conversation.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Greta, your husband is a terrific
               actor.  You should come down and
               visit the set.

<b>                             GRETA

               my husband Tor.  He is not a monster.
               These horror pictures are
               humiliating.

     Ed has no response.  Suddenly -- CRASH!  There's a loud o.s.
     SLAM, falling porcelain, then Tor SHOUTS FURIOUSLY in Swedish.

<b>                             TOR (O.S.)
</b><b>               OUCH!  GODDAMMIT!

     Earl and Connie begin giggling. Ed is totally baffled.
     Tor runs out, angrily holding a BROKEN TOILET SEAT.  It is
     split in two.

<b>                             TOR
</b>               Look, it happened again!

     Ed is boggle-eyed.  This house is sadness.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Tor, I should be getting home.

<b>                             TOR

     It's very late.  Tor and Ed sit in the living room, drinking
     from a steaming pot of hot stilled wine.  They are smashed.

<b>                             TOR
</b>               My friend, you tink Greta is first
               woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds,

<b>                             ED
</b>               But I thought me and Dolores had
               something.

<b>                             TOR

               boy like you as you can have any girl
               you wish.

     Tor finishes his glug, and then his eyes roll back into his
     head, and he falls off the couch.  He starts SNORING.

     Ed stares at Tor, then gets up.  Ed turns off the lights and
     goes home.

               Ooo!  That was so scary, it gave me
               goosebumps.

<b>     INT. SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

     There is another rambunctious party in progress.  Crepe paper
     streamers hang down.  Bela approaches Tor.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               So what are we doing here?

<b>                             TOR
</b>               Nobody knows.  But there's a lotta
               booze.

     Suddenly Ed steps into the middle of the room.  He's extremely
     handsome in his tuxedo, and beaming happily.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Excuse me!  Could everyone please
               quiet down?
                       (the room quiets)
               First of all, I want to thank you,
               all my good friends, for being here
               tonight.  And second, if you're
               wondering what the big surprise is...
               well, TONIGHT I'M GETTING MARRIED!!

     The crowd is stunned.

     Many people DROP their glasses.

     Ed proudly pulls out Norma.  She's in a wedding gown.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Everybody, this is <u>Norma</u>!

<b>     ON BELA AND TOR

     They're bewildered.  Bela WHISPERS.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Who the fuck is she??

<b>                             TOR
</b>               I never heard of her.

     Ed walks over.  He hugs Bela.

<b>                             ED
</b>               And Bela, I want you to be the best

     Bela smiles -- trying to hide his total confusion.

     Ed kisses Norma.

     The crowd doesn't applaud.  They're too baffled by this whole

     Criswell grabs Ed and pulls him aside.

               perfect for me.

     Outside, a car HONKS.

     Ed and Norma run out the door.  The crowd hurries after them.

<b>     OUTSIDE
</b>
     Ed and Norma jump into his Nash.  It says "Just Married" and is
     festooned with dangling tin cans.  The car screeches away.  The
     cans RATTLE NOISILY, then slowly fade into the distance...

     Ed excitedly carries Norma over the threshold.  He throws her
     onto the bed, and they start ardently making out.

     He helps her remove her wedding dress.  She is very shy.

</b>               Be understanding.  I don't know

     Ed removes his jacket, then gestures to his shirt.  Norma
     nervously starts unbuttoning it.

     Ed bites his lip in anticipation.

     Norma opens the shirt... and <u>inside, Ed is wearing a bra</u>!

     Norma is horrified.

     Ed despondently approaches Bela's.  Inside, a light glows, and
     the dogs BARK.

     Ed is relieved.  Bela's awake.  He BANGS on the door.

     He keeps BANGING.  Finally the door opens -- and Bela stands
     there, shakily <u>waving a gun</u>!  Bela is doped up, glassy-eyed,
     and disturbingly haggard.

<b>     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

     Decrepit Bela is propped up in his bed, as the mob of reporters
     throw questions at hit and SNAP shots: "Bela, how long have you
     been a junkie??" "Bela, look this way!"

     Ed angrily pushes through.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Everybody out!  This is a hospital!
               Get out of here.

     Ed forces them out, then SLAMS the door.

<b>                             ED

               Isn't it wonderful?  After all these
               years, the press is showing an
               interest again in Bela Lugosi.

<b>                             ED
</b>                       (surprised)
               Bela, they're parasites!  They just
               want to exploit you.

<b>                             BELA
</b>               Fine.  Let them!  There is no such
               thing as bad press.  A man from New
               York even said he's putting me on the
               front page!  First celebrity to ever
               check into rehab.
                       (he smiles feebly)
               When I get out of here, I will be
               healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed
               for my comeback!

     Bela starts COUGHING heavily.  Ed stares sadly.

     There's a moment.  And then Bela slowly steps outside, calm,
     dignified, walking with a cane.  He looks about -- and then
     something catches his eye.  He leans down and picks a flower.

     Bela smells the flower, then abruptly drops it.  He starts
     crying.  A pause, and then he composes himself.  The old man
     slowly shuffles out of frame.

     Ed peers emotionally from behind the camera.

     It's PANDEMONIUM.  People are screaming and shouting.  Kids jump
     up and down, on top of the chairs.

     Bela, Tor, Vaspira, and Criswell are alarmed.

     The lights dim on and off.  Scratchy SPOOKY MUSIC blasts over
     the sound system.

     Criswell pushes blind Tor towards the stage.  Tor sticks out
     his arms and scarily staggers down the aisle.  Criswell
     nervously follows.  Vampira escorts Bela.

     The crowd BOOS.  They pelt our gang with popcorn.

     Tor GROWLS like a monster.  Kids LAUGH and jeer.

     Criswell pushes Tor in the right direction.  Some roughnecks
     knock down Criswell and snatch his wallet.

     A MEAN BOY jumps on his chair, ripping the stuffing out of the
     seat.  He throws the fibers in the air, and they float over
     Bela and Vampira.

     The lights suddenly go off.  Some girls SCREAM.

     Ed's panicked.  He grabs Kathy and runs down to his friends.

     Ed rounds up Bela, Tor, Criswell, and Vampira.

     "Bride Of The Monster" starts unspooling on the screen.

     The gang frantically runs out, scared for their lives.

     They look over.  Some JUVENILE DELINQUENTS are stripping the

     Ed spins wildly around... and sees a <u>cab</u> approaching.

     Bela stops walking.  And in a BOOMING, THEATRICAL VOICE, he
     suddenly launches into his impassioned, climactic speech from
     "Bride Of The Monster."

     him a pen and paper.

<b>     INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME

     Ed motions Reynolds in.  Reynolds peers unsurely at the tornado
     inside.  Then he notices a framed one-sheet for "BRIDE OF THE
     MONSTER."  Reynolds admires it.

               religious films, on the Apostles.
               But unfortunately, we don't have
               enough money.

               Raising money is tough.

<b>                             REYNOLDS

     His eyes suddenly pop.

     The color comes back to his fact.  A plan is quickly boiling
     over inside Ed's head.  He starts feverishly pacing around.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Okay -- you know what you do?  You
               produce a film in a commercially
               proven genre.  And after it's a hit,
               you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and
               make the twelve Apostles' movies.

     Ed randomly grabs a script off the messy floor, then glances
     down, to see which one he picked up.  It says "Graverobbers
     From Outer Space."

               find a double to finish his scenes,
               and we'll release it as "Bela

     Ed hangs up.

     Paul leads in THREE.  They look <u>nothing</u> like Bela.  One is
     a HOMELESS BUM, one is a SHORT FAT MAN, and one is CHINESE.

     He suddenly rises, Poseidon-like, from the pool.

     And inside is the "Grave Robbers From Outer Space" famous
     CEMETERY SET!  The film is in production!  Packed into a
     stinking little studio are a few scrawny twigs, branches, and
     flimsy cardboard tombstones set against a black drop.

     He chats up the CREW.

</b>               The script refers on numerous
               occasions to graverobbing.  Now we

</b>               Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to
               do a thriller at Universal, and they
               want Charlton Heston to play a
               <u>Mexican</u>!

     Ed shakes his head.  He's discouraged.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?

               You know the one film of mine I can
               stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio
               hated it... but they didn't get to
               touch a frame.
                       (he smiles warmly)
               Ed, visions are worth fighting for.
               Why spend your life making someone
               else's dreams?

<b>     "PLAN 9" MONTAGE:
</b>
<b>     SCENE IN THE CEMETERY SET

     Tor plays a zombie rising from the dead.  He wears the scary
     white contact lenses.  Tor's so big, he has trouble lifting
     himself from the grave.

<b>     EDITING ROOM

     Ed and his stock footage buddy watch a moviola.

<b>     SOUNDSTAGE

     Harry paints Bunny's face GREEN, like a Martian.  Ed yells.

<b>                             ED
</b>               NO!  The aliens should look like
               people.

<b>     SCENE IN THE SPACESHIP SET
</b>
     Bunny's make-up is now normal.  He wears an alien
     suit.  A HAMMY ALIEN enters and salutes with a bizarre
     crossing gesture.

<b>                             BUNNY

     Tor staggers up to Paul Marco and CLOBBERS him.

<b>     OFF-STAGE

     Ed smiles at the Baptists.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Maybe you guys were right.  "Plan
               Nine" <u>is</u> a good title.

<b>     MINIATURE CITY SET
</b>
     Ed shoots the famous flying saucers.  Paul holds a paper plate
     and Conrad lights it on fire.

     The "saucer" soars on fishing line over a little miniature
     town.

<b>     SCENE IN THE BEDROOM SET

     Dr. Tom glides in, his cape over his face.  A woman SCREAMS.

<b>     COCKPIT SET

     Ed stands in front of a masonite board and two chairs.  An

     A shower curtain gets lowered into the doorway.

<b>     EXT. DUSTY ROAD

     A car zooms by.  Kathy drives, as Ed shoots handheld out the
     back window.

</b>
<b>     EXT. CITY - NIGHT
</b>
     It's pouring rain.  Standing in the drench is Ed.  He's wearing
     a tux, and fighting with his open convertible top.  The
     Rambler is filled with water.

     Kathy stands under an awning.  She wears a pretty gown.

<b>                             ED
</b>               I can't get it to go up.

</b>                       (he gives up)
               C'mon!  Let's just go.

     Ed impulsively opens the car door.  Water pours out.  Kathy
     scurries out and jumps in the wet car with him.

<b>     EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
     The rain is gushing down.  The marquee proclaims "WORLD
<b>     PREMIERE: PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE!"
</b>
     People hurry in.  Ed and Kathy roar up in the open convertible,
     totally soaked.  He jumps out, opens her door, and they run
     inside.

<b>     INT. THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
     The theater is packed.  All the gang, and their friends and
     families, are gathered.

     Criswell stands on-stage, speaking into a mike.

<b>                             CRISWELL
</b>               You are about to see en extraordinary

               hand to the man without whom we
               wouldn't be here tonight... Eddie,
               take a bow!

     The crowd ERUPTS in applause.  Everybody goes crazy -- even the
     Baptists.  People YELL "Speech! Speech!"

     Ed smiles proudly.  Kathy kisses him.  Ed runs down front, hugs
     Criswell, then takes the microphone.

<b>                             ED
</b>               Thanks a million.  I just wanna
               say... this film is for Bela.

     The lights dim.

<b>     MINUTES LATER
</b>
     The title "PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE" is projected onto the
     screen.  As random IMAGES from the film play out, we drift over
     the happy faces of our friends watching.

     Paul and Conrad stare, enthralled.

     Tor laughs as he sees himself.

     Vampira giggles.  Bunny nudges her playfully.

     Criswell mouths his own lines.

<b>     ON SCREEN
</b>
     Bela appears, in his little suit.  In the last footage he ever
     shot, he shuffles around in front of his house, then tenderly
     smells the flower.

<b>     ON ED
</b>
     He watches, entranced.  Then he smiles to himself.

<b>                             ED
</b>               This is the one.  I know I'll be
               remembered for this film.

<b>     INT. THEATER LOBBY - LATER
</b>
     The BOISTEROUS crowd is in high spirits.  People congratulate
     Ed and pat him on the back.  "It was great!"  "It's your best
     one yet!"  "Bela would've loved it!"

     Ed drifts through the crowd, basking in the glory.  It's like a
     wonderful dream.

<b>     EXT. THEATER - SAME TIME
</b>
     The rain comes down in sheets.  The doors burst open, and Ed
     and Kathy run out.

<b>                             KATHY
</b>               Ed, I'm so happy for you.

<b>                             ED

<b>                             KATHY

<b>                             ED
</b>               <u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!

<b>                             KATHY
</b>               But it's pouring.  And the car top
               is stuck!

<b>                             ED
</b>                       (he gives his killer grin)
               So?  It's only a five-hour drive.
               And it'll probably clear up, once we
               hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably
               clear up once we drive around the
               corner.  I promise.

     Kathy stares in disbelief.  Then she smiles.  They kiss.

     Ed and Kathy jump into the open convertible.  The engine
     starts, and they drive away, disappearing into the pouring
     rain.

     A moment.

     And then, we move up, up, into the black clouds.  Lightning
     CRACKS across the sky.

<b>                                                    OPTICAL:

     We slowly PULL OUT from the sky, move through a window... and
     we're back inside

<b>     INT. HAUNTED MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT
</b>
     Criswell is sitting inside his coffin.  He stares at us.

<b>                             CRISWELL
</b>               My friend, you have just seen the
               story of Edward D. Wood, Junior.
               Stranger than fact... and yet every
               incident based on sworn testimony.
                       (his eyes gleam)
               A man.  A life.  Can you prove it
               didn't happen?

     A beat, to ponder this.  And then Criswell slowly lies back in
     his coffin, and the lid mysteriously closes over him.

<b>                                                    FADE OUT.
