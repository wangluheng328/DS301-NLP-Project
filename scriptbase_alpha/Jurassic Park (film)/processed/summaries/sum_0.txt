Huge advancements in scientific technology have enabled a mogul to create an island full of living dinosaurs.
John Hammond has invited four individuals, along with his two grandchildren, to join him at Jurassic Park.
But will everything go to plan?
Especially when one of the parks' own workers attempts to steal the dinosaur embryos, and has to shut down critical security systems in the process.
It's now a race for survival with dangerous creatures roaming all over the island.
