What Jake Vig doesn't know just might get him killed.
A sharp and polished grifter, Jake has just swindled thousands of dollars from the unsuspecting Lionel Dolby with the help of his crew: Insideman Gordo, Shills Miles, and Big Al--and two corrupt LAPD officers, Lloyd Whitworth and Omar Manzano.
But when both Lionel and Big Al turn up dead, it becomes clear that Lionel wasn't just any mark--as Jake soon learns, he was an accountant for eccentric crime boss Winston King.
Never one to shy away from a challenge, Jake offers to repay The King by pulling off the biggest con of his career.
The mark?
Morgan Price, a banker with deep ties to organized crime.
With so much riding on the outcome, Jake decides to bring in a brash, blonde pickpocket named Lily, who joins the crew in a complex scheme involving corporate loans, creative accounting, wire transfers and off-shore accounts.
Jake and his crew will have to stay one step ahead of both the criminals and the cops to finally settle their debt.
