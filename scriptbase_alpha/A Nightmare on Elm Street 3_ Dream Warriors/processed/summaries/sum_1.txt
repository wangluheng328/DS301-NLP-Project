The third Nightmare continues Freddy's story with the sole survivor of the first movie, Nancy Thompson.
Nancy has just accepted a position as a research scientist at a pschiatric institution near the fated house on Elm Street and is working with a group of children who all share nightmares of Freddy.
She discovers that one of the children (Kristen) has a special gift which may help them destroy Freddy forever.
