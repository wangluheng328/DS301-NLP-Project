For Marion Crane, it's been quite an eventful day.
The day before, she had stolen $40,000 from her employer's client, packed her bags and driven all day on her way to join her paramour several hundred miles away.
Now, she is taking a relaxing hot shower after her long day's journey.
The remoteness of the motel suit her purposes perfectly.
The only sounds heard are the chirping of the crickets, the splashing of the water, and her humming contentedly as the hot needles of water caress her aching shoulders.
