Speed Racer is the youngest driver in the WRL (World Racing League), and his ultimate goal is to be the best driver in the world.
When he was younger, he watched his older brother, Rex after leaving home, compete in the Casa Cristo Cross Country Rally.
Rex did not survive that race.
Now, James "Speed" Racer is participating in that very same cross country race and is determined to win where his brother did not.
All was not lost though, because unbeknownst to the Racer family, Rex did not die, but he did change his looks and assumed the identity of the masked Racer X. X watches over Speed when he competes in various races around the world.
