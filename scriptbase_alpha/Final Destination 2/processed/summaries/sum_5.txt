"It has been one year today since the tragic explosion of flight 180."
After having a premonition of a horrific multi-car pileup on the highway, Kimberly panics and blocks off the offramp she is on holding up several cars.
Kimberly tries to tell Officer Burke, who was one of the people behind her what was about to happen.
As he looks at her in disbelief cars begin to crash and explode about 1/2 mile from them as they stare in shock.
Later that same day, one of the survivors dies in a freak accident and Kimberly starts to wonder if the flight 180 incident and the events after weren't just a coincidence.
Her only hope lies in Clear Rivers, the sole survivor of flight 180.
Can she help them cheat death one more time?
