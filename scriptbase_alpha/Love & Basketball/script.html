<b>	OPENING TITLES
</b>
<b>	SLOW MOTION.  STYLIZED.  TIGHT.
</b>
	The silhouette of a man and woman.  They are on a blacktop
	basketball court, playing a sexually-charged game of one-one-
	one.

	Sweat glistens.  Hands pull at clothes.  Hips bump and
	collide.  Eyes lock...

<b>	BALDWIN HILLS
</b>
<b>	EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - LATE MORNING
</b>
	An upper middle-class neighborhood, known as the Black
	Beverly Hills.  Big houses, green grass and Caddies in every
	other driveway.  The street is quiet, until --

<b>				YOUNG VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		You wanna be Kareem?

	CAMERA REVEALS: QUINCY MCCALL, eleven years old, dribbling a
	basketball in front of KELVIN and JAMAL, also eleven.  He
	sports a fro, a "Clippers" jersey, and a serious swagger.

<b>				QUINCY (CONT'D)
</b>		All his big butt do is stand by the
		basket.

<b>				JAMAL
</b>		Shoot, I'll be blocking your stuff.

<b>				KELVIN
</b>		I'm gonna be like Dr. J.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I'ma be like my Dad.

<b>				JAMAL
</b>		He ain't a star or nothing.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I don't see none of your sorry daddies in
		the NBA.

<b>				KELVIN
</b>		Hey, look, Q.

	Quincy follows Kelvin's eyes, to a beat-up pair of Converse
	All-Stars approaching from next door.  Walking in the kicks
	is a YOUNG KID in a T-shirt and Tuff-skins, and a LAKERS cap
	pulled low.  A moving van is parked in the driveway.

				KELVIN (cont'd)
		Thought only girls were moving in.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		That's what my Moms said.

<b>				KELVIN
</b>		I hope he can ball.

<b>				JAMAL
</b>		Bet he's a scrub.

	The Kid stops at the edge of Quincy's driveway.

<b>				KID
</b>		Hey.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Hey.

<b>				KID
</b>		Can I play?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You nice?

<b>				KID
</b>		Yeah, I'm nice.

	Quincy looks the Kid up and down, then --

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You and Kelvin gainst me and Jamal.

	Quincy tosses the Kid the ball.  The Kid pulls off the
	baseball cap.  Brown hair tumbles down, framing a soft brown
	face and bright eyes.  She is MONICA WRIGHT, eleven years
	old.

<b>				JAMAL
</b>		Ah man, he is a girl.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Girls can't play no ball.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Ball better than you.

	Quincy laughs derisively as Monica walks to the top of the
	driveway.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(whispering)
		What a dog.

	Monica shoots him a glare.

<b>				JAMAL
</b>		She heard you.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Nuh uh, they could only hear dog
		whistles.

	Monica starts to dribble.  Jamal whistles as he walks
	backwards, guarding her.  She throws up a shot.  IT'S AN
	AIRBALL.  Quincy and Jamal crack up.  Kelvin rolls his eyes.

	Quincy grabs the rebound and shoots.  Swish.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		One, zip.

	He rolls the ball to Monica.  She starts dribbling and again,
	Jamal just backs up with her.  She passes to Kelvin.  Jamal
	and Quincy collapse on him, leaving Monica open under the
	basket.  Trapped Kelvin has no choice but to pass it back.

	Monica catches the ball and throws up a shot.  It banks off
	the backboard...AND DROPS THROUGH THE NET.  The boys look at
	her in shock.  Monica tosses the ball back to Quincy.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		One, up.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Lucky.

	Quincy easily dribbles by Kelvin and lays up the ball.  He
	throws the ball back to Monica.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Two, one.

	Monica dribbles.  Jamal plays her a little tighter.  Monica
	bounces the ball through his open legs and lays up the ball.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Two, up.

	Quincy can't believe it.  Kelvin cracks up.

<b>				KELVIN
</b>		Aaah, she dogged you.

<b>				JAMAL
</b>		Shut up.

	The game continues, with Quincy and Monica trading baskets
	for their teams.  Quincy grows agitated with Jamal, who is
	unable to stop her.  The score hits nine, nine.

	Quincy stands at the top of the driveway, ball in hand.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Point.

	Quincy dribbles through his legs, then pops an outside shot.
	The ball bounces on the rim...and rolls off.

	Quincy curses as Monica grabs the rebound and clears the
	ball.  Jamal moves to guard her, but Quincy shoves him off.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I got her.

	Quincy defends.  Monica smiles back at him.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be
		the first girl in the NBA.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my
		cheerleader.

	Monica suddenly passes to Kelvin, sprints for the basket.
	Quincy stumbles, giving her a step.  Kelvin throws it back.

	Quincy knows he's beat as Monica goes for the winning lay-up.
	In desperation, he swings at her for the hard foul, shoving
	her off balance.

<b>	THE BALL FLIES FROM HER HAND AS SHE CRASHES TO THE GROUND,
</b><b>	FACE-FIRST.  SHE GRABS HER CHEEK.  BLOOD SLIPS THROUGH HER
</b><b>	FINGERS.
</b>
	The boys stand frozen.  Quincy stares down at her, his eyes
	wide with fear...and regret.

<b>	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATE MORNING
</b>
	Monica leans over the sink as her mother, CAMILLE, 36, wipes
	the blood from her face with a washcloth.

<b>				GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Eeew.

	Her sister, LENA, 14, leans in the doorway, making a face.
	She is a mirror of their mother, with relaxed hair and
	painted nails.

	Her father, NATHAN, 39, moves behind Lena, holding a box.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		How are you feeling, munchkin?

	Monica nods.  He smiles.

				NATHAN (cont'd)
		Yeah, you're through.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		She needs to stop running around like a
		little boy.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		She's alright.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		How is she alright looking the way she
		does?

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		Camille, she'll be fine.

	He gives Monica a wink, crosses away.  Monica pulls the
	washcloth away from her Mom and starts wiping the blood
	herself.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		I'll get some ice.

	She exits.  Lena shakes her head, follows.

	Monica pulls the washcloth from her face and stares into the
	mirror.  TORN SKIN SURROUNDS A SMALL DEEP GASH IN HER CHEEK.
	Seeing her latest battle scar, there's only one thing left
	for this little girl to do.  She smiles.

<b>	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
	Quincy sits at the kitchen table, writing "I AM SORRY" in
	block letters across a homemade card.  His face is tight with
	concentration as he tries to write in a straight line.

	At the counter, his mom, NONA, moves a cake from its store
	box to a cake dish.  She is 30, beautiful, with effort.  She
	smooths the frosting with a spoon.

	ZEKE, 32, with the height and ego of an NBA ballplayer,
	enters.  He laughs.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Girl, who you trying to fool?

	Quincy looks up, smiles.  He quickly grabs a piece of
	crumpled paper, and tosses it to Zeke.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Alley-oop, Dad.

	Nona intercepts his pass.

<b>				NONA
</b>		Boy...

	She points him back to his card.  Quincy scowls, starts
	writing again.  Nona scoops some frosting on her finger,
	holds it up.

				NONA (cont'd)
		New neighbors.

	Zeke wraps his lips around her finger, sucks the frosting
	off.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		See, Quincy, this is how your Moms caught
		me, with the old fake and bake.  Had me
		thinking I was getting a sister who could
		burn.

	Nona laughs, pulls him down for a kiss.  Quincy suddenly
	throws down his pencil in frustration.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I can't do this shit.

	Zeke and Nona pull away, stare at Quincy in shock.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Boy, what'd I tell you about using that
		word?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(sighs, then)
		"Can't" should never be in a man's
		vocabulary.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Why not?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Cause when you say can't, you ain't a
		man.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		That's right.

<b>				NONA
</b>		Zeke.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		What?
			(then)
		Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."

	Nona just shakes her head.

<b>				NONA
</b>		We should head over.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Just you and Quincy, baby.  I got a
		meeting.

<b>				NONA
</b>		With who?

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Business folks.

<b>				NONA
</b>		You just got back from a four game road
		trip.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Nona, don't start bitching.  I got maybe
		two years left to play.  I'm just trying
		to put some things together for us.

	Zeke grabs his keys.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		Later, Quincy.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Later, Dad.

	Zeke exits.  Nona leans against the counter, concerned.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Mom?

<b>				NONA
</b>		What?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		We still have to go?

<b>				NONA
</b>			(beat)
		Yeah.

<b>	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>


	Camille and Nona stand among the piles of boxes.  Monica and
	Quincy stand at their mothers' sides, stealing glances at
	each other.  A large bandage covers Monica's cheek.  Monica
	holds her card, Camille holds the cake.

<b>				NONA
</b>		...we moved back here when Quincy was
		about five, after Zeke was traded.
		Neighborhood was a little more mixed
		back then...

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Until the Black family down the street
		became the Black family next door.

<b>				NONA
</b>			(nods)
		Okay?

	Camille tries to smooth down Monica's unruly hair.  Monica
	moves her head.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Well, thanks again.  This was really nice
		of you.

<b>				NONA
</b>		It was the least we could do.  And I love
		to cook.

	Quincy looks up at his Mom, surprised.  She quickly hugs his
	face into her stomach.  Camille lights up.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my
		friends' parties and things back in
		Atlanta.

<b>				NONA
</b>		You're a caterer?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled
		and the girls get a little older, it's
		definitely something I want to do.
			(then)
		Since you love to cook, maybe it's
		something we can talk about.

	Quincy snickers.  Nona quickly changes the subject.

<b>				NONA
</b>		You know, girl, long as I've lived next
		door, I've never seen the inside of this
		house.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Really?  Well, come on, then.

	Camille hands Monica the cake.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Honey, put this in the kitchen.

<b>				NONA
</b>		Help her, Quincy.

	Camille and Nona head down the hall, leaving Monica and
	Quincy alone.  The two just stand there.

	Quincy reaches out, scoops a finger of frosting, and pops it
	in his mouth.  Beat, then Monica takes a bigger scoop.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So...does it hurt?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		It's this big hole.  You could almost see
		bone.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		For real?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Uh huh.

	Quincy is impressed.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So how come you could play basketball?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I just can.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I never knew a girl that could play.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		My Mom says she doesn't know where I come
		from 'cause I act different.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Your Dad play?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		He works at a bank.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		My Dad plays for the "Clippers."  He says
		I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma
		play for them, too.  Same number and
		everything.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm going to be number thirty-two, like
		Magic.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		He's alright, but my Dad can take him.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What was the most points your Daddy ever
		got in Junior High?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I don't know.  A lot.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		One time Magic scored forty-eight points,
		and they only had six minute quarters and
		he sat out the whole fourth.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You do act different.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I don't care.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Well, if anybody bothers you, you could
		just tell me cause I run this street.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'd just tell my sister, Lena.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad
		showed me how to fight like Ali.

	He shows off a flurry of punches.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		So, I know karate from "Almighty Isis."

	Monica puts the cake down on a box, does a couple of kicks
	and hand movements.  Quincy is impressed.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Bet you can't do this though.

	Quincy does a jump kick.  Monica does the same.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Okay, how bout this?

	Quincy takes a couple steps back, then does a cartwheel.  It
	looks great, until he crashes into the box with the cake.
	The cake falls onto his head and shoulder.

	Monica doubles over, laughing.  Quincy is embarrassed.
	Camille and Nona rush back into the living room.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Monica, what did you do?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Nothing.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>			(to Nona)
		Oh, all that work.

<b>				NONA
</b>		It's...it's okay.  Can I get a towel?

	Camille quickly crosses into the kitchen.  Quincy stares at
	the floor.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Sorry.

	Nona bends down, whispers in his ear.

<b>				NONA
</b>		No.  Good boy.

	Monica sits between Lena's legs, grimacing, as Lena works a
	comb through her freshly washed, kinky hair.  Monica's head
	flops like a rag doll.  Her eyes are wet.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Ow!

	Lena keeps tugging.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Ow, Lena!!!

	Monica punches her in the leg.

<b>				LENA
</b>		Ow!

	Lena yanks Monica's head back as Camille enters, carrying a
	yellow dress on a hanger.  Monica sees it and her face falls.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Ah, Mom.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your
		box of dresses under a pile of rags in
		the garbage.

	Monica sulks.  Lena cackles in her ear.  Camille has to
	laugh.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Child, pick up your lip.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I hate it.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Fine, you don't like this one, which one
		would you rather wear?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Pants.

	Camille rubs her temples, then hangs the dress on the door.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>			(to Lena)
		When you're done can you make sure she
		brushes her teeth?

<b>				LENA
</b>		Are you okay?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		I just need to lay down.  I've been
		running around all day.

	Just then, Nathan enters.  He holds up two dress shirts as if
	it were a matter of life and death.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		Which one for tomorrow?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		The blue.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		You sure?

	Camille nods.  Nathan looks at both of them, then:

				NATHAN (cont'd)
		Can you iron both tonight just in case?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>			(beat)
		Okay.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		Thanks, sweetheart.

	He kisses her on the cheek, hands her the two shirts and
	crosses out.  Monica just watches.  Beat, then Camile turns
	back to her daughters.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		The boy next door is riding with you to
		school so you'll know somebody your first
		day.
			(to Lena)
		Hurry so she can go to sleep.

	Monica reacts, surprised.  Camille leaves.  Lena puts the
	comb back to Monica's hair.  Beat, then:

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Make it look nice, kay.

	Basketball posters, "Clippers" and USC memorabilia, a
	basketball globe light.

	Quincy lays tucked in bed, eyes wide open, listening to his
	parents MAKING LOVE.  The sounds bring a smile to his face.

	Quincy climbs out of bed, wearing underwear.  He moves to his
	window, sees Monica through her window directly across from
	his.  Her eyes are closed as Lena braids her hair.  Quincy
	kneels down, rests his arms on the window sill, and watches.

	Quincy sits atop his BMX bike in front of Monica's house.  A
	basketball is tucked under his arm.

	Monica emerges, walking her banana-seater.  She is looking
	cute in her yellow dress and braids tied with ribbons.  A
	basketball sits in her back basket.

	Quincy is taken aback, stares at her.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You wanna be my girl?

	Monica blinks in surprise.  She thinks for a moment.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What do I have to do?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I guess, you know, we play ball and we
		ride to school together.  And if you get
		mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I don't like flowers.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Oh.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever
		buy them.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Kay.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Okay.

	An awkward beat between the new couple.  Finally --

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I think we gotta kiss now.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		For how long?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Five seconds.

	The two glance around, then climb off their bikes and walk to
	the secluded area between their two houses.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Ready?

	Monica nods.  They lean in, eyes wide open, and touch lips.
	Quincy counts to five with his fingers.  They pull away,
	embarrassed, and walk back to the driveway.

	Monica lifts her bike from the ground and climbs on.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Wait.  Cause you're my girl now you
		gotta ride my bike.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I want to ride my own bike.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		My Dad always drives my Mom.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		So?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(impatient)
		So that means I have to ride with you.

	Monica doesn't move.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Come on.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I don't have to do what you say.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Man, forget you then, stupid.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for
		the worst team in the NBA.

	Quincy's face instantly clouds.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What?

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(laughs)
		Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Shut up!

	He shoves her, knocking her off her bike.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I don't wanna be your boyfriend, you ugly
		dog!

	Monica leaps up, her dress now dirty.  She shoves him back.

<b>	INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

	A snarling Black cougar glares down from a large mural.  On

	the court below, a girl's basketball play-off game.

	The bleachers are almost half-full with a hyped crowd.  In
	the crowd are Monica's parents.  Her father is excited and
	vocal.  Her mom reads a book.  Also in the stands, the HEAD
<b>	COACH OF THE TENNESSEE LADY VOLS, PAT SUMMIT.
</b>
	A fine-ass BROTHER leans in the doorway, sporting a letter
	jacket with an embroidered "Q" on the chest.  He gets as much
	attention as the game.  A couple of JUNIOR VARSITY
	CHEERLEADERS smile his way.

<b>				CHEERLEADERS
</b>		"U", "G", "L", "Y", you ain't got no
		alibi, you ugly, yeah, yeah, you ugly.
		"M", "A", "M", "A", how you think you got
		that way, your Mama, yeah, yeah, your
		Mama.

	On the floor, MONICA, dribbles down court.  Just EIGHTEEN,
	her athletic figure has a few curves, but her loose jersey
	does little to show it off.  Her hair is a mess and her knees
	are dark with bruises.  A small scar is visible on her cheek.

	She whips a no-look, around the back pass to a cutting
	TEAMMATE under the basket, who scores.  The crowd cheers.

	Monica defends the opposing point guard like a gnat.  She
	knocks the ball loose and grabs it up.  She goes for a lay-up
	and the opposing guard steps in front of her.  Monica crashes
	into her, knocking both to the floor.

<b>	A WHISTLE.
</b>
<b>				REFEREE
</b>		No basket!  Offensive foul, number thirty-
		two.

	Monica leaps up.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What?  She wasn't set!

	The referee ignores her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		She was still moving!

	From the sideline, COACH HISERMAN waves frantically.

<b>				COACH HISERMAN
</b>		Monica!  Let it go!

	Monica stares down the ref as she jogs back on defense.

	The opposing guard drives the lane and puts up a shot.
	Monica leaps and blocks it with a taunting scream.  A
<b>	WHISTLE.
</b>
<b>				REFEREE
</b>		Technical foul!  Number thirty-two.

	Coach Hiserman slams down his clipboard.  Monica charges the
	referee.  A teammate grabs at her but she pushes her off.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		For what?

<b>				REFEREE
</b>		Taunting.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Taunting?!

<b>				COACH HISERMAN
</b>		Sub!

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Man, you suck!

	The referee whips back around, whistle in mouth.  Coach
	Hiserman grabs her arm and pulls her off the court.

<b>				COACH HISERMAN
</b>		Sit down and shut up.

	Monica slams down in a chair, sweat pouring, hands clenched.
	Her mom watches from the stands, completely embarrassed.  The
	brother in the doorway turns, leaves.

	Monica looks up at the clock.  SIX MINUTES LEFT IN THE THIRD
<b>	QUARTER.

	Monica, still benched, sits slumped in her chair, her sweats
	on, her face dry.  She glances up at the clock.  TWENTY
	SECONDS LEFT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.  Her team's up by SIX.

	Her teammates dribble out the clock.  The BUZZER SOUNDS and
	they dance across the floor.  Monica looks up in the stands.

	Camille, now forty-three, stands at the stove stirring a pot
	of gumbo.  Lena, 21, and pretty, stands next to her, holding
	a handful of plates and silverware.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		...and if you want a thicker base, you
		can cut in a potato or just use a little
		flour.

<b>				LENA
</b>		But you use potato?

	Camille nods as they cross into:

<b>	INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	At the table, Monica is in mid-conversation with her dad.
	Camille and Lena start setting the table.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		And what am I supposed to say to the man?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		The coach from Tennessee was there and he
		has me riding the bench.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		You lost your head.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I was just showing emotion.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		So that means it's alright for you to act
		like that?

<b>				LENA
</b>			(to Monica)
		What'd you do?

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(dismissive)
		nothing.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		I don't know why I keep hoping you'll
		grow out of this tomboy thing.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I won't.  I'm a lesbian.

	Lena chokes on her drink, cracks up.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		That's not funny

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Well, that's what you think, isn't it?
		Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an
		apron...

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Watch your mouth.

	Nathan quickly jumps in, tries to clean things up.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's
		time to start thinking about other things
		besides basketball.

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(taken aback)
		What?

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		You only have one game left and you
		haven't been recruited.  Munchkin, I
		wanted it as bad as you did, but we have
		to face reality.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		The coach from USC is going to be at the
		championship.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		I know.  But chances are...

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Chances are there's still a chance.

	Nathan nods.  She can always soften her dad, but not her mom.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		If you'd just listen for once, you'd
		realize you have a lot more going for
		yourself.  You're smart, you'd be pretty
		if you put a comb to your head.  I mean,
		why walk around with your hair looking
		like "whodunit"...?

	As her mom nags on, Monica looks out the window.

	OUTSIDE, QUINCY and a GIRL lean against a car parked at the
	curb, slobbing each other down.

	Just shy of 18, with a magnetic face and muscular body, he is
	a brother who drank his chocolate milk.  HE IS ALSO THE
<b>	BROTHER WHO WAS WATCHING MONICA'S GAME FROM THE GYM DOORWAY.
</b>
	Monica watches and her mom's droning voice disappears...

	FELICIA, 17, can't get enough of Quincy's lips.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Yo, Felicia, I gotta get to my game.

	She keeps kissing him.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		And my mom's about to be home.

<b>				FELICIA
</b>		So I'm not good enough to meet your mom?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Girl, she knew I had a hottie like you
		up inhere, she'd beat the black off me.

<b>				FELICIA
</b>			(kissing him again)
		That's a lot of beating.

	She finally lets go, and slides into her car.  Quincy watches
	her go with a cocky-ass smile.

<b>	  INT. CRENSHAW HIGH SCHOOL GYM - NIGHT

	A frenzied crowd from floor to ceiling watches Quincy explode

	across the court.  He is the complete point guard - hitting
	from the outside, driving to the hoop, no-look passes,
	playing tight D.'

	His father, Zeke, now 39, stands on the sideline.  His muscle
	has softened a little over the last five years of retirement.

	Monica sits alone in the bottom row, holding a basketball.
	She wears jeans and a T-shirt and her hair is pulled back in
	a simple pony-tail.

	Quincy does a killer cross-over move and his Defender falls
	down.  He lays up the ball, then taunts the player he just
	poster-ized.  Behind Monica, TWO GIRLS smack each other
	excitedly.  One of them, SHAWNEE, 17, pretty, big chest,
	slides down into the empty seat next to her.

<b>				SHAWNEE
</b>		Hey, girl.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Hey.

<b>				SHAWNEE
</b>		Your hair looks so cute like that.

	Monica knows she's full of shit, doesn't respond.

				SHAWNEE (cont'd)
		So...you know who Q's asking to the
		Spring Dance?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		No.

<b>				SHAWNEE
</b>		C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's
		been creeping?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		There's so many I just can't keep track.

<b>				SHAWNEE
</b>		Well, can you give him this for me?

	Shawnee holds out a folded note.  Monica doesn't take it.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Give it yourself.

<b>				SHAWNEE
</b>		I don't wanna look fast.
			(drops it in Monica's lap)
		Thanks, girl.

	She slides back to her seat.  Monica shakes her head, turns
	back to the game.

	Quincy dives for a loose ball.  Shawnee clutches her friend.

				SHAWNEE (cont'd)
		Good Lord, look at that ass.  I just want
		to lick the sweat off it.

	Monica takes in his tight body.  He does look good.  Quincy
	jogs back down court and flashbulbs go off...

</b>		Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's

</b>		You could make a career by telling me

</b>		But you'd love for him to play at USC,

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		I'd love for him to get a good education.

		That's it.

	Jim crosses away.  Zeke puts an affectionate arm around his
	son as they walk toward the locker room.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		We should have another talk with Coach
		Carril at Princeton.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is
		going all the way.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		I don't care about the team.  I care
		about the school.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Didn't we already have this conversation?

	Zeke sighs, then:

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		You played good.  I was proud of you.

	Quincy smiles wide.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Yeah?
			(then)
		So you up for a game later?

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You don't wanna hurt your back.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>			(smiles)
		Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting.
		Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You work too hard, Pop.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Let's hope I can say the same about you
		one day.

	Quincy watches his dad move toward the doors, stopping once
	to give an autograph.  Zeke passes Monica, entering.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Hey, Mr. M.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Hey, Miss Baller.

	He exits.  Monica approaches Quincy.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Way to hoop.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I know this.  What do you want?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		A ride home.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Your legs don't look broke.

		Please.

	Silence as Quincy wheels his Jeep Wrangler toward home.
	Monica sits in the passenger seat, basketball in lap.  She
	pulls Shawnee's note from her pocket.  Quincy glances it
	over.


<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What's that?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give
		to you.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(thinks)
		Big-ass titties?

	Monica shoots him a disgusted look.  Quincy reaches out.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Give it here.

	Monica leans away, reads aloud.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		"Q.  I think you are so fine and I've
		been wanting to get with you.  Let me
		take you to the Spring Dance and I
		promise I'll leave you satisfied."

	Monica laughs in disbelief.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		What a ho.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she
		wants to get with me.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		She's a ho cause she's sending her
		coochie through the mail.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		And?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a
		nice guy and I wanna get to know you
		better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So she's honest.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I
		guess you'll stick your dick in anything.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Didn't know you cared so much.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I don't.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So who you going to the dance with,
		Spalding?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Who's Spalding?

	Quincy looks down at the SPALDING BASKETBALL in her lap and
	cracks up.  Monica glares.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Fuck you, Quincy.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		See, that's why you ain't getting
		recruited.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Who said I'm not getting recruited?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Your hot-ass temper.

	Monica points to the scar on her cheek.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm not the one who put this scar here.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		God, here we go.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		When we were eleven years old cause he
		was about to lose.

	Quincy turns, faces her.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		That's it, give it your best shot.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Would you watch the damn road?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I mean it, give it your best shot, cause
		I'm tired of you holding that over my
		head.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm warning you, don't tempt me.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I'm warning you.  You don't stall that
		bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.

	Quincy pulls his Jeep into his driveway.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk
		smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But
		because I'm a female, I get told to calm
		down and act like a "lady".  I'm a

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		With a jacked-up attitude.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Didn't know you cared so much.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I don't.

</b>		Ow!!!  Okay!

	They crack up.

<b>				LENA
</b>		So what's going on with the Spring Dance?
		You have a date yet?

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(sarcastically)
		Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.

<b>				LENA
</b>		I found you someone.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Found?  I'm not some charity case.

</b>		I know...

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Mom tell you to do this?

<b>				LENA
</b>		No.

</b>		Damn, Lena...
			(then)
		Who is he?

<b>				LENA
</b>		This brother from my college.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		He's in college?

<b>				LENA
</b>		And he's fine, girl.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		How'd you get him to say yes?

<b>				LENA
</b>		I told him you looked like me.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Oh, great.

<b>				LENA
</b>		You do.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yeah, right.

<b>				LENA
</b>		If you were tore up I would not be
		claiming you.  Trust.

	Monica is not convinced.

				LENA (cont'd)
		We'll do something cute with your hair,
		get you a dress, get you some heels...

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I don't know how to walk in heels.

<b>				LENA
</b>		Hey.  You just worry about playing your
		behind off for that recruiter tonight.
		Let me worry about your date.

	Lena starts to braid Monica's hair again.  Beat, then...

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You ever been in love?

<b>				LENA
</b>		Too many times.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		They ever love you back?

<b>				LENA
</b>		Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?

	Quincy and Zeke sweat through a playfully intense game of one-

	Quincy almost breaks Zeke's ankles with a cross-over dribble,
	and leaves him in the dust.  He stops under the basket, waves
	for his Dad to come on before laying it up.

	Zeke smiles, tells Quincy to bring that shit on again.
	Quincy tries his cross-over again and this time Zeke picks
	him clean.

	Zeke taunts him as he easily backs in on him to the basket.

	Quincy sits in the back row with a couple of teammates.  As
	always, he's the focus of much attention.

	Monica and her teammates are crouched in a tight huddle,
	surrounding Coach Hiserman.

<b>				COACH HISERMAN
</b>		I don't have to tell you girls how big

</b>		Cougars!

	As Monica moves to center court, she glances up at the USC
	Coach, then at Quincy.

	Monica takes a deep breath as she lines up for the opening
	tip.  An opposing player suddenly bumps her out of position.
	Monica glares at her, but just moves over.

	The ball is tossed up...

	Fourth quarter.  One minute left.  Cougars down three.

	Monica dribbles down court, bouncing with confidence as her
	opponent plays her tight.

	Monica zips a no-look pass to a teammate, who lays it up.
	Quincy punches one of his friends - "Oh shit!"  She is having
	the game of her life.

	On the defensive end, Monica steals the ball.  She drives the
	length of the court, lays it up between two defenders.  The
	crowd is hyped.

	Twenty seconds left, up by one.  Monica hounds the opposing
	guard as she brings up the ball.
	Monica suddenly reaches in and knocks the ball loose.  As she
	goes for the ball, a WHISTLE.

</b>		No!

	Anger rushes through her as she starts for the ref.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		That's bullsh--!

<b>				COACH HISERMAN
</b>		Monica!

	Monica catches herself, turns the word "shit" into a
	frustrated yell as she quickly moves away from the ref.

	Monica lines up for the free-throw, clenching her fists.  The
	girl hits the first one.  Then, she hits the second.

	With ten seconds left, down by one, Monica drives down court
	and throws up a prayer.  EVERYONE IS ON THEIR FEET AS THE
	BALL SPINS AROUND THE RIM.  AND THEN...IT POPS OUT.  An
	opposing player grabs the rebound and Monica has no choice
	but to foul her.

	Monica has just fouled out.  She walks to her bench and drops
	down.  She buries her face in a towel and sobs.

	An R&amp;B song jams through the speakers, filling the dance
	floor with high school kids in suits and dresses.

	In the middle of the floor, Quincy gets his groove on with
	his date, Shawnee.  She dances so provocatively, there is no
	mistaking what she has in mind for later.

	Over at the doors, Monica enters with her college date,
	JASON, 21, and fine.  Heads turn in surprise.  Monica feels
	the stares, shifts nervously.

<b>				JASON
</b>		Can I take your coat?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You're cold?

	Monica starts to pull it off.

<b>				JASON
</b>		No, I mean I can check it for you.

		Oh, sorry.

	Jason pulls off her coat, revealing a dress that shows off
	everything Monica has been hiding.  He checks out her frame,
	smiles.

</b>		Your sister wasn't lying.

	He crosses to the coat check, leaving her alone.

	Quincy, who glances over from the middle of the dance floor,
	and abruptly stops.  He stares at Monica in shock.

	Quincy starts off the floor as a new song kicks in.

</b>		Q, I like this song...

	Monica, sees Quincy approaching in his suit.  She quickly
	steadies herself on her heels, brushes a curl from her face.

</b>		See you made it.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You don't look half-bad.

	Shawnee suddenly steps up, slides her arms around Quincy.

</b>		Dang, girl, I didn't know Nike made

	Monica looks at Shawnee, wrapped around Quincy.  She can't

	Monica sits at a table with Jason.  His arm lays casually
	across the back of her chair.  Monica sits upright, stiff.

<b>				JASON
</b>		So, you like school?

	Monica smiles nervously, nods.

				JASON (cont'd)
		Yeah, high school was cool.  I don't
		remember sisters being as fine as you,

	Monica just holds that nervous smile.

				JASON (cont'd)
		So what do you like studying?

	Monica's face lights up.  Jason smiles.

				JASON (cont'd)
		There we go.

	He crosses away to the refreshment table.  Monica smiles
	wider, leans back in her chair with her legs splayed.  She
	catches herself and quickly crosses them.

	A couple of guys pass by and check her out.  Monica smiles
	wider.  Quincy steps up, holding two cups of punch.

	Couples move to the dance floor.

		You know, it was late and she asked...

<b>				JASON
</b>		You want to dance?

	Jason stands behind her chair.  Monica smiles shyly.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Sure.

	Jason puts down her cup of punch, takes her hand, leads her
	to the dance floor.

	Quincy just shakes his head, then crosses to his table, grabs
	Shawnee's hand.

</b>		C'mon.

	He pulls Shawnee to the middle of the floor.

	Monica, nervous at first, a little awkward, but Jason gently
	guides her in a slow circle and she starts to relax.

	Jason moves his hands down Monica's back, pulling her in
	closer.  Shawnee snuggles into Quincy's chest, runs her hands
	down his neck.  The heat from bodies grows.

	Monica and Quincy glance up at the same time and catch each
	other's eyes.  They start to look away but find they can't.
	Eyes locked as they dance, they move together, almost feel
	each other.  Finally, as their bodies turn, they lose sight.

	Monica puts her head to Jason's chest, Quincy slides his

		Freshman year, my free throw percentage

		Um...but then sophomore year I was
		shooting seventy-five percent from the

	Jason kisses her neck.

		...uh, by keeping my feet set and really

	Jason goes in for the slam dunk.  Kisses Monica on the lips.
	It's the first time she's really been kissed.  Jason pulls
	away, smiles.

</b>		That was nice.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Uh-huh.

</b>		Your sister told me hands off, but I

	Jason leans in.  Monica closes her eyes, and they kiss some
	more.  Monica tries to follow his practiced lips.

	Jason's tongue slides in and their bodies slide down.  His
	hand moves across her breast.  Monica's eyes pop open.

	Monica catches her reflection in the window.  She glares at
	her made-up face, then wipes at her mouth with her hand.

	She steps back , walks to her bedroom window.  She pulls it
	open, kicks off her heels and climbs through.

	Monica moves to her bed and drops down.  She sits motionless

	Light suddenly cuts through the darkness.  Monica turns and
	is surprised to see Quincy standing in the middle of his

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		None of your business.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left
		you satisfied.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		That what you think?

	Monica shrugs.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Little after you left, I told Shawnee it
		was time to go and I drove her ass
		straight home.  And after she told me I
		was the dumbest brother in the world, I
		took off.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Why?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Cause I don't just stick my dick in
		anything.

	Monica takes this in.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I was sitting in Jason's ride with him
		kissing on me and feeling on me and it
		was really bugging me cause I couldn't
		remember how many offensive boards I had
		in the championship.  And then I guess
		she got tired of me sort of accidentally
		kneeing him in the balls.

	Beat, then Quincy cracks up.  Monica laughs with him.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Four.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You had four offensive rebounds.

	Monica stares at him, surprised.  She thinks.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Hold up for a second.

	Monica disappears back inside.  Beat, then she re-appears.
	She climbs out her window, drops down.  Quincy looks at her.

	She holds out the envelope from USC.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		When'd you get this?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		It was on my bed when I came in.
			(then)
		Can you just...?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(beat)
		You sure?

	Monica nods.  Quincy takes the envelope, sits down on the
	grass.  Monica sits down beside him.  He tears open the
	envelope and pulls out the letter.

	Monica stares at him as he reads, trying to see an answer in
	his face.  Quincy finally looks up.  Expressionless.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Damn girl...

	Monica's face falls.  And then, a slow smile spreads across
	Quincy's face.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		They want you.

	Monica grabs the letter, reads.  Her head just drops as a
	tidal wave of relief washes over her.

	Quincy smiles.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Congratulations.

	Monica looks up, cheesing.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		I'm gonna be there, too.  I'm announcing
		tomorrow.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I knew it.

	Monica can't contain her excitement.  Without thinking, she
	gives Quincy a kiss.  They pull away, then break into nervous
	laughter.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What was that about?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I know, right?

	But they both want more.  They lean in, kiss deeply.  They
	fall back on the grass.  And kiss.  And kiss.

	Suddenly, Monica pulls away, sits up.  Quincy follows,
	instantly apologetic.  Monica stares at him, then to his
	surprise, she reaches over, gives his shirt a small tug with
	her finger.

	Quincy stares at her, then slowly pulls off his tie.  He
	nervously unbuttons his shirt.  He fumbles with the last two
	buttons.

	Monica slowly pulls down the straps of her dress, self-
	conscious.  Quincy can't keep his eyes off her.

	He pulls off his pants.  Monica glances down and her eyes
	widen.  She looks scared to death.  Quincy smiles softly,
	leans in and gently kisses her.  She relaxes.  They lay down.

	Quincy reaches into his pants for a condom.  His hands shake
	as he puts it on.  They stare at each other as he moves on
	top of her.

	Quincy pushes inside her.  She flinches back in pain.  Quincy
	immediately stops as tears spring to her eyes.

<b>				QUINCY

		You want to stop?

	Monica shakes her head.  Quincy pushes inside again.  He
	looks down at her with tenderness, moves gently, kisses her

	sit in front of them, jiggling nervously.

	COACH MILLER stands in front of the team.

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		I don't know some of you very well yet,
		and you don't know me because I'm still
		being nice to you.

	Laughter from the upperclassmen.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		But my philosophy is simple. Hard work
		and sacrifice.
		There's a lot of basketball history and
		pride here at USC, but just putting on
		the cardinal and gold doesn't make you a
		great player.  Hard work and sacrifice
		makes you a great player.  What you were
		doesn't matter anymore.  For the first
		time in your life, you won't be the best.
		You'll be going up against women that are
		bigger and stronger and better than you
		ever imagined.  So the question is, how
		will you respond?  Well, your answer
		better be hard work and sacrifice because
		that's the only way you're gonna make it
		through.  Vince Lombardi preached it and
		I teach it, "There is only one way to
		succeed at anything and that is to give
		everything."

	Coach Miller pauses a moment to let her words sink in.
	Monica glances at her fellow freshman for their reactions.
	Like her, a lot of cockiness, a lot of fear.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		A few simple rules.  Eleven o'clock
		curfew, no exceptions.  Always be on
		time, no exceptions.  Attend every class,
		no exceptions.  No drugs, no alcohol, no
		getting pregnant.  And finally, respect
		yourselves, respect your coaches and
		respect your teammates, right Sidra?

	SIDRA, senior point guard, nods from the second row.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		That's right, Coach.

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		By the end of this year some of you will
		hate me...

	The upperclassmen crack up.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Some of you will want to go home...

<b>				UPPERCLASSMEN
</b>			(cat-calling)
		Cree!

	CREE, junior forward, ducks her head sheepishly.  Coach
	Miller smiles.

		basketball players and better people.

	Monica nods, accepting the challenge.

	Monica sucks it up, runs faster.  She reaches the middle of

</b>		Thanks, Sidra.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Besides.  I've been starting point the

	Sidra walks off, leaving Monica with the bar on her chest.
	Finally, she has to drop the weight to the floor.

<b>	EXT. USC CAMPUS - LATE MORNING

	Monica and Quincy walk to class, his arm draped casually
	across her shoulders.  Quincy gets looks and smiles.  Monica
	just looks exhausted.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You finish the reading for E-con?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What'd it say?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Basically broke down how I'm gonna make
		mad loot in the NBA, me being such a
		limited commodity and all.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Whatever, big head.

	Quincy laughs.  TWO GIRLS pass by, smile.

<b>				GIRL #1
</b>		Hey, Q-man, you gonna take us to the
		Final Four?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		We'll see.

<b>				GIRL #2
</b>		We'll be watching.

	The girls continue on.  Monica looks at Quincy.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You do see me standing here, right?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I can't be nice to a fan?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Fine, Quincy.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I can't help girls coming up to me.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I said fine.

	Quincy looks at her sulking.  He suddenly pulls her down onto
	the nearby lawn, and cradles her.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		It's okay, little baby.

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(struggling)
		Quit.

	Quincy grips her tighter, rocks her.  Students pass by,
	laugh.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Shhh.  Daddy's here.

	Monica finally cracks up.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You're such a punk.

	He gives her a kiss.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		All these girls...you're the only one I

	Monica smiles, kisses him back.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Always.

<b>	 INT. CAMPUS GYM - MORNING
</b>


	A heated scrimmage between the women's "A" team (the starting
	five) and "B" team (five who want to be starting).  Monica
	runs point for the "B" team, playing opposite Sidra.


	Sidra is all over Monica, slipping in cheap shots, but Monica
	starts to come on.  She does a quick cross-over and loses
	Sidra.  She dishes off to Shayla, who scores.

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		Sidra!  You feel like playing any "D"?

	Sidra scowls as she runs down court.  She gets a pass in the
	corner, tires to make a move but Monica slaps the ball loose.

	Monica grabs it, drives to the three-point line, puts up the
	shot.  SWISH!  Monica stays posed, with her arm up.

	Sidra takes advantage, sprints back down court.  She get the
	long pass, lays it up.  Coach Miller blows her whistle.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Monica!  Get over here.

	Monica jogs over, sheepish.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		While you're so busy posing, your man
		just scored!

	Monica drops her head.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		Show me again.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What?

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		You love to pose so much, let's see it
		again.

	Beat, then Monica holds up her arm like she just shot the
	ball.  Snickers from her teammates.

				COACH MILLER (cont'd)
		I want you to stand like that for the
		rest of practice.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Coach...

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		I want you to stand like that until
		you're sick of it because I don't ever
		want to see it again, you hear me?
			(then)
		Dora, take her spot.

	DORA, freshman, jogs onto the court.  Coach Miller blows her
	whistle and the scrimmage resumes.

	Monica stands alone on the sideline, posing, and feeling like
	an asshole.

<b>	INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING

	Monica sits on the bench in front of her locker, dressing
	after the shower.  Shayla sits next to her.

	Nearby, Lisa and Sandra apply make-up in the mirror.  Zvette
	passes by, already dressed.  Lisa turns.

<b>				LISA
</b>		Z, I know you're gonna shower first.

<b>				ZVETTE
</b>		I don't smell bad.

<b>				SANDRA
</b>		And you wonder why your ass sits alone on
		the bus.

	Cree glances over from another sink, as she snaps the chain
	on her CROSS NECKLACE.

<b>				CREE
</b>		You guys curse too much.

<b>				SANDRA
</b>		Since when is "ass" a curse?

	MAEYEN walks past.

<b>				MAEYEN
</b>		Whoa, it's as big as yours.

	They crack up.  Cree just shakes her head.  Two TEAMMATES
	pass by Monica with their arms raised, mimicking her pose.
	Monica shakes her head.

	Sidra glances at Monica from her spot on the bench.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		That's what you get for trying to show
		out, freshman.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I was just playing ball.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		You were trying to make me look bad.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Didn't have to try very hard.

	Ears prick up around the locker room.  Sidra stands.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Girl, don't you know you're just sloppy
		seconds?

	Monica rises.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What?

	Toni tries to step in.

<b>				TONI
</b>		Sidra, let it go.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Only reason you're here is cause Tonya
		Randall got pregnant and decided not to
		come.  They were done recruiting.

	KELLI, senior forward, shakes her head.

<b>				KELLI
</b>		That's cold, Sid.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Just thought the girl should know.

	Monica is stunned.  Sidra saunters to the showers.  Shayla
	nudges her with her shoulder.

<b>				SHAYLA
</b>		Don't even trip.  She's just mad cause
		she's bow-legged.

<b>	  INT. USC SUITES - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Monica and Quincy lay feet to face on Quincy's twin bed.

	Monica's hand holds an ice bag on Quincy's hip.  Quincy's arm
	rests across an ice bag on Monica's ankle.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Forget Tonya Randall.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was
		here instead of me.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Then prove her wrong.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I don't have it easy like you, alright.
		There's no red carpet laid out for me.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So you're gonna act salty all night?

	Quincy's roommate/teammate REGGIE, 18, suddenly pops his head
	into the room.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		Yo, dog, we're about to order some wings.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Nah, thanks.

	Reggie shrugs, closes the door.  Quincy looks at Monica,
	still brooding.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Fine.  Don't worry about proving
		everybody wrong, okay?  You can't handle
		the pressure, I'll understand.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		That was so weak.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Who cares if you're never known as the
		first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more
		play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.

	Monica shoves Quincy's ice bag down his sweat pants.  He
	leaps up.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Aaaah!  Damn, girl!

<b>				MONICA
</b>		That's what you get.

	He smiles as he pulls the ice.  Then looks her up and down.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So how about a little one-on-one?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What are we playing for?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Clothes.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What?

	Quincy locks the door, sets up his indoor hoop.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I score, you strip.  You score, I drop
		something.

	Monica looks at him, then cracks up.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Give me the ball.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		My court, I go first.

	Quincy grips the ball.  Monica crouches low on defense.
	Quincy drives past her and slams down a vicious dunk.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Strip.

	Monica makes a face, then pulls off her sweatshirt.  Quincy
	skips back.  Monica drops low again.  Quincy fakes her out
	and slams down another vicious dunk.  He laughs.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Where's the "D"?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Kiss my booty.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Plan to.

	Monica glares through her smile, then pulls off her T-shirt,
	leaving her in a bra and shorts.

	Quincy goes for another dunk, but this time, Monica reaches
	out, GRABS HIS DICK.  Quincy drops the ball.  Monica picks it
	up and lays it in.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hold up...

<b>				MONICA
</b>		All's fair in love and basketball.
		Strip.

	Quincy pulls off his shirt.  Monica moves back into position.
	Quincy drops down low.  Monica fakes, gets him to leave his
	feet.  She slips under him and scores.  She laughs.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Too bad you got your mama's height, huh.

	Quincy pulls off his sweats, leaving him in just drawers.
	Monica takes in the view as she moves back into position.

	She holds the ball out, taunting.  Quincy pretends to reach
	for it, but grabs her breast instead.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Oh, my bad.

	She drives.  Quincy just steps out of the way and lets her
	score.  Monica snatches the ball off the floor.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yo, where's the "D"?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Right here.

	Monica turns, finds Quincy butt-naked.  He moves her against
	the wall and kisses her.  Monica drops the ball, wraps her
	arms around him.  She smiles.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I won.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I wanted you to.

</b>		What are you having, Zeke?

	Terry laughs as he moves off to fix the drinks.  Something is
	on Zeke's mind, but before he can speak on it...

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You know, the numbers I'm putting up are
		better than any freshman.  Some people
		are saying I'm a definite lottery pick.

	Zeke suddenly focuses.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		What people?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You know, people.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Well, tell them to mind their damn

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I'm also good enough to go pro.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		You know how much higher the play level

</b>		I just told you.

</b>		I mean, it's not true, is it?

	Zeke stares at his son.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		You got the balls to ask me that?

	hurt.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Sorry.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say

	Quincy looks in his father's eyes, knows he's telling the

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So what are you gonna do?

</b>		I want this thing to go to court, but my

</b>		We haven't exactly been living the fairy-

		I'm giving her some space, couple

	Just then, a COLLEGE STUDENT approaches.

<b>				COLLEGE STUDENT
</b>		Yo, Q-man, great game.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Thanks.

	The student holds out a piece of paper, without even a glance
	to Zeke.

</b>		You scared me.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Sorry.  You okay?

</b>		I'm fine.

	Quincy glances at her half-hidden glass.

<b>				NONA
</b>		Guess I should have been telling your

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So you're gonna take the word of some
		trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.

	Nona grabs an envelope beside her and throws it at him.

	Confused, Quincy opens it.  HE PULLS OUT A COUPLE OF PHOTOS:

	Zeke outside a party.  IN ONE PHOTO, his arm is around a
	young woman.  IN ANOTHER PHOTO, they KISS.  AND YET ANOTHER,
	they climb into his car.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		What...what's this?

<b>				NONA
</b>		I hired somebody.  How pathetic is that?
		After all his late nights and "meetings"
		and I still needed proof.

	Quincy just stares at the photos.

				NONA (cont'd)
		I used to think I was lucky just to be

</b>		What?

<b>				LISA
</b>		I think ol' girl took out your chi-chis
		with that charge.

	The women break into laughter.  Monica smiles.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Kiss my ass.

<b>				SANDRA
</b>		Nah, I think she took that too.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Sandra, please, last time you chest-
		bumped me, it took you three tries.

	More laughter.  Monica looks over at Toni, sitting quietly at
	the bench.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Yo, T, why you so quiet?

<b>				TONI
</b>			(beat)
		I don't want to go play overseas.

<b>				DORA
</b>		I thought you were hyped about going to
		Portugal next year.

<b>				TONI
</b>		It's never gonna be like this.  Playing
		in front of my family, hanging out with
		my girls.  Probably not even a
		McDonald's.

<b>				SANDRA
</b>		Nah, there's always a McDonald's.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Least you got an offer.  My agent's
		still looking.

<b>				CREE
</b>			(to Lisa)
		What about you?

<b>				LISA
</b>			(beat)
		Maybe it'd be worth it if I knew some day
		I could come back here and play.  But for
		right now, it's law school.

<b>				COACH MILLER (O.S.)
</b>		Monica.

	Monica turns, sees Coach Miller standing in her office
	doorway.  She motions for her.  Monica heads over.  Sidra
	watches.

<b>	INT. COACH MILLER'S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER
</b>
	Trophies, plaques and photos fill every empty space.

	Coach Miller sits behind her desk.  Monica stands before her.

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		You could've given up after you threw
		that ball away.  But you kept your head
		and you showed real heart.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Thanks.

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		We've got our final games against Oregon
		and Oregon State and I want to shake
		things up a bit, so I'm starting you at
		point again.

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(confused)
		I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next
		game.

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		You want the job or not?

	Realization finally hits.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yeah.  Yes.

	Monica looks at Coach Miller completely thrown.

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		What?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		It's just...it seems like you're always
		yelling at me.

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		You think I'd go hoarse for a player with
		no potential?   When I ignore you, that's
		when you worry.
			(then)
		Go get dressed.

	Monica nods, crosses out.

<b>	INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	As Monica walks back to her teammates, Coach Miller steps
	into the doorway.

<b>				COACH MILLER
</b>		Sidra.

	Sidra looks at Monica as she rises, crosses over.  Monica
	avoids her eyes as they pass.  Sidra enters the office and
	the door closes.

<b>				SHAYLA
</b>		Yo sis, what's going on?

	Beat, then Monica smiles.

	Black folks pack the cramped houseparty, bumping to a phat

	hip hop joint.



	Monica bounces through the throng.  A GIRL grabs her arm.

<b>				GIRL'S VOICE
</b>		Yo, great game.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Thanks.

	Another PARTY-GOER grabs her arm.

<b>				PARTY-GOER
</b>		Girl, you can play.

	Monica smiles wider.  She spots Reggie dancing in the crowd,
	moves to him.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Reg.  You seen Quincy?

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		What's up, girl.

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(louder)
		Derek said Q was here.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		We'll roll through.

	Monica is suddenly pulled into a dance routine by Sandra and
	Lisa.

	She laughs, tires to move away, but they won't let her go.
	Monica gives in, grooves with them.

<b>	ANGLE ON:
</b>
	Quincy walks through the door with a half-empty forty in his
	hand.  Girls immediately try to grab his attention from the
	dance floor, or stare him down from the sidelines.

	Quincy sees Monica on the dance floor.  He stands, watching
	her.  Takes a drink.  Monica finally looks over, sees him.
	She smiles, crosses to him.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Hey.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What's up?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I've been trying to find you all day.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Here I am.

	She glances at the forty in his hand.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Sorry about your game.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		It happens, right...

	Shayla suddenly grabs Monica from behind.

<b>				SHAYLA
</b>			(to Monica)
		What's up, superstar.
			(then, to Quincy)
		Your girl was on tonight.  She tell you?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(beat)
		I heard.

<b>				SHAYLA
</b>		She also tell you she ganked the starting
		spot from Sidra?

	Monica looks at him for a reaction.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Nah.

	He downs the last of his forty.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Where's the keg at?

<b>				SHAYLA
</b>		Balcony.

	He heads for the glass doors.  Monica and Shayla follow.

<b>	EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Reggie approaches the group.  Gives Quincy a nod.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		What's up, dog?
			(to Shayla)
		Hey, flyness.

<b>				SHAYLA
</b>		Get off the bra strap, Reggie, you're a
		ho.

	He laughs, then turns back to Quincy.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		Coach is gonna kill us in practice
		tomorrow.  Might even pull his lips off
		your dick, limp as your game was tonight.

	Quincy just looks at him.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		That's funny.

	Monica leans against Quincy, affectionately.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		he's just playing, Q...

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You think for once we could talk about
		something besides basketball?

<b>				SHAYLA
</b>		Sure.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		Whatever's clever.

	Silence.  Reggie and Shayla crack up.  Quincy shakes his
	head, moves to the keg line.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Y'all need to quit.

	She starts for Quincy

<b>				SIDRA (O.S.)
</b>		Monica.

	Monica looks over, sees Sidra standing in the doorway.  There
	is no escaping this confrontation.  She glances at Quincy,
	then crosses over.  Quincy turns, sees her disappear back
	inside.

<b>	INT. HOUSEPARTY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
<b>				MONICA
</b>		What's up?

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Just wanted to say good game.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		But?

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take
		that charge.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Thanks.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni.
		Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.

	Monica shakes her head.  An awkward silence.

				SIDRA (cont'd)
		I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I know.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Just one word of advice for next season.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What's that?

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Never let a freshman take your spot.

	Sidra turns and walks away.

<b>	EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Quincy takes one long drink from his cup.  KERRY, 20, and
	spandexed, stands directly in front of him, flirtatiously.

<b>				KERRY
</b>		Excuse me.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Excuse me.

	He steps aside as she tries to work the keg.  Nothing comes
	out.  She nods at his cup, smiles.

<b>				KERRY
</b>		If that's the last beer, you and I are
		sharing.

	Shayla glances over as Quincy pumps the keg a couple of
	times.  Kerry hands him her cup and he starts filling it up.

				KERRY (cont'd)
		I like watching you play.  Number twenty-
		two.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Guess you didn't see the game.

	Quincy knows he should blow her off, but he's digging the
	attention.  He hands her back her cup.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		What's your name?

<b>				KERRY
</b>		Kerry.

<b>				QUINCY
</b><b>		Q.
</b>
<b>				KERRY
</b>		I know.

<b>	ANGLE ON
</b>
	Monica looks over at Quincy and sees him talking to the
	hoochie.  The girl looks too damn comfortable.  Monica moves
	back outside.

				KERRY (cont'd)
		I'll see you.  Q-man.

	She swishes past Monica.  Shayla "accidentally" bumps her.
	Kerry glares.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Who was that?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Nobody.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Who's nobody?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Look, this party's whack.  You ready to
		go?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You want to go talk?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Not really.

	He leans in, kisses her drunkenly.  She pulls away.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		We could finish what we were talking
		about last night.

	Quincy kisses her again.

				MONICA (cont'd)
<b>		Q...
</b>			(pushing him off)
		Quincy, quit.  You're drunk.

	They fall silent.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You know what, I'm just gonna crash.

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(agitated)
		Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Nah.  I have curfew.

	He starts to walk away, then stops.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Oh, by the way.  Congratulations.

	He goes.  Monica stares after him.

</b><b>	  INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

	Quincy pushes through his front door, then stops short in his
	doorway.  Zeke sits on the couch.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What are you doing here?

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Your door was unlocked.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Still is, so let yourself out.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		We need to talk.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		We ain't got nothing to talk about.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I
		ain't that kid's father.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Lucky kid.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Look, I ain't saying it was right, but
		sometimes things happen.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		And some things should never fucking
		happen!

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Boy, you're so perfect you can look down
		on me?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I ain't a damn liar.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Your mom was real quick to show you those
		pictures, wasn't she?
		Well, she was nineteen when she got
		pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're
		the best thing in my life, but she knew I
		wasn't ready for no marriage.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So now you're saying my mother trapped
		you?

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		I'm saying I handled my responsibilities
		like a man.  But when you're in the NBA,
		you pull into a city and there's a
		hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And
		another twenty that made it past security
		on your floor.  And the boldest one is
		standing right at your door.  And after
		awhile, it just becomes part of the game.
			(then)
		I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't
		have.  But I did it cause I love you.

	Zeke looks at his son, meaning every word.  Quincy stares
	back, long and hard.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Since we're being honest, guess I should
		tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and
		going pro.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		What?

	Quincy just stares back.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		Quincy, you'd be making the biggest
		mistake of your life.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(sarcastic)
		From your mouth.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>			(desperate)
		I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't
		let you do this.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's
		vocabulary.

	Zeke is taken aback by the hatred in his son's eyes.  He
	turns and without another word, exits.

<b>	EXT. STREET - LATE NIGHT
</b>
	Quincy stands across the street from the houseparty, staring
	up at the balcony.  Monica leans against the railing,
	laughing with a couple of teammates.  Quincy watches her,

	SLOW MOTION.  Monica's eyes are on fire as she races an

	Oregon player for a loose ball.  Both dive for it, slide

	across the floor.  Monica grabs it up, screams for a time-out
	as her opponent tries to wrestle away the ball...

<b>	EXT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S SUITE - DUSK

	Monica walks down the hall to Quincy's suite.  The window is
	open.  The sounds of Nintendo are heard.  She walks in
	without knocking.

</b>
	Reggie sits on the couch with a TEAMMATE, playing Nintendo's
	"Duck Hunt".

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Hey, y'all.

	They barely give her a nod.  Monica crosses into

<b>	INT. QUINCY/REGGIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Quincy stands at an ironing board, ironing a T-shirt.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Hey.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Hey, what's up.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You weren't at my game.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this

	Quincy pulls on the T-shirt.

		You win?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.

</b>		The "man" again.

	A knock at the front door.  Quincy exits.

	Monica follows, then stops short.  Kerry, the spandexed girl
	from the party, stands in the doorway.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Hey, you.

<b>				KERRY
</b>		Hi.

	Quincy gives her a hug.  Monica stares at him in disbelief.
	Reggie and his teammate smack each other, "Oh shit!"

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Oh, Kerry, this is Monica.  Monica,
		Kerry.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What the hell's going on?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		We're going to get some food.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Are you out of your mind?

<b>				KERRY
</b>		Maybe I should come back?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		No.  You stay, I'll leave.

	She storms out.

<b>	EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DUSK
</b>
	BAM!  Monica slams her car door.  Her face is a mask of anger
	and confusion.

	Camille exits the house, car keys in hand.  She sees her.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Monica.  What are you doing here?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Didn't know I needed a reason to come
		home.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised
		to see you.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Dad around?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		He's still at the bank.

	Monica glowers.  Camille looks at her.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Everything okay?

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(clearly not)
		Yeah.

	Camille just nods, doesn't bother asking again.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Well, I'm going to get dinner.

	She pulls open her car door.  Beat, then...

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		It's just a game.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Whenever you lose, you get this attitude.
		But it's just a game.

	Monica rolls her eyes, as her mom leaves.

<b>	EXT. DORMS - NIGHT
</b>
	Quincy sits on the wall outside of Monica's dorm, as Monica
	slowly makes her way up the walk.  She sees him, stops.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Can we talk?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Talk to your new girlfriend.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I just took the ho to Burger King,
		alright.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Cheap date.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Least she had time for me.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		So you fucked around to prove a point!

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I just said I didn't fuck around.  But
		you got your head so far up your ass it
		took a cheap date for you to notice me.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your
		ass like everybody else?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You forgot to be there.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		That night you wanted to talk about your
		Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed
		to do?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Stay!

<b>				MONICA
</b>		If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Least you got your priorities straight.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I never asked you to choose.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Never had to.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what
		that means it should be you.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Well, if all you care about is
		basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck
		Dick Vitale.

	Monica punches the shit out of Quincy, then pushes past him.
	Quincy grabs her arm, stopping her.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hold up.  I'm sorry, alright.

	They stand, silent.  Trying to come down from their anger.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		How do I know next time you're feeling
		neglected or whatever, you're not going
		to run around on me?  If we're going to
		be together I have to be able to trust
		you.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I'm not asking for us to be together.

	Monica flinches in shock.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I'm going through a lot of shit right
		now, more than you have time for.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		How are you going to tell me what I have
		time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we
		can fix this.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I don't think so.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You don't think so?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Look, I'm entering the draft.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You're what?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I decided to go pro.  And who knows where
		I'll end up, you know?

	Monica's heart is sinking fast.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		When did you decide all this?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Few days ago.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		So that's it, just forget about us?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us
		anymore, it's about me.

	Monica is crushed.  Beat as, Quincy struggles to stay cold.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		But, you know, I'd still like us to be
		friends.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Friends.

	She fights back tears.  Quincy has to look away.  Monica
	can't respond.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So...I guess I'll see you around.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Uh huh.

	Beat, then Quincy turns and walks away.  Monica tries to
	fight her tears but her pain, hurt and confusion are too
	much.  Finally, she gives in, and the tears fall.

<b>	ESTABLISHING SHOTS OF SPAIN
</b>


	Madrid, Pampolona, the running of the bulls, old-world
	architecture.

	Finally, we rest on a large billboard, a photo of Monica in a
	basketball uniform, drinking a Spanish soft-drink.

<b>	EXT. STREETS OF SPAIN - LATE DAY
</b>
	Monica jogs down the congested cobble-stone street, a sports
	bag over her shoulder.  She is TWENTY-THREE.  Half-assed
	braids frame her matured features.

	She passes store fronts, street vendors, and dodges
	pedestrians, as she makes her way toward a large, older
	arena.

<b>	EXT. ARENA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	An excited crowd jockeys for position at the front doors.
	Above them, a huge banner reads "Campeonato de Europeo".
	(European Championships".)

	As Monica heads for the back entrance, a cheer goes up from a
	large contingent in the crowd.  Monica smiles, waves back.
	TWO LITTLE GIRLS break from line, run to her.

<b>				LITTLE GIRLS
</b>		Baloncesto!  Balencesto!  (Basketball!
		Basketball!)

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Oye.

	They giggle, hold out a piece of paper and a pencil.

<b>				LITTLE GIRLS
</b>		Autografo.

	As Monica signs her autograph, a tall woman carrying a
	matching sports bag approaches.  She is LUISA, Spanish, 33.

<b>				LUISA
</b>			(thick Spanish accent)
		Monica.  What is up?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Oye, Luisa.

	Monica hands the girls her autograph and they run off.

<b>				LUISA
</b>		Large game, no?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Si.  Large game.

	They duck into the arena.

<b>	INT. ARENA - LOCKER ROOM - LATE DAY
</b>
	Paint peels off the walls.  Windows are broken overhead.

	Monica sits alone at her locker, taping her own ankles.  Her
	TEN TEAMMATES, all from Spain, sit on the surrounding
	benches, talking and joking among themselves in Spanish.
	Monica is clearly an outsider.

	COACH PARRA, Spanish, late 40's, enters.

<b>				COACH PARRA
</b>		Silenco!

	The women immediately stop talking.  COACH PARRA gives an
	animated, impassioned speech in Spanish.  Monica doesn't
	understand a word, just continues taping her ankles.

	Coach Parra finishes and the women clap, pumped up. Monica
	turns to Luisa, seated next to her on the bench.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What did he say?

<b>				LUISA
</b>		He say to give the ball to you.

<b>	INT. ARENA - NIGHT
</b>
	The arena is PACKED with a raucous European crowd, chanting
	and waving signs - the love their women's basketball.

	Monica walks onto the floor, tucking her jersey into her
	shorts.  The uniforms are old-style - polyester and tight.
	Her club's name is stitched on the front, "GODELLA".

	As she hits center court, a smile suddenly breaks through her
	game face.  Standing opposite her, playing for the opposing
	Italian club is Sidra, HER RIVAL FROM USC.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Well, what do you know.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What's up, Sidra.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		I'm gonna love winning this championship
		in your house.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		How do you say "you're dreaming" in
		Italian?

	They move into position.  The ball is tossed up.  Italy winds
	the tip and the ball is passed to Sidra.

	Monica hounds her as she brings up the ball.  Sidra shoves
	her off and to the floor, and scores.  No whistle.  Women's
	pro ball is at a whole other level.  Bigger, better, tougher.

	The ball is passed in to Monica.  She drives down court, goes
	up for a lay up.  An Italian player shoves Monica in mid-air,
	taking out her legs.  Monica crashes on the hardwood.

	A whistle.  Monica lays still for a moment, then pushes
	herself up and walks to the free-throw line without a word.
	Without emotion.

<b>	INT. SPAIN - NIGHTCLUB - LATE NIGHT
</b>
	A huge crowd dances fervently to the live Spanish music.  In
	the middle of the floor, the Spanish players are the life of
	the party.

	In a corner, Monica sits with Sidra, drinking and watching
	the festivities.  A large trophy sits on the table.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Can you take that damn thing off the
		table.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.

	Monica sets it down in the seat next to her, puts an arm
	around it.  Sidra shakes her head.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Still a cocky bitch.

	Monica laughs.  She downs her drink, motions to the waiter.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Uno mas, por favor.

	The waiter nods.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Last I heard, you were playing in Sweden.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Yeah, four years ago.  They had me
		staying in this tiny-ass town with like
		fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was
		about a thousand goats running around,
		and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then
		the whack club I'm on loses three games
		in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire
		me.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Just like that?

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Yup.  So I've been playing with this
		Italian club the last three years.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		How's that been?

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		It's better.  Even though the whole first
		season my teammates didn't pass to me
		cause they were mad "The American" was
		making more money.
			(smiles)
		I led the team in rebounds cause it was
		the only way I could touch the damn ball.

	Monica laughs as the waiter brings her drink.  She tries to
	pay, but he just shakes his head, crosses away.

				SIDRA (cont'd)
		Most of us don't win championships our
		first year overseas.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Please, I went through the same drama as
		everybody else.  I mean, the first four
		months, only person I could talk to was
		this chick Luisa, who knew like ten words
		of English from watching old "Dif'rent
		Strokes" reruns.  Swear to God, I had to
		tell her if she said, "What you talking
		bout, Willis?" one more time, I was
		gonna kick her ass.

	Sidra laughs.  They watch the madness out on the dance floor.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		So what are these Spanish guys like?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I wouldn't know.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		What?  You've been over here seven months
		and you ain't tapped anything?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Just not my type, I guess.

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Shoot, Italian boys love them some black
		women.  They can't get enough of me.

	Monica smiles.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You ever think about going back?

<b>				SIDRA
</b>		Sometimes.  But what's the alternative,
		not playing?  You remember big Toni?
			(off Monica's nod)

	Monica takes this in.  Her eyes do not reflect someone on top
	of the world.  She takes a long drink.

	A small, sparse, one-bedroom.  Sam, Diane and the rest of the
	gang from "Cheers" fill the small TV screen that flickers in
	the darkness.  Their dialogue is dubbed in Spanish.

	Monica sits on the floor, braiding her hair.

	Feelings of loneliness threaten to swallow her whole.  She

	The crowd erupts as a Laker player dunks the ball on a fast

	break.



<b>	ANGLE ON
</b>


	Laker announcers CHICK HEARN and STU LANTZ.



<b>				CHICK HEARN
</b>
		Stu, this game is in the refrigerator.
		The door is closed, the lights are out,
		the butter's hard and the Jell-Oooooo's
		jigglin'.

<b>				STU LANTZ
</b>		And here come the subs.

<b>	ANGLE ON
</b>
	Quincy pulls off his sweats and jogs onto the court with the
	rest of the subs.  He is twenty-three, a man.  His goatee and
	tired eyes make him look older.  HE NOW WEARS NUMBER TWENTY-
<b>	ONE.
</b>
				STU LANTZ (cont'd) (V.O.)
		It's good to see these guys get a little
		playing time.  And the fans love it.

	Quincy immediately gets a pass in the corner.  He puts up a
	quick three and it banks hard off the rim.

<b>	ANGLE ON
</b>
	Chick and Stu.

<b>				CHICK HEARN
</b>		Three-pointer is off for the kid from
		SC.  Came out after his freshman year,
		now in his fifth year with the league.

<b>				STU LANTZ
</b>		The son of Zeke McCall, played twelve
		years with the Clippers.

<b>				CHICK HEARN
</b>			(nods)
		Pretty good player.  The kid's moved
		around quite a bit, but he's hoping to
		finally have a home with the Lakers.

<b>	ANGLE ON
</b>
	Quincy steals the ball, has nothing but open court ahead of
	him.

				CHICK HEARN (cont'd) (V.O.)
		Watch out, folks, it's showtime.

	Quincy takes off from the hash-mark and throws down a monster
	jam.  He swings high off the rim.  Too high.  His hand slips
	and he crashes to the floor.  His knee twists at a sickening
	angle.

	The dwindling crowd gasps as Quincy clutches his left knee,
	writhing in pain.

<b>	INT. DANIEL FREEMAN HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT
</b>
	Zeke walks down the corridor, checking room numbers.  He is
	forty-five now.  His slight paunch as become a roll.

	He sees Nona exiting a room, with an empty water pitcher in
	hand.  Her hair is in locks.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Nona.

	Nona looks over.  Her eyes narrow.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		How's he doing?

<b>				NONA
</b>		Not great.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		What's that, not great?

<b>				NONA
</b>		The doctor'll be back in a minute.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Nona, please.

<b>				NONA
</b>		He tore his ACL.

	Zeke's shoulders slump.  Then he looks back at her.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Almost didn't recognize you with your
		hair like that.  How you been?

<b>				NONA
</b>		Happy.  And he won't want to see you.

	Nona walks over to a MAN standing nearby.  He puts an arm
	around her and they move down the hall.  Zeke watches for a
	beat, then pulls open Quincy's door, steps inside.

	Quincy lays in the bed.  His knee is bandaged and propped up
	by pillows.  He stares out the window.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Hey, son.

	Quincy turns, sees his father.  He turns back to the window.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		Well, you made SportsCenter.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What do you want?

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Came by to check on you.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		After five years.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Don't remember that being my fault.
		Seems like you divorced me same time as
		your mom.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Look, I'm busy.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		I can see that.  I know things look
		pretty bleak right now, but you can't get
		down on yourself.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I stopped taking your advice a long time
		ago, or did you forget?

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		No.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Good.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Quincy.  I know you left school early to
		throw your middle finger up at me.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		And now I'm paying for it, right?  That
		what this is about?  "I told you so?"

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		You want me to fuck off?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say
		something.

	Silence.  Then.

				ZEKE (cont'd)
		You're a better ballplayer than I ever
		was.  But you got a lot of other things
		going for you.  You're smart.  I always
		felt...I always knew that you could do
		anything you wanted.  You want to be a
		ballplayer, be a ballplayer.  Just know
		you ain't like everybody else on that
		court.  You ain't like I was.  You got
		options.  That's all I ever tried to show
		you.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You're still trying to tell me what I
		should and shouldn't do.  How come you
		couldn't be the man you kept trying to
		make me?

	Zeke stares at his son, wishing he could satisfy him with an
	answer.

<b>				ZEKE
</b>		I just couldn't

	With nothing left to say, Zeke pulls open the door and
	leaves.  Quincy stares at the door long after it closes.

	A NURSE enters, carrying a bouquet of flowers.  She moves

	past the empty bed, puts them on a table already overflowing

	with flowers.  She pulls open the blinds and light floods the
	room.  She crosses back out.

	A toilet flush.  Beat, then Quincy slowly hops out of the
	bathroom, scratching his bare ass through the opening of his
	gown.

<b>				VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		And I thought this was gonna be awkward.

	Quincy whips around and is shocked to see Monica standing
	there, laughing.  She has clearly made an effort with her
	appearance.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Monica?

	He stumbles.  Monica quickly goes to him, catches his arm
	before he falls.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm sorry.

	Quincy stares at her, completely thrown.  It's been five
	years.  An awkward beat.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		So, how you doing?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Alright.  I heard you were in Spain.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I was.
			(smiling)
		I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.

	Quincy rubs his goatee self-consciously.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Just something I'm trying.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Thanks.

	Quincy tries to adjust his footing and flinches in pain.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Shouldn't you be lying down, or...

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I'm alright.  But you can sit.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Yup.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What are the doctors saying?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(shrugs)
		A lot of things.  All I know is I'll be
		back in six months.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Not for Quincy McCall.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I forgot, "Q-man."

	An awkward beat.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So, how's pro-ball, Europe?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		We won the championship.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Still working on being the first girl in
		the NBA?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Well, I tried sneaking in after college,
		but they found breasts during my
		physical.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Funny.  I never did.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Kiss my ass.

	Monica cracks up.  Quincy laughs with her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		I can't believe it's been five years.

	Quincy nods.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Tried calling you a couple times.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Oh yeah?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Wanted to give you props on making First
		Team All-American.  And then when Magic
		retired, I tried calling you again.

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(lying)
		Must have been my cheap-ass answering
		machine.  It was always messing up.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Figured it was something like that.

	They look at each other.  The moment is building.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		So, when do you go back?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Actually, I don't...

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking
		about giving it a rest for awhile.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(completely thrown)
		A rest?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun
		anymore.  You know?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		No.

	He stares at her.  Into her.

<b>				FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Quincy!

	Quincy and Monica turn, as KYRA KESSLER, black, 26 and
	beautiful, rushes into the room.  She wears a flight
	attendant's uniform.  She goes to Quincy, gives him a kiss.
	Monica reacts.

<b>				KYRA
</b>		I'm so sorry.  No one would switch
		flights with me.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		It's okay.

<b>				KYRA
</b>		Why are you up?  Get in bed.

	She takes Quincy's arm, moves him to the bed.  Monica
	watches.

				KYRA (cont'd)
		Tell me you're going to be okay.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I'm gonna be okay.

	Kyra relaxes.  Then she glances over at Monica.

<b>				KYRA
</b>		Hello.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Kyra, this is Monica.  She, uh...

<b>				KYRA
</b>			(recognizing)
		Monica.  You grew up together, right?
		Quincy's told me about you.

	Monica smiles awkwardly.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		This is Kyra.  My fiance.

	The shock hits too quick to cover.  But Monica tries.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Fiance.  Wow.  Congratulations.

<b>				KYRA
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I didn't know.  Wow.  That's great.
			(then)
		Well...I should go.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		It means a lot that you came by.

<b>				KYRA
</b>		Yes, we appreciate that.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your

	Camille moves between the counter and the stove, whipping up

	a couple pecan pies.  Monica enters.



<b>				MONICA
</b>
		Hey.



<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Hi.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Need any help?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		I can manage.

	Monica nods and moves to the barstool.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		Your sister's bringing the baby over.
		You should try to be here.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yeah.  Can't wait to see him
			(she falls silent, then)
		I just saw Quincy.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		How is he?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Engaged.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		To that stewardess?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Yeah, you met her?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago.
		He could do a lot better if you ask me.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Maybe she is.

	Camille looks up, studies Monica for a moment.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		I thought you were over him.

	Monica shrugs.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		So what do I do?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Find out where they're registered and
		send them a gift.

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(disgusted)
		Whatever.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		You didn't want my opinion in the first
		place, so why even ask?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I asked but why does it always have to be
		so damn prissy.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Don't curse.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		There you go.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		What do you want me to tell you, Monica,
		to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex
		with him?  I'm not going to do that.
		Yes, I believe thinking of other people
		is important and yes I'd rather bake a
		pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that
		makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.

	Monica stares at her mother.  There's no going back.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		So that's why we can't get along?
		Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump
		shot?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		You're the one always turning your nose
		up at me.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		No I don't.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Child, please.  Ever since you were
		little you thought you were too good for
		anything I had to say.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail
		polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray
		of your perfume.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		What was so wrong with wanting to teach
		you the things I knew could help you?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Because you're pushing me to be something
		I'm not.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		So you're angry with me because you're
		standing here with your hair combed and
		wearing perfume?

	Monica is busted.  It takes her a moment to come back.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm angry because I want a mother, not
		Martha Stewart.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete
		whose mother is nothing but a housewife.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		That's not it.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that
		because I know.

	Monica stares at her mother.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I remember when I was eight years old,
		you spent like four hours cooking up this
		fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do
		was set the table.  And I guess you and
		Dad got your wires crossed or something
		because he walks in with a couple of
		pizzas.  And you didn't say anything.
		You just threw the whole meal into some
		tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		I don't remember that.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I do.  You never stood up for yourself.
		Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because
		of that.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		That's ridiculous.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What's ridiculous is not being a caterer
		so your husband can feel like a man
		knowing his woman's home cooking and
		ironing his drawers.

	WHAP!  Camille's humiliation is immediate and she cuts off
	Monica with a SLAP.  Camille curses herself for losing it.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Dammitt, Monica!

	Monica is stunned, hurt.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'm sorry.

	Camille stares at her daughter, devastated.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		Is that really all you think of me?

	Monica can't answer.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		When I married your father, all I wanted
		was a nice house with a big kitchen so I
		could start my catering business.  And
		then I got pregnant with Lena, and then I
		got pregnant with you.  And I put it out
		of my mind because that's what you did.

	Monica stares at her mother.

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		But you want to know what day I remember?
		In high school, you getting ready for the
		Spring Dance.  I put my pearls around
		your neck, told you you were beautiful
		and you looked like you were going to
		cry.  That day I was happy I didn't have
		a catering business to run off to.  My
		family had three meals a day, had someone
		to pick up after them, and when my
		daughters went to a dance, I helped them
		get ready.  That's what I came to care
		about.

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(softly)
		That's all you cared about.  I must have
		played in a thousand games and I can only
		remember you being to two.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		You had your coaches and your father for
		that stuff.  It never mattered one way or
		the other if I went to your games.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		It mattered, Mom.

	Camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in
	her eyes.  Monica moves off the barstool and leaves.

	The room looks exactly the same.  Trophies, medals, plaques.
	Basketball posters and her "strong women" wall.

	Monica sits on her bed, staring up at a photo of her and
	Quincy, tacked up to her bulletin board, amid other photos of
	her childhood.  THEY ARE EIGHTEEN, PLAYFULLY WRESTLING OVER A
<b>	BASKETBALL.

	Monica slowly rises, starts taking her posters down.

<b>	INT. REHAB CENTER - DAY

	Quincy sits on a leg extension machine, with his left leg

	Sweat and pain coat Quincy's face and scarred knee as he
	slowly lifts the light weight again, and again, and again.

<b>	INT. BANK - DAY
</b>
	A long line of customers shift impatiently during the noon-

	Monica sits with a BANK MANAGER at the "New Accounts" desk,
	learning the ropes.  Her hair is done, she wears a simple

<b>	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Monica stands in her room, staring out at Quincy's window.
	She watches as Quincy and Kyra pack up some of Quincy's

	laughs, "Hell no."

<b>	INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Camille enters, moves to Monica's garbage can, dumps the
	contents into her larger bag.  Suddenly, she stops.  She
	reaches into the garbage and pulls out a crumpled picture.

	Camille smooths it.  It is the photo of Monica and Quincy at
	eighteen, wrestling over a basketball.

<b>	CAMILLE STARES AT IT, TAKEN IN BY THE PURE JOY IN HER
</b>	DAUGHTER'S FACE.  She sits down on Monica's bed, still

<b>	INT. FORUM - DAY

	In the empty gym, Quincy jogs up and down the court.  He is

	And then, slowly, the determination melts from his face.  His
	jog turns into a walk, and then he just...stops.

<b>	INT. MCCALL HOUSE - QUINCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Quincy stands in the middle of his room, taking in his life.
	Old, worn basketball posters still line the walls.  Trophies

</b>		Baby, don't talk like that.  Your rehab's

</b>		Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.
		Busting my ass, for what?

<b>				KYRA
</b>		To do what you love.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I don't know sometimes.

<b>				KYRA
</b>		You're just scared.  I know rehab is
		hard, and you have to worry about whether
		you'll be as good as you were but you

</b>		Hey, munchkin.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Dad.  What are you doing here?

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		I was upstairs for a meeting.  I've been

</b>		So how's the job going?

	Monica forces a smile.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You know.

	Nathan looks at her, nods.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		I think I know what the problem is.

	He pulls a GARBAGE CAN HOOP from a plastic shopping bag.

				NATHAN (cont'd)
		There.

	He shoots an ugly, imaginary shot.  She laughs.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You shoot like a girl.

<b>				NATHAN
</b>		I'll take that as a compliment.

	He gives her a smile, and exits.  Monica looks at the hoop,
	then crumples a piece of paper.

<b>				MONICA
</b>			(whispering)
		And she gets the steal.  Monica goes one-
		on-one against Jordan, she stops, pops...

	Monica shoots.  The paper drops through the net.

				MONICA (cont'd)

	quickly composes herself and goes back to her work.

	Monica smiles.

</b>		Can I ask you something?

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		You never told me why ball isn't fun

<b>				MONICA
</b>		It just isn't.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You had a rough couple years, that's all.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		That a nice way of saying I rode the

<b>				MONICA
</b>		And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four
		and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You're serious.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Seems like I needed a ball when I was

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Like what?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Maybe go back to school.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Wow.

</b>		I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school

			(then)
		She'll probably say it's the painkillers

		never crosses your mind that it's not
		gonna turn out that way.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So why'd you give up ball?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Why do you keep asking me that?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Cause I don't get it.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Something was just missing.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What?

	Monica is too hurt, too scared to tell him the truth.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave
		it alone.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Find.

	Monica turns, crosses to her house.  She stumbles on her
	heels, kicks them off in frustration, and exits inside.
	Quincy walks back to his curb.

<b>	ANGLE ON
</b>
	Camille watches from the kitchen window

<b>								   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. WRIGHT HOUSE - PATIO - DUSK
</b>
	Lena sits next to Camille.  Her one year old son, L.P., sits
	on the ground at her feet.  Monica sits quietly nearby,
	watching.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		So you're still breast-feeding?

<b>				LENA
</b>		The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm
		still trying to lose some of this baby
		fat.

	She quickly looks over at Monica.

				LENA (cont'd)
		Shut up.

	Monica gives her a small smile.  Camille looks down at L.P.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		You might want to put a jacket on him,
		it's getting cold.

<b>				LENA
</b>		He's fine.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>			(warning)
		Okay.

	Lena sighs, rolls her eyes.  She picks up her son.

<b>				LENA
</b>		Come on, L.P.  Grandma says it's too
		cold.

	She exits inside.  Camille makes a face.

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		God.  "Grandma."

	Monica smiles.  And then silence.  There is still so much
	distance between them, so many misunderstanding.  Camille
	stares at her daughter.  And then...

				CAMILLE (cont'd)
		You know, I'd probably be a lot more
		"prissy" in the situation than you'd
		like, but the thing I always admired that
		drove me crazy, was the fight you had in
		you.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What are you talking about?

<b>				CAMILLE
</b>		When I said Quincy could do better, I was
		thinking about you.

	Monica stares at her mom.  Camille stands and leaves.

</b><b>	  INT. WRIGHT HOUSE - MONICA'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>


	Monica lies in her bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to

	sleep.  Her mind races with thoughts of her past, her

	choices, her future...



	Suddenly, she climbs out of bed.  She wears a tank-top and
	pajama bottoms.  She crosses to her window, pulls it open and
	climbs out.

<b>	EXT. WRIGHT AND MCCALL HOUSES - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Monica drops down.  She moves to Quincy's window and knocks
	quietly.  Beat, then Quincy appears.  Bare-chested and in a
	pair of shorts.  He looks at her, then pulls open the window.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(half-asleep)
		What's going on?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		We need to talk.

	Quincy just looks at her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Please.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Hold on.

	Quincy disappears for a moment, then returns, pulling on a T-
	shirt.  He climbs out of his window, drops to the ground.

	Quincy looks at her.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You asked me what was missing.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		From basketball.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		you woke me up to tell me that?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		It's not fun for me anymore because
		you're missing.

	Quincy stares at her.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		What I'm trying to say is --

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		I heard enough.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you
		since I was eleven and the shit won't go
		away.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		We haven't talked since college and now
		you wait two weeks before my wedding to
		say something like this?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I know, I probably should have said it
		two weeks ago.

	Quincy doesn't even crack a smile.  In fact, he glares.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You haven't changed.  You still think the
		sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well,
		guess what, it doesn't.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Then why are you so upset?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Because you don't pull this on someone
		who's about to get married.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Better late than never, right?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Wrong.

	Quincy starts back toward the window.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I'll play you.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		One game.  One-on-one.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		For what?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Your heart.

	Quincy looks at her in disbelief, then laughs at the
	absurdity.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		You're out of your mind.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		So you're gonna bitch up?

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What's that supposed to be, psychology?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		I know why you broke up with me in
		college.  And not that what you did
		wasn't messed up, but what I did was,
		too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive
		you.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I
		couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I
		was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that
		was five years ago.  I moved on.

	Monica moves past him, reaches through his window.  She drops
	back down, holding his basketball.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Prove it.

	She throws him the ball.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		What will this prove?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		You once said the reason I beat you was
		because you wanted me to.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		So?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		So, if I win it's because deep down you
		know you're about to make the biggest
		mistake of your life, and deep down your
		want me to stop you.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		And what happens when you lose?

<b>				MONICA
</b>		If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding
		present.

	Quincy stares at her.
<b>	
</b><b>	  EXT. MCCALL HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - SHORT TIME LATER
</b>


	Monica stands opposite Quincy.  Both are suited up in

	basketball gear.



	They stare at each other, ready to go to war. Monica tosses
	him the ball.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Check.

	Quincy tosses the ball back.  Monica drives.  Quincy's knee
	is maybe at sixty percent and he can't keep up.  She scores
	easily.

	She walks to the top of the driveway, tosses him the ball.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		One, zip.  Check.

	Quincy rubs his scarred knee, then passes it back.

	The game continues.  Monica owns the first five points easily
	by exploiting Quincy's injury.

	Monica drives for another lay-up.  Quincy suddenly lets go of
	his fear, leaps and swats her shot.

	He grabs the rebound and lays it up.  He nods intensely, as
	he grabs the ball and walks back to the top of the key.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		One, five.  Check.

	The game continues and now Quincy has the upper-hand, using
	his size and strength.  He scores seven straight points.

	The score stays close.  It is a sexually-charged battle of
	wills -- Quincy pulls off his sweat-soaked shirt.  Their
	bodies collide as they wrestle for the ball.  Monica yanks
	off her jersey in frustration.  Her ass bumps into his hips
	as she backs him in.  Her hands slide across his chest as she
	guards him...

	Finally, the score hits nine, nine.  Monica slowly walks to
	the top of the key.

<b>				MONICA
</b>		Nine, up.  Point.

	She tosses Quincy the ball.

				MONICA (cont'd)
		Check.

	Quincy tosses the ball back, drops low on defense.  Monica
	fakes an outside shot and Quincy bites.  Monica drives around
	him.  SHE HAS A WIDE-OPEN LAY-UP.  SHE PUTS IT UP..AND IT
	ROLLS OFF THE RIM.  Monica can't believe it.

	Quincy grabs the loose ball and clears it.  He stares at
	Monica as he dribbles in front of her.  She stares back.

	He breaks for the basket.  Monica stays with him.  He goes
	up.  Monica jumps, desperately tries to block his shot.
	Quincy dunks on her, knocking her to the ground.  He lets go
	of the rim, and tumbles to the ground also.  GAME OVER.

	Silence.  Quincy stares at her.  Monica looks back.  Then:

<b>				QUINCY
</b>			(pointed)
		All's fair in love and basketball, right?

	Monica struggles to fight back her tears as she picks herself up.
	She slowly walks back toward her house.  And then:

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Hey.

	Monica slowly stops, turns.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Double or nothing.

	Monica stares at him, wonders if she heard right.  Quincy
	limps to his feet, picks up the ball and holds it out to her.

	Monica slowly walks back to him.  They stare at each other.
	No more egos, no more bullshit.  Just love.

	In the moonlight, on the blacktop, they kiss...

<b>								FADE TO BLACK.
</b><b>								
</b><b>	  FADE IN:
</b>


<b>	INT. LOS ANGELES FORUM - NIGHT
</b>


	Music is blasting, banners are waving, crowd is screaming.



	Magic Johnson sits in a floor seat, watching the game.  A

	REPORTER interviews him.

<b>				SPORTS REPORTER
</b>		So, Magic, are you contemplating another
		comeback?

<b>				MAGIC
</b>			(laughs)
		No more comebacks.  Tonight I'm just
		enjoying being a spectator.

	Behind him, in a second row seat, a ONE YEAR BLACK GIRL sits
	in a lap, bouncing, watching feet and legs ballin' on the
	court.

	Quincy leans down, gives the little girl a kiss, then looks
	out at the court.  It's the Los Angeles Sparks and the New
	York Liberty.  The WNBA.

	On the court, the women line up for a free-throw.

<b>				QUINCY
</b>		Let's go, McCall!

	Monica, sporting a uniform with Wright-McCall on the back and
	the number thirty-two, looks over.  Quincy takes their
	daughter's hand and waves it.

				QUINCY (cont'd)
		Go Mommy.

	Monica smiles back, then steps to the line.  The referee
	tosses her the ball.  Monica stares at the basket, then
	bounces the ball twice, licks her lips and shoots.

<b>								 FADE TO BLACK.
