Two hundred years after Ellen Ripley died trying to eliminate the Alien species, they brought her back from blood samples taken earlier.
It took several tries, and un-fortunate failures to get it right, but they weren't interested in Ellen Ripley- they wanted the alien inside her; and they got it, but they got more than they bargained for.
When the aliens grew smart, they broke out of their enclosures.
When the crew tried to run, they killed them.
And when the Queen's secret was revealed, it exposed a bizare DNA mix-up that left both Ripley and the queen's genetics intertwined; giving light to a new alien that could spell certain doom for Earth.
