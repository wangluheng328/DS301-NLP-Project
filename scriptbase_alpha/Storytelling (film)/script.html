</b>	TITLE CARD: Fiction
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MARCUS'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	The time is circa 1985.
<b>	
</b>	Vi and Marcus finish making love. Marcus has cerebral palsy.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		Hey, you want to hear my short 	
		story now?
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Huh?
<b>			
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>			(lifts a MS from a shelf by his bed)
		I can read it to you.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		You mean, again?
<b>			
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		Well, I changed the ending a 	
		little.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Oh. What happens now?
<b>			
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		Well, actually, it's the same, but 
		longer. I think it's better. 
		More...raw.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Well then, maybe you should just 	
		read the ending.
<b>			
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		But it won't make any sense if you 
		hear it out of context.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		I think you should leave it the 	
		way it was. It was good.
<b>			
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		So you don't want to hear my new 	
		ending?
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		You'll read it in class tomorrow. 	
		Surprise me.
			(beat)
		Anyway, I have to go. I promised 	
		Melinda I'd help her with her 
		oral.
<b>			
</b>	She rises, starts dressing.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		You're tired of me. I can tell.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
<b>			
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		You've lost interest...You hardly 	
		even sweat any more when we 
		have sex.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		I was never much of a sweater. You 
		know that.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		Look, Vi, I don't blame you. You 	
		feel You feel pity now. The 
		pleasure isn't there any more. The 
		kinkiness has gone...You've 
		become kind. 
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. CAMPUS GREEN - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	It is bright and sunny.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MR SCOTT'S CLASSROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Mr Scott, who is black, presides over his class. Marcus is 
	reading from his story, Vi at his side. Catherine, a stunning 
	intellectual, sits near the teacher. The rest of the students 
	(Amy, Elli, etc.) listen closely and take notes.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		"...but when he saw her...it was 	
		as if he could walk like a 
		normal person. His legs didn't 	
		swing, his arms didn't spaz 
		away...He wasn't a freak any more, 
		for she made him forget his 
		affliction. No more cerebral 	
		palsy! From now on  "CP" stood 
		for...cerebral person. He was a 	
		cerebral person.
<b>			
</b>	Pause. Marcus and Vi exchange looks.
<b>	
</b><b>				AMY
</b>		I thought it was really good, 	
		Marcus...Really moving and 
		emotional.
<b>				
</b><b>				ELLI
</b>		Yeah, I thought it was really 	
		emotional, too.
<b>	
</b><b>				AMY
</b>		And I mean, really good word 	
		choices. It kind of reminded me a 
		little of Faulkner, but East Coast 
		and disabled.
<b>	
</b><b>				LUCY
</b>		Or Flannery O'Connor. She had 	
		multiple sclerosis.
<b>	
</b><b>				JOYCE
</b>		And Borges. He was blind.
<b>				
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				ETHAN
</b>		Updike has psoriasis.
<b>	
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				CATHERINE
</b>		Um...Maybe I'm wrong, but, um, I'm 
		afraid I found the whole thing to 	
		be a little trite. Its earnestness 
		is, well...it's a little 	
		embarrassing. And those 
		adjectives, they're a little 	
		flatfooted. And redundant. I'm 	
		sorry, but...Anyway, what do I 	
		know? Don't even listen to what I 	
		say. I mean...
<b>			
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Anyone else?
<b>			
</b>	No response.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Catherine is right. The story's a 	
		piece of shit. You express nothing 
		but banalities and, formally 	
		speaking, are unable to construct 	
		a single compelling sentence. You 	
		ride on a wave of clichés so worn, 
		in fact, it actually approaches a 	
		level of grotesquerie. Ad your 	
		subtitle, 'the rawness of truth' 	
		is that supposed to be a joke of 	
		some sort? Or are you just being 	
		pretentious?
			(beat; then checking his class book) 
		OK. Who's next?
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. CAMPUS COURTYARD - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Marcus, upset, rushes outside, Vi in pursuit, desperately trying to 
	console.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Marcus, wait up!
<b>			
</b>	Marcus stops.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		What do you want?
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Don't be so upset. It's OK...
<b>			
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		What the fuck are you talking 	
		about? What's OK?
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>			(beat)
		You know he hated my story also.
<b>			
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		Your story was terrible!
<b>			
</b>	He moves on, she keeps up with him.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Marcus...You'll write something 	
		better next time!
<b>			
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		Patronizing fuck! If you had just 	
		been honest with me in the first 	
		place I wouldn't have read it. I 	
		knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I 
		believed you!
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		That's not fair! I was honest! 	
		Just because I wasn't sucking up 	
		like 	that bitch Catherine.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		Well, I sure didn't hear you voice 
		your opinion in there when it 	
		mattered.
<b>					
</b><b>				VI
</b>		I admit it - I was scared! I was 	
		shocked, in fact , by what he 	
		said. And he's so...convincing. 	
		I'm sorry if I let you down, but 	
		really, I still say he's just 	
		one opinion. I don't even like his 
		books that much. They're all so 	
		aggressively confrontational. I 	
		don't care if he's won the 	
		Pulitzer Prize.
<b>	
</b>	Catherine and Mr Scott walk by together in the distance.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		You just want to fuck him. Like 	
		Catherine and every other white 	
		cunt on campus.
<b>			
</b>	He leaves her.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. VI AND MELINDA'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Melinda lies on her bed with some homework, watching Vi.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI (O.S)
</b>			(on phone)
		...But Marcus! You can't just 	
		unilaterally decide to end things. 
		This is a relationship we're 	
		talking about! A friendship! You 	
		don't just...Fuck you!
<b>	
</b>	She hangs up and enters her bedroom, in tears.
<b>	
</b>				VI(cont'd)
		Fuck him! Fuck him! Fuck him...
<b>			
</b><b>				MELINDA
</b>		Vi? Are you OK?
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Yes. I'm OK. I'm totally OK.
<b>			
</b>	Melinda rises, puts a hand on her shoulder.
<b>	
</b><b>				MELINDA
</b>		You did the right thing.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		I know that. Fucking cripple. Why 	
		do I waste my time with 	
		undergrads? They're all 	
		so...juvenile! Uch! I just thought 
		Marcus would be different. I 	
		mean he's got CP!
<b>	
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				MELINDA
</b>		What are you gonna do now?
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		I dunno...go to a bar...get 	
		laid...whatever...Don't worry 	
		about me. I'll be fine...
<b>	
</b>	She starts changing into a new outfit.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. BAR - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Students hang around outside. Vi goes inside. 
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BAR - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Vi walks up to the bar.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Can I have a beer? 
<b>			
</b>	After getting her beer, Vi turns around and suddenly notices Mr Scott, 
	who is sitting alone. She goes over to him.
<b>	
</b>				VI(cont'd)
		Hi.
<b>			
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Hello, Vi.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		What are you doing here?
<b>			
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		What are you doing here?
<b>			
</b><b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just 	
		didn't expect to run into you 	
		here, that's all.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Well, now you have.
<b>			
</b>	Vi laughs, sort of, ten blushes.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
<b>			
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Uh huh.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Can I join you?
<b>			
</b>	Mr Scott gestures for her to sit down with him.
<b>	
</b>				VI(cont'd)
		Gee, thanks. Well, um...I just 	
		wanted to say that I'm really 	
		happy with the class and, 	
		um...I know you must here this all 
		the time, but I'm also a 	
		great admirer of your work. A 	
		Sunday Lynching, 	
		especially...really, um spoke to 	
		me. God, I hope I'm not 	
		embarrassing you...
<b>							
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		You're not.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Good.
			(beat)
		'Cause I...um...I really agreed 	
		with everything you had to say 	
		last week about how bad my story 	
		was...
<b>			
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		That's good.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		And I also agreed with what you 	
		said today about Marcus's story. 	
		It is a piece of shit.
<b>			
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		You have beautiful skin.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Thank you.
			(beat)
		So Catherine seems like she might 	
		become a really good writer.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Maybe. She's OK.
<b>			
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Aren't you going out with 	
		Catherine?
			(beat)
		I'm sorry. It's none of my 	
		business. I didn't mean...
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		I'm not 'going out' with 	
		Catherine.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Oh.
			(beat)
		Do you think I have a potential as 
		a writer?
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		No.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Thank you for being honest.
<b>			
</b>	Mr Scott leans over and touches her hand.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		I have so much respect for you.
<b>			
</b><b>	EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Mr Scott and Vi walk together in silence.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MR SCOTT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Vi and Mr Scott enter. He turns around and looks at her. Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Can I just freshen up for a 	
		second?
<b>	
</b>	He indicates the direction of the bathroom.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		It's over there.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Thanks.
<b>			
</b><b>	INT. MR SCOTT'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Vi enters, locks the door behind her. She looks at herself in the 
	mirror, then notices a snapshot of Catherine: she is naked, legs open 
	wide. Other erotic photographs lie beneath Catherine's.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>			(to herself, almost chanting)
		Don't be a racist. Don't be a 	
		racist. Don't be a racist...
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MR SCOTT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Vi emerges from the bathroom to find Mr Scott lounging on the bed.
<b>	
</b><b>				VI
</b>		It's a really nice place you have. 
		Is the rent high?
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Take off your top.
<b>			
</b>	She obliges.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Now...take off the rest.
<b>			
</b>	She does, and he looks hard at her. Finally he rises.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Turn around.
<b>			
</b>	She does.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Bend over.
<b>			
</b>	He starts making love to her, from behind.
<b>	
</b>				MR SCOTT(cont'd)
			(whispers)
		Say, 'nigger, fuck me.'
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
<b>			
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Say, Ni...
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Ni...
<b>			
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		...gger.
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		...gger.
<b>			
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Say, 'Nigger.'
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Nigger.
<b>			
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		'Fuck me hard!'
<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		Fuck me hard!

</b>		'...So John flipped her around and 
		slammed her against the wall. Jane 
		braced herself: she thought about 	
		her mother. She thought about 	
		Peter. She thought about God...and 
		rape. ''Say, 'Fuck me, nigger. 	
		Fuck me hard.''' John's flesh 	
		abraded her soft skin. There would 
		be marks. She acquiesced, and said 
		what he asked her to say, and did 	
		what he asked her to do. She had 	
		entered college with hope, with 	
		dignity, but she would graduate as 
		a whore.'
<b>	
</b>	Silence.
<b>	
</b><b>				AMY
</b>		Why do people have to be so 	
		ugly...write about such ugly 	
		characters? It's perverted. I know 
		you all think I'm being prisssy, 	
		but I don't care. I was brought up 
		in a certain way. And this 	
		is...mean-spirited!
<b>	
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				JOYCE
</b>		Yeah, well, it did seem a little 	
		affected. Like by using taboo 	
		language you were trying to shock 	
		us about the hollowness of your 	
		characters.
<b>	
</b><b>				ETHAN
</b>		I think it was a little bit 	
		racist.
<b>			
</b><b>				ELLI
</b>		It was completely racist, and 	
		beyond that I felt deeply offended 
		as a 	woman. As if a woman can 	
		only operate from experiences of 	
		objectification.
<b>	
</b><b>				SUE
</b>		Totally phallocentric.
<b>			
</b><b>				ELLI
</b>		And so weirdly misogynistic. I 	
		mean, why does Jane go through 	
		with this? Is she stupid?
<b>			
</b><b>				ETHAN
</b>		Hey, But wasn't this a rape? Or 	
		...did I miss something? Because I 
		- I'm confused. Because if this 	
		was a rape, then why would she be 	
		a whore?
<b>							
</b><b>				CATHERINE
</b>			(beat)
		It was confessional, yet 	
		dishonest. Jane pretends to be 	
		horrified by 	the sexuality that 	
		she in fact fetishizes. She 	
		subsumes herself to the myth of 	
		black male potency, but then 	
		doesn't follow through. She thinks 
		she 'respects Afro-Americans,' she 
		thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,' 	
		what a notch he 'd make in her 
		belt, but, of course, it all comes 
		down to mandingo cliché, and he 	
		calls her on it. In classic racist 
		tradition she demonizes, then runs 
		for cover. But then, how could she 
		behave otherwise? She's just a 	
		spoiled suburban white girl with a 
		Benneton rainbow complex. It's 	
		just my opinion, and what do I 	
		know...but I think it's a callow 	
		piece of writing.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		Callow and coy. Jane wants more, 	
		but isn't honest enough to admit 	
		it. In the end, she returns to the 
		safety of her crippled 	
		(translation: sexually impotent) 	
		boyfriend.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARCUS
</b>		This is bullshit! Her story was 	
		the truth!
<b>			
</b><b>				JOYCE
</b>		Right.
<b>			
</b><b>				SUE
</b>		It's unbelievable!
<b>

</b>		It's clichéd!
<b>

<b>			
</b><b>				VI
</b>		But it happened!
<b>			
</b>	Silence.
<b>	
</b><b>				MR SCOTT
</b>		I don't know about 'what 	
		happened,' Vi, because once you 	
		start writing, it  all becomes 	
		fiction. Still, it certainly is an 
		improvement over your last story: 	
		There is now at least a beginning,

</b>		When the sky is clear and the sun 	
		is warm, you're reminded of how 	
		beautiful things can be: a lamp 	
		post, a sign, a straw wrapper 	
		blowing in the wind…But when that 	
		dark cloud appears, you realize 	
		how fragile the balance of life 	
		is.
<b>	
</b>	(2) The neurologist Dr Barry Jordan discussing Brady's condition:
<b>	
</b><b>				DR JORDAN
</b>		When Brady first arrived at the 	
		hospital he was unresponsive to 	
		verbal stimuli. Wee performed a CT 
		scan which demonstrated a large 	
		subdural hemotoma with mass 	
		effect. Since the removal of the 	
		subdural he's been in coma.
<b>	
</b>	(3) A psychologist discussing the effect of the Brady crisis on his

<b>	
</b><b>				DR GOODMAN
</b>		When I first met the Livingstons 	
		it was in the first twenty four 	
		hours of Brady coming in after his 
		tragic football accident and they 	
		were acting in a fairly typical 	
		way…
<b>	
</b>	(4) The Livingstons consulting with Dr Goodman in a hospital waiting 
	room:
<b>	
</b><b>				MARTY
</b>		We're not the ones who need the 	
		help. My son needs help.
<b>	
</b><b>				DR GOODMAN 
</b>		And you-
<b>			
</b><b>				MARTY 
</b>		My son's in there! He can't even 	
		feed himself, he can't eat – I 	
		don't even know if he's going to 	
		be a vegetable or not, for 	
		Chrissake!
<b>	
</b>	The picture freezes and then zooms into a close up on Scooby.

<b>	
</b><b>				EDITOR
</b>		This is entertainment you're 	
		making, Toby. This story about a

<b>

		like exploitation.
<b>	
</b><b>				TOBY
</b>		No, no, no. No exploitation. This

		people think of this.
<b>	
</b><b>				EDITOR
</b>		I dunno, Toby. We really have a 	
		long way to go. You still need a

<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Consuelo. Are you crying?
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO
</b>		No.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Yes, you are. I can tell. What's

<b>	
</b><b>				CONSUELO 
</b>		Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Speak English.
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO 
</b>		Mi Jesus esta muerto!
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know 	
		if you don't speak English I can't 
		understand you.
<b>	
</b><b>				CONSUELO 
</b>		My Jesus…
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Who is Jesus?
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO 
</b>		My baby.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		You have a bay?
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO 
</b>		My grandchild-baby.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Gee, I didn't even know you had 	
		any children. But why are you so 	
		upset about Jesus?
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO 
</b>		He's dead.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Oh. How did it happen?
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO 
</b>		He was executed. He was on Death 	
		Row and then he was executed.
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		How did they execute him?
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO 
</b>		Poison gas.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>			(beat)
		Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if 
		he was guilty of doing  something 	
		wrong…People who are bad should be 
		killed. Don't you think so?
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO
</b>		Jesus was not bad.
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Maybe he was and you just didn't 	
		know it.
<b>	
</b><b>				CONSUELO
</b>		He wasn't.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		But still, you can't be sure.
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO
</b>		I am sure.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		But really, you never know.
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO
</b>		I know!
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>			(beat)
		Why was he on Death Row?
<b>	
</b><b>				CONSUELO
</b>		For rape and murder.
<b>			
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
<b>			
</b><b>				CONSUELO
</b>			(beat)
		It is when you love someone, and 	
		they don't love you. And then you 	
		do something about it.
<b>					
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Sometimes I feel like my parents 	
		don't love me.
<b>	
</b><b>				CONSUELO
</b>		Well then, when you get older you 	
		can do something about it.
<b>	
</b>	A long pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Consuelo? I spilled some grape

<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Dad?…Do you think that Brady will 	
		ever get better?
<b>	
</b><b>				MARTY
</b>		One in a million recover.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY 
</b>		Maybe he's that one in a million!
<b>			
</b><b>				MARTY
</b>		Mikey, there's optimism, and then 	
		there's stupidity. It's a very 	
		fine line.
<b>			
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY 
</b>		I don't think there's any hope, 	
		either. I was just trying to make 	
		you feel better.
<b>			
</b><b>				MARTY
</b>		Thanks.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY 
</b>		You're welcome.
			(beat)
		Dad?…Would you let me try 	
		hypnotizing you now?
<b>	
</b><b>				MARTY
</b>		Yeah. Sure Go ahead. Hypnotize me.
<b>			
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		OK. Stay there. I'll be right 	
		back.
<b>	
</b>	Mikey hurries off to fetch his hypnotizing apparatus. Marty sits and 
	waits. 
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Just a sec!…Be right there!
<b>			
</b>	Mikey returns, sets himself up across from Marty and takes out a shiny 
	object.
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Dad, can you turn around a bit, 	
		please?
<b>	
</b>	Marty obliges.
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Thanks. All right. Now you must 	
		look at this shiny object and 	
		concentrate. Relax your legs. 	
		Relax your arms. Relax your 	
		shoulders. Now keep your eyes on 	
		the shiny object…Your eyelids 	
		are getting heavy…heavier…You're 	
		getting sleepy…sleepier…Now let 	
		your eyes close shut…and you 	
		are asleep.
<b>	
</b>	Marty's head drops.
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b>		Now you are completely under my 	
		power. I am the only voice you can 
		hear, the only voice you will 	
		listen to. Now. When you wake up 	
		you will be in a good mood. You 	
		won't worry so much about Brady. 	
		And I will be your favorite from 	
		now on. If Brady dies, you can be 	
		sad for a little bit, but I will 	
		still be the most important person 
		in your life. You will never be 	
		mean to me, and always give me 	
		whatever I want. Also, you should 	
		fire Consuelo. She's lazy. Now 	
		when I snap my fingers, you will 	
		remember nothing, but you will do 	
		everything I have asked. One. Two. 
		Three.
<b>	
</b>	Mikey snaps his fingers and Marty wakes up.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARTY
</b>		Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice 
		cream?
<b>	
</b><b>				MIKEY
</b><b>		OK!

</b><b>				MARTY
</b>	Consuelo. Mrs. Livingston and I have discussed this, and we've come to

		education at a good college. And 	
		everybody else is gonna be happy.
<b>					
</b><b>				TOBY (O.S.)
</b>		...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a

		confronted with hollow values and 	
		systemic conformism? 
<b>	
</b>	Pause.
<b>	
</b><b>				MARTY
</b>		I don't know why this is so hard

		terrific time in college. I've got 
		a terrific job, a comfortable 	
		salary, terrific wife, three 	
		terrific kids…and every year I 	
		give to the alumni fund. Now why 	
		are you trying to make college out 
		to be a bad thing, a negative 	
		experience? You were unhappy? 	
		Well, to bad! Get over it! Stop 	
		trying to impose your misery on
