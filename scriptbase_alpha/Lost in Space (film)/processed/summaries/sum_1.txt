In the near future, earth's fossil resources are about to be used up.
In an attempt to save the human race, scientists have begun building a gate, through which faster than light travel will be possible - but only if there is a gate at the destination to receive the travelers.
The Robinson Family has been chosen to travel to Alpha Prime - the only other inhabitable planet known - at normal speed, ten years, cryogenically frozen.
But Dr. Smith, a sinister man, sabotages their spaceship, Jupiter 2, but is also betrayed by his people.
So, he has to work together with the Robinsons in order to survive himself.
When Jupiter 2 is falling into the sun, the only chance to survive is to activate the hyperdrive - without a gate at the other end.
Soon, the Robinsons are someplace really unknown, where they meet unfriendly silicon-based space spiders, take in a little ape-like creature and name new star systems after Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig.
They have to reach Alpha Prime in order to build the second gate, or earth's only hope is gone.
