<b>              FADE IN:
</b>
<b>              OPEN COUNTRY - DAY
</b>
              Endless green hills bisected by a ribbon of highway. A road
              gang clearing brush by the side of the road... Twenty-five
              men in prison fatigues sweating through their mid-afternoon
              labor.

<b>              THREE GUARDS
</b>
              Flank the working prisoners... Mountie hats, shotguns,
              sidearms, sunglasses; they look like they mean it.

<b>              HIGHWAY
</b>
              A battered pickup appears...approaches. Suddenly, it coughs,
              shudders, stalls. A big Blackfoot Indian named BILLY BEAR
              gets out and starts cursing and kicking the vehicle.Then he
              begins walking toward the road gang...

<b>              ROADSIDE
</b>
              BRADY is the Guard near the center of the work gang; he
              smiles at the oncoming man, pokes a prisoner beside him.

<b>                                  BRADY
</b>                        Wonder what reservation they let
                        him off of...

              The prisoner is GANZ who looks up, grins at Brady...

<b>                                  GANZ
</b>                        Yeah, there goes the neighborhood.

              Brady laughs as Billy Bear closes in on him.

<b>                                  BILLY
</b>                        Say, buddy, my engine's
                        overheating and I got 30 miles
                        before the next station... Could
                        I get some water out of your
                        cooler?

              Ganz leans on his hoe, speaks as Billy passes...

<b>                                  GANZ
</b>                        Maybe you shoulda stole a better
                        truck, Tonto.

<b>                                  BILLY
</b>                        You got a real big mouth, convict.

<b>                                  BRADY
</b>                        It's okay, chief.  He's just
                        joking...

<b>                                  BILLY
</b>                        How about the water...






<b>                                  GANZ
</b>                        Firewater, Tonto?  Is that what
                        you...

              Billy whirls, swings at Ganz. Both men roll to the ground.

<b>                                  BRADY
</b>                        Hey! Jesus Christ!

<b>              THE OTHER GUARDS
</b>
              Seeing the commotion, they run toward it.

<b>              GANZ AND BILLY
</b>
              As they struggle, Billy slips a pistol into Ganz' hand.

<b>                                  BRADY
</b>                        That's a state prisoner,
                        asshole...! Back off...

<b>              ROADSIDE
</b>
              Brady pulls Billy away from Ganz just 'as one of the other
              officers arrives... Ganz suddenly whips out a pistol, shoots
              Brady at point-blank range. Before the other Guards can even
              react, Billy comes out with his own pistol, caps the Second
              Guard.

<b>              THIRD GUARD
</b>
              Still forty yards away... In mid-draw, be howls as a bullet
              from Ganz breaks the nearby ground. He fires, then turns and
              runs for the prison bus.

<b>              GANZ
</b>
              Smiling, fires twice. but the range is too great for pistol
              work...

<b>              THE OTHER PRISONERS
</b>
              Watching....Then they all scatter in different directions...

<b>              GANZ
</b>
              Hefts his weapon...

<b>                                  GANZ
</b>                        Come on...

              He and the big Indian run to the pickup, climb in and roar
              away.

<b>              INT. BUS
</b>
              The THIRD GUARD making a call on the police radio...





<b>                                  OFFICER
</b>                        APO 657, Unit 25 to APO 478t APO
                        657t Unit 25 to APO 478.

<b>                                  RADIO RESPONSE
</b>                        Go ahead, Unit 25.

<b>                                  OFFICER
</b>                        Escape in progress. Two officers
                        shot off rail crossing 31.
                        Prisoners escaping. Two men, one
                        six-four, 200 pounds, dark, an
                        Indian, the other, Albert Ganz,
                        five-ten...

<b>              FURTHER DOWN THE HIGHWAY
</b>
              Several miles from the escape... A big semi parked by the
              side of ttie road; back doors to the closed trailer open. A
              station wagon parked across the road. The pickup appears,
              approaches the semi, slows down and drives up the ramp into
              the van. Ganz and Billy jump out, shove the ramp up inside
              the truck and close the big doors.

<b>              STATION WAGON
</b>
              Ganz and Billy climb inside ancl roar off, back in the
              direction of the road gang.

<b>              BILLY BEAR
</b>
              Takes off his hat, puts on a baseball cap and sunglasses...

<b>                                  BILLY
</b>                        Get ready to duck.

              Ganz dives for the floor. Three police cars go by, sirens
              blaring, lights flashing. They pass the road gang. Ganz
              reappear, smiles...

<b>                                  GANZ
</b>                        You know something? I'm having a
                        real good time.

<b>              HIGHWAY
</b>
              The station wagon blasts down the pavement... Becomes a small
              dot on the landscape.

<b>              TRANSITION.
</b>
<b>              A DOORWAY - NIGHT
</b>
              the portal slams open revealing a man holding a huge
              pistol,jack cates, s.F.P.D., a large and powerful man... He
              stealthily moves up a stairwell.






<b>              CORRIDOR
</b>
              He stops at the top of the stairs... Listens gun still ready.
              A continuous sound of running water... Cates moves toward the
              bathroom. Rips the door open.

<b>              BATHROOM
</b>
              The shape behind the shower curtain freezes. Cates, gun held
              level, moves forward... Rips the shower curtain open.
              Revealing a young and very beautiful woman, ELAINE MARSHALL.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Inspector Jack Cates, S.F.P.D....
                        And you're wanted.

              Elaine stares at him as Cates turns off the water.

<b>                                  ELAINE
</b>                        What am I wanted for?

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I don't answer questions, I ask
                        'em...

              A moment as she continues to stare at his pistol.

<b>                                  ELAINE
</b>                        I don't think your gun's loaded...

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        This is a .44 Magnum, the most
                        powerful handgun in the world. You
                        gotta ask yourself just one
                        question. Are you feelin' lucky?

<b>                                  ELAINE
</b>                        I still don't think it's loaded.

              Elaine shakes her head and smiles, folds her arms over her
              breasts, shivers a little... Cates looks at the cylinder,
              spins it...

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Hey, you're right.

<b>                                  ELAINE

              She matches Ganz's earlier requirements.Smoking a cigarette,
              staring at the ceiling. Ganz remains on top of the blanket.
              Still in his shirt and pants watching TV. Three sharp knocks
              at the door. Ganz reacts as if he's received an electric
              shock. His hand goes under the pillow... Comes up with an
              automatic. Shoves it hard into Lisa's stomach.

              Cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell. Looks across at
              mirror on the wall opposite. The entire lobby covered from

              Ganz belts her with his gun; she falls..Ganz goes through the

              She's a Mexican girl in a ridiculous 'Indian' outfit.

              Billy goes to where Rosalie is awkwardlytied to a chair with
              an electric dord.  He pulls her to her feet as Ganz moves by.

              Vanzant reaches down, tries the knob.  Locked. Algren moves
              back, preparing to kick the door down.

<b>              ADJACENT ROOM
</b>
              Ganz opens the door behind the two cops. Raises his pistol
              and fires. Billy's shots follow immediately. Hits Vanzant.
              Algren rolls just as Ganz fires again. Wounded, he gets off
              three shots, then moves inside Ganz' room. Ganz and Billy run
              for the elevator... Exchange two more shots with Algren. The
              Mexican Girl begins screaming in Spanish...

              Cates draws his .44. Races up the stairs three at a time.
              Frizzy starts to frantically call the police.

              Cates stops at the landing. Vanzant's body sprawled across
              the hallway. Algren back in the corridor, still losing
              blood... Leans against the wall for support... Lisa staggers
              out of the room, screams. Algren points the gun toward the
              elevator. Indicating where Ganz and Billy have just fled.
              Cates starts back down toward the lobby.

<b>              ELEVATOR

              Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward.
              Rosalie is terrified, sobbing...

<b>              CATES
</b>
              Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase. He takes
              the next flight in two jumps.

              As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to
              wait as he heads for the lobby.

              Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears. He
              slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with
              his pistol. Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun... Cates
              again slams him with his pistol, felling him...

<b>              GANZ

              Slides across the floor.

              CATES Senses something ... moves just as Billy appears behind
              and fires at him. The bullet takes out a window. Cates dives
              over the desk. Another bullet chews up the wood.

<b>              LOBBY

              Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming... Cates'
              move and the accompanying bulletspanic her. She dashes for
              safety... Cates gets to his feet behind cover. Sees Billy
              holding Rosalie by the throat. Frizzy begins to scream.

</b>                        He'll blow her goddamn head off.

              Cates doesn't miss a beat. He slowly levels his .44. Takes
              careful aim and starts to fire at Billy.

<b>                                  ROSALIE
</b>                        No. No.

              Cates' shot narrowly misses Rosalie. The bullet smashes into
              a mirror above Billy's head. Cates keeps moving closer, gun
              pointed straight ahead. Billy pushes the pistol against
              Rosalie'temple. For the first time, Cates hesitates. They
              face each other across the length of the lobby.

<b>              ALGREN
</b>
              Struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby. He still
              holds his revolver. Dares not raise it towards Billy and
              Rosalie.

<b>              BILLY BEAR

              Covers Algren from near the entrance.  He's confused, doesn't
              know what to do... He keeps hold of Rosalie.

              Cates lowers his gun. Finally lets it drop to the floor.

              Then back to Cates as Billy runs out the entrance with
              Rosalie.

                        Your gun's just like mine.

              He's going to kill Cates. But first be glances at Algren.
              Then, almost casually, shoots him twice with Cates' .44.
              Algren staggers back. Dead before he hits the floor. Cates
              twists sideways just as Ganz fires. The bullet misses. Again
              Frizzy starts screaming and struggling. Ganz swipes the woman
              across the head with the gun. Her body slumps to the floor.
              Police sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an
              attempt for Algren's gun. A bullet splatters against the
              floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. The gun
              skitters out of reach.

              Ganz smiles.

              With your own gun, cop. How does it feel? Cates leaps into a
              wooden phone booth. Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth
              with both his and Cates' gun. Two bullets crash into the
              booth. Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are
              ominously near. Ganz finally retreats out the entrance.

              Billy and Rosalie weave their way across street to the
              Cougar. They make a U-turn. Ganz runs out. Car pulls out,

              The police arrive. Swarm into the hotel. All eyes on Cates as

</b>                        That's what you say, Cates...

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Yeah.









<b>                                  YOUNG COP
</b>                        But that's what you say about all
                        of us all the tine ... we're
                        always the ones fucking up when
                        you tell it...

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

              Cates looks at the Old Cop.

<b>                                  OLD COP
</b>                        It don't figure.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I need to borrow a piece.

              The OLD COP shrugs... looks in his desk...

<b>                                  YOUNG COP
</b>                        Somebody steals your gun, you're
                        supposed to file a report.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Are you gonna tell me about police
                        procedure?  Do me a favor, don't
                        give me a bunch of crap.

<b>                                  YOUNG COP
</b>                        I guess when two cops die on
                        account of your fuck up you want
                        to keep it as quiet as possible...

              Cates loses it for a second, lands on him with both hands,
              pushes him against a wall... The room goes quiet. Cates cools
              down.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Just shut the fuck up.

              The other cops don't intervene. They just watch.  Cates cools
              down, straightens up. HADEN walks by, or, rather, speeds by.

<b>                                  HADEN
</b>                        Cates, I'll need to see you in
                        five minutes, exactly five.

              The Old Cop hands Cates a gun, a traditional Army .45...

<b>                                  OLD COP
</b>                        Best I can do.

<b>                                  HADEN
</b>                        D'you read me, Cates...

              Haden continues moving away.






<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Five minutes.  I heard you, your
                        voice carries...

              As Cates is examining the gun, RUTH, a lab technician, enters
              and drops three 8 x 10's on the desk near Cates.

<b>                                  RUTH
</b>                        They're still wet.

              Cates lifts the blow-ups, each one showing a different aspect
              of a spent bullet.

<b>                                  RUTH
</b>                               (continuing)
                        Lots of people getting shot with
                        .44's lately ... Last year, it was
                        Saturday Night Specials..now it's
                        heavy stuff. People must be
                        getting madder about something.

              Cates starts pinning the blow-ups onto a large bulletin board
              on the wall. Nearby, at the same time (within Cates' line of
              sight, within earshot), Lisa, the Hooker, is being
              interrogated by a POLICE-WOMAN who pulls the statement off
              the typewriter. Nearby, the Indian Hooker is being
              interrogated in Spanish.

<b>                                  POLICEWOMAN
</b>                        You're an accessory to Murder One,
                        so you're going to have to do a
                        whole lot better than what we got
                        down here, honey...

<b>                                  LISA
</b>                        Gimme a break, huh? ... Look, I
                        got there.  He was a trick just
                        like any other for all I knew.
                        That's all there is.  He didn't
                        feel like sitting and talking. He
                        was in a big hurry to get laid.
                        I was with him about an hour...

              Cates has gotten interested in the last part of this ...
              drifts toward her... A DETECTIVE comes through, begins
              distributing I.B.M. printouts to Cates, the other nearby
              officers..

<b>                                  DETECTIVE
</b>                        We got a print from the hotel
                        room.  Guy's real name is Ganz,
                        Albert Ganz.  A hitter from back
                        East but he worked out here a few
                        years back.  Armed robbery. Broke
                        out of prison two days ago and
                        capped two of the guards. A real
                        animal.  Wait'll you see this...





              Cates reads the printout, then smoothly,imperiously, he takes
              over the questioning of Lisa.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Did he give you a return match?

<b>                                  LISA
</b>                        He wasn't interested.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Maybe he didn't like your
                        performance.

<b>                                  LISA
</b>                        Fuck you.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I'll take a raincheck...

              From the side, Ruth is pointing at the photos...

<b>                                  RUTH
</b>                        This'll interest you, Jack...we've
                        got something here from your
                        gun... and these are from the
                        first weapon Ganz used...

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I don't get it.

<b>                                  RUTH
</b>                        Here.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>
              She turns, produces the third photo.  Pins it beside the one
              from the Walden Hotel.

<b>                                  RUTH
</b>                        A perfect match for the markings
                        from the first gun he used... but
                        not from the Walden Hotel... fired
                        at least six hours earlier...at
                        point blank range... right between
                        the eyes.  Found him on a park
                        bench...

              She shows him two more pictures.  Police forensics shots of
              Henry Wong ... very dead on the park bench...

<b>                                  RUTH
</b>                               (continuing)
                        Ya know, there are some very bad
                        people out there in the world.








<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Look at it this way, Ruth.  If
                        there weren't, what would there be
                        for us to do?

              Lisa continues with the Policewoman.

<b>                                  LISA
</b>                        Anyway... so I got there and took
                        him down.  He started watching
                        television and then you
                        sensational people started banging
                        on the door... that's all...
                        except ... he's gonna give you
                        guys a hard time.

<b>                                  CATES

              Cates looks up as he hears that remark.  Notices KEHOE,
              another Detective, entering with a long suitcase.

<b>                                  POLICEWOMAN
</b>                        What makes you think so?

<b>                                  LISA
</b>                        I think he liked shooting cops a
                        lot more than getting laid.

              Cates watches Kehoe unpack the box.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Is that what this guy Ganz had in
                        the hotel?



<b>                                  KEHOE
</b>                        Every last bit of it.  The big
                        guy's room was empty.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I'll help you out.

              Cates and Kehoe start going through the suitcase.  Kehoe
              produces a speed loader for a .44...

<b>                                  KEHOE
</b>                        This guy must have had a .44 like
                        yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Shit.

              Kehoe next produces several boxes of shells.








<b>                                  KEHOE
</b>                        This cat was real serious about
                        his artillery.

              An Attendant comes through, hands Kehoe a file. He opens it,
              shows the file to Cates who reads the name under the mug shot.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Billy Bear...

<b>                                  KEHOE
</b>                        Backup man from the East Bay.
                        Worked with Ganz a few years ago
                        and sprung him from the road gang.

              Kehoe opens the second file.  Four mug shots are inside.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Who are all these?

<b>                                  KEHOE
</b>                        They all pulled a bunch of jobs
                        with Ganz about four years ago.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Wait a minute, wait a minute...
                        who's this?

<b>                                  KEHOE
</b>                        Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was
                        in on the same job.

              Cates spins the file around so that both Ruth an Kehoe can
              see it, throws the forensic shots down beside it.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Tell me that's not the same guy.

<b>                                  KEHOE
</b>                        Hey ... Dick Tracy.

<b>                                  RUTH
</b>                        Did Ganz have a grudge against his
                        old friends?

              Haden comes out of his office.

<b>                                  HADEN
</b>                        Get in here, Cates.

              Cates ignores him.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I think I wanna have a discussion
                        about it with any of the ones
                        still walking.  Can we find them?






<b>                                  KEHOE
</b>                        Here's the file. Cates checks the
                        file.

<b>                                  CATES

              Cates walks into Haden's cubicle.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I want to be left alone on this
                        one. Algren was killed with my gun.



<b>                                  HADEN
</b>                        Yeah, I read the report...

              Haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore Cates.

<b>                                  CATES

                        want it back.

<b>                                  HADEN
</b>                        Jack, come on, there is an
                        official department policy about
                        cop killings. Cop killers
                        represent a special priority
                        because any man crazy enough to
                        kill a cop is a greater threat to
                        an unarmed civilian... In other
                        words, we can't seen like we're in
                        the revenge business... I know, we
                        all know the truth's a little
                        different.

              Cates almost smiles at Haden.

<b>                                  CATES

<b>                                  HADEN
</b>                        Anthing botherin' you besides
                        losin' your gun?

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get

              Cates and a GUARD on the upper deck approaching the door to

              He walks down the cell block. Inmates stare at him from
              inside the stark cells. They don't know who he is, but they
              can smell a cop. Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside...
              a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and
              taste. The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall
              instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a
              graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods
              to the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch
              and the door opens.

              Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain
              pen. He's boogeying in his seat to the music. Sprawled on a
              bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond's

              Cates grabs the still open Cadillac door, slams it into

              Luther sits up again, glares at Cates.

                        You'd better think of somethin' to
                        tell him.

              Luther besitates...flashes a look at Hammond, who sends him
              a silent fleeting reply.  Maybe Cates sees this. Maybe not.

              Something's wrong with all this.  Cates isn't sure just what.
              Not yet. He looks at Hammond.

                        Ganz and warn him. Ain't you,
                        motherfucker?

              Luther makes a play toward Hammond, who laughs, doesn't even
              flinch.

<b>                                  HAMMOND

                        Luther, are you angry with me?

              Cates wrestles Luther into the back seat, turns to Hammond.

              Hammond searches the first. He drops a wallet on the floor
              and moves to the second. A switchblade, some credit cards and
              another wallet fall to the floor. The last Punk has only a

              Hammond turns to the Bartender...

                        One of them is under-age.  Another
                        attacked a police officer. And you
                        know I ain't found what I came
                        lookin' here for yet...

              Walks back to the Bartender.

                        or you got the picture yet?

              He reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses. Jerks
              the towel, the pyramid capsizes onto the floor. Huge crash as
              the glasses break into a million fragments.

                        Now, let's see what can we fuck
                        with next?

              The Bartender doesn't have the look of a happy man.

<b>                                  BARTENDER
</b>                        Okay, okay.  The Indian hangs out
                        with a girl down the block. Right
                        where Chinatown starts.  She lives
                        on top of the hardware store.

              Hammond turns, grins at Cates. As far as he's concerned, he's
              won the bet.  Cates nods, slips out the door.

                        place.  It's the only thing I know.

              He looks desperate.

              Hammond steps out of the bar.  He crosses to Cates by the car.

              Hammond smiles.

                        me the switchblade, too.

              Hammond reluctantly takes out a .22 automatic, slams it down
              on the hood of the car.

              Hammond hands them over with the knife.

<b>                                  HAMMOND
</b>                        You already got a gun and you owe

                        for the gun you just took.

              A long moment. Then Cates slowly lifts the .22 automatic.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        You did a real good job... Guess
                        you deserve a reward.

              Removes the clip.  Throws it across the street. Hands Hammond
              the automatic.

</b>                        Motherfucker.

              He throws the gun away.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I sure am. Now let's go get us an

              They walk up the block.

<b>              TRANSITION.

<b>              STREET - CHINATOWN - NIGHT
</b>
              Neon signs with Sino lettering.

<b>              CATES AND HAMMOND
</b>
              Walk down the street, spot a shop with a window display of
              tools.  Look up at the darkened apartment windows. They walk
              to the end of the block.

<b>              ALLEY
</b>
              Stairwells lead to each apartment above the shops. Cates and
              Hammond move along the buildings... Arrive at the back of the
              hardware store. Quietly, they start to ascend the stairs.

<b>              STAIRWELL
</b>
              The metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door.
              Cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent
              window. Between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from
              a TV set. On the tube, various poses from stridently
              exercising women.

<b>                                  HAMMOND

              Looks again. A female form passes by, goes out of the room.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        There.

<b>              DOORWAY
</b>
              Cates gestures to the door lock. Hammond fiddles with it for
              several moments. The door swings open. They step into a
              darkened room.

<b>              APARTMENT
</b>
              Cates takes the .38 from his pocket. He stops near the open
              bedroom doorway. He looks at Hammond and then both men step
              quickly into the room.

<b>                                  CATES

              Hammond reaches for the light switch. Takes a heavy blow.
              Slumps against the door. A Woman's voice screams out.

<b>                                  CATES

                        Stay where you are!

              The light goes on. Cates' gun points at a YOUNG WOMAN (CASEY)
              in a flimsy dressing gown. Saturday Night Special held
              between her palms, police style... A SECOND WOMAN (SALLY)
              stands beside Hammond at the light switch. Larger and
              slightly older than the first, she wears a man's shirt. Holds
              a baseball bat in her right hand.

<b>                                  SALLY

                        just liable to pull the trigger.

              Cates takes two steps toward Casey...

              A long look at Hammond.

<b>              STREET ACROSS FROM TORCHIE'S - NIGHT
</b>
              They two men walk toward the Cadillac.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Okay, Reggie, I'm done playing
                        around. I want to know what's
                        going on and I'm going to beat the
                        living shit out of you until you
                        tell me.

              Hammond goes into a street rap.

<b>                                  HAMMOND
</b>                        You beat the shit out of me?
                        Don't make me laugh, sucker.  You
                        don't know how I'd dance on your
                        face?  I'll hit you so hard, so
                        many times, you'll wish you'd
                        never been hatched.  I'll turn
                        your face into cottage cheese.
                        I'll make your girl think you been
                        takin' ugly pills.  She won't even
                        know who you are, sucker.

              They stop by the car. Cates takes the gun out, lays it on the
              hood.  Hammond stares at him. Cates next takes out his
              wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the
              car fender... Smiles.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I guess the first thing I ought,
                        to explain to you, nigger, is I
                        fight dirty.

              Hits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face.
              Hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. Cates
              hesitates ... and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially
              open car door slamming into Cates. Cates sprawls.

<b>                                  HAMMOND
</b>                        So do I.

              Hammond aims a kick at Cates' head.  Cates blocks it with
              crossed forearms, grabs, twists.  Hammond tumbles, rolls away
              from Cates.  Both men struggle to their feet, circle each
              other.

              Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates,
              a bit sooner than he expected.  Cates smiles.

              Hammond dances in and out... Cates' breathing becomes more
              labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense. Cates
              clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater
              bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a
              brick wall.






              Hammond is faster...

              Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at
              one another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond's
              back is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the
              lighter man's agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary...
              Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at
              his side... Breath coming like a bellows...

              Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put
              him out.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        Now, you bastard, you going to
                        tell me what's going on...

              Puffing away.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                               (continuing)
                        ... Do I have to kick the shit out
                        of you some more.

              They stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and-
              white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights
              flashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out,
              guns drawn.

<b>                                  FIRST COP
</b>                        All right, you two.  Don't move.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        NO, no...it's okay...I'm police.

<b>                                  SECOND COP
</b>                        Yeah, sure.  Get your hands above
                        your head.

              He keeps his gun trained on Cates,and Hammond.

<b>                                  CATES

                        And I'm too fucking tired to raise
                        my hands...

              Hammond rubs the side of his face. Cates falls back against
              the patrol car. Still fighting for breath. The First Cop
              lifts Cates' wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge,
              shows it to the other cop.

<b>                                  FIRST COP
</b>                        What the hell's going on here?

              Cates walks over, pockets his gun.

</b>                        I've got a burglary call.  Two

                        into their place posing as cops.

                        talk 'em.  You can straighten it
                        out.

              The First Cop checks out Cates' badge and I.D.

                        tomorrow.

              The First Cop takes out his book, starts writing.  He's
              pissed.

<b>                                  FIRST COP

              He grabs Hammond and they head for the Cadillac.

              Cadillac parked behind the service area.

<b>              RESTROOM
</b>
              Hammond looks' up at his bruised face in the mirror, then
              washes up.  Cates is one step ahead of him. He rolls up a
              piece of the wet towel and inserts it over his bleeding gum.

<b>                                  HAMMOND

                        finish you off.

              Cates straightens up from the wash basin.

</b>                        Yeah, right.  You want to try

                        That's how you'll tell the story.

              Cates dries off his face, starts out of the washroom.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I'll even put it in my report that
                        way.

              The door closes behind Cates. Hammond leans back toward the
              mirror, nudges a tooth with his finger.

<b>              GAS STATION PARKING LOT

              Cates leans on the Cadillac as Hammond emerges. Hammond
              starts for the passenger side.

              Pause.

              A long moment; Hammond decides be has no choice.

              The Attendant finds the key, exits the booth. Luther follows
              to an elevated stack of cars. The Attendant throws a switch,

              Luther drives down the exit ramp in a dated Porsche

              The car is covered with a uniform coat of dust, except for
              the windshield which has been wiped hastily clean.

              Luther waits for a break in the flow of traffic, drives out.

              Luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly Cate's

              He goes to the trunk. Rummages there ... picks up a flaming
              red suit.

              Under the suit is a nondescript attache case. Luther takes

              Luther hurries along the sidewalk.

              He reaches the corner, turns quickly...

<b>              CATES AND HAMMOND
</b>
              Following a little way behind.

              They pause at the corner, watching the pedestrian traffic
              move by. Then turn down the cross street after Luther. Follow
              him down a stairwell.

<b>              SUBWAY STATION - LOBBY
</b>
              Escalators and open stairwells. Luther enters and pauses by
              the doorway. Commuters crowd the counters and congregate near
              the stairwells. More people are seated along hard plastic
              seats. But no Ganz.  And no Billy.

              Luther moves further into the station.  Cates and Hammond
              enter. They keep Luther fixed between them, 50 feet ahead.
              Luther seems to be wandering He walks through the shop area
              and back toward the escalator. Hammond remains near the
              arcade while Cates blends in with the commuters. Luther puts
              the briefcase down at his feet and leans against a counter.
              Next to him, a loud troop of Boy Scouts marches by.  A crowd
              of people from the train area below flows through the lobby
              obscuring Luther from Hammond and Cates for a moment.  Cates
              steps out to get a better view and suddenly spots Ganz moving
              through the crowd toward Luther. Be looks over at Hammond
              across the station and motions.  Then they both start moving
              in on Ganz, trying to intercept him before he gets deeper
              into the crowd.

              Ganz moves cautiously through the station. A crumpled
              newspaper held absently in his hand. He scans the faces of
              the commuters and spots Luther. Fails to notice Cates and
              Hammond closing in on him from two directions.

              A PATROLMAN comes up. Starts chatting amiably with a Boy
              Scout next to Luther. Ganz hesitates in his approach. He
              motions Luther to move awaye, but Luther starts to panic when
              he sees Cates and Hammond closing in...

              Ganz reacts to Luther, turns and spots the two men. He makes
              an immediate break for open ground. The Patrolman sees Ganz
              start to run. The newspaper is thrown to the floor... Ganz
              swings Cates' .44 toward Hammond.

</b>                        Hey--you!

              Ganz whirls, his feet slipping on the marble floor. His shot
              at Hammond goes plowing into the ceiling. The crowd starts to
              panic and run in all directions.





              The Patrolman has al ready brought his own gun out. Levels it
              at Ganz.

<b>              BILLY BEAR
</b>
              Suddenly appears, Rosalie at his side. Billy Bear's .44
              blasts the Patrolman onto his back.

              Ganz comes up and scrambles through the screaming patrons.
              He, Billy and Rosalie head toward the escalator. Cates has
              already brought out his .38... Can't get a clean shot through
              the chaos.

              Hammond pushes his way through the crowd to Cates.

              Hammond starts after Luther. Cates turns, starts to aim at
              Hammond. Hesitates...

<b>              PASSENGER WALKWAY
</b>
              Panic has overtaken everyone as they try to escape the madman
              with the gun.

              Ganz and Billy elbow and kick their way through the crowd,
              tugging Rosalie along...

              Cates, gun in hand, creates further-panic as he moves after
              Ganz.

              Ganz grabs a man beside him.





              Shoves him hard into the passengers in back.

              The man knocks over several more people creating a roadblock.

              Ganz vaults over the railing and starts for the trains.
              Cates loses a few more precious seconds grappling through the
              terrorized passengers...

<b>              TRAIN AREA
</b>
              The usually jammed area looks like an empty stockyard. The
              patrons huddle in fear against any available wall.

              Cates bursts out of the stairwell...

<b>              TUNNEL

              Red and green signal lights. The light goes red, a train
              roars up and the doors hiss open.

              Billy and Ganz fight through the passengers getting off the
              train, jump on board; Billy pulls Rosalie behind him.

<b>              CATES

              Running for the doors...

              Suddenly, a SECURITY OFFICER appears, riot gun in hand.

              He means it, points the riot gun even closer... The train in
              front of him moves away.

              Cates carefully places the .38 on the pavement. Then raises
              his hands in the air.

              Cates shrugs.

              Big smile as Cates produces some cash. Hammond counts it
              eagerly. Looks around. Candy suddenly appears like a trout
              seeing a lure.  She grabs the money.

              Cates watches them go, downs his drink. He fishes in his

              Luther waits, impatient.

              Checks his watch.

              Looks up and down the street.

              He double-checks the bus stop sign over his head.

              Just as a bus pulls to a stop, air brakes hissing ...








<b>              LUTHER

              Gets in.

              Sees that the driver is Billy Bear...

<b>              BUS

              The bus starts up. Luther hesitates in the front. On the wide
              rear seat is Ganz. Rosalie beside him.

<b>                                  GANZ

              Commuters look up expectantly. One of two drift toward the

              Ganz is satisfied. Luther closes the case.

<b>                                  LUTHER

              His eyes fall on the rear view mirror. A white Caddy dances
              in the vibrating glass. Billy looks over his shoulder at Ganz.

<b>              GANZ

              Looks up as glass shards sparkle down.

              He speeds up ... he is neck and neck with the bus.

              Hammond has a clear shot of Billy Bear who gives a side
              glance at him;

              Hammond doesn't shoot...

              Cates slows down and fires...

              Billy is hit in the shoulder. Ganz runs up and fires again...
              Hammond is hit in the arm. Cates grabs Hammond by the shirt.
              Yanks him close. Throws the wheel over ...

              Swerves as bullets pepper the passenger side. Stuffing flies
              out of Hammondis still warm seat. The right hand windows
              explode. Then the Caddy spins out.

<b>              THE CADDY

              As Casey opens the door and starts toward the.stairs, Cates
              and Hammond come through the door and grab her. They are now
              on the ground floor stairwell.

              They move upward...

<b>              INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
              Cates is stealthily going to the end of the second corridor
              of the kitchen and living room area. That corridor turns at
              a sharp angle and goes to the back. Hammond is at the very
              front of that first corridor..at a door ... he shoves it back.

</b>
              There is a bed and  Rosalie, undressed, is in it... Billy is
              seated on the edge of it... pants on, shirt off, pulling on
              his boots. Suddenly, Hammond is pointing a gun at him...

              Billy looks at Hammond.  With lightning sudden quickness, he
              reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back.
              Billy smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he
              leaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol.  The big
              slugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as
              Rosalie shrieks.

              Ganz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off
              the bed, pushes Sally out of the way ... opens the door and
              starts firing furiously down the corridor... He grabs the
              briefcase and runs to the window.

<b>              INT. CORRIDOR/DOOWAY TO BACK BEDROOM

              Cates has ducked the bullets ... he is inching toward the
              door...

              He pulls it open...Ganz from the window fires another shot
              which almost gets him then vanishes down the fire escape...

              Sally gets to her feett yelling, runs at Cates as he appears
              and futilely tries to hit him....He throws her down on the
              bed as if she were a doll ... He goes to the window...

              Ganz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground. He stops
              for a second... Then Cates appears, Ganz fires a shot then
              starts to run. Cates keeps coming...

              Hammond enters to find it empty of Ganz and Cates, only Sally
              crying hysterically ... He runs out.

              Ganz runs out the back alley ...Cates pursues...

              Hammond runs down the stairs toward the front of the building.

</b>
              Ganz runs, turns out of an alley onto a street baked with
              neon light. Cates pursues.

<b>              EXT. FRONT OF CASEY'S BUILDING

              Hammond runs out, turns down the adjoining street.

<b>              CATES
</b>
              Following Ganz, holding him in sight, but unable to get a
              shot off...

<b>              PARALLEL STREET

              on his street hears the shot... he runs toward it, down a
              narrow alley between two buildings....

<b>              EXT. DOORWAY AT END OF ALLEY
</b>
              Ganz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of
              Cates.  They move very close to where be is crouched... it is
              Hammond coming toward him... Ganz suddenly rolls a garbage
              can in his path, dropping him like a stone.

<b>              CATES
</b>
              Comes toward where he expects to find Ganz... Ganz has his
              arm around Hammond's throat and his gun to his ear...

              comes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it
              down when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy.  The hand
              that's around Hammond's throat also holds the black bag.
              Cates walks forward, his gun down at his side...

</b>                        Sure...

              Suddenly, he crouches and fires twice. Hammond twists as Ganz
              also fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet
              backward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the
              ground, looks at Cates.

<b>                                  HAMMOND

              Ganz' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side.
              Cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again.





              Ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look
              of childish disbelief passes over his face.

<b>                                  GANZ

                        ain't cool.

              He runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is
              stopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his
              chest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of
              Ganz' now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond...

              Cates in the tub, steam rushing from the water.

              He reaches out, lifts his watch from his pile of clothes on

<b>              CANDY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
              Minimal crummy hotel room accommodations... Hammond is
              kissing her at the door, finishing buttoning all his buttons.





              He reaches for a wallet, gives her several bills.

<b>                                  HAMMOND

                        Buy yourself something pretty.
                        I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got
                        this cop waitin' for me...

              They kiss... it's pretty romantic... She opens the door for
              him.

<b>              CORRIDOR

              She stands at the top of the stairs; as Hammond walks down,
              he calls back to her over his shoulder ...

<b>                                  HAMMOND

                        Maybe I'll make an honest woman of
                        you.

              He gives her a big sniile.

              He moves off, still smiling, holding the black briefcase...

<b>              STREET - NIGHT
</b>
              on a picturesque hill above the Haight. Cates standing near
              the wheel of Hammond's Porsche.  Hammond comes down the porch
              steps from the hotel.

<b>                                  CATES

<b>                                  HAMMOND

                        go in for that macho bullshit ...
                        but I was fantastic.







                        As a riatter of fact, I was so
                        good, I may have my cock done in
                        bronze.

              Cates holds up the black briefcase.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        I guess this is what you want to
                        talk about...All the pretty money
                        that's inside here.

              Cates takes the case to the trunk, opens it, deposits the
              case, locks the trunk.

<b>                                  HAMMOND
</b>                        Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been
                        waitin' three years for that.  I
                        don't think it's fair, man. What
                        about the merit system.? You were
                        gonnna give me a few thousand.

<b>                                  CATES
</b>                        There's nothin' to talk about.

              Another long exchange of looks. Then be hands Hammond the
              keys to the trunk.

<b>                                  CATES

<b>                                  HAMMOND

<b>                                  HAMMOND
</b>                        You are an awesomely weird cop.
                        Sure wish there were more like you
                        runnin' around out here.

<b>                                  CATES

                        of you steppin' over the line
                        again, I'm gonna ventilate that

                        investments from here on in.







              Cates gives him a very skeptical look, as they head for the
              car.

              Hammond gets in behind the wheel, Cates on the passenger side.

              Cates takes out a cigarette, starts to light it.

              Hammond takes the match does it for him.

<b>                                  CATES

<b>                                  HAMMOND
</b>                        No trouble, Jack. But, listen,
                        suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd
                        you get the idea that you could
                        catch me?

              They both smile. Hammond socks it into gear and they drive
              off into the far distance...

<b>                                             END.
