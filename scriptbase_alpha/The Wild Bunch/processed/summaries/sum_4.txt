After a botched robbery attempt in Texas, Pike Bishop and his gang head south across the Rio Grande and into Mexico.
They are being pursued by Deke Thornton and his men, made up of bounty hunters.
They had been hired by the railroad to stop Bishop and his gang from robbing the rail depot and now have 30 days to track them down and kill them.
Bishop and his men plan to spend only a short time in Mexico and then cross back into Texas to continue plying their trade.
Their stay is lengthened however when they meet a violent Mexican general who wants them to rob a U.S. train carrying arms.
They do so, but it leads to a violent and bloody final confrontation.
