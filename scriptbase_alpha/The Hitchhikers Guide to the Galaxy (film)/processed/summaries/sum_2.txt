Everyman Arthur Dent is whisked off the Earth seconds before it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass.
Sadly, his day has only just begun.
Before it's over, he will have been blown up, attended a poetry reading, been thrown out of an airlock, rescued, reunited with the love of his life, shot at, had a fish stuck in his ear, insulted, whacked, sickened, deprived of tea, learned the answer to the ultimate question, and almost had his brain sawed out by mice.
He then goes to have lunch.
