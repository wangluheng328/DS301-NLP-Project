In 1965, Mossad agents Rachel, Stephan and David are assigned to kidnap Nazi Dieter Vogel, a.k.a.
The Surgeon of Birkenau, in East Berlin.
They succeed in the abduction but fail in bringing him to the west side.
While staying with him in an apartment building, Vogel escapes but the trio of young agents lies to their government and tells that Rachel killed Vogel while he was running away.
They have been honored in their country by their action for more than thirty years.
In 1997, Rachel's daughter Sarah Gold releases a book in Tell Aviv about the mission of her mother and the two other agents.
Rachel Singer, Sarah's father Stephan Gold, who is paralytic in a wheelchair, and David Peretz, who is missing, are retired and Rachel is uncomfortable with the lie that they have been living with.
Out of the blue, David appears in Tel Aviv and commits suicide.
Stephan investigates and finds that Dieter Vogel is apparently alive in a hospital in Kiev, Ukraine, and will be interviewed by a journalist.
Now Rachel has to travel to Kiev to conclude what they should have done thirty years ago.
