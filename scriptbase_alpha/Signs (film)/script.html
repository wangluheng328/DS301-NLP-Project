<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT.  WINDOW - MORNING
</b>
We are looking out a second story window of a house.  The
backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn
from use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a
picnic table.

The backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown. 
Six feet high.

Everything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A
<b>CHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S
</b><b>COMING FROM.
</b>
<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
GRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep.  He thought he heard
something.  He listens.  HE HEARS THE HEATER.  THE
<b>REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING.  THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS
</b><b>OUTSIDE CHIRPING.
</b>
Graham climbs out of bed.  He moves in his pajama pants and
white Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the
bedroom door.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  HALL LANDING - MORNING
</b>
Graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors
meet.  He moves to the door that has children's drawings
taped to it.  He puts his ear close.  Listens.  Beat.

He relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up
sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He
puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his
bedroom.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING
</b>
A bathroom door is open.  WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING.  WE HEAR
<b>THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED.
</b>
Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded
outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang.  It's
ghostly stained forever on the blank wall.

<b>A CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY.
</b>
The water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the
doorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very
still.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
The bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his
children's room.  There are children's books everywhere. 
Overflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners.

Graham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both
empty.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING
</b>
<b>WE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.  THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT
</b><b>INTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE.
</b>
MERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings
onto his feet in one quick motion.  He is hyper-awake. 
Merrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His
muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and
looks around bewildered.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING
</b>
Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the
backyard.  He spins as he looks around.

Merrill, now with a T-shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side
stairs adjacent to the garage building.

Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each
other across the yard.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Where are they?

Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes.

<b>                    CHILDREN
</b>              (yelling in the distance)
          Daaaad!

Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the
YELLING.  They look away from the house, across the yard and
into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  CROPS - MORNING
</b>
The tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as
they run through the crops.

A LITTLE GIRL appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them
like an apparition.  She is in her nightgown.  She is four.

They reach her fast.  She stands unaware of them in a daze. 
Her hair is messed from sleep.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Bo where's Morgan?

BO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts.  Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Bo?

Bo finally looks at her father.  Beat.  She smiles softly.

<b>                    BO
</b>          Are you in my dreams too?

Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          This isn't a --

<b>                    BOY (O.S.)
</b>          Dad!

Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE.  He's
close.  Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops.

He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his
pajama bottoms.  DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Morgan what's happening?

Graham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of
Morgan.  The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.

Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's
looking straight at him.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Are... you... hurt?

Beat.  Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          I think God did it.

Beat.  THE DOGS KEEP BARKING.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Did what Morgan?

Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his
face.  Graham is forced to look to his right.  Beat.  Graham
sees something.

Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet.  He starts moving
forward towards something.

He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a
clearing.  Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. 
They are clearly agitated.

Graham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING
<b>FLAT ON THE GROUND.  THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED
</b><b>FEET WIDE.
</b>
Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the
center.  Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.

The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL
<b>THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF
</b><b>THIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.
</b>
<b>WE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE
</b><b>HUNDRED FEET WIDE -- SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ENDLESS,
</b><b>UNTOUCHED CORN FIELD.

</b>
<b>EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME
</b>
Graham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if it's at the
right temperature.  The other hand holds a cordless phone to
his ear.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (into phone)
          ... Lee actually the reason I'm
          calling is about Lionel.

Graham stokes the coals with a LONG BARBECUE FORK.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (into phone)
          Was he at home last night with you
          or was he out and about with the
          Wolfington brothers?

Graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads
towards the house.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (into phone)
          Well, there was a little mischief
          done to our crops last night.

Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (into phone)
          I know he's a fine boy... No one's
          saying otherwise.

Graham steps through the back screen door into his

<b>KITCHEN.
</b>
Graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED
<b>VOICE.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (into phone)
          Listen Lee, I don't even mind if it
          was him.  You could just talk to
          him and that would be enough for
          me... See it was kind of strange
          finding the crops like that.  The
          kids were... confused by it.  It
          would take the strangeness away if
          we knew it was Lionel and the
          Wolfington brothers just messing
          around...
              (beat, listens)
          The movies...
              (beat)
          Are you sure?
              (beat)
          Okay, then... Thank you for your
          patience Lee.

Graham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the
counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen
floor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a
LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Houdini peed.  I think he's sick.

Graham looks at the majestic dog.  It's shivering.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Take him outside.  I'll call Dr.
          Reynolds.

Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on
their faces.

Graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the
puddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his
knees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down
the hall.

A balding police officer stands on the other side of the
screen door.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          That was quick Edgar.  I only
          called you boys about two hours
          ago.

OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as
          she put it, "diving for her life"
          when a bunch of school kids rode
          down the sidewalk on skateboards. 
          She went down to Thorton's store
          this morning and started spitting
          on the new skateboards.  Spitting! 
          By the time I got there, Mrs.
          Kindleman had sprayed the whole
          damn place... She must have had a
          cold or something.  It was enough
          to turn a grown man's stomach.

Beat.  Graham stares at Officer Paski.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          So what happened to your crops?

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME
</b>
Bo walks from the house with a large glass of water.  She
moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table.

Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the
grill.  He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,
before walking over to Houdini.

The two children sit down in the grass with the dog.

Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. 
She stops.  Takes a tiny sip of the water first.

She holds the glass out to Morgan.

<b>                    BO
</b>          I think it's contaminated.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          You don't even know what that word
          means.

He drinks.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          It's not contaminated.  It's just
          tap water.  Pour it in his bowl.

<b>                    BO
</b>          It tastes funny.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          He licks his butt everyday.  He's
          not going to mind.

Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl.  Beat.

Houdini just sits staring at them.  He is not shivering.  He
doesn't drink.  He is unnaturally still.

Bo pushes the bowl closer.

Graham stands next to him and leans in.  The joint where the
stalk bends from the ground is a perfect "L".

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          It's not broken.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          What kind of machine can bend a

          it?

Graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn

Graham, nods in agreement.  Officer Paski stands up.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          Second thing this week I can't
          explain.

</b>          Some animals around the county
          exhibiting uncharacteristic
          behavior.  Sometimes violent
          behavior.  Theo Henry had two of
          his fingers bit off by his cow.

<b>                    GRAHAM

</b>          No Father, they're edgy.  On alert. 
          Like they act when they smell a

We see a thought catch in Graham's eyes.  He turns back and
stares in the direction of the house.  You can barely see the
roof over the crops.  Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM

Officer Paski notices the still expression on Graham's face.

Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred
patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table.

Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and
Officer Paski enter the backyard.  They stop cold when they
look in his direction.  They begin a slow walk towards him.

Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on
his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on
top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball.

As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is
crying.

Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE
<b>FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK.
</b>
Beat.

They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his
pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma
spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>              (soft)
          He wanted to kill Bo.

Beat.  Graham stares at his ten-year old son.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Did he hurt you?

Beat.  Morgan nods, "No."  His tough exterior breaks as his
face starts to tremble.  He starts crying.  Graham picks him
up in his arms.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (whispers in his ear)
          I'm so sorry Morgan.

Graham reaches up for Bo.  She has dirt and tears on her
face.  Beat.  She slowly climbs down.  Graham carries both
his children as they cry in his arms.

He starts towards the house.  Merrill walks out from the back
holding a bowl of food.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          I used a little Tabasco in the
          potato salad.

Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym.

<b>                    BO
</b>          Houdini's sick.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Please tie up Isabelle to the back
          of the shed.  Make sure the knot's
          tight.

Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.  He
nods.

The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill
runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the
house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the
shed.

Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen
door.

The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is
the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of
their dead dog's neck.

five inches away from his face.

Graham gets startled.

          went in opposite directions.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Edgar, it sounds as strange to me
          saying it, as it is to you hearing
          it.  But we couldn't see him.  He
          stayed mostly in the shadows.  All
          we could make out was movement.
              (beat)
          But I'll tell you something with
          absolute certainty.  There was
          someone watching our house last
          night.  He was looking in my
          children's windows and I want you
          to find him Edgar.
              (beat)
          I need you to take this seriously,
          just incase, it is something
          serious.

The three men stand in the doorway.  Edgar opens his pad.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          I apologize.

Morgan walks up to the front door.  He holds up a baby
monitor.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as
          a walkie-talkie?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Yes.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          It needs batteries.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Edgar, come inside.

The three men follow Morgan into the house.  They pass
through the family room where Bo stands at the television.

She is staring at the screen.  ON THE SCREEN IS AERIAL
<b>FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER.  THE FOOTAGE IS OF A LARGE FIELD
</b><b>WITH ENORMOUS CIRCLES AND DIAMONDS CARVED INTO ITS CROPS.
</b>
Bo changes the channel.  She finds a cartoon.  She sits down
on the sofa.

Morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the

<b>KITCHEN.
</b>
<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          How certain are you, that this was
          a male?

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          I don't know any girls can run like
          that.

Graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some
batteries.  He hands them to Morgan.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          These are D's; I need double A's.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I have some upstairs.

Graham starts out of the kitchen.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          I don't know Merrill.  I've seen
          some of those women on the
          Olympics.  They could out run me
          easy.

They all move into the

<b>FAMILY ROOM.
</b>
Bo watches cartoons.  THE CARTOON MUSIC AND CARTOON PRAT
<b>FALLS FILLS THE ROOM.
</b>
<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          This guy got on the roof in like a
          second.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Bo, can you turn down the volume
          until Officer Paski leaves?

Bo nods and moves to the television.  The pack of men follow
Graham up the

<b>STAIRS.
</b>
<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          That roof is over ten feet high.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          He's telling you the truth, Edgar. 
          Whoever it was, is very strong and
          can jump pretty high.

They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his
bedroom.  He moves into his

<b>BATHROOM.
</b>
They all move in with him.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          They got women's high jumping in
          the Olympics.  They got these
          Scandinavian women who could jump
          clean over me.

Graham takes the clock radio from the sink.  Tries to open
the back.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Shoot, it needs a screw driver.  I
          have double A's in here.

Graham waves the radio.  The men and Morgan move out of the
bathroom.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I know you're making a point Edgar. 
          I just don't know what it is.

They moves down the STAIRS.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          Yesterday afternoon, an out of town
          woman stopped by the diner and
          started yelling and cussing cause
          they didn't have her favorite
          cigarettes at the vending machine. 
          Scared a couple of customers.  No
          one's seen her since... My point
          is, we don't know anything about
          the person you saw.  We should just
          keep all possibilities available.

They move through the FAMILY ROOM.

Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon.

<b>                    BO
</b>          Dad, where's the remote?

Bo starts looking around the couch.

Graham stops before entering the kitchen.  The group stops
with him.  He looks at Bo searching the couch.  He walks over
to the television.

There are three glasses of water on the TV set.  He stands
next to the set.  Doesn't see what's on the screen.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Bo, you're too old to still be
          doing this.  The rule is, you take
          a glass of water, you finish it.
              (beat)
          Now what's wrong with this one?

Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her
father.  Looks at the glass.

<b>                    BO
</b>          There's dust in it.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          This one?

<b>                    BO
</b>          A hair.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          This one?

<b>                    BO
</b>          Morgan took a sip.  It has his
          amoebas in it.

Beat.  Bo turns back to her search.  Graham tucks the clock
radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.  He heads
towards the kitchen.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Excluding the possibility that a
          female Scandinavian Olympian was
          running around outside our house
          last night, what else is a
          possibility?

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          I'm not done asking questions and I
          don't appreciate the sarcasm.

They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into
the KITCHEN.

Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other
half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a
screwdriver.  He starts opening the clock radio.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          Do you have anyone who might have a
          grudge or something against you? 
          Maybe a church member, who might
          not have liked the fact, that you
          left the church?

Graham looks at Edgar.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I don't think so.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          Do you owe anybody money?  You can
          tell me off the record if you need
          too.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          No.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          No.

Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts
replacing the batteries.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          Is anything missing?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          No.

Graham hands Morgan the monitor.  He turns it ON.  THERE IS A
<b>STATIC CRACKLE WITH SPIKES OF SOUND.
</b>
<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          It's still making the noises.  It's
          broken.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          It's old Morgan.

Morgan heads out of the kitchen.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Listen, I was out of line with that
          whole female Scandinavian Olympian
          thing.

Edgar nods.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          It's just that, I'm pretty strong
          and pretty fast.  And I was running
          as fast as I could.  And this
          guy...
              (embarrassed smile)
          He was just toying with us.

Beat.  Merrill walks out of the kitchen.  Graham watches
Edgar think it over.

Graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit. 
He picks them up.  Sees two more on the coffee table.  He
gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          Could everyone just take a seat on
          the couch.  I have some preliminary
          thoughts.

Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches
the TV.  Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          There are three possibilities here. 
          We'll call them one, two and three. 
          The level one scenario is that
          there is a sane individual, who for
          real reasons wants to do you harm. 
          I really don't believe that's what
          we're looking at here.  In my
          opinion, whoever this is, they
          don't want to do harm to you all. 
          That's kind of clear.
              (beat)
          The level two scenario is, this is
          a mentally unstable person who's
          fixated on you and your family. 
          This is a possibility, but a very
          slim one.
              (beat)
          I assure you I will treat all three
          possibilities carefully, but in all
          likely hood we are looking at what
          we'll call a level three scenario. 
          He's a watcher.  Someone who this
          is a game for.  He's laying low. 
          Doesn't want to be seen.  But he
          wants to watch you.  Study you
          folks.

Officer Paski walks towards the windows.  Graham, Merrill and
Morgan follow him with their eyes.  Officer Paski walks next
to the television.

<b>ON THE SCREEN WITH THE SOUND ALMOST MUTED, IS AN AERIAL SHOT
</b><b>FROM A HELICOPTER.  A DIFFERENT ONE THAN BEFORE.  THE FOOTAGE
</b><b>IS OF A VAST FIELD OF CROPS.  THERE ARE TWO DIAMONDS FLANKING
</b><b>TWO SIDE OF A TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD.
</b>
Officer Paski turns to them.

Graham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          Now I don't want you all to worry
          about this no more.  You're making
          more of this than it is.
              (beat)
          You guys have had a tough couple of
          days with the vandalism to the
          crops and the death of your
          shepherd.
              (beat)
          Maybe you guys should do something
          fun?  Let me worry about this
          person.  Let me find out who it is
          and then -- What the hell are you
          people looking at?

Edgar comes around to see the screen.

<b>WE ARE ON A TV SCREEN.  THE CROPS SWAY IN THE BREEZE.
</b>
<b>A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE WAVING FROM THE DIAMONDS ON THE

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI

Bo gets up.

<b>                    BO
</b>          I can't find the remote.

She presses the up arrows on the TV controls.

          found in that country in the last

The television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR.

<b>                    PROFESSOR (TV)

          late seventies with the renewed
          interest in extraterrestrial life. 
          They died out by the early
          eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. 
          This new resurgence is wholly
          different.  Elements of it are
          unexplainable.  The speed and the
          quantity in which it has appeared
          implies the coordination of
          hundreds of individuals over many

in deeply.

Edgar turns back to Graham.

Edgar stares at Graham.

</b>          And three weeks.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI

          thing these children need to do, is
          worry about some crazy things
          happening in the world.  Take them
          into town.  Get their minds -- your
          mind, on everyday things.  It's

The Pharmacist looks back at Graham and then reaches up and
TURNS OFF THE RADIO.  She quietly finds the prescription on
the shelf and moves to the counter across from Graham.

She doesn't ring it up.  She just stands there fiddling with
the bag holding Morgan's medicine.  Beat.

<b>                    PHARMACIST
</b>          Can I ask you a favor Father?

Graham stares at the girl.  Beat.  He nods "yes."

<b>                    PHARMACIST
</b>          Can I take confession with you?

Beat.  Graham leans forward on the counter and takes the
girl's hands in his.  He talks very slowly.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Tracey, I -- am -- not -- a --
          reverend -- anymore.  I haven't
          been for six months.  You know
          this.

Beat.  When Tracey speaks her VOICE IS A BIT SHAKY.

<b>                    TRACEY

          Please.  I need to take confession

Graham looks at the young girl's teary eyes.  He exhales
slowly.

<b>INT.  ARMY RECRUITING OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Army
uniform standing at attention on a beach.

We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER.  Inside the small
storefront space is a desk.  A gentleman sporting a CREWCUT
sits behind it.

A young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table filling
out some forms.

<b>                    CREWCUT GUY
</b>          I got it figured.

Merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          You do?

<b>                    CREWCUT GUY
</b>          I've had two separate folks tell me
          they think there are strangers
          around these parts the last couple
          of nights.  Can't tell what they
          look like, cause they're staying in
          the shadows -- covert like.  No
          one's got hurt mind you... And
          that's the give away.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>              (doesn't see)
          I see.

<b>                    CREWCUT GUY
</b>          It's called probing.  It's a
          military procedure.  You send a
          reconnaissance group, very small,
          to check out things.  Not to
          engage, but to evaluate the
          situation.  Evaluate the level of
          danger.  Make sure things are all
          clear...

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Clear for what?

The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence.

<b>                    CREWCUT GUY
</b>          ... For the rest of them.

It takes a second, but Merrill smiles.  The crewcut guy
smiles back.  Merrill points at a poster.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          You have a pamphlet or something I
          can read?

The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures.  Picks the
top brochure and hands it to Merrill.

The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely.

<b>                    CREWCUT GUY
</b>          Hey you didn't used to play
          baseball did you?

Merrill looks up from the brochure.  Beat.

<b>                    CREWCUT GUY
</b>          Shit.  I know you.  You're Merrill
          Hess.  I was there that day you hit
          that five hundred and eighty seven
          footer over the left field wall and
          set the record.  That thing had a
          motor on it... It's still the

Merrill not, "yes."

<b>                    MERRILL

<b>                    CREWCUT GUY

          records don't you?

Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Five.  The five longest.

<b>                    CREWCUT GUY
</b>          Boy, why aren't you in the pros
          making stacks of cash and getting
          handfuls of T and A?

<b>                    YOUNG MAN (O.S.)
</b>          Cause he also has the minor league
          strike out record.

Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at
the folding table.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Hello Lionel.

LIONEL smirks.

<b>                    LIONEL
</b>          He'd just swing as hard as he could
          every time.  It didn't matter what
          the coach said, didn't matter who
          was on base, he'd whip that bat
          through the air as hard as he
          could... Looked like a lumber jack
          chopping down a tree.
              (beat)
          Merrill here, struck out more times
          than any two players.

Beat.

<b>                    CREWCUT GUY
</b>          You really hold the strike out
          record?

Beat.  Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket.  Looks like
he's not going to say anything.  When he does, the words are
soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Felt wrong not to swing.

Beat.  The crewcut guy shakes his head.  Merrill turns and
starts walking.

As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in
Lionel's direction, like he might hit him.  Lionel flinches
and covers his face.

Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office.

Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the

</b>          Your water is fine.  Bo has a thing

Mrs. Nathan stares at the four-year old.

Everyone turns to the front of the store where Mr. Nathan

Beat.  Everyone nods, "yes."

Graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on. 
Merrill watches as Graham's hand goes to put the car in
reverse -- and then stops.

Graham is staring out the windshield.  Merrill follows his
stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a LEATHER JACKET
coming out of a store.  Merrill's face changes expression
too.  They both stare as the man passes in front of the car.

Everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as
he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck.  It's here that
he notices the stares.  He glances up to see the faces
watching him from the station wagon.

The leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck.  He gets
in, turns it on, and without looking over to the station
wagon, backs out of the parking lot.

Beat.  The Hess family sits quietly.

Graham pulls the handle.  His door opens.  He waits before
getting out.  The other three station wagon doors open right
after.

Graham doesn't move his arm.  He keeps it out in the air
where he had it as he closed his door.  Graham looks to
Merrill over the roof of the station wagon.

<b>                    GRAHAM

Morgan is the first one to move.

<b>                    MORGAN

He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper
where he begins to climb onto the station wagon.

<b>                    MORGAN

Morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so
gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.

</b>          Morgan, be careful.

<b>                    MERRILL

Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof. 
Merrill keeps a hand on his nephew.  Morgan raises the
monitor above his head.

<b>THE RED LIGHTS ON THE BABY MONITOR ALL TURN ON.

<b>THE SWIRLING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE MONITOR BECOMES

Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood.

Graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood.  He takes
hold of Bo.  All four are on the car now.

Morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon.  Merrill
holds him by the waist.

Bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and
the windshield.  Graham boosts her up over his head with both
hands.

<b>                    GRAHAM

Merrill reaches out his free hand.  Bo reaches out to him.

Everyone STOPS exactly where they are.  Graham holds Bo over
his head.  Bo reaches out to Merrill.  Merrill sits on the
roof with one arm out.  Morgan stands with the baby monitor
raised high in the air.  The Hess family remains very still
on the hood of their station wagon as they listen.

</b>
Graham struggles to hold Bo up.  Bo struggles to keep her
arms out.  Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the
incredible SOUNDS ABOVE HIS HEAD.

<b>THE TONES ESCALATE IN VOLUME.

Morgan's eyes widen as THE SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS BECOMES SHORTER

</b>          You know something?  Even
          entertaining the possibility of
          this for a minute has been
          exciting.

Beat.  Graham starts to move.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I can see how people can get
          carried away with this type of
          thing.

Graham reaches the barbecue area.  There's a flashlight on
the picnic table.  Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.  A NARROW
<b>BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.
</b>
Graham starts toward the crops.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          It's a kind of faith.  It's an
          intoxicating thing to believe in
          something you can't see.

<b>THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE
</b>BACKYARD.  Graham steps right up to them.  He hesitates and
then steps into the field of

<b>CORN CROPS.
</b>
We can't see two feet in any direction.  Six foot stalks of
corn line Graham on all sides.  THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A
<b>WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          You were always good at that...

THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.  Graham
starts following it.  His shoulders brush crops on either
side.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Believing in things you couldn't
          see.
              (beat)
          You would have been the first
          person on that station wagon
          wouldn't you?  You and Morgan would
          have been wrestling for that baby
          monitor.

<b>SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.
</b>
Graham stops.  HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.  Nothing
but crops disappearing into darkness.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          It'll be secretly kind of sad for
          everybody, when this turns out to
          be -- all just make believe.

THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Graham spins and aims
the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.  THE LIGHT ONLY
<b>PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (yelling)
          You're wasting your time here!  I'm
          not going to report this or
          anything you do to me crops, to the
          news or TV or anybody!  You're not
          going to get famous!

Beat.  There is no response.  GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN
<b>BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF
</b><b>HIM.
</b>
Beat.  Graham holds his breath.  THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE
<b>BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.
</b>
Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.  THE
<b>BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.
</b>
<b>GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.  HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE
</b><b>BREATHING.  BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.  HIS OWN BREATHING IS
</b><b>FAST AND LOUD NOW.
</b>
Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.  His hands
search over the ground in all directions.  They finally touch
the flashlight.  Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the
"on" button.  He does.

<b>A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.  SOMETHING POWDERY
</b><b>WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.
</b>
It instantly moves into the darkness.  Graham tries to get
up.  He stumbles backwards into the crops.  He's tangled in
crops as he struggles to rise.  He gets up and starts
running.

Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions.  He panics. 
He doesn't know where he is.  THERE IS SOMETHING COMING
<b>BEHIND HIM.
</b>
Graham makes a sudden right turn.  He puts his hands in front
of him to protect his face and eyes.  He's running as fast as
he can.  HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.

Another sudden turn, this time left.  Graham emerges into his

<b>BACKYARD.
</b>
Graham keeps running across the yard.  ISABELLE BARKS
<b>FRANTICALLY.
</b>
When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.

There is no one behind him.  The wall of crops fifty feet
away sway in the gentle night breeze.

Graham gains control of his breathing.  He turns and walks to
the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.

<b>INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING
</b>
Graham steps into the kitchen.  His hair is messed.  His
shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it.  He
locks the back door.

The children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing
each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes.

Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room. 
He sees Merrill there.

Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN
BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't
notice him either.

Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes
a seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs
one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and
thinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows
his mind.  Beat.

Merrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the
baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the
children at the sink, he turns off the faucet.

The children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They
follow his stare to the kitchen table.

Beat.  Graham looks up at them.

</b>
<b>ANOTHER SET OF LIGHTS DOT THE SKY ABOVE THE CITY.  THEY ARE

</b>
Bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hovering
lights.

<b>                    BO
</b>          Fourteen.

Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before the
television set.

<b>                    TV ANCHOR

          U.S. officials have confirmed that
          these are not air crafts from
          either government's airforce.  The
          first sighting was made by an Air
          Mexico 747 en route from Mazatlan
          to New York as the unidentified
          crafts entered Mexico City air
          space.  They were not detected by
          radar by either country.

Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          The crazies were right.

Beat.  Everyone just watches the fourteen lights hovering on
the screen.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          We have to tape this...

Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the
television stand.  He grabs one.

Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR.

<b>                    BO
</b>          My ballet recital.

Morgan stares at his sister.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>              (gravely serious)
          Listen Bo.  This is very important.

Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (preoccupied)
          Find another tape.

Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa. 
They both have the same dazed, slow movements.

Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically.  He
finds one and reaches for the VCR.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Uncle Merrill, I'm using your tape.

Morgan slams the tape marked "Bay Watch" into the VCR and
presses record.  He's breathing heavy now.  Wheezing
actually.

Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his
father and his uncle.  Bo walks over and squeezes in also. 
The four of them stare at the television.

<b>INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MIDNIGHT
</b>
The family room lights are off now.  The TV is still on.  The
SOUND IS MUTED.  There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on
the television now.

The fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen.  Morgan
is asleep on Graham's lap.  Bo is asleep on Merrill's
shoulder.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>              (whispers)
          Some people are probably thinking
          this is the end of the world.

Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (whispers)
          That's true.

          Sure, there are a lot of people
          watching this who think this could
          be a bad thing.  But there are a
          lot of people watching this, who
          think it's a miracle.  A sign of
          God's existence.  It's all in how
          you look at things Merrill.
              (beat)
          What you have to decide is what
          kind of person you are?  Are you
          the type who believes in miracles
          and looks for signs or are you the
          kind who believes, things just
          happen by chance?

Beat.  Merrill is deep in thought.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          I was at this party once.  I'm on a
          couch with Sara Mckinney.  She was
          just sitting there, looking
          beautiful and staring at me.  I go
          to lean in and kiss her and I
          realize I have gum in my mouth.  I
          turn and take out the gum.  Stuff
          it in my paper cup next to the sofa
          and turn around.  Sara Mckinney
          throws up all over herself.
              (beat)
          I knew the second it happened.  It
          was a miracle.  I could have been
          kissing her when she threw up. 
          That would have scarred me for
          life.  I may never have recovered.

Merrill looks at the TV screen.  Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          I'm a miracle man.  Those lights
          are a miracle.

Graham smiles.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (whispers)
          There you go.

Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>              (whispers)

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (whispers)
          What does it matter then?

The two of them turn back to the silent screen of the
television.  It's a long beat before Graham speaks.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (whispers)

Beat.  Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (whispers)
          She said, "See", and then her eyes
          glazed a bit and she said... "Tell
          Merrill to swing away."

Merrill's mouth opens a bit.  Graham turns and chuckles at
his expression.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (whispers)
          Do you know why she said that?

Merrill nods, "No."

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (whispers)
          Because the nerve endings in her
          brain were firing as she died, and
          some random memory of us at one of
          your baseball games popped into her
          head.
              (beat)
          There is no one watching out for us
          Merrill.  We're all on our own.

<b>INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY
</b>
Graham's eyes open.  DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room.  He is
alone on the couch.  Alone in the room.

He looks to the television.  It's not there.

Graham moves to his feet and look around the room.  His eyes
stop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the
family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door.

Graham moves to the door.  WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES. 
Graham opens the

<b>CLOSET.
</b>
Merrill looks up.  He's seated on a kitchen chair with the
television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          For the kids protection.  All they
          were doing was watching TV from
          five a.m.  I felt like they were
          getting obsessed like you said. 
          They should be playing furry, furry
          rabbit or tea party or something
          right?

              (beat)
          Anyway...
              (points at the TV)
          There's been some interesting
          developments.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          What time is it?

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Eleven a.m.  They're gone.

Beat.  Graham looks at the TV screen.  There's a daylight
shot of Mexico City.  The skies are empty above it.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          But they're not really gone.  We
          just can't see them.  Early this
          morning a bird flew right at the
          area where the lights were hovering
          last night.

Merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          It stopped dead in the air and fell
          straight down.

Merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          They caught it on tape and they've
          been playing it all morning.  They
          found the bird.  His head crushed
          in.  When you see the footage it
          looks like the bird flew into a
          wall in the sky.
              (beat)
          They think they have some invisible
          shield thing going, like an optical
          illusion.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          The bird could have had a heart
          attack and crushed his head when he
          fell.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Already thought of.  Two other
          birds did the same thing an hour
          later.  Not as dramatic.  They
          lived.  But you could see they hit
          something.

Graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different
eyes.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          They're still there hovering.  In
          fact, some people think there's
          more of them now.  All over the
          place.  Over us even.
              (beat)
          And there's a theory about the crop
          circles now.  They think it could
          be some kind of landmark, visual
          mapping system -- so they can
          navigate.  Coordinate.  Makes sense
          doesn't it?

We are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door,
which is closed.  The same sun-faded outline of where a large
cross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door.

Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair. 
He towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window.

<b>WE LOOK OUT THE SAME WINDOW WE LOOKED OUT AT THE VERY
</b><b>BEGINNING.
</b>
The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym.  A
single tree throws shade onto a picnic table.  The back of
the yard is lined by corn crops.  Golden and brown.  Six feet
high.

The crops go on well beyond our view.  Graham stares at them
quietly.  Watching.

Beat.  THE SOUND OF WHISPERING DRAWS HIS ATTENTION FROM THE

He listens closely.  HIS CHILDREN ARE WHISPERING IN THE NEXT

Graham walks into the hall and looks in their room.

Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed.  They have
TIN FOIL wrapped around their heads like a helmet.  Graham
stares at his children.

<b>                    MORGAN

Morgan holds up the book he bought from Nathan's bookstore.

Graham enters the room.  The children make space for him on
the bed.  He takes a seat between them.  Morgan puts the book
on his father's lap.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          It says they're probably very small
          -- like my height -- because, as
          their brains developed, there was
          no use for physical development. 
          It says they're probably
          vegetarians, because they would
          have realized the benefits of such
          a diet.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Who wrote this book?

Graham looks on the back cover for a picture.  There's none
there.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Scientists who have been persecuted
          for their beliefs.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          That means they're unemployed.

Morgan closes the book.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Dad, are you going to be serious?

Bo points at the book.

<b>                    BO
</b>          Yeah, serious.

Graham looks at his two children with foil on their heads.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I don't know what got into me.

Beat.  Morgan puts the book on his father's lap.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          There are pictures.

Beat.  Morgan opens the tome.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of
          the book --

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Bimboo?

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Dad.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I just asked his name.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          You had a tone.

Beat.  Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a
tone.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          He says there are two reasons why
          Extraterrestrials would visit us.

Morgan turns the page.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          To make contact in the spirit of
          exploration and furthering the
          knowledge of the universe.

Graham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed
figure shaking hands with a bearded human.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Or the other reason... They're
          hostile.  They've used up the
          resources on their planet and are
          looking to harvest our planet next.

Morgan turns the page.  There is a picture of a house.  A
space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at
it.  Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Looks a little like our house
          doesn't it?

Morgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture.  Beat.

<b>                    BO
</b>          The same windows.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>              (soft)
          That's weird.

The three of them study the picture of the house.  It's on
fire.  Their eyes move to the front yard.  There are three
bodies lying dead on the front lawn.  Two are children.

<b>THE PHONE RINGS.
</b>
The children SCREAM and cling to their father.  THEIR SCREAMS
DIE DOWN.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Graham gets up.  He closes
the book.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          That's enough from Dr. Bimboo for
          now.  Everybody in this house needs
          to calm down and eat some fruit or
          something.

Graham steps out into the hallway.  He tucks the book under
his arm and picks up the phone.

<b>                    PHONE VOICE
</b>          Father.

<b>THROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL
</b>AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Hello?

NOTHING BUT DEAD AIR.  Graham looks at the receiver and then
slowly hangs it up.

Graham walks down the hall to a small window.

The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road. 
Graham stares into the distance.  About a half-mile away we
see the TIP OF A HOUSE.  Graham gazes at it for a beat.

Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on.  He moves
to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it.

Merrill looks up from the television.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I'm going out for a few minutes. 
          No one leaves this house.  No one.

Merrill nods.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Where are you going?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Ray Reddy's house.

Graham starts down the hall.  Merrill steps out of the closet
for the first time.  He looks down the hall shocked.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Why?

Graham unlocks the front door.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I think he just called here.

Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope that is set up
on the window seat in his room.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Why, you got one of your feeling
          again?

Bo nods, "Yes."

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Is it bad?

Bo nods, "Yes" slowly.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          If it does, I won't let anything
          bad happen to you.

Bo hugs Morgan tight.

Bo keeps hugging Morgan.

</b>          Who said I was going to die?

Beat.  Morgan peels Bo's arms off of him.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Come on Bo.  I need to keep a look
          out.

Bo lets go.  Morgan puts his eye to the eyepiece of the

<b>EXT.  REDDY HOUSE - DAY
</b>
A mailbox reads "R. Reddy."

There is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter
mile driveway.  We saw the roof of this house from the Hess
hallway window.

Graham stands at the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL AGAIN.

Beat.  Graham tries to look inside.  Curtains block his view.

Graham walks around the porch.  Turns the corner of the
house.  He looks in a side window.

<b>THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW IS OF A KITCHEN.  THE KITCHEN
</b><b>CHAIRS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.  THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF, IS
</b><b>UPSIDE DOWN, LEANING AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR.  THE ROOM IS
</b><b>TOTALLY WRECKED.
</b>
Graham stands straight up.  He looks around nervously.  He
takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the
safety of his station wagon before he notices the GREEN TRUCK
parked to the side of the house.

There is someone sitting in it.

<b>EXT.  REDDY DRIVEWAY - DAY
</b>
The passenger side window of the truck is open.  Graham steps
up to it and looks inside.  The thin man with the leather
jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel.  He stares out
the windshield.  He is covered in sweat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Hello Ray.

RAY REDDY doesn't look over.  Doesn't react.  Keeps staring.

Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles
a yellow white.

Graham glances to the backseat of the truck.  There are two
large bags over flowing with clothes.

Graham's eyes gently move back to Ray and drift down to the
TWO BLOOD STAINED AREA ON HIS SHIRT.  Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          What happened Ray?

Beat.  Ray doesn't look over when he speaks.

<b>                    RAY
</b>          I wrote your number down to call
          you.  It's been sitting next to the
          phone for six months.  When I knew
          it was inside the house, I couldn't
          think of any other number to call. 
          I panicked.
              (beat)
          Thank you for coming Father.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (soft)
          You're welcome Ray.

Tears start falling down Ray's face.

<b>                    RAY
</b>          I worked so long that night.  I
          ain't never fallen asleep driving
          before.  And never since.  Most of
          the ride home, there wasn't a car
          insight in either direction.  If
          I'd fallen asleep then, I'd a ended
          up in a ditch with a head ache.  It
          had to happen at that right moment. 
          That certain ten-fifteen seconds
          when I passed her walking.  It was
          like it was meant to be.

Ray finally turns.  His red face quivers as he talks.

<b>                    RAY
</b>          I guess if this is the end of the
          world, I'm screwed right?  People
          who kill Reverends' wives aren't
          exactly ushered to the front of the
          line in heaven.

Ray starts the car.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Where you going Ray?

<b>                    RAY
</b>          To the lake.  The way I see it, all
          the places marked in the crops and
          such -- none of them are really
          near water.  I figure they don't
          like water.
              (beat)
          Can't be any worse than here.

Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Ray, did you see one of them?

Ray looks at Graham.

<b>                    RAY
</b>          I'm truly sorry for what I've done
          to you and yours.

The two men stare at each other for a beat.  Ray looks away. 
He puts the car in drive.

<b>                    RAY
</b>          And don't open my pantry Father.  I
          locked one of them in there.

Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down
the driveway.

Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats. 
His eyes are closed.

<b>                    TV ANCHOR
</b>          ... The startling footage we're
          about to show you was photographed
          by a forty-two year old Romero
          Valadares.

Merrill's eyes open.

<b>                    TV ANCHOR
</b>          This video was taken yesterday
          afternoon at his son's seventh
          birthday, in the city of Passo
          Fundo, Brazil.  It was sent to the
          local news bureau there and
          satellited to us a few minutes ago. 
          All initial opinions are; this is
          genuine.

<b>THE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED.
</b>
<b>                    TV ANCHOR
</b>          What you are about to see, may
          disturb you.

Merrill sits up in his chair.

<b>THE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO
</b><b>IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE
</b><b>A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING
</b><b>GLASS WINDOW.

<b>THE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY.  THEY LOOK AT
</b><b>THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS.

<b>THE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT

</b>
<b>THE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL

The chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a
little towards the television screen.

<b>WE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE.  THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE
</b><b>GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME.  WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL
</b><b>TO THE KITCHEN.  A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE

</b><b>HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE.

<b>THE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING

<b>                    MERRILL

<b>THE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH

<b>WE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.  WE SEE A NARROW
</b><b>ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A

</b><b>DENSE FOLIAGE.  THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE
</b><b>BUILDING.

<b>WE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN

<b>THE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON-

<b>THE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES.  BEAT.  WE SEE IT

<b>INT.  KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
The door swings open slowly.  Graham steps into Ray Reddy's
kitchen.

Cabinets are open.  Dishes are broken.  Chairs are turned
over.  The faucet is running full blast.

Graham's eyes move across the room.  The kitchen table is
upside down and leaned up against the pantry door.

<b>THE SOUND OF A GLASS JAR BREAKING ON THE GROUND CAN BE HEARD
</b><b>INSIDE THE PANTRY.
</b>
Graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the
kitchen.

He leans a little bit and listens.  From behind the pantry
door WE HEAR THE SOUND OF BREATHING.  THERE ARE QUIET
<b>MOVEMENT SOUNDS.  THE SOFT SOUND OF GLASS BEING CRUSHED AS
</b><b>IT'S BEING WALKED ON.
</b>
Graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the
leaning table.  Graham stands up straight and thinks it over. 
Beat.

Graham takes two small steps closer.

When he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry
door.  THERE IS LIGHT LEAKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.  THERE IS
<b>SHADOW BEING THROWN FROM INSIDE THE PANTRY.  THE SHADOW MOVES
</b><b>BACK AND FORTH UNDER THE DOOR.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Hello.

<b>THE SHADOW STOPS MOVING.

          them... I am a police officer.
              (beat)
          I just want to talk to you.

SILENCE.  There is no movement from the pantry.  Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (loud)
          We know all about the hoax.  We
          already took some of your friends
          downtown in the paddy wagon.
              (mouths to himself)
          Paddy wagon?

<b>THE ONLY SOUND IN THE KITCHEN IS THE SOUND OF THE FAUCET
</b>RUNNING.  Graham waits for a reply, but none comes.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          If you tell us your name and why
          you did it, we'll give you the same
          deal we gave the others.  Don't
          throw away your life son.

Beat.

Graham bends down where he stands.  He puts his head near the
wood floor.  He tries to look under the door.  All he can see
are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the
pantry.  He's at too severe an angle.

Graham sits up.  He's only four feet away from the pantry
door.  He looks around not knowing what to do.  His eyes fall
on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer
onto the floor.

He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to
the door.  Beat.  He reaches with the butcher knife
underneath the slanted kitchen table.  He uses the knife like
a mirror to see under the door.  Graham watches the SOFT
<b>REFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE. 
</b><b>WE CAN MAKE OUT BROKEN GLASS AND RIPPED OPEN PACKETS OF RICE
</b><b>AND CEREAL ON THE GROUND.  THERE ARE POCKETS OF SHADOWS WE
</b><b>CAN'T SEE INTO.
</b>
Graham pulls the knife out.  He sits there kneeling two feet
from the door.  Beat.

He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the
slanted table.

He stops halfway down.  He loses his nerve and sits up.  He
rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the
counter.  Graham starts walking across the kitchen.  He gets
to the door.  Puts his hand on the doorknob.

He stays like that for a long time.  Beat.

Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly
across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He
kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the
slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor,
only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the
pantry.

There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of
the pantry.  Nothing else.

Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR.  Something's wrong. 
Parts of it feel like a painting.  THE PAINTING MOVES.

<b>TWO BLACK EYES OPEN -- SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF

<b>GRAHAM YELLS.  HE JOLTS UP.  HIS HEAD HITS THE SLANTED TABLE

The station wagon knocks over the "Ray Reddy" mailbox as it
turns sharply onto the road.

Graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his
right.

<b>THE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES.
</b>
Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon
comes to a fast stop.

Beat.  Graham gets out of the car.  He walks a few feet ahead
of the station wagon.  He bends down in the middle of the
road.

A BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.  Its head is crushed.

Graham gazes at the still pile of feathers.  Beat.

Graham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY
above him.

<b>INT.  HESS FAMILY ROOM - DAY
</b>
Graham enters his front hall.  He closes the door and locks
it behind him.  He turns and looks into the family room.

Morgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa. 
All three are wearing foil helmets.  Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          They're skin changes color.  That's
          why we couldn't see him that night.

Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch.  Beat. 
Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs.  He takes
a seat on the second to last step.

He sits obscured by the balusters.  Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Tell me something Morgan.  In that
          book of your, did they happen to
          detail what would happen if they
          were hostile?

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Yes.  They would invade us using
          only ground tactics.  Hand to hand
          combat.  They wouldn't use their
          technology or fight an airborne

          would eventually use nuclear
          weapons and the planet would be
          useless to them.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Did they say what our chances would
          be if they did invade?

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          They said one of two things could
          happen.  One, they fight and are
          defeated and leave to return again
          with full forces hundreds or even
          thousands of years later.

</b>          What's two?

<b>                    MORGAN

The words hang in the air.  Graham sits quietly on the second
step of the stairs.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          What do you think about the idea
          that they don't like places near

          them near a lake or something?

<b>                    MORGAN

Beat.

          Or we can stay here.  Board up this

and sit in silence.

<b>EXT.  HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</b>
WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham
inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room
after another.

WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is
not pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at
us.  She is shivering.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill
carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs. 
He's moving into the main house.

Merrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around
carefully as he moves.

Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses
the lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the
fallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs
encased in glass cases.

The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has
cracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it.

We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of
clothes and things on the grass.  He looks around and finds
what he's looking for.  A rake.

Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle. 
With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball
in the other, he turns to face the crops.

<b>WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.  PART OF OUR VIEW IS
</b><b>OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.
</b>
Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a
batter's stance.  His left leg digs into the grass in front
of him.  His weight is mostly on his back leg.  He looks out
into the distance high over the crops.  He throws the
baseball up in the air...

Merrill grabs the wooden handle.  Merrill's shoulders move
with blinding speed.  The wooden rake handle slices the air. 
And misses the ball.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.  This
time his shoulders move even faster.  The wooden stick
actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up
and tries a third time.  This time he YELLS as he swings.  He
rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the
eye.

The baseball drops at his feet.  Strike three.

Merrill stands still in the yard.  He's breathing a little
heavy as he stares down at the ball.

He gently picks it up.  He walks back to his pile of things
and then suddenly turns.  He throws the ball in the air as he
does.  His left leg goes out.  His weight goes to his right
leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and
power...

<b>THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS
</b><b>ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.
</b>
The ball rockets into the air.  We watch it fly overhead...
sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.

After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.  It
lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.  It
cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.  Maybe
more.

WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.  He drops
the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.  He
piles them in his arms.  When his arms are full, he starts
for the porch.  WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOES
<b>INSIDE THE HOUSE.

They appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the
closet.  Graham and Merrill are holding hammers.

All four stare at the television.

<b>ON THE SCREEN IS A STREET FILLED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING WITH

          four cities.  That total could be
          as high as four hundred within the

Beat.

</b>          They think these look like stages
          immediately proceeding an attack
          maneuver.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          It's like War of the Worlds.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          They think it might happen all at
          once.

The words silence everyone.  Beat.

The image goes back to a quiet TV anchor.  He takes a second
before starting up again.

<b>                    TV ANCHOR
</b>          Hundreds of thousands have flocked
          to synagogues, churches and
          temples.

The television shows hundreds of Israelis in a temple and in
the streets praying.

Graham watches quietly as the masses pray side by side.

Bo watches as Graham leaves the doorway of the closet.  She
turns back to the television.

Beat.  Merrill leans down between his niece and nephew.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>              (whispers)

They don't answer.  They watch the soldiers loading up onto
trucks on the television.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Some guy had a sign that said it
          was the end of the world.

          happen, is it Uncle Merrill?

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Don't worry.

Morgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          You sure right?

Beat.  Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces.  He looks
back at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood.  He
turns back to the children.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          You know about signs Morgan?  Not
          like the ones people write on. 
          It's like if you poured a glass of
          milk and you dropped the glass by
          mistake and broke it before you
          could drink it.  Then you looked at
          the milk carton and saw that the
          milk was spoiled.  They're things
          that happen by chance or luck, but
          make you feel that someone's
          watching out for you.

The children think it over.  Beat.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          I once had a bad dream and I
          couldn't wake up.  I kicked at the
          table next to my bed and something
          fell on me and I woke up.  It was a
          picture of mom.  She was smiling. 
          It made me feel safe... You mean
          like that?

Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Yeah, like that.
              (beat)
          I believe in signs Morgan.  I think
          there's someone watching out for
          us.  I got to believe he's going to

          end.

He stands in the hall by himself.  He takes a couple deep

Graham, Bo and Morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway. 
There's a couple boards left leaning against the walls.

Merrill comes out of the children's room with his tools.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Too many windows in the bedrooms. 
          We don't have enough boards.

Merrill stands and leans against the wall.

<b>                    GRAHAM

<b>                    GRAHAM

Merrill glances at Graham.

elegantly on serving dishes.

The Hess family sits around the table.  Beat.  The scene is

Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway. 
Graham watches as both his children cry at the table.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Fine, if you all don't want to eat,
          then I'm going to have some of
          everything.

Graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his
plate.  He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it
in his mouth.  He swallows.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          This tastes so great.

Bo, Morgan and Merrill watch in stunned silence as Graham
stuffs more in his mouth.  He chews and chews and swallows
hard.  He digs his fork into the pile again.

Graham starts crying as he eats.  He keeps taking more bites. 
More tears fall.

Morgan gets up from his seat.  He goes to Graham's chair.  He
leans against his dad's arm and cries with him.  Graham's
fork stops moving.  He watches as Bo moves from her seat to
his other side.  She holds her dad's arm and cries.

Beat.  Graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and
hugs them tight.  Merrill leans forward and comes to the pile
on Graham's chair.  Merrill buries his head in Graham's
shoulder.  The Hess family huddles together at one end of the
table.  Beat.

<b>THE BABY MONITOR EXPLODES WITH STATIC AND NOISE.
</b>
Everyone slowly turns and looks over to Morgan's place
setting where the baby monitor sits on the table.  THE RED
<b>LIGHTS ON THE FRONT ARE ALL LIT UP.

Merrill sits up.  Graham puts down the children from his lap. 
He gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out
of the dinning room.  He moves through the family room and
into the hall.

Graham opens the closet door and looks in at the television. 
He turns it ON.

Beat.  THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYMBOL IS ON THE SCREEN.  A
LOW TONE EMITS FROM THE TV.  Beat.  Graham changes stations. 
<b>THE SYMBOL AND TONE APPEAR ON EVERY CHANNEL.  THE MONOTONE

Graham steps out into the hall.  Merrill and the two children
are standing there waiting.  Graham looks at them.

Graham walks to the window next to his bed.  It's the same
one we've looked out twice before.

Graham looks out onto his backyard.  The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE
HOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD.  There is a light
breeze.  Nothing seems wrong.

Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on
into darkness.  He moves closer to the glass.  Watches the
top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind.

<b>SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS.
</b>
Graham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black
forty feet away.  Graham goes very still.

<b>LINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE

Graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his
bedroom.

Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts
hammering nails into the frame.  Graham picks up his hammer
and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood.

Graham glances to his right as he works.  Bo and Morgan are
standing together at the top of the stairs.  Bo holds
Morgan's hand.

Graham keeps hammering as he speaks.

<b>                    GRAHAM

          said when you were born, Bo?

Bo nods "no" lightly.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          You came out of your momma and you
          didn't even cry.  You just opened
          your eyes and looked around at
          everybody.  Your eyes were so big
          and gorgeous, the ladies in the
          room gasped.

Graham stops hammering.  Merrill keeps going.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          They literally gasped.
              (Graham gasps like them)
          Then they go, "She's like an
          angel."  They said, "We've never
          seen a baby so beautiful."

Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment.  Merrill
finishes hammering.

Graham goes over and picks up Bo.

<b>                    GRAHAM

Graham looks at his daughter quietly.  He brushes the hair
out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up.

</b>              (whispers)
          Should we turn off the lights?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (soft)
          They already know we're here.

<b>THE FIRST SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT ARE HEARD OUTSIDE.  CREAKS OF
</b><b>WOOD FROM THE FRONT PORCH CAN BE HEARD.
</b>
<b>THERE IS SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT FROM BEHIND THE LOCKED BACK DOOR.
</b>
<b>SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.  SOUNDS
</b><b>FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.
</b>
<b>THERE IS SCRATCHING NOISES AGAINST THE FRONT DOOR.  METAL
</b><b>NOISES AS THE HANDLE IS TRIED.
</b>
<b>                    MORGAN
</b>              (almost inaudible)
          Dad --

<b>THE DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Do you know what happened when you
          were born Morgan?

Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          You came out and your momma kept
          bleeding.  The doctors rushed you
          out of the room before I could even
          see you.

<b>THERE ARE THUDS ABOVE THEM.
</b>
All four look up.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          They're on the roof.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          While they were trying to fix her
          up, all she kept asking about was
          you.

<b>THEY LISTEN AS THE THUDS INCREASE IN NUMBER.
</b>
<b>THE FIRST SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS IS HEARD FROM UPSTAIRS.
</b>
Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          They're in the house.

Graham takes Morgan's hand.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I wanted your momma to see you
          first.  She had dreamed about you
          her whole life.
              (beat)
          They waited till she felt better,
          then they brought you in.  They
          placed you right in her arms.  And
          she looked at you.  And you looked
          at her.  You just stared at each
          other for the longest time and then
          she said real soft, "Hello Morgan,
          I'm you momma, you look just like I
          dreamed."

Graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back.

<b>SCRATCHING NOISES BEGIN TO COME FROM UPSTAIRS.
</b>
The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs. 
The BEDROOM DOOR HANDLES ARE BEING RATTLED.

Merrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the
ceiling of the upstairs hallway.  He stares at a rectangle in
the ceiling.  A tiny rope hangs from the rectangle.  Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          The attic door.

Merrill sprints up the stairs.

Morgan and Bo watch as Graham follows after Merrill.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING
</b>
Graham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling.  There is
movement right above them.  Dust falls from a ceiling light
right next to them.

The rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them. 
They watch as it begins to twitch and sway.

The springs in the trap door begins to GROAN.  The door
starts to fall open.

Merrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and
reach up.  The door opens a few inches.  Merrill is taller. 
The door presses against his fingers first.  It gives a few
more inches before Merrill stops it.

Graham's finger are barely touching it.  Merrill's face turns
red with strain as something pushes down on the door.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          This is a very temporary solution.

Graham brings his arms down.  He sees his children watching
from the bottom of the stairs.  Graham looks around where he
is.  There is a very small table with photos against a wall. 
A laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors...
nothing else.  Graham turns to Merrill.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          How temporary?

Merrill's face is a deep crimson.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Twenty-two seconds.

Graham looks around again... the same things... the same
table... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the
closet.  It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed
on a guide rail.  The wooden folding door is very tall.  Its
top is one foot from the ceiling.

Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts
rocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of
its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight...
The thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still
attached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches
into the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to
Merrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a
few inches lower than Merrill's reach.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Let go.

Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It
connects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The
trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of
the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to
the attic.

Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds
the weight of the attic door.

After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as
the pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat.

It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet
door with a THUD.

The attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force. 
<b>THUD.
</b>
The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges
keeping it upright.

Graham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING
</b>
<b>THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE.
</b>
Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach
under the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO
<b>THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON
</b><b>THE DOOR.
</b>
<b>THUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR
</b><b>UPSTAIRS.
</b>
Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes
Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the
hall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the
stairs.

<b>ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE.
</b>
<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING
</b>
The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he
enters the kitchen.

Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and
waits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the
table against the swinging door.

They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and
jam the rest underneath the table.

Graham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at
the pile of furniture.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          This is going to do nothing.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          We have to go in the basement.

Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a
darkened door at the bottom.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          There's no way out of there.

Beat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Did I ever tell you, I dislocated
          Uncle Merrill's arm?

<b>THUD.
</b>
<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Should we make a run for it out the
          back?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          They're right behind the door.

Merrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to
Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          He was only a year and half old.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>              (to Graham)
          What are you doing?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          He was trying to eat a second
          chocolate bar.  Your grandma said,
          "No."  He tried to take a bite, so
          I grabbed it.

THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and
stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I must have pulled his arm at an
          awkward angle.  His elbow popped
          right out of the socket.

<b>THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE
</b><b>CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS
</b><b>HALL.
</b>
<b>WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          He didn't scream or anything.  His
          arm just flopped to his side and he
          got real still.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          They're coming.

Graham moves towards the basement stairs.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I held him in my lap in the back
          seat as we drove to the hospital. 
          I couldn't stop crying... We need
          to go into the basement now.

Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs.  Morgan
and Bo move to their father slowly.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          You know what your Uncle Merrill
          did right after the doctor put his
          arm back in place?  He jumped off
          the table and gave me a hug.  He
          had already forgotten that I was
          the one who hurt him.

Graham ushers the two children down the stairs.  He waits for
Merrill.  Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks
toward him.  Merrill stops and looks down the stairs.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          We won't be able to get out of
          there.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I'm sorry I hurt your arm.

Beat.  Merrill's eyes fill with water.  He doesn't look up at
his older brother.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          I know.

Merrill walks down the stairs.  Graham waits at the top.  He
watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against
it.  Beat.

<b>THERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL.
</b>
The door starts to force its way open.  THE TABLE AND CHAIRS
<b>BEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A
</b><b>CHALK BOARD.
</b>
<b>WE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN.  SOUNDS MADE
</b><b>FROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES.
</b>
<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  BASEMENT - EVENING
</b>
Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          We forgot our foil helmets!

Graham closes the door behind him.  It has no lock.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          We need something to wedge against
          the doorknob.

The basement is lined with metal shelves.  The shelves are
cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords,
cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools.  Merrill
rummages through the shelves frantically.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          They'll read our minds!

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          You're scaring your sister.

<b>                    BO
</b>          I'm already scared.

Graham puts his ear to the door and listens.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Merrill --

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          I'm looking!

Merrill moves to another set of shelves.  He starts knocking
things to the ground.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>              (to himself)
          They'll know our secret thoughts.

There is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR.  The doorknob turns. 
Graham grabs it with both hands.  The door begins to push
open.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Merrill!

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Got it!

Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a
pick for digging in the ground.  He holds it up in the air. 
It has a three-foot wooden handle.

Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction.

A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling.  It is
the only light in the room.  Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB
with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.

<b>THE BULB SHATTERS.
</b>
<b>THE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK.
</b>
<b>                    BO
</b>          Dad!

<b>WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES.  STRUGGLING
</b><b>AT THE DOOR.  STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS.
</b>
<b>CLICK.  A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON.
</b>
<b>IT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL
</b><b>SHELVES.  HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS.
</b>
<b>THE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS.  IT FINDS MERRILL
</b><b>AND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.
</b>
<b>MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED
</b><b>BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND.  THE PICK WAVERS A
</b><b>LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS.
</b>
<b>THE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO
</b><b>LESSEN.
</b>
Beat.  Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S
<b>FACE.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Where's Bo?

<b>THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS.  THROUGH THE BOXES,
</b><b>BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING
</b><b>BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD.  BO'S
</b><b>HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS.  SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.
</b>
<b>                    BO
</b>          I'm okay.

<b>ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON.  IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES
</b><b>WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT.  HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE
</b><b>SHELVES NEAR HIM.  BEAT.
</b>
<b>HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.
</b>
He turns the knob to "on."  The radio lights up, but no sound
emerges for it's speakers.  Merrill turns the channel knob
and checks all the stations.  No sound.  No signal.  He
listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.

Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          What's happening out there?

Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (in the dark)
          I can't even imagine.

<b>THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.
</b>
<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          I hope they're doing better than we
          are.  We don't even have helmets.

<b>THERE IS A LOUD BANG.
</b>
<b>BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME
</b><b>TO A STOP ON THE DOOR.
</b>
<b>ANOTHER BANG.  THE DOOR VIBRATES.  THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN
</b><b>HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.
</b>
<b>BANG.
</b>
GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS.  He looks at the door
and then turns and faces the lights.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          They're just making noises. 
          They're not trying to get in.
              (beat)
          Why are they doing that?

Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness.  Morgan
moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          They want our attention on the
          door?

BANG.  A beat of silence.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          They're distracting us?

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          From what?

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          The book says they're probably very
          good problem solvers.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          What book!

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          They'll find a way in.

<b>BANG.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Morgan, give me your flashlight.

Morgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS
<b>THE FLOOR.  THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN
</b><b>GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.
</b>
THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM.  He picks it
up.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Is there an air vent in here?

Merrill moves next to Graham.  ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.

They aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  The
brothers move in opposite directions.

<b>GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE
</b><b>CEILING AS HE MOVES.
</b>
<b>MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME.  HIS FLASHLIGHT
</b><b>PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.
</b>
<b>A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.
</b>
Merrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I can feel air.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Me too.

<b>THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          It's getting stronger.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          I'm close.

<b>BANG.
</b>
<b>THE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL.  GRAHAM AND
</b><b>MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME
</b><b>TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.
</b>
<b>HE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL.  HE STARES UP AT THE
</b><b>TWO LIGHTS.
</b>
<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          What?

<b>IN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM
</b><b>A BREEZE.
</b>
<b>GRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR
</b><b>VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.
</b>
<b>EYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT.  A NARROW SET
</b><b>OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN
</b><b>THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.
</b>
<b>MORGAN SCREAMS.  THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND.  THERE'S
</b><b>A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE.  FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.
</b>
<b>WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.
</b>
<b>                    MERRILL (O.S.)
</b>          Hold the vent!

<b>SOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT.  WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING
</b><b>FACES.  MORGAN SCREAMING.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Pull him!

<b>THE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN.  WE SEE IT IS
</b><b>BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.
</b>
<b>BO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT.  MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE
</b><b>THERE.  HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG
</b><b>FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL.  HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER
</b><b>WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG.  HE QUICKLY
</b><b>MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.
</b>
<b>BO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM.  SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN
</b><b>ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT.  HE HEAVES IT ON TOP
</b><b>OF THE PILE.  HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN.  RETURNS WITH
</b><b>ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR.  GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF
</b><b>THE REST.
</b>
<b>MERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED.  THE PILE OF DOG FOOD
</b><b>AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT.  A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS
</b><b>ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL.  HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS
</b><b>AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.
</b>
Merrill slowly catches his breath.  He reaches over to his
side and grabs the remaining flashlight.  HE TRAINS THE BEAM
<b>AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.
</b>
<b>HE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP.  MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS
</b><b>BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST.  USING HIM AS A CHAIR.  MORGAN'S
</b><b>FACE IS PALE.  HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES.  IT SOUNDS
</b><b>LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW.  HE'S SUFFOCATING.
</b>
<b>GRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          We don't have his medicine.

Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray.

Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the
child's ear.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Don't be scared Morgan.  We'll slow
          it down together.  Feel my chest. 
          Feel it going in and out.  Breathe
          like me.  Breathe like me.

Morgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain
and panic.

<b>                    BO
</b>          He can't breathe.

Bo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch.

Graham closes his eyes.  Beat.  He opens his eyes and talks
into Morgan's ear.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Stay with me.  Stay with me.  I
          know it hurts.  Be strong baby...
          It'll pass.

Graham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Don't do this to me again.  Not
          again.

Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face.

Graham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on
Graham's hand.  The fingers squeeze with all the strength
they have.

Graham looks to Merrill helplessly.  Merrill's eyes fill up
with water.

Graham's eyes close.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I hate you.  I hate you...

Graham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          The fear is feeding it... Don't be
          afraid of what's happening...
          Believe it's going to pass...
          Believe it... Just wait... Don't be
          afraid... The air is coming...
          Believe... We don't have to be
          afraid... It's about to pass...
          Here it comes... Don't be afraid...
          Here comes the air...

<b>A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT.  LIKE THE
</b><b>SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.
</b>
<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          There we go... We don't have to be
          scared at all... We know it'll
          pass.  We believe it... Don't be
          afraid Morgan.

Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand.

<b>THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR
</b><b>THROUGH A STRAW.
</b>
Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his
son.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Feel my chest... Breathe with me. 
          Together... The air is going in our
          lungs... Together... We're the
          same.  We're the same.

Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with
Graham's.

<b>THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO
</b><b>LABORED BREATHS.
</b>
Graham's eyes close.  He starts crying.  He speaks to no one.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (soft)
          I hate you.

Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand.  Merrill watches as
father and son breathe together.  Merrill and Bo hold each
other tight.

<b>THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED
</b><b>FACES.  THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE
</b><b>BASEMENT.  TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS.  THEY'RE BOTH LOST
</b><b>IN THEIR THOUGHTS.
</b>
Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          I should save the flashlights.

Beat.  Graham nods without looking over.

<b>MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT.  THE BEAM OF
</b><b>LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT.  THEY
</b><b>DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.
</b>
Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in
her hand.  THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE
<b>HER AND MERRILL.
</b>
Merrill nods to her.  She reaches down and presses the
button.

<b>THE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK.

Graham opens his eyes from sleep.  HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT

</b>
Merrill steps into his vision.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          I found a pack of light bulbs.

Merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf.  THE

</b>
<b>                    RADIO VOICE

Merrill waits for his brother to say something.  Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          It went on all night.  Everywhere. 
          It was completely a ground battle. 
          Mostly hand to hand.  You can't see

          of people died.  Some from combat. 
          But most from poison gas

Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL

          -- who is everything I want to be,
          starts losing faith in things.  I
          saw your eyes last night.

          I don't want to ever see your eyes
          like that again, okay?  I'm
          serious.

Merrill's face is hard.  He looks shaken.  Graham stares at
the conviction in his younger brother's expression.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (soft)
          Okay.

Beat.

THERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  Graham
and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on
Merrill's folded sweater.  Morgan's breathing is strained. 
He still looks grey.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          He's been like that for awhile.  We
          need to get him some medicine.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Have they said anything about our
          area?

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Philadelphia and its outlying
          counties are cleared, but who knows
          for sure?

Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground.  Graham
turns to Merrill.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>              (whispers)
          He's not strong enough to fight off

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>              (whispers)
          I know.
              (beat)
          We need to be sure, before we open
          that door Graham.

The two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. 
Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan.  He moves across
the room towards him.

Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's
side.  Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt.

Graham walks back to Merrill.  He holds it out between them. 
Beat.

He turns it ON.

<b>A SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD.  GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE
</b><b>WAY UP.  THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE. 
</b><b>THERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY

Graham makes eye contact with Merrill.  Beat.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          That's good enough for me.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Me too.

The basement door cracks open a few inches.  Beat.  Merrill
opens it all the way.

<b>DUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS.
</b>
Merrill moves up the stairs by himself.  He reaches the top
and looks around.  Turns back down to the faces at the
bottom.  Gives them the thumbs up.

Graham leads Bo up the stairs.  He carries a limp Morgan in
his arms.

Graham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the
toppled chairs to get to the cabinets.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Get the syringe as well.  We might
          need to give him an epinephrine
          shot.

Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that
have fallen from the cabinets.

Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room.

<b>                    BO
</b>          People are dancing.

She points at the closet.

Morgan strains to look in her direction.  Graham looks at
him.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          You want to see it?

Morgan nods, "yes" as he struggles to breathe.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          I'll bring the TV in here.

Graham unplugs the television.  The screen goes black.

Bo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and
the television cart out into the hall.

<b>INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Graham pulls the television into the family room.  Careful
not to trip it on the carpet.

<b>THE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR.
</b>
Graham moves the television into position.  THE BLACK SCREEN
<b>REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS.
</b>
<b>THE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE
</b><b>TELEVISION SCREEN.
</b>
The TV stops moving.  Graham stays frozen with his hands on
either side of the television cart.  He's slightly bent over. 
His back is to the family room.

Graham straightens and turns around slowly.

Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air.  Morgan's
face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up.

For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air.  Then we
see the outlines... and we see the eyes.  The black eyes.

There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the
middle of the family room.  It's powdery skin has taken on
the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly,
it almost disappears.

It blinks.

Graham and Bo have turned to stone.  Bo stands frozen in the
front hall.

Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the
family room.  He takes two steps into the room and comes to a
stop next to the fireplace.  The inhaler and syringe in his
hand fall to the ground.  The creature is between Graham and
Merrill in the middle of the family room.

Morgan is dying.  THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT.

The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the
creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand.

Graham's eyes shift to the hand.  THREE OF THE CREATURES
<b>FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE.
</b>
The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face.  It tilts its
fingers and palm back.  THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY
<b>CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM.
</b>
A small pore opens up on its wrist.  A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS
<b>TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING.
</b>
Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of
the creature.  It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's.

<b>GRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS
</b><b>TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM.
</b>
<b>GRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES.
</b>
<b>WE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN.  WE SEE THE EMOTION

<b>WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT.  THE LIGHT IS MOVING.  WE
</b><b>REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE
</b><b>OF THE ROAD.
</b>
The car door opens.  Graham Hess steps out.  His coat is
open.  He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.  A
priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black
shirt.  Graham looks around in a daze.

We are on a country road.  THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE
LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.  Four police cars are scattered
amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.

A large group of officers and workers hover around a green
truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.

Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham.  He whispers
something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he
approaches.  Edgar looks badly shaken.  Beat.  The two men
look at each other.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          What do you know?

Graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides.  Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          There was an accident.  Drunk
          driving.  They weren't sure.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          He wasn't drinking.  Ray fell
          asleep at the wheel.

Officer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the
ambulances.  Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass.  His
arms rest on his bent knees.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Is he okay?

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          Yes... That's the first thing
          Colleen asked too.

Graham smiles a little smile.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          She's talking... Which ambulance is
          she in?

Beat.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          She's not in an ambulance Father.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Why not?

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          See Father, Ray's truck swerved off
          the road and ah... Hit Colleen and
          then a tree.  She was pinned
          between the two.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Pinned?  What does that mean?

Beat.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          The truck... the truck has severed
          most of her lower half.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          What did you say?

Beat.

<b>                    OFFICER PASKI
</b>          She won't be saved.  At this point
          she's alive, because the truck is
          holding her together.  She doesn't
          feel much, and she's talking almost
          like normal.  We didn't pull the
          truck out, cause we wanted you to
          come down here to be with her, as
          long as she's awake.  That won't be
          very long.

<b>EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them.  He
walks on, unaware of the stares.

He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck.  It
sticks out onto the road a few feet.  He comes around the
side of the vehicle.

COLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way.  Her straight
brown hair falls down over her small face.  She leans over
the front bumper of the truck onto the hood.  Her head rests
on her arms like a child resting on a school desk.  Her back
is against a tree.  The lower half of her is obscured by the
truck.

She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up
to her.  She is shivering slightly.

<b>                    COLLEEN
</b>              (soft)
          Hi sweetie.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Hi baby.

Graham glances down.  There are bundles of blood soaked
blankets in the area below her.  They peek out under the
twisted front of the truck.  Graham looks up quickly.

<b>                    COLLEEN
</b>          I was just taking a walk before
          dinner.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          You love walks.

Beat.

<b>                    COLLEEN
</b>          I guess it was meant to be.

Beat.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Does it hurt?

<b>                    COLLEEN
</b>          I don't feel much.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Good.

Graham touches her cheek.  She starts crying.  Graham starts
crying with her.

<b>                    COLLEEN
</b>              (crying)
          ... Tell Morgan to play games --

<b>                    COLLEEN

<b>                    COLLEEN
</b>              (crying)
          Tell him... See.  Tell him to see.

Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand.  She rests
on it.  Her eyes are distant.

<b>                    COLLEEN
</b>              (soft)

Graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall.  Beat.

          Swing away, Merrill.

Merrill turns and looks to Graham.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Swing away.

Graham's eyes are not on Merrill.  Merrill follows his eye
line to the baseball bat mounted above him.

Beat.  Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting
place.

The creature starts to move.

Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks
forward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg.

The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its
lines and colors don't match in position in the room.

Merrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn
with staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through
the air of the family room... Contact.

The creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball
bat.

Morgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room
in an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop
lifelessly to the carpet.

The creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is
the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM. 
The creature falls to the ground.

Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham
picks up his son's limp body in his arms.

The creature moves to its feet.

Merrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on
fire.

Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine
on the ground.

Merrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles
pull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with
the creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back
into the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH
ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's
skin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.

Bo and Graham look up.

<b>THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS
</b><b>INTO A POWDERY WHITE.
</b>
Merrill looks back across the room at Bo and Graham.  They
stare at each other with sudden realization.

Merrill looks around at Bo's half-filled water glasses places
all over the family room.

<b>INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING
</b>
Graham carries Morgan through the kitchen and out the back
door.  Morgan's arms and legs swing limp as Graham walks.

Morgan's head bobs back from its own weight as Graham steps
outside.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:

<b>INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING
</b>
Merrill steps in.  THE WOODEN BAT MAKES A SOUND AS IT CUTS
THROUGH THE AIR.  SLAM!  It connects with the creature.  The
creature falls back into the coffee table.  Bo's glasses of
water crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO.  ANOTHER
HIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM.  His torso turns a powdery white. 
Parts of its body are still changing and matching its
environment.  Parts are white.

The creature stands again.

Merrill looks for the next target in the room.  Bo points to
the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon
cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched.

Merrill sees the three glasses of water at Bo's seat.  He
nods.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING
</b>
MERRILL YELLS WITH EVERYTHING IN HIS LUNGS.  His wrists turn. 
His shoulders torque.  THE WOODEN LOUISVILLE SLUGGER SLICES
<b>THE AIR AND SHATTERS WHEN IT CONNECTS WITH THE UPPER CHEST OF
</b><b>THE CREATURE.  PIECES OF WOOD SPLINTER OVER THE FAMILY ROOM.
</b>
<b>THE CREATURE WAVERS AND THEN ALL SEVEN FEET OF IT TIPS OVER. 
</b><b>IT FALLS BACK.  IT CLIPS THE TV STAND AS IT FALLS.  IT LANDS
</b><b>ON THE GROUND WITH A THUD.
</b>
<b>THE CREATURE'S BLACK, EMPTY EYES LOOK UP IN TIME TO SEE BO'S
</b><b>GLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION, FALL... AND SPILL
</b><b>OVER THE EDGE -- RIGHT ONTO ITS FACE.
</b>
<b>THE CREATURE'S SCREAMS FILL THE FAMILY ROOM -- AND THEN
</b><b>SUDDENLY STOP.
</b>
<b>IT BECOMES VERY STILL.  EVERY INCH OF ITS BODY TURNS A
</b><b>WITHERED, POWDERY WHITE.  BEAT.
</b>
Bo watches quietly from the door.  Merrill drops the handle
of the bat in his hands.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:

<b>EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING
</b>
Merrill and Bo find Graham kneeling in the grass.  Morgan
lays limp in his arms.  They kneel down in the grass with
him.

Merrill sees the empty syringe in Graham's hand.  He looks to
Morgan.  The boy's head is tilted back.  His tiny mouth hangs
open unnaturally.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          His lungs were closed.
              (beat)
          His lungs were closed.  No poison
          got in... No poison got in.

Merrill stares at Morgan.  His body is utterly still.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          His lungs were closed.

Merrill reaches for Morgan's still hand.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Don't touch him.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>              (soft)
          Graham.

Beat.  Morgan lies lifeless.

<b>                    BO
</b>          Daddy.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Don't touch him.

Bo is crying.

<b>                    MERRILL
</b>          Graham.

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Don't.

Beat.

<b>                    MORGAN'S VOICE
</b>          Dad.

HIS SON'S VOICE MAKES HIM STOP.  Graham starts crying.  Every
bit of sadness trapped in his body is released.  He looks
down through tears and tears at Morgan.

<b>                    MORGAN
</b>          Did someone save me?

<b>                    GRAHAM
</b>          Yeah baby.  I think someone did.

<b>INT.  WINDOW - MORNING
</b>
We look out through the broken glass of the second story
bedroom window.  We see the worn jungle gym.  We see the
single tree throwing shade on the picnic table.  We see the
golden brown corn lining the back of the yard.

And we see the Hess family.  Sitting together on the grass. 
Huddled together in the sunlight.

<b>                                           FADE TO BLACK.
