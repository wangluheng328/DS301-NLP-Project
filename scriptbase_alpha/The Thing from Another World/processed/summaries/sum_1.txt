In 1949, in the Officers Club in Anchorage, Alaska, the pilot Captain Patrick "Pat" Hendry is summoned by General Fogarty to fly to a remote outpost to investigate something that has crushed on Earth.
Captain Hendry flies with his crew and meets Dr. Arthur Carrington and his team of scientists and they fly to the location.
They discover a flying saucer buried in the ice and they use Thermite bombs expecting to release the spacecraft.
However, it explodes and is totally destroyed by the bombs.
They also find a frozen life form and bring it to the research station.
When the creature thaws, it attacks the dogs and loses one arm.
Dr. Carrington researches and discovers that it is a vegetable life that reproduces like plants.
Captain Hendry believes that the dangerous creature is an invader and decides to find a way to destroy it with his team.
But Dr. Carrington believes that the scientific discovery is more important than lives and protects the creature.
