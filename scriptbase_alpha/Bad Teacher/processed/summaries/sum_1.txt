Ready to marry into money, teaching is a passable past-time for Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz), but when her fianc√© dumps her for being a gold-digger, teaching becomes her only option.
This school year introduces a new young teacher whom everybody seems to be in love with.
Since he seems to be in love with big chests, Elizabeth has to find a way to pay for breast implants.
She'll do whatever it takes, including stealing from her students or stealing for her students.
She'll do even more once a perky, over-achieving teacher starts getting in her way.
