Bobby Dupea seems to be a regular blue collar kind of guy.
He works on oil rigs and lives with his girlfriend Rayette who works as waitress in a diner.
He spends a lot of his time drinking and carousing.
After having little or no contact with his family for three years, he decides to pay a visit to his family home after sister Partita tells him their father is quite ill having had a stroke.
Surprisingly, Bobby's family is quite well off and all seem to be accomplished musicians.
Bobby himself is a classical pianist.
He still finds them pompous and annoying, something that comes to the fore again during his visit.
