When a nasty neighbor tries to have her dog put to sleep, Dorothy takes her dog Toto, to run away.
A cyclone appears and carries her to the magical land of Oz.
Wishing to return, she begins to travel to the Emerald City where a great wizard lives.
On her way she meets a Scarecrow who needs a brain, a Tin Man who wants a heart, and a Cowardly Lion who desperately needs courage.
They all hope the Wizard of Oz will help them, before the Wicked Witch of the West catches up with them.
