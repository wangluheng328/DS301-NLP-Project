Sixth in the series and the fifth to feature the character of Michael Myers.
It has been six years since both Michael and Jamie disappeared from Haddonfield's Police Station.
Now, in 1995, the kids of Haddonfield want to have parties on Halloween Night again after their parents have banned it since the incidents of 1988 (H4) and 1989 (H5).
Meanwhile, Jamie has been raped by a cult but manages to escape with her new-born baby.
But Michael in hot pursuit.
The Strode family has moved into the Myers' house, in an attempt to break the curse and to finally sell the house.
But daughter Kara Strode has problems with her son, Danny Strode who is haunted by the Man in Black (from H5).
Help is at hand though from not only Dr. Loomis but also from an unexpected source, Tommy Doyle (one of the two child survivors from H1).
Tommy has grown up and has researched into Michael's madness and he might have the answer...
