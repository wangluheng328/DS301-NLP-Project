Shortly after the death of her husband, Amish woman Rachel Lapp takes her son Samuel on a trip to Philadelphia.
In the train station bathroom, Samuel witnesses a murder, and helps hardened cop John Book with the ensuing investigation.
Book discovers that people within the police force were involved, and after being targeted himself and wounded he escorts Rachel and Samuel back to their home, where he stays for a while to protect the boy while recovering.
Book and Rachel find themselves growing more and more attracted to each other, but both are aware that unless one of them is willing to leave behind their entire world, their love can never be.
Meanwhile, there's still the crooked cops to worry about.
