<b>               EXT. LANCASTER COUNTY, PA. COUNTRYSIDE â€“ DAY
</b>
<b>               TITLE SEQUENCE
</b>
               The faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, 
               as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND 
               TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The 
               CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, 
               then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar 
               faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are 
               dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.

<b>               EXT. COUNTRY LANE â€“ DAY
</b>
               Through the last traces of early morning mist another group 
               of black-clad figures make their way down a lane.

<b>               EXT. COUNTRY LANE â€“ DAY
</b>
               An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the 
               landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces.

               Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern 
               figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, 
               his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired 
               like his father, peering out.

               The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS 
               on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES 
               on the pavement.

<b>               ANOTHER LANE
</b>
               Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of 
               three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a 
               leafless thicket of hickory.

<b>               VALLEY
</b>
               A BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen 
               buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.

<b>               BARNYARD
</b>
               Where literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses 
               have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of 
               the barn.

<b>               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE â€“ FRONT PORCH
</b>
               As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women 
               and children presumably first).

<b>               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE
</b>
               The coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse 
               has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen 
               partially covering the bearded face.

<b>               END TITLE SEQUENCE
</b>
<b>               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE
</b>
               Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of 
               the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred-
               fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows 
               of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the 
               f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy 
               a special Place.

<b>               RACHEL LAPP
</b>
               A young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and 
               drawn.

               In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too 
               many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual 
               woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence.

               Eight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would 
               appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events.

               And the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered â€“ yet 
               not unkind â€“ features grief-stricken.

<b>               THE MOURNERS
</b>
               Their faces...

<b>               CLOCK
</b>
               As it begins to CHIME nine a.m.

<b>               FAVORING PREACHER
</b>
               As he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation 
               remove their hats also.

               Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect:

<b>               SUBTITLES OVER.
</b>
<b>                                     PREACHER
</b>                         ...a brother has been called home. 
                         God has spoken through the death of 
                         our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...

<b>               THE FAMILY
</b>
               Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion 
               and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as:

<b>                                     PREACHER
</b>                         ...husband of Rachel, father to 
                         Samuel, son of Eli.
                              (and)
                         His chair is empty, his bed is empty, 
                         his voice will be heard no more. He 
                         was needed in our presence, but God 
                         needs such men, too. That one should 
                         be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. 
                         Still, we would not wish him back. 
                         Rather we should prepare ourselves 
                         to follow him.

               TIGHTENING to the Lapps, and...

<b>               EXT. CEMETERY
</b>
               The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in 
               silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the 
               pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.

               As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the 
               grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a 
               slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty 
               air.

<b>               RACHEL
</b>
               TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues...

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE
</b>
               Where the Amish have gathered for the traditional post 
               funeral, midday meals.

               Long tables are laden with customary Amishfare... crocks of 
               soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, 
               preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries.

<b>               RACHEL
</b>
               Where she sits among women, accepting their condolences.

<b>               DANIEL HOCHSTETLER
</b>
               A brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman. 
               There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic 
               set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly 
               what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up 
               man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group 
               of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, 
               BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.

<b>                                     STOLTZFUS
</b>                         Lapp was a good farmer. None better.

<b>                                     BEILER
</b>                         But not the man to buy a horse for 
                         you.
                              (and)
                         Hochstetler, wasn't it your father 
                         sold him that horse with a ruptured 
                         testicle?

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                              (grins)
                         Told him it was a bee sting made him 
                         limp that way.

<b>                                     HOCHSTETLER
</b>                              (amused)
                         That horse had one good ball. That's 
                         all it takes.

               The others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on 
               Rachel.

<b>               RACHEL
</b>
               As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a 
               tree in front of her.

               At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. 
               All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, 
               tune in as Rachel looks up.

<b>                                     HOCHSTETLER

               It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is 
               hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The 
               death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three â€“ 
               Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli 
               work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up 
               from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach â€“ 
               it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a 
               word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various 
               tasks associated with the work in hand.

               Daniel works close beside Rachel.

               A huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it

               raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the 
               countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot

               looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to

<b>               INT. 30TH ST. STATION, PHILADELPHIA â€“ DAY

               Rachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress 
               of the two Amish â€“ particularly Samuel's black coat and hat 
               â€“ are drawing curious stares.

               He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a

               from appearances, be an Amishman.

               Samuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we

               It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops 
               before one of the urinals â€“ a long, trough-like affair with 
               water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.

               It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING 
               FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel 
               stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, 
               stoops to see which are empty.

<b>               HIS POV â€“ TOILETS

               Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel 
               is alone in the restroom.

<b>               BACK TO SCENE
</b>
               As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a 
               stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily 
               bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, 
               he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind 
               a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.

               Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large 
               BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. 
               His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and 
               a short leather jacket.

               They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.

               The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for 
               him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close 
               confines of the lavatory.

<b>               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he 
               can see their feet under the edge of the door.

<b>               BACK TO FIGHT
</b>
               As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young 
               man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.

               The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's 
               hand bloodstained. His partner stares at what they've 
               accomplished with a stunned expression:

<b>                                     PARTNER

               The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with 
               blood.

               He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. Finally his 
               bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. 
               Then he collapses to the floor.

               The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, 
               then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind 
               the dispenser.

<b>               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder 
               we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the 
               backpack. But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we 
               catch sight of the black man's face.

<b>               SAMUEL
</b>
               As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes 
               the stall door.

<b>               ANGLE IN STALL
</b>
               Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and 
               won't fall closed.

</b>
               As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket. 
               His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand.

               The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, 
               glances at the row of stalls.

               All quiet, but...

<b>               BACK TO SCENE

               The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting 
               at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors.

</b>
               As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on 
               the latch. At the last minute he finally wedges it in.

<b>               BLACK MAN

               He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.

               In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of... 
               he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the 
               black man just checked out. But he loses his hat in the 
               process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just 
               as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that 
               splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's 
               framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking 
               down our throats.

               A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to 
               follow the partner out.

               A beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather 
               slightly built partner:

               Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel 
               intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter:

               Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam. Just then a commotion 
               off screen catches his attention.

               It's Capt. TERRY DONAHUE, Chief of Homicide, striding past 
               the crowd of journalists and TV crews... brushing off 
               reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's

               They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue 
               and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's 
               obviously intense and angry:

               Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile:

               to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit

               Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on 
               the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and 
               move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this

               Samuel inside the car:

               Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative.

               Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and 
               slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing 
               his face up against the front window. His face takes on a 
               grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his 
               partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away 
               by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has 
               horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he

                         maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe 
                         I don't need to have it jammed down 
                         my throat like this.

               She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:

               Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting 
               into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his 
               undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.

               Not a politic observation on Fred's part.

               And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares 
               after her.

               Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, 
               letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure.

               As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door 
               behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.

                         way.

               After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together:

                         sort of made me face it.

               She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private 
               thought.

                         his time with a man who carried a

               Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something 
               to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look.

               She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into

               Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They 
               are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers. 
               Samuel shakes his head â€“ another negative.

               Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow 
               gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an 
               inquiring look. It's a peace offering.

               Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly.

               As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just 
               as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches 
               over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at

               Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing

               similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on 
               the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker.

               The Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously â€“ 
               internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the

                         work to do round here.

               The two men leave. Samuel looks about before hopping off his 
               perch and following the direction taken by Book.

               Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in 
               a cubicle of an office.

               Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the 
               bustle of the squadroom.

               He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques 
               and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of 
               outstanding duty and achievement.

               As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes 
               are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway.

               Until suddenly he freezes.

               A long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to 
               Samuel, ENTERS FRAME.

               He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that 
               they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to 
               point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small 
               hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes. 
               He smiles gently at the boy.

               Samuel close. Book glances at her:

               opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised 
               and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY

               Schaeffer passes Book a drink.

               Book is excited, animated... the hunter, after a long chase, 
               closing on his quarry:

               Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being 
               locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports 
               section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward 
               his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports 
               section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts 
               to take a step... and looks up.

<b>               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the 
               other side of the parking lot crosswalk

               Freezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught.

               Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping 
               bag (which he appeared to be carrying) â€“ letting the shopping 
               bag fall away as he does so â€“ revealing a five-inch barrel 
               Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. 
               Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES 
               once.

<b>               BOOK

               Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven 
               into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as:

<b>               MCELROY

               Coming right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a 
               WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. 
               And McElroy still smiling as:

               Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send 
               Book down hard and grasping.

<b>               MCELROY

               Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely 
               taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book

               GROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And 
               we HEAR â€“ from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream.

               As the lights of an oncoming car â€“ going very slowly, on its 
               way to a parking space â€“ sweep over him and we HEAR it come 
               to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get 
               to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, 
               using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car 
               door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, 
               accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the 
               oncomers,

<b>               ANGLE

               A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of 
               Book, looks on edgily:

<b>                                     MAN

                         too much to drink?

               Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly.

<b>               BOOK'S WOUND

               As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck 
               him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other 
               just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).

                         that blood?

               Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to 
               intercept him:

                         to death!

               Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed 
               squarely at the fat man's face:

               Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is 
               sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at 
               the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back 
               toward his car.

               drawn.

               He examines the wound, a cleanly drilled hole through his 
               right side, just under the rib cage. The wound continues to 
               bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him, before putting 
               his shirt back on.

               He then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin

               As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning 
               low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered.

               Book's brow is beaded with sweat.

               Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat-
               soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should 
               get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on 
               display here just now than she's quite comfortable with.

               She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, 
               so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, 
               scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one 
               shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious 
               Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at 
               first, then the words take shape â€“ swear words; curses; fuck

               As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan. Book is lying asleep 
               on the bed.

               Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is 
               indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed 
               and opens the clothes chest.

               Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded 
               clothes.

               Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled 
               pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon 
               from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN...

               His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the

               Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length. He 
               looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots 
               the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes 
               out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm. He 
               snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel.

               Book smiles. Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne-
               tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol, 
               demonstrating the action.

               He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first.

               The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but 
               his hands are too small. Book smiles.

               Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two 
               hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so 
               that it's not pointed at him.

               Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps 
               the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to 
               find her son has a gun pointed at her. Samuel blanches and

               on from the b.g.

               Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will 
               ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central 
               pillars of the Amish way.

                         you kill another man? Eh?

               Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli 
               leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.

               A beat, then Samuel musters some defiance.

               Now he meets Eli's eyes:

</b>                         I have seen it.

               Eli expels a deep sigh; then:

                         changed, and gone amongst them...

               He breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the 
               boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly 
               into the tabletop with enormous intensity:

               fastens it about him. The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman" 
               increases the awkwardness between them. Book turns his back

<b>               EXT. FIELD NEAR FARMHOUSE â€“ DAY
</b>
               Book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car 
               knocked down the day of his attempted departure. He pauses 
               as a figure approaches. We recognize Daniel Hochstetler, 
               Rachel's would-be suitor. He heads for Book with an outgoing 
               smile and outstretched hand. Here's a likable man who likes 
               people.

                              (grinning)
                         Very plain.

               Book is not particularly amused.

               Hochstetler gives Book a powerful clap on the shoulder.

               Hochstetler heads for the house. Book stares after him with 
               some interest.

               As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also 
               catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion 
               crossing her expression for an instant.

               And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either.

               Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome.

</b>
               Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is 
               headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens. He 
               glances toward the house:

               Where Rachel and Hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing, 
               sharing a pitcher of lemonade.

</b>
               Thoughtful... He glances at the hog pen as a huge sow SQUEALS 
               and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she 
               can feed.

               Rachel smiles. Book crosses to a workbench and selects another

               Eli is seated at the head of the table, Book opposite Samuel 
               and Rachel. The table is piled high with an incredible amount 
               of food.

               Eli eyes Book cagily, waves his fork at him:

                         makes an appetite.

               Book swallows that one. With difficulty. Rachel intervenes:

               to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp 
               buggy.

               He glances up as she enters:

               Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the 
               battery power, hits the radio â€“ and suddenly from the 
               Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major 
               inventions â€“ rock and roll.

               It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more 
               even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's 
               his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous 
               as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in 
               Amish.

               Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book 
               sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel 
               alternately protesting and laughing.

               Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences 
               grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled 
               question or statement.

                         Probably.

               Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.

                         He's got my number.

               Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep 
               breath... suddenly smiles. And is abruptly (as he is capable 
               of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. He even 
               CHUCKLES as he begins:

<b>                                     SCHAEFFER
</b>                         It's funny. I know he's hiding 
                         somewhere with the Amish, I know it.
                              (a quick glance at 
                              Carter)
                         Can you imagine John Book at a prayer 
                         meeting? Our John Book?

               Schaeffer CHUCKLES again, looks hopefully again at Carter.

               Carter looks back, stony-eyed. Schaeffer makes another abrupt 
               shift in form... but still speaks softly.

               As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder.

<b>               HIS POV â€“ BUGGY
</b>
               With trace horse harnessed... Samuel and Eli loading 
               provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house.

<b>               BACK TO BOOK â€“ INT. / EXT. BARN
</b>
               As he goes into the barn.

               Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the 
               temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his 
               hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.

               Book starts to talk gently to the animal:

<b>                                     BOOK

                         you like it or not.

               Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall 
               gate.

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, 
               brings out some lumps of sugar.

<b>                                     BOOK

                         you for Christ's sake?

               Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends 
               to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
               Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled 
               expression.

                         Eli is ready to go to Zook's.

               Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a 
               nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him 
               skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:

<b>               EXT. ZOOK FARM â€“ LANCASTER COUNTY â€“ DAY
</b>
               BIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are 
               arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising.

               In the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the 
               construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun 
               raising the main supports on the already laid foundation.

               Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are 
               spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot 
               coffee and cold lemonade for the men,

<b>               LAPP BUGGY
</b>
               As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the 
               construction site.

<b>                                     ELI
</b>                         Wait here 'til I find a gang you can 
                         work with.

               He goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and 
               more workmen and their families climb out.

               Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad 
               face breaks into a grin:

<b>                                     HOCHSTETLER
</b>                         Book! Good to see you!

               He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting 
               and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused.

               Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his 
               showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.

               And Book realizes it as well.

<b>                                     HOCHSTETLER
</b>                         Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

                         use a good carpenter.

               With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and 
               ushers him away. Rachel calls after them:

<b>                                     RACHEL

               Hochstetler nods with satisfaction:

<b>               CUTS
</b>
               As the morning progresses:

               ...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers 
               on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of 
               competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely 
               unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the 
               gang.

               ...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems â€“ without leaning 
               on it too heavily â€“ to be measuring the two men as the morning 
               progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of 
               them.

               ...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with 
               sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising 
               the construction. All around them the structure is rising 
               with remarkable rapidity.

               ...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge 
               noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g., 
               knitting or doing quiltwork.

               ...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a 
               group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls 
               "botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).

               ...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs 
               in the sunlight, looking on â€“ the old men kibitzing in German, 
               the women gossiping.

               Until...

<b>               BIG SHOT
</b>
               Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at 
               least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about 
               the barn framework...

               ...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, 
               others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and 
               what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing 
               up before our very eyes. And there isn't a power tool in 
               sight.

<b>               WOMEN'S AREA
</b>
               As Rachel crosses near the benches... we can see other women 
               eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering. 
               Rachel ignores them.

               She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs. Yoder from the funeral 
               sequence earlier. The older woman is emptying a big pan of 
               fried chicken into serving platters. She smiles, obviously 
               liking Rachel.

<b>                                     MRS. YODER

</b>                         Hardly any of them.

<b>               ANGLE â€“ THE ROOFBEAM
</b>
               Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding 
               them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam. They 
               are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, 
               way out at the far end of the roof.

               Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start 
               to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.

               Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof 
               with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it 
               back together.

               Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.

               Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:

<b>                                     HOCHSTETLER

</b>                         Yes, sir.

               And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, 
               looks on.

<b>                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

<b>               BIG SHOT

               The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. 
               It's late afternoon.

<b>               ANGLE ON BOOK
</b>
               He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The 
               exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of 
               fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's 
               determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, 
               nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler 
               guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm 
               about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From 
               below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.

               Hochstetler shouts:

<b>                                     HOCHSTETLER
</b>                         We admire our work!

               The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes 
               his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his 
               appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no 
               thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding 
               SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.

               PANNING the faces as they listen to the heavy German words 
               rolling out over the still evening air.

               Book stands a little to one side of the Amish. The prayers 
               he cannot share with them. Rachel is aware of this, feels 
               something of his emotion. She looks toward him, then she too 
               closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing 
               prayer.

               Book takes a seat in a chair, SIGHS, looks toward the night 
               sky.

               There is a SOUND, but it's a moment before he turns his eyes

               The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts 
               across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... 
               then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving 
               the door open behind him.

               Looking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he 
               speaks softly:

               After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door

               From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to 
               the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see 
               where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. 
               The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks

               No answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind

               Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is 
               pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub.

               She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of 
               her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back 
               of a chair.

               Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath.

               Rachel hesitates for a moment â€“ and in that moment she makes 
               a choice.

               Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his 
               eyes.

               And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of 
               eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, 
               for an instant, a woman of Book's world.

               As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable 
               to make it happen.

               And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, 
               picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting 
               it on, looks away.

               she senses his presence.

               Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing 
               them in the fold of her apron.

               When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work.

               Rachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick â€“ 
               the race is on.

               Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together

               race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and 
               gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and 
               neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly.

               It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off 
               Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she 
               gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers

               YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence 
               fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.

               Book and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside; 
               the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing 
               smoke pulls up nearby.

               Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's 
               stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She 
               waggles the camera at him...

               The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her 
               grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back

               control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to

                         Pick up the hat.

               The youth momentarily unsure â€“ something about Book's tone 
               of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps 
               on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A 
               pause, then Book explodes.

               The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he 
               hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth 
               grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into 
               him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. 
               He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. 
               Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd 
               is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book 
               shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a 
               kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction 
               of the Lapp farm.

               The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back 
               to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD 
               LOCAL addresses Rachel.

               realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even 
               get close to such a one. He appears to start to speak, but

               she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with 
               some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.

               Where Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out... 
               the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table.

               Eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the 
               kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons 
               leveled, burst in. Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer 
               enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified.

               McElroy whips around, smashes Eli on the temple with the 
               butt of his shotgun. Eli crumples to the floor. Rachel

               Book, at another window in the lower barn, sees McElroy 
               heading for the milkhouse door. He can't see Fergie. He turns, 
               crosses the cowpen area, climbs an inner ladder leading to 
               the upper barn.

               Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously, 
               gun up. He eases around the doorpost, looks within.

               Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie 
               easing into the barn. Book pulls himself up, crawls behind 
               the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside 
               Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm 
               him. He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's 
               nose. The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes 
               widen, but he makes no untoward sound. Book closes the gate.

               He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting.

               DOLLYING WITH him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens 
               the gate. An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously. 
               Fergie backs off, moves on.

               As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh 
               straw.

</b>
               As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack 
               on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy 
               explode in an horrendous SCREAM.

<b>               FERGIE

               Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies 
               open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under 
               the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering 
               backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the 
               mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into 
               Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half 
               like a matchstick.

               It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to

               pointed at each end of the U. the points hanging toward the

               Samuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is 
               Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of 
               the rockerarm.

               He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of 
               his head, his face set against the tears that move down his 
               cheeks.

               Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward 
               the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward 
               the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. 
               He still can't see Samuel.

               As Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps.

               Turning, SHOUTING:

               Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there 
               is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him.

               Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, 
               Stotlzfus and others â€“ including Hochstetler and his brothers 
               â€“ are baling the first cutting of June hay.

               But the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in 
               toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the 
               Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating.

               But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward 
               Samuel.

               As Schaeffer reaches Samuel, SHOUTS:

</b>                         Cut that out!

               Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling.

               Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of 
               the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs 
               on grimly.

               Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves 
               him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun 
               blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several 
               threads, so he FIRES again.

               The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to 
               look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when 
               Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy 
               kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness 
               right then and there.

               But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He 
               SNARLS at Sam:

               Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in

               He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The 
               cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks 
               at him with its horns. Book waits, watches.

               Visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. He stops 
               at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering

</b>
               He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to 
               a nearly-empty silo. Above the entrance, a ladder (interior) 
               rises to the top of the structure.

               Book looks in, and up. We should get the impression that 
               Book's been here before, expects what he sees.

<b>               WHAT HE SEES
</b>
               Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.

               He steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond 
               it into the silo. There is about two feet of old silage 
               covering the floor. He turns, looks up the white walls.

</b>
               Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses 
               to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out..

               McElroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other 
               direction (toward the milkhouse).

</b>
               Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward 
               into the cowpen). It begins to swing very slowly open. Book 
               immediately turns, darts back into the silo.

</b>
               Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his 
               eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow 
               half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. 
               McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door.

               Old Eli, at the sight of Samuel, rises from the table.

               Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and 
               hard.

               She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big 
               family Bible. He crosses to the table, sets the book down, 
               places his hand on its pulls Samuel to the table beside him.

               Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man 
               helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, 
               takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of 
               the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out 
               how to open the chamber to load it.

               In the b.g., Eli glances up, sees what she is about... he 
               rises and crosses to her. Samuel watches from the table.

</b>                         I have to help him!

               Rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try 
               to load the bullets. Eli's callused hand closes over hers, 
               halting the action:

<b>                                     ELI
</b>                         It is not our way!

               Bullets are already CLATTERING to the floor from her trembling 
               fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's.

               A long beat as Rachel looks at him... Finally her fingers 
               release the pistol and it CLATTERS to the floor. She closes 
               her eyes.

               Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli 
               and Rachel silently.

               Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible 
               beneath his. They stand there and they pray.

               The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly. 
               McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door. 
               As he arrives, he HEARS a noise â€“ very slight â€“ from the 
               direction of the silo.

               He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance, 
               He hesitates. Another slight noise. He steps in to the base

<b>                                     SCHAEFFER
</b>                         Get back, you people!
                              (prodding)
                         Keep moving, Johnny...

               Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops. 
               The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. Book 
               now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer.

<b>                                     BOOK
</b>                         You're going to have to do it right 
                         here, Schaeffer.

<b>                                     SCHAEFFER
</b>                         Don't try me, Johnny!

               Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.

<b>                                     ELI
</b>                         So... will you kill us all, then?

<b>               ANGLE
</b>
               As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly 
               turns until he is facing Schaeffer... the gun now leveled â€“ 
               and almost pressing against â€“ Book's chest. Book locks eyes 
               with Schaeffer.

               Quietly:

<b>                                     BOOK
</b>                         It's all over, Paul.

<b>                                     SCHAEFFER
</b>                         Move! Or you die right here!

               Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand 
               wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer SCREAMS in pain, the gun 
               falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force 
               of Book's grip.

<b>               ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
               As Book bends, picks up the pistol, releases Schaeffer, pushes 
               him away. Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who â€“ partly 
               to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to 
               congratulate him on his surrender â€“ wraps one brawny arm 
               around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving 
               nod... holds Schaeffer as:

</b>
               Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel. Their gazes 
               meet, hold for a long MOMENT. In the eyes of both we read 
               resignation... whatever there was between them has been 
               terribly damaged. It is almost certainly over for them, too.

<b>               EXT. BARN â€“ DAY
</b>
               HIGH SHOT holding the moment.

<b>               EXT. LAPP FARM â€“ LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               The door opens and Book steps out, looking somehow strange 
               in his working suit. He looks about him, sees Samuel down by 
               the pond.

<b>               EXT. POND
</b>
               He eases down beside Samuel. They both stare into the pond.

<b>                                     SAMUEL
</b>                         Are you really ever coming back?

<b>                                     BOOK
</b>                         Got to, Sam. You and I are going to 
                         a courthouse together, put some people 
                         behind bars.

</b>                         Sure have, Sam.

               Sam grins. Book takes him in his arms, holds him.

<b>               EXT. HOUSE â€“ DAY
</b>
               Book opens the door of the car, turns to find Rachel standing 
               there with his Amish hat in hand.

<b>                                     RACHEL

               He wants to kiss her, but does not. Their eyes say it all. 
               Eli has a final word, SHOUTING from the porch.

<b>                                     ELI
</b>                         You be careful, John Book! Out among 
                         them English!

               Book gets quickly into the car.

<b>               INT. /EXT. DRIVEWAY â€“ LAPP FARM â€“ DAY
</b>
               As Book drives, he sees an open buggy coming down the hill 
               toward the farm, He slows as he passes, It's Daniel 
               Hochstetler. A long beat, and as they pass, Hochstetler gives 
               Book an expansive tip of his hat.

<b>               INT. BOOK'S CAR
</b>
               Book turns to look back at his rival, a doubt in his eyes.
