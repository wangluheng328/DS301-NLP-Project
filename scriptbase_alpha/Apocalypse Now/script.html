<b>				A P O C A L Y P S E   N O W 
</b>


		Original screenplay by John Milius.

		Inspired by Joseph Conrad's "HEART OF DARKNESS".

		This draft by Francis Ford Coppola.

		December 3, 1975.



<b>	1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN
</b>
	It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through 
	the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the 
	trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

	Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to 
	the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
	then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to 
	emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set 
	of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, 
	in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." 
	The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier 
	beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no 
	shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
	painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the 
	right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
	slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

	Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though 
	unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
	We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
	swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
	in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
	As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow 
	and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
	in a paisley design.

	Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
	the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
	ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
	ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
	pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
	Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
	no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
	eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

	The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
	AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
	about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
	and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
	casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
	laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
	US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out 
	with AUTOMATIC FIRE.

	Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
	screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
	appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
	we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
	Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
	feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
	savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
	they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
	They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
	bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
	They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
	as they move.

	The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
	mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

	We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
	running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
	only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
	painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
	FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
	and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
	around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
	are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
	frightened.

	An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
	on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
	TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
	dead.

	OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
	Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
	stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
	with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
	and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
	and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
	bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
	electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :


		<u>MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW</u>


<b>	2  TITLE SEQUENCE
</b>
	The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, 
	growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
	transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
	look at, like the sun itself.

	Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
	again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
	is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
	cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
	distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
	stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
	MUSIC  now.

	We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
	as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
	close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
	CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
	Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
	shapes of :


<b>	3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY
</b>
	The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
	cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

	It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
	bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
	cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
	head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
	party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
	catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
	smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
	paint. Charlie is going on and on :

<b>				CHARLIE
</b>		... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
		200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

<b>				LAWYER
</b>		What about oil ?

<b>				CHARLIE
</b>		Food, oil --look, let me show you
		something. This is the economy of
		the United States in two years --

	He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

<b>				CHARLIE
</b>			(continuing)
		This is West Germany.
			(he draws another,
			 bigger circle)
		This is Japan.
			(another , bigger)
		This is Italy.
			(a dot)
		This is Iran.
			(a very big circle)
		And this is Saudi Arabia... In
		two years ?
			(a gigantic circle)
		Do you understand ?

<b>				ACCOUNTANT
</b>		What's to prevent it ?

<b>				CHARLIE
</b>		Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
		I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
		company in the last twenty years
		by doing nothing. We can protect
		our interests.
			(pause, for a drink)
		We are still the most powerful
		nation in the world. Militarily.

	He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

<b>				CHARLIE
</b>			(continuing)
		You know bodyguard; he was a
		captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
		him, except he won't talk. This
		kind of man can kill you with his
		pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

	The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

<b>				CHARLIE
</b>			(continuing)
		Carries a attache case at all
		times. You know what's in it ?
			(another sip)
		An Ingram Machine pistol.

	Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
	NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

<b>		CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>	I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill
	neither should this country.			with the ridge of your
	If we're strong, we should			hand to the throat; you
	protect our interests, and			can crush a skull with
	we should have the respect			your knee... but you
	of the world, even if it				can't kill anybody with
	takes another war.				your pinky.

	The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
	Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
	good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		The attache case has been empty
		for three years, but it makes him
		safe to think there's a machine
		pistol in it.

		I don't like automatic weapons.
		They jam.

		I saw a friend of mine get
		ripped open because he flicked his
		M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
		How much money did the contractors
		make on the M-16 ?

	Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
	reading, flirting, drinking.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>			(continuing)
		He likes to hear stories about Nam.
		I tell him I can't; they're not
		cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
		understand.

	We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
	opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We 
<b>	MOVE CLOSER.
</b>
<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>			(continuing)
		There's no way I can tell them...
		what really happened over there.

		I wouldn't've believed it if
		someone'd told me.

	We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
	from a beer, but we cannot see his face.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>			(continuing)
		There was only one part that
		mattered -- for me, anyway. I
		don't even know if I remember
		all of it. I can't remember
		how it ended, exactly -- because
		when it ended I was insane.

<b>							DISSOLVE TO :
</b>
<b>	4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY
</b>
	A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and
	shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.
	Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.
	WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
	by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
	shoes and sell him things.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		But I know how it started
		for me -- I was on R. and R.
		in Saigon; my first time south
		of the DMZ in three months. I
		wasn't sure, but I thought this
		guy was following me.

	Willard looks back.


<b>	5  HIS VIEW
</b>
	an American CIVILIAN.


<b>	6  MED. VIEW
</b>
	Willard ducks into a bar.


<b>	7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY
</b>
	Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
	tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
	crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
	past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
	sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

	An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
	drinks and approaches Willard's table.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		How about a drink ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Sure, thanks.

	He sits down at the table with the drinks.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Winning the war by yourself.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(he calls for the waiter)
		Part.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Which part is that ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		My part.
<b>			(TO THE WAITER)
</b>		Beer, with ice and water.

<b>	   
</b><b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		That's good gin.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Delta ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		North ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yeah. Way north.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		What unit were you with ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		None.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Rangers, eh?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Sort of.

	The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
	his shoulder.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Were you Longe Range Recon --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No -- I worked too far north for
<b>		LRRP.
</b>
	He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
	Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
	notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
	then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		That's quite an array of ribbons...

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Let's talk about you.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		I was an FO for the 25th.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Tracks ?

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Fat. That's real fat.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Sometimes.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		At least you always have enough
		water. How many gallons does
		each one of those damn things
		carry ?

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You know, I can remember once,
		getting back below the DMZ -- and
		the first Americans we ran into
		were a track squadron. I just
		couldn't believe how much water
		they had. We'd been chewing
		bamboo shoots for almost a week,
		and before that, for two weeks,
		we'd been drinking anything --
		rain water, river shit, stuff
		right out of the paddies. And
		there were these guys standing
		by their trucks spilling water
		all over. I could've killed them.
			(solemnly)
		I swear to God I would have, too,
		if ...

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		I didn't know we had units up
		there in North Vietnam.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We do.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		How long were you up there ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		A long time.

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		A year ? Waiter another beer.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I go up on missions. Listen
		Captain, buy me all the beer
		you want, but you better tell
		that asshole over there you're
		not going to find out anymore
		about me.

	Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
	Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
	He rises and comes over to the bar.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		What do you want ?

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>			(indicating the Army jeep)
		If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
		Group, we'd like you to come with
		us.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Whose orders ?

<b>				CAPTAIN
</b>		Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
		A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
		Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
		Nha Trang.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Who are you ?

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>		The agency.

	Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
	roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
	The Civilian follows.


<b>	8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK
</b>
	A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
	before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
	wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
	fortified, concealed compound.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		They took me to some place outside
		Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
		for all operations in South East Asia.
		I'd worked for Intelligence before --

	Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
	large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
	corridor -- they enter.


<b>	9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM
</b>
	A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
	attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
	reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
	maps and filled with smoke.

	The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
	and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
	reclaiming it.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
		reporting as ordered, sir.

<b>				COLONEL (O.S.)
</b>		Okay, Willard, sit down.

	Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
	bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
	and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
	puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
	him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		Have you ever seen this officer
		before, Captain Willard ?

	He points to the Major.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No, sir.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		This gentleman or myself ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No, sir.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		I believe on your last job you
		executed a tax collector in Kontum,
		is that right ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I am not presently disposed to
		discuss that, sir.

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		Very good.

	He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
	Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		You know much about about Special Forces;
		Green Berets, Captain ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I've worked with them on occasions
		and I saw the movie , sir.

	The officer smiles at this.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		Then you can appreciate Command's
		concern over their -- shall we say
		'erratic' methods of operation.
			(pause)
		I have never favored elite units,
		Captain, including your paratroopers
		or whatever. Just because a man
		jumps out of an airplane or wears
		a silly hat doesn't give him any
		priviliges in my book -- not in
		this man's army.

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		We didn't need 'em in Korea --
		no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
		and an M-1 Garand, none of this
		fancy crap -- no sir.

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>			(stopping him)
		Major.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		We have Special Forces A
		detachments all along the
		Cambodian border. Two here and
		another one here -- twelve or
		fourteen Americans -- pretty
		much on their own; they train
		and motivate Montagnard natives;
		pick their own operations. If
		they need something, they call 
		for it, and get it within
		reason. What we're concerned
		with is here.


<b>	10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP
</b>
<b>				COLONEL
</b>		The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
		It was originally a larger base,
		built up along the river in an
		old Cambodian fortress.
<b>	
</b>		The area has been relatively
		quiet for the past two years --
		but --


<b>	11  MED VIEW
</b>
<b>				COLONEL
</b>		... Captain, we know something's
		going on up there -- Major --

	The Major looks at some papers in front of him.

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		Communications naturally dwindled
		with the lack of V.C. activity,
		this is routine, expected ... but
		six months ago communication
		virtually stopped.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		About the same time -- large numbers
		of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
		began leaving the area -- this in
		itself is not unusual since these
		people have fought with the Rhade
		Tribe that lived in the area for
		centuries. But what is unusual is
		that we began to find Rhade refugees
		too -- in the same sampans as the
		M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
		of V.C. They've put up with war
		for twenty years -- but something
		is driving them out.

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		We communicate with the base
		infrequently. What they call for
		are air strikes, immediate --
		always at night. And we don't
		know what or who the air strikes
		are called on.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Who ?

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		You see, no one has really gone
		into this area and come back alive.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Why me ?

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
		Special Forces. We understand
		you knew him.

	He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		He's commanding the detachment
		at Nu Mung Ba.

	The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
	flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the
	AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target
	coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.
	Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like
	someone dumb, except very fast.

<b>				VOICE (ON TAPE)
</b>		Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --
		Mark flare -- affirmative damn --
		Immediate receive -- hearing
		automatic weapons fire man ...

	GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background.

<b>				SECOND VOICE
</b>		Blue Delta five
		This Big Rhine -- three
		Need that ordinance immediately
		Goddamn give it to me immediate
		Christ -- Big Rhino --
		Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn.

	A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER
	-- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK
	MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE
	peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.

<b>				THIRD VOICE
</b>		This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.

<b>				MAJOR
</b>		That's Colonel Kurtz.

<b>				KURTZ (V.O.)
</b>		I want that napalm dropped in the
		trees -- spread it among the
		branches.

		We'll give you a flare -- an
		orange one -- bright orange.
<b>			(STATIC)
</b>		We'd also like some white phosporous,
		Blue Delta. White phosporous, give
		it to me.

	STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I only met Kurtz once.

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>		Would he remember you ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Maybe.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		What was your impression of him ?

	Willard shrugs.

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>		You didn't like him.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Anyone got a cigarette.

	The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		I thought he was a lame.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		A lame ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		This is years ago, before he
		joined Special Forces, I guess.
		We had an argument.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		About what ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I don't know. He was a lame,
		that's all.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		But why ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		He couldn't get through a
		sentence without all these
		big words; about why we kill.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		Well, he's killing now.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Maybe.

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>		What does that mean ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
		believe he's capable of that.
		I just don't believe it.

<b>				COLONEL
</b>		It's got to be Kurtz.

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>		The point is that Kurtz or
		somebody attacked a South
		Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
		days ago. Last week a Recon
		helicopter was lost in the area --
		another took heavy damage --
		direct fire from their base
		camp.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Our Recon flight ?

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>		Ours.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Touchy.

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>		You can see, of course, the
		implications, if any of this --
		even rumours leaked out.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You want me to clean it up --
		simple and quiet.

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>		Exactly -- you'll go up the
		Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
		appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
		accident, re-establish your
		acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
		find out what's happened -- and
		why. Then terminate his command.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Terminate ?

<b>				CIVILIAN
</b>		Terminate with extreme prejudice.


<b>	12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA
</b>
	A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and
	divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms.

	A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area.
	This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily
	armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple
	military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle-
	dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet,
	M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard.


<b>	13  MED. VIEW
</b>
	We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE.
<b>			
</b><b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		I met the P.B.R. crew; they were
		pretty much all kids, except for
		Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's
		Mate Third Class L. Johnson --
		Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate
		Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --
		Radio Operator Second Class T.
		Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Chief, try to keep out of where
		we're going -- Why we're goin' and
		what's gonna be the big surprise.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		All right with me, I used to drive
		a taxi.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Let's go.

	The Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard
	and otherwise go about their work.

	The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from
	the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward
	twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards
	on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads
	to the ocean.

<b>	15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF
</b>
	Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale.
	Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The
	Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs
	back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just
	stares ahead into space, swallowing.

<b>	17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST
</b>
	The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		The Delta closes off to us about
		ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll
		be able to pick up some supplies --
		bit I think there are only two
		points we can draw enough water
		to get into the Nung River. It's
		all Charlie's turf from there on
		out.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We're gonna have some help to
		get in the river. You know
		these waters, Chief ?

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		'Bout six months ago I took a man
		up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
		regular Army too. Shot himself
		in the head. I brought his body 
		back down.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Shot himself. What for ?

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Beats me -- the sun was too much
		for him, or the mud. Who knows ?

	Pause, looking at Willard.


<b>	18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD
</b>
	Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow
	buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out
	and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There
	is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All
	the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up
	and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
	beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all
	stand silently -- suddenly it stops.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Arch light.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		I hate that -- Every time I hear
		that noise something terrible 
		happens.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Anybody see some smoke ?

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Too far inland.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		There they are.

	He points up to the sky.


<b>	19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY
</b>
	Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE
	the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor
	trails streaming white against the dark blue sky.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not
		till it's too late -- don't have
		to hit you neither, concussion'll
		do it for a quarter mile or better.
		Burst your ears -- suck the air
		outta your lungs.


<b>	20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW
</b>
	They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.
	He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He
	flips through the letters and other documents.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		The dossier on A detachment had
		letters from Kurtz' wife and the
		wives and families of his men.
		All asking where to send future
		mail, understanding the necessery
		silence due to the nature of
		their work -- None of the men had
		written home in half a year.

	Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting
	of the distant B-52 BOMBING.


<b>	21  CLOSE - ON WILLARD
</b>
	studying, examining a report.


<b>	22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ
</b>
	Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his
	career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,
	as Willard reads :

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
		dedicated and well-disciplined
		spirit. He is a fine officer,
		combining military efficiency --
		with a broad background in the
		Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...

	Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the
	161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>			(continuing)
		... He views his military career
		as the dedication of his talents
		to bringing our values and way of
		life to those darker, less
		fortunate areas in the world.

	A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>			(continuing)
		... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
		for Special Forces training is
		highly unusual in regard to his
		past humanitarian concerns, and
		his somewhat liberal politics,
		though I can see no reason to
		deny it.

	A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam
	jungle. His face is blank and vacant.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>			(continuing)
		... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
		bring a sense of Western culture
		to the backward peoples of these
		areas will be of use in
		accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
		programs ...

<b>	23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA
</b>
<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		One day later we came to an
		advanced staging area along the
		coast. This was our last chance
		to pick up supplies before
		approaching the mouth of the
		Nung River.
<b>		 
</b>	The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-
	ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-
	tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."

	Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --
	helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds
	advanced staging areas like the Americans.

	As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices
	something.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Hey.

	They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-
	skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at
	one another.


<b>	24  VIEW ON THE DOCK
</b>
	The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Lance -- I want you to go with the
		Captain an' get three extra drums
		of fuel and maybe scrounge some
		more 50 caliber.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Yeah -- look at those uniforms.


<b>	25  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and
	pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the
	airplane.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Poor bastards, have a long year

	The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of
	Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.


<b>	26  FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW
</b>
	They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-
	ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard.

<b>				SERGEANT
</b>		I don't know anything about these
		papers, sir.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		They're in order -- it's perfectly
		clean -- just check with ComSec-
		Intel like I said.

<b>				SERGEANT
</b>		Well, you know I don't have the
		priority to do that, sir. It
		says here not to contact Com-Sec-
		Int. Who's your commanding 
		officer ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Right now -- I am.

<b>				SERGEANT
</b>		Well who the hell verifies that ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I do.

	He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		No shit -- what's all the activity
		for around here ?

<b>				SERGEANT
</b>		The show --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What show ?

<b>				SERGEANT
</b>		Big show in the parade grounds
		this noon -- some boss stuff --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		This -- Bob Hope or the like --

<b>				SERGEANT
</b>		No sir, I think -- this'll be a
		little bit different --

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Where's it gonna be ?

	He points --


<b>	27  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL
</b>
	A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is
	surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and
	garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --

<b>							DISSOLVE TO :

<b>	28  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS
</b>
	The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the
	wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some
	of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in
	the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to
	see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
	surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,
	or child-molester. To counter their need of course are
	the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
	this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the
	lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-
	herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so
	armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.


<b>	29 FORWARD AREA
</b>
	jammed in the crowd

<b>				CHEF
</b>		It's really too much -- I mean
		I've collected every picture of
		her since she was Miss December.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Yeah -- you can really get hung
		up on them like the cat in the
		Delta.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		What cat  ?

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		One that went up for murder -- he
		was an Army Sergeant.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		I never heard about that.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
		mag, man -- I mean like he was there
		when it arrived -- He just knew.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		So what happened ?

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
		and had one a them little cocky
		gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
		the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
		one day, sat on the end of the dock,
		and wouldn't give it back.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Then went too far -- he sat
		there and starts mutilating the
		centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
		all that. Sergeant says, don't do
		her like that. You leave your
		shitty little hands off that girl.
		Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
		Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
		do that again. You'll wish you
		hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
		his iron to rock and roll and gave
		the little zero a long burst
		through the Playboy mag. Man, it
		blew him clean off the dock --
		Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
		there all full of holes.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		They nail him for it bad ?

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
		give him no medals or nothing --

	In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND
	MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.
	All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
	pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.
	On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large
	Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a
	strange silence descends over the men. The door of the
	copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets
	step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
	abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
	is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
	impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal
	but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his
	presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
	quiet the man.

	He walks over to the microphone.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		I'd like to say hello from all of
		us up here, to all of you out there.
		All of you who've worked so hard
		during Operation Brute Force --
		Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
		-- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
		And I want you to know that we feel
		proud of you and know how hard your
		job is. To prove it -- we've brought
		some entertainment we think you're
		gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
		and her two runners up !

	He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
	sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start
	dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing
	"Suzy Q."


<b>	30  MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN
</b>
	VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
	manner -- smiling.

	The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some
	look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean
	cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
	tenderness.

	Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement
	their need increases by the square.


<b>	31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN
</b>
	They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the
	wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget
	-- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges
	forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
	which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
	has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
	grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
	then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black
	Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
	it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The
	Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.

	Such are the ways of war.

<b>	32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY

	The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.
	There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
		nothing but us and the coastline.
		I felt like I had set off for
		the center of the earth...

	Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Smoke !

<b>				WILLARD

	They all turn. Chief points up the coast.


<b>	33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE

	A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.

<b>	34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE

	-- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the
	surf.


<b>	35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW

	They wade through the water to the beach where they are
	met by a heavily armed group of men.

	Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning
	out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.

	We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the
	Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.


<b>	36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS
</b>
	Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with
	machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-
	side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising
	a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
	pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
	from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
	strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
	neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
	-- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

	He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
	is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He
	walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and
	with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.
	His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(bellowing)
		Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
		back about a hundred yards -- give
		me some room to breathe.

	A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off.

	He was not quite prepared for this.


<b>	38  VIEW ON KILGORE

	turning to his GUARDS

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Bring me some cards.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		Sir ?

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Body cards, you damn fool --
		cards !

	The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new
	packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other
	soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are
	well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual
	about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks
	up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(formally)
		Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
		Recon Group -- I carry priority
		papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
		11 Corp -- I believe you understand

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(not looking up)
		Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
		expect you -- we'll see what we
		can do. Just stay out of my way

	He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the
	deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides
	right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The
	others follow,


<b>	39  TRACKING VIEW
</b>
	The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of
	devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore
	comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on
	it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(to himself)
		Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
		Isn't one worth a Jack in this
		whole place.

	The Colonel goes on about this business.

	moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

	On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers
	something to him. He stops.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		What ? Here. You sure?

	The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down
	the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the
	young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t
	Willard.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		What's your name, sailor ?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Gunner's Mate, Third Class --
		L. Johnson, sir.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Lance Johnson? The surfer?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		That's right, sir.

	Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		It's an honor to meet you Lance.
		I've admired your nose-riding for
		years -- I like your cutback, too.
		I think you have the best cutback
		there is.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Thank you, sir.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		You can cut out the sir, Lance --
		I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy
		foot.

</b>
	His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the
	background.

<b>				KILGORE (O.S.)
</b>		This is Mike from San Diego and
		Johnny from Malibu -- they're good
		solid surfers -- none of us are
		anywhere near your class, though.

	Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		My orders are from Com-Sec
		Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Just hold up a second, Captain --
		I'll get to you soon enough --
		We've got things to do here.

	Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on
	Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-
	discriminately on the bodies as they talk.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		... we do a lot of surfing around
		here. Like to finish up operations
		early and fly down to Vung Tau for
		the evening glass. Have you ever
		surfed the point at Vung Tau? I
		liked the beach breaks around Na
		Trang a lot -- good lefts.

	He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five
	bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		... we keep three boards in my
		Command Huey at all times. You
		never can tell when you're gonna
		run into something good. I got a
		guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict
		a swell two days in advance. We
		try to work it in.

	He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who
	has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in
	horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing; to himself)
		Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
		one.

	He puts the card in the gaping mouth.


<b>	42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG
</b>
	We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead
	Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card
	has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above
	it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Where've you been riding, Lance?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		I haven't surfed since I got here.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		That's terrible -- we'll change 
		that -- I'd like to see you work --
		I've always liked your cutback;
		got a hell of a left turn, too.

	a table set up in front of the command copter.

	Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil
	drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY
	BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Why the hell you wanna go up
		to Nu Mung Ba for?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I got bored in Saigon.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		What's the furthest you been
		in?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Haiphong.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No. Walked.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		What'd you do for supplies?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(he shrugs)
		Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
		they put out caches.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Can you trust them?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No. They put out two or three
		for every one I needed. When
		you get to the one you'll use,
		you just stake it out. If
		something feels wrong, you just
		pass it up. On one mission, I
		had to pass up three and ended
		up living on rats and chocolate
		 bars.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter
		Kurtz commanded a Green Beret
		detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		When did you hear?

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz
		still alive?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Who knows.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Seems to me he got himself
		fragged. i heard some grunt
		rolled a grenade in his tent.
		Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --
		remarkable officer. Walter
		Kurtz woulda been a General
		some day. General of the Army.
		Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs
		of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I met him.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Don't you agree?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		He musta changed !
			(pointing to the map)
		I got to get into the Nung
		River, here or here.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		That village you're pointing at
		is kinda hairy.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Hairy ?

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		I mean it's hairy -- they got some
		pretty heavy ordnance, boy --
		I've lost a few recon ships in
		there now and again.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		So? I heard you had a good bunch
		of killers here.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		And I don't intend to get some of
		them chewed up just to get your
		tub put in the mouth of the
		goddman Nung River. You say you
		don't know Kurtz?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I met him.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		You talk like him. I don't
		mind taking casualties,
		Captain, but I like to keep
		my ratio ten to one in this
		unit -- ten Cong to one.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You'll find enough Cong up there.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		What about this point here?

	He puts his finger on the map.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		What's the name of that goddamn
		village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook

	He motions to one of his surfers.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		Mike, you know anything about
		the point at Vin Drip Drop?

<b>				MIKE
</b>		Boss left.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		What do you mean?

<b>				MIKE
</b>		It's really long left slide,
		breaks on the short side of the
		point -- catches a south swell.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Nice.

	Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Why the hell didn't you tell me
		about that place -- a good left.
			(to Willard)
		There aren't any good left slides
		in this whole, shitty country.
		It's all goddamn beach break.

<b>				MIKE
</b>		It's hairy ,though. That's
		where we lost McDonnel -- they
		shot the hell out of us. It's
		Charlie's point.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		How big it is?

<b>				MIKE
</b>		Six to eight feet.

	Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(to himself)
		A six-foot left.

	Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Boss. What's the wind like.

<b>				MIKE
</b>		Light off shore -- really hollow.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We could go in tomorrow at dawn
		-- there's always off-shore wind
		in the morning.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		The draft of that river might be
		too shallow on the point.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Hell, we'll pick your boat up and
		lay it down like a baby, right
		where you want it. This is the
		Cav boy -- airmobile. I can
		take that point and hold it as
		long as I like -- and you can
		get anywhere you want up that
		river that suits you, Captain.
		Hell, a six foot left.
			(he turns to an advisor)
		You take a gunship back to division
		-- Mike, take Lance with you -- let
		him pick out a board, and bring me
		my Yater Spoon -- the eight six.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's --

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(hard)
		What is it?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Well, I mean it's hairy in there

	SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a

	Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons
	emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three
	Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind.
	The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM

<b>	84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE
</b>
	Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance
	kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		They far enough?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Sure -- fine --

	Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from
	a waiting lackey.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(through megaphone)
		That's far enough -- pick one
		up and come on in --


<b>	85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS
</b>
	They line themselves up on the point. A good set is
	building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off
	-- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a
	tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking
	around frantically.


<b>	86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE
</b>
	Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach.
	Lance looks over at Willard.

<b>				LANCE
</b>			(to himself)
		Maybe he'll get tubed.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Maybe he'll get inside the tube --
		where -- where they can't see him.

	A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in.
<b>	
</b><b>				WILLARD
</b>		Incoming !

	Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS
	SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore
	looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water
	are HEARD.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Son of a bitch.

	Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror.


<b>	87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT
</b>
	Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down
	on the waves.


<b>	88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE
</b>
<b>				LANCE
</b>			(to himself)
		The tragedy of this war is a
		dead surfer.

	Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy,
	too.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What's that?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Just something I read in the
		Free Press.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		They just missed a good set --
		the chicken shits !

	Lance looks up.


<b>	89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS
</b>
	They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke
	hangs over the water.

<b>				KILGORE (O.S.)
</b>			(megaphone)
		Try it again, you little bastards.


<b>	90  BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	He turns to Willard.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		I´m not afraid to surf this place.
		I'll surf this place.


<b>	91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE
</b>
	He turns, glowering to his lackeys.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Bring that R.T., soldier.

	He grabs it.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels --
		Goddamit, I want that treeline
		bombed -- yeah -- napalm --
		gimme some napalm -- son of a
		bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z.
		or C.B.U.'s if you got any of
		them -- just bomb 'em into the
		Stone Age, boy.

	He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO
	WHISTLES over -- everyone drops.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing; to himself)
		Son of a bitch.

	As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore
	raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the
	general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un-
	intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his
	rifle turning to Lance --

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		We'll have this place cleaned up
		and ready for us in a jiffy, boy.
		Don't you worry.

	He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead.



<b>	92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS
</b>
	A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --
	The P.B.R. hangs below it.

	The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight
	alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending
	copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.
	The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists
	-- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still
	going on around them. They all look up as a wadge
	of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to
	begin their bombing run.


<b>	93  FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE
</b>
	Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five
	inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop
	H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units)
	and finally an immense amount of NAPALM.


<b>	94  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.
</b>
	The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean
	and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-
	often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins
	to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM
	are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns
	out almost everything.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Forget that extra drum -- it's
		too damn hot.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Clear on starboard -- Where's
		Lance an' the Captain?

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		I saw that Colonel's Huey on the
		point --

	Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>			(continuing)
		Let's just get outta here.


<b>	95  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE,
</b><b>	       OTHERS
</b>
	Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --
	smoke drifts over.

	Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another
	direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is
	drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
	deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
	tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
	making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
	ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
	goes further downriver through the black smoke and there
	merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(to Lance)
		Look. There it is; the boat.

	Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face. But
	still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark
	against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward
	the boat.

<b>				LANCE
</b>			(whispers)
		He'll kill us.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		He can't kill us.
			(realizing as he says it)
		We're on his side.

	Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then
	strides back without looking at them.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(almost to himself)
		You smell that.
			(louder)
		You smell that?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		What?

<b>				KILGORE
</b>		Napalm, boy -- nothing else in
		the world smells like that --

	They reflect the glow from the burning trees.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing; nostalgically)
		I love the smell of napalm in
		the morning. 

		One time we had a hill bombed
		for 12 hours. I walked up it
		when it was all over; we didn't
		find one of 'em ... not one
		stinking gook body. They
		slipped out in the night -- but
		the smell -- that gasoline smell
		-- the whole hill -- it smelled
		like ...
			(pause)
		victory...

	He looks off nostalgically.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You know, some day this war's
		gonna end..

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(sadly)
		Yes, I know.

	Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his
	hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts
	them up in the air.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		The wind --

<b>				LANCE
</b>		What?

	Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(rising maniacally)
		Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's
		blowing on shore -- It's on shore !

	He leans down and practically grabs Lance.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing; screaming)
		It's gonna blow this place out.
		It's gonna ruin it ...

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		The kid can't ride sloppy waves.

	They turn and stare out to sea.


<b>	96  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS
</b>
	The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back
	over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange
	wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing
	the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their
	boards, overjoyed.

<b>				WILLARD (O.S.)
</b>		The kid can't stand sloppy waves.


<b>	97  MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD
</b>
<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You don't expect this kid to
		ride that crap, do you? He's
		a goddamn artist, he needs
		something to work with...

	Slapping Lance on the shoulder.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(apologetically)
		Yeah -- yeah, I can understand
		how you feel.

	He turns toward the trees.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing)
		It's the napalm -- it's causing
		the wind -- ruining my perfect
		left.

	He staggers off toward the trees followed by his
	guards and other lackeys.

<b>				KILGORE
</b>			(continuing; mumbling)
		The napalm -- ruin -- napalm
		my perfect left -- my perfect
		left point break -- napalm --

	Lance motions with his eyes to Willard.


<b>	98  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.
</b>
	The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and
	crew waiting and yelling.


<b>	99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE
</b>
<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Are you finished surfing?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Yeah... thanks.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Want to say goodbye to the
		Colonel?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Nah.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Then let's get the hell out of
		here.

	They break and run like hell toward the boat in the
	distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are
	cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-
	thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of
	equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards
	-- Willard looks at them.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		No -- no, Captain.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Which one's the Colonel's?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		The Yater -- the clear one
		with the thin stringer.

	Willard glances over to it with determination. There
	is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the
	board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.

<b>				CHIEF (O.S.)
</b>		Incoming ! Incoming -- son of
		a bitch.

	The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach
	toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the
	surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.
	Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips 
	a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the
	board.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(calm)
		This one , Lance?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Yeah, Jesus Christ !

	Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the
	board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,
	through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.
	Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and
	relieved.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		What'd you that for?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		When I was a kid I, never had
		a Yater spoon.

	Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.
	The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF
	toward the deeper water of the river -- the board
	clearly visible on the stern.

<b>							DISSOLVE TO :

<b>	100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R
</b>
	The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.
	It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy
	fire.


<b>	101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW
</b>
	They all are in full battle positions -- their twin
	fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled
	banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches
	against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.
	Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back
	from his forward turret.

<b>				LANCE
</b>			(yelling)
		Maybe we better stay in under
		the trees till dark -- we got
		his Yater.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		He didn't look like he'd take
		that sitting down.

	They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		Let's put some distance between
		us and Charlie.

	The Chief nods.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Lance ---
<b>	
</b><b>				LANCE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Why don't you roll us a big
		joint? I think the Captain'd
		like that.

	They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful
	pause, Willard smiles:

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Take one a mine --

	He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge
	cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights
	up.

</b>

<b>	103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT
</b>
	The boat is hidden under some trees along the river
	bank. The men wait tensely listening --

<b>				LANCE
</b>		You hear it again?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No -- I don't think so. But
		it'll be back. They were
		circling. It'll be back.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		You think he'd of shot us?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		When?

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Any time -- us -- Americans.

	Lance looks over at Willard.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I don't think he´d of shot us on
		the beach but -- he'd of shot us
		if he saw me taking the board --

<b>				LANCE
</b>		A Yater spoon is hard to get --
		especially here.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		He's a man who knows what he 
		wants -- he does know what he wants.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Can I go get those mangos now?

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		I'll go with you in a while --
		judt hold tight awhile --

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Captain -- that was all true
		about the rats and chocolate
		and stuff?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Sure.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		And you could just tell when
		the supplies were booby trapped?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		It's a feeling you get in the
		jungle. When you get good, you
		can find a track and tell not
		only how many they are, but
		their morale, how far they're
		going, whether they're near
		their camp, the weapons they're
		carrying.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		How can you tell their weapons..
		an' how far they're going?

	Willard smiles.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Mostly from the imprints when they
		put them down to rest. their morale
		from the way they drag their feet,
		or the joints that may be lying
		around. If they're near a base
		camp, they wouldn't be conserving
		food; they'll be throwing it away
		half-eaten. If the branches aren't
		broken, their weapons are slung.
		But all this is just technique..
		There's a feeling you get after a
		while, that's what's important.
		I was going through a village once.
		I was looking for a certain party.
		I took off my boots, and walked
		into each hut. It was midnight.
		I went into three like that and
		suddenly I realized I´d gone into
		each hut the same way -- standing
		up -- so the next one I went in on
		my belly. An RPD burst took out
		the door a bit above my head.
			(he shrugs)
		Things like that.

	A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --
	They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the
	distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable
	language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the
	ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.

<b>				KILGORE (V.O.)
</b>			(over a loudspeaker)
		I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
		boy -- I just want the board
		back -- You can understand --
		It was one of my best -- You
		know how hard it is to get a
		board you like, boy. I'm not
		gonna hurt or harm you --
		Just leave it where I can find
		it --

	The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same
	speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise
	ceases.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Jesus -- that guy's too damn
		much.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		I wonder if that was the same
		copter.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		He's probably got 'em all over
		the river with that recording.
		We better move now while it's
		dark.

	Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
		Lance with you --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I'll go with him --

	They all look at him.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		I wanta get my feet on solid land
		once in awhile --

	He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.


<b>	104  MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT

	They cautiously walk through the underbrush.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Chef.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Yes, sir --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Why they call you that?

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Call me what, sir?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Chef -- is that 'cause you like
		mangoes an' stuff?

<b>				CHEF
</b>		No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir
		-- I'm a sauciere --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		A sauciere --
<b>	
</b><b>				CHEF
</b>		That's right, sir -- I come from
		New Orleans -- I was raised to
		be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
		We specialize in sauces; my whole
		family. It's what we do. I was
		supposed to go to Paris and study
		at the Escoffier School; I was
		saving the money. They called
		me for my physical so I figured
		the Navy had better food.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What are you doing out here?

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Cook school -- that did it.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		How?

<b>				CHEF
</b>		They lined us all up in front of
		a hundred yards of prime rib --
		magnificent meat, beautifully
		marbled.. Then they started
		throwing it in these big
		cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
		I looked in, an' it was turning
		gray. I couldn't stand it. I
		went into radio school.

	They move into a slight clearing.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(whispering)
		-- quiet --

	Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-
	tures that he heard something; he points.


<b>	105  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE
</b>
	PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(silent)
		There...

	He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover
	the spot. A few yards from them they hear something
	move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They
	walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns
	at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is
	cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There
	is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles.  He
	and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking
	the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
	gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
	stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
	hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
	and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
	noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
	out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
	point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
	wants. He makes another command and they rush the
	trapped enemy.


<b>	106  MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF
</b>
	Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds
	down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and
	from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats
	FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds
	almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at
	them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,
	emptying their clips.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		It's a motherfucking tiger --
		goddamn...

	He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a
	man can be.

<b>				CHEF
</b>			(continuing; screaming)
		Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger --
		motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh --

	Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of
	the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared
	out of his head as well.


<b>	107  FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW
</b>
	They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into
	the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws
	his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.

<b>				CHEF
</b>			(hysterical)
		Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn !
		It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ !
		Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.

	The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is
	unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around
	the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the
	jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		What's this tiger shit?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No shit... I think I shot the
		hell out of him.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		You think?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I wasn´t looking.. I was running.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Was a big tiger -- no shit?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Who stopped to measure him -- let's
		get the hell out of here.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		A motherfucking tiger -- I could've
		been killed.

	The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great
	speed.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		You forgot the mangoes, didn't
		you?

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Mangoes? There as a fucking
		tiger in the woods -- I could've
		been eaten alive. I'm never
		going into that jungle again.
		I gotta remember never get out of
		the boat; never get outta the boat.

	They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE 
	NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		He was right, the Chef -- never
		go into the jungle, unless you're
		ready to go all the way.

</b>		What was in the jungle? What was

	He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating
	his face momentarily. There is something different about
	him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>			(continuing)
		... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;

		Jeff came home with a black eye
		on Tuesday but said he won anyway.
		He wouldn't tell me what the fight
		was about. Jeff keeps asking
		where you are -- he has maps of
		Viet Nam in his room now. He
		misses you very much. I can't
		take this much longer, Walt. I
		love you and I just can't stand
		it.


<b>	117  CLOSE ON WILLARD
</b>
	He folds the letter up, files through some others quickly
	and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with
	a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was
	the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is
	addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is
	written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic-
	ular. It reads:

					Sell the house
					Sell the car
					Sell the kids
					Find someone else
					Forget it
					I'm never coming back
					Forget it --

	He folds up the letter.


<b>	118  CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD

	He looks out at the ominous jungled mountains.

<b>	119  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER OUTPOST - RAIN
</b>
	The P.B.R. pulls in towards an American outpost that is
	being used as a forward medical evacuation center.
	Various helicopters pads are SEEN, but only one heli-
	copter -- the H-34 painted with Playboy rabbits that
	brought the girls to Hau Fat. Several soldiers in rain-
	coats come out the dock as the P.B.R. pulls up.


<b>	120  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, SOLDIERS
</b>
	Willard looks into some empty tents -- looks around the
	dreary muddy camp. Two soldiers pass.

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		Soldier -- where'´s your C.O.?

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		Stepped on a booby trap, sir --
		got blown all to hell --

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		Well , who's in command here?

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		I don't know -- don't have any
		idea -- I'm just the night man --

	He turns and walks off babbling incoherently -- 

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		What about you, soldier?

	The soldier he was talking to turns around smiling
	idiotically and making animal noises. He stumbles off
	after his friend.


<b>	121  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - WILLARD
</b>
	He looks around disgustedly

<b>				VOICE (O.S.)
</b>			(whispering)
		Captain --

	Willard turns around looking for where the voice came
	from.

<b>				VOICE (O.S.)
</b>			(continuing)
		Over here, Captain --

	He turns to see the Hollywood Agent under the flap of a
	large tent so that he won't get wet. He wears the same
	clothes as before, but is much dirtier. He motions
	Willard into the tent.


<b>	122  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, AGENT
</b>
	They duck inside -- it is dark and damp.

	On cots around astove sit the three playmates and the
	pilot. The nearest one, CATHY, a blonde, picks leeches
	out of her feet. The other two, TERRI and LYNDA, play
	cards with the helicopter pilot. Willard looks over 
	the situation.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		You came in on that boat, didn't
		you?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yeah --

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Where are you headed?

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		What's it matter? Get to the 
		point.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Look -- you know the girls --
		Thta's Terri -- she was playmate
		of --

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		Yeah, I caught your show at Hau
		Fat.

	They all look over.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this
		is Captain -- eh --

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		Captain Willard -- go ahead.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Look -- we got in a little trouble
		-- they rudely took our helicopter
		for MedEvac work on this -- uh
		Operation Brute Force -- They just
		brought it back this morning.

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Well I mean like they also took
		our fuel -- We've been here two
		days.

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		Dreadful.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Look -- the girls could get
		killed -- we're not supposed to
		be this close combat, I mean
		real combat.

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		Well --

<b>				AGENT
</b>		We could use some fuel -- just a
		half drum -- just enough to get
		us out a here.

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		We need all our fuel.

	He turns and starts to leave.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		But, Captain, think what these
		girls have done for the boys --
		think of how they've risked --

	Willard is almost out of the tent.

<b>				TERRI
</b>		Captain --

	He turns around.

<b>				TERRI
</b>			(continuing)
		It's really rough here -- Captain
		-- we're just not built for it --

	The Pilot laughs.

<b>				PILOT
</b>		That's rich --

<b>				TERRI
</b>		Do us a favor -- I'd do one for
		you -- if I could --

	Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans
	and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent
	takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Look -- you know who that is,
		Captain -- you know what she's
		saying -- you'll never see stuff
		that good outside of a magazine
		for the rest of your life.

<b>				WILLARD 
</b>		I'm not that fond of blondes --
		maybe I like brunettes --

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Take your pick -- they all like
		you -- I can tell --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I like all of them --

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Good -- like I said, take your 
		pick.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I said I like all of them.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Now just a second -- I'm doing
		you a favor, buddy -- what're you
		trying to pull?

	Willard turns to leave again.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We need all our fuel anyway.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight
		-- what I meant was we'd need a
		whole drum for that --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Sit down -- we'll talk about it.

	Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent
	to do likewise.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		What's there to talk about -- this
		whole thing disgusts me.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		My men --

<b>				AGENT
</b>		What !

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		That's what there is to talk 
		about -- my man -- I take a good
		care of my men --

	The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening --
	the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		You're out of your skull --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We have a lot of pride in our
		unit --

<b>				AGENT
</b>		How far do you think you can
		push -- what kind of people do
		you think --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Esprit de corps --
<b>	
</b><b>				AGENT
</b>		No -- absolutely not --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		One for all -- all for one --

<b>				AGENT
</b>		You can keep your fucking fuel --

	Willard gets up.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You make some of your closest
		friends in the army -- war has a
		way of bringing men together.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Get out --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Men of all races -- nationalities --

	He gets up and starts out.

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Two drums --

	Willard turns around slowly.

<b>				AGENT
</b>			(continuing)
		Two whole drums --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We can use some fifty caliber and
		a 16 too --

<b>				AGENT
</b>		I don't know what you're talking
		about -- Get fucked --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I will -- I assure you that --
		You got a fifty on that H-34 --
		leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll
		get my men to bring the first drum
		with 'em --

	He turns to go under the tent flap.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		Have the girls freshen up a bit --
		comb their hair -- put on
		something -- you know what I mean --

	He leaves.


<b>	123  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are all working on patching the boat and cleaning
	it up in general. Mr. Clean sits in f.g., cleaning an M-16.

</b>		You keep this thing in this

		Lance -- mark my words.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Why don't you go pet the water
		buffaloes -- get off my back.

	Behins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes
	eating mud or whatever they do. They are painted jungle

	sides the words have been stenciled in black:
<b>			
</b>				1 Each --
				Buffalo, Water B-1A
				U.S. Army No. 15239

	Willard walks through them down to the boat.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Careful,  Captain, they've been
		known to charge.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		All right I got a little surprise
		for you --

	They all look up.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		I've arranged with those people
		we saw at Hau Fat to give us some
		50 caliber in trade for a couple
		a drums of fuel --

<b>				CHEF
</b>		No shit.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Chef -- since you're such a fan
		of Miss December's I think you

		Clean to take the first drum up
		there.

	She picks up a shoe to throw at him. he turns, exits f.g.

<b>	127  EXT. THE P.B.R. APPROACHING DO LUNG BRIDGE - FULL SHOT -
</b><b>	         NIGHT
</b>
	The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the
	distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations
	with U.S. soldiers in them. There is a bright fire
	burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white
	light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the
	night.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		Two days and nights later, we
		approach the Do Lung Bridge.


<b>	128  VIEW ON THE FACES OF THE P.B.R. CREW
</b>
	watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks
	sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the
	banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and
	rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip
	through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --
	scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge
	or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light
	automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.
	edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run
	up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		I gotta get out a here -- I´ll pay
		-- I got money.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Get away from this boat.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Who's your C.O., soldier?

	The Soldier ducks back and runs away.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		Fuck you, you'll get what's coming 
		to you.

	Other men approach the boat. A young LIEUTENANT steps
	forward.

<b>				LIEUTENANT
</b>		Captain Willard?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		That's me.

<b>				LIEUTENANT
</b>		Captain Willard -- we got these
		from Nha Thrang two days ago --
		they expected you here then --

	He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings,
	Willard takes it.

<b>				LIEUTENANT
</b>			(continuing)
		You don't know how happy that makes
		me, sir.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Why?

<b>				LIEUTENANT
</b>		Now I can get out a here -- if
		I can find a way out.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We'll be needing some supplies
		and fuel -- do you know anybody
		who can give me a hand?

<b>				LIEUTENANT
</b>		I'd just clear out as soon as I
		could if I were you, sir. They're
		gonna start working on the bridge
		with torches again. Charlie will
		start throwing it in hard --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What is this bridge?

<b>				LIEUTENANT
</b>		It's of strategic importance for
		keeping the highway into Bat Shan
		open -- the generals don't like to
		admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

	He points to the men getting ready to work.

<b>				LIEUTENANT
</b>			(continuing)
		Every night we build it and by
		0800 they've blown it up -- it
		and a lot of good men -- But the
		generals like to say the road is
		open -- ha ! Nobody uses that
		road except Charlie.

	He turns and splashes off into the darkness.

<b>				LIEUTENANT
</b>			(continuing)
		This is the cesspool of hell.

<b>				SOLDIER (O.S.)
</b>		Incoming.

	SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM
	in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>			(yelling)
		All right -- Lance, go with the
		Captain an' see what you can
		scrounge --

	Willard climbs out with Lance.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>			(continuing; to Willard)
		Better make it fast, sir -- we
		don't really need much anyway.

	Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the
	bridge.


<b>	129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE
</b>
	They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire
	on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they
	don't know where to run.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Straight ahead, son of a bitch.

	They dive towards the voice.


<b>	130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH
</b>
	They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his
	buddy who is crying uncontrollably.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		You came right to it, son of
		a bitch --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Son of a bitch, sir.

	The Soldier doesn't respond.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		Where's your chief supply officer?

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		Beverly Hills --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What?

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		Straight up the road -- a concrete
		bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where
		else you think he'd be?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		C'mon --

	There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the
	road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP
	from a sandbagged emplacement.

<b>				SOLDIER (O.S.)
</b>		Get your asses down, buddy.

	They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the
	emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a
	sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner.
	Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard
	trips.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		Watch your feet, asshole --

	Willard looks down.

<b>				VOICE
</b>			(continuing)
		You stepped on my face.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		We thought you were dead.

<b>				VOICE
</b>		The whole world loves a smart ass.

	They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away
	into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three
	feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to
	himself.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What're you shooting at, soldier?

<b>				GUNNER
</b>		Gooks.

	He turns and sees it's an officer.

<b>				GUNNER
</b>			(continuing)
		I´m sorry, sir.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		It's all right, sergeant -- what's
		out there?

<b>				GUNNER
</b>		They were tryin' to cut through
		the wire -- I got 'em all I think.

<b>				OTHER SOLDIER
</b>		Oh yeah -- listen.

	There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it
	stops for aminute then continues hideously.

<b>				GUNNER
</b>		He's trying to call his friends --
		send up a flare.

	The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie
	light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.

<b>				SPOTTER
</b>		Those are all dead, stupid, he's
		obviously underneath 'em --

	They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING
	gets more intense.

<b>				GUNNER
</b>		Wake up the Roach.

	The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is
	leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several
	times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are
	the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

<b>				ROACH
</b>		Yeah, man.

<b>				SPOTTER
</b>		Slope in the wire -- hear him.

	He listens, he does, he nods.

<b>				SPOTTER
</b>			(continuing)
		Bust him.

	Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters
	up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley
	designs all over it.

<b>				GUNNER
</b>		Hear him?

<b>				ROACH
</b>		Sure , yeah.

<b>				GUNNER
</b>		You need a flare --
<b>			
</b><b>				ROACH
</b>		No, it´s cool.

	He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks
	the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it
	across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the
	SCREAM, calculating.

<b>				ROACH
</b>			(continuing)
		He's close -- real close.

	He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into
	the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE
	WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION
	that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or
	pieces of bodies coming down around them.

<b>				ROACH
</b>			(continuing)
		Muhhh Fuhhh ...
<b>	
</b>	He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.


<b>	131  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF
</b>
	They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance.
	Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS
	WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Geez, I wish they'd hurry.

	A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start
	building the bridge.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		Hey, buddy, that boat still runs,
		eh?

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Yeah, it still runs.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		Do me a favor buddy, please.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		What is it?

	He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		Send these out when you get back
		to the world.

	He puts them in Clean's hand.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>			(continuing)
		It's to everyone I really knew --
		the first girl I screwed -- my
		brother -- best friend -- I wanted
		to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
		knowing 'em -- it's been a great
		twenty years. I gotta let 'em
		know.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		What're you askin' me for -- put
		'em in the first helicopter comes
		in tomorrow.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		Nobody comes in here.

	He points up at the mountain ridges.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>			(continuing)
		The N.V.A. 312th -- over there
		the 307th -- on that hill we
		counted fourteen different guns
		in one minute -- they got rockets
		mortars, snipers in those trees,
		there's a million of those shitty
		little bastards out there -- we're
		all gonna die.

	He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>			(continuing)
		I'm gonna be dead.

	Clean takes the letters.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>			(continuing)
		You got a chance in that boat --
		by morning you could be five miles
		down the river.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		We ain't goin' down the river.

	The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>			(continuing)
		What's up river from here anyhow --

	The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded.

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		Spooky.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		Charlie?

<b>				SOLDIER
</b>		No, it'd be spooky without the war
		-- give 'em back.

	He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and
	disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach
	carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra
	M-16's.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We found some bodies -- let's get
		out a here.

	The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical
	downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning
	his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are
	forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas
	canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was
	set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount.


<b>	135  EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN

	The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de-
	bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>			(to Willard)
		I can't see a fucking thing.

	There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of
	tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard
	climbs forward, and looks down.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>			(continuing)
		We hit a big enough one this
		hull will shatter like a Corvette.
		Fucking plastic boat.

	Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole,
	warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean
	joins him, helping.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(shouting to Chief)
		What about ducking into one of
		those tributaries till this river
		slows down?

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Who knows what's up there?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Can't be any worse than this.
		What do you think?

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		I think this river wants to take
		us home fast. I'm practically
		goin' in reverse.

	Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth
	of a tributary.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Well, get in there.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		This whole area is lousy with
		V.C. -- We don't stand a chance.
		Lemme turn around and we'll be
		in Hau Fat in six minutes.

	There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard
	really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Get in there !

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		This is my crew and my fucking
		boat, and I'm the responsible

</b>		Probably is.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Whatdoya think it thinks.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		That we're dumber than we look.

	Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the
	darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of
	it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them.
	It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later.

	Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck
	fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is
	removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Lance -- 'bout twenty meters
		starboard.

	Lance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef
	cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		There in the trees !

	Everything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD
	of heavy BULLETS ripping inti the P.B.R.'s fibreglass hull.

	Lance grits his teeth, FIRING --


<b>	143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN
</b>

<b>	144  POV BEHIND CLEAN
</b>
	He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting
	it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction
	-- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield
	and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy
	burst at the jungle -- trees crumble.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a-
		bitch, it's jammed, oh God,
		it's jammed.

	Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

	Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead.
	He looks angrily to Willard.

	Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps
	up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward
	the cockpit.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Throw me that ordnance.

	Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard
	opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over
	the edge of the cockpit.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		Give me some kind a field a fire --

	BULLETS rip by.

<b>				CHEF

		We're through.

	He climbs aboard and collapses.

		Oh, God --

	is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the
	jungle.


<b>	145  POV. - BEHIND THEM

	He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly.
	There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large
	tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin-
	ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and
	jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES.

	Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79.

	The men sit around, exhausted, brutalized, wounded.
	They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be-

	They smoke pot and eat silently. Lance smokes a
	joint and looks at his gun. Splotches of paint
	have been blown away from the armor shield -- pieces
	of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount.
	The boat is a floating wreck.

	Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack
	by Chief. All of the men are silent.

	Chef comes up from below; he has been wounded in the

	They duck as SHOTS RING OUT from the dock, stitching the
	water across the P.B.R.'s bow. The crew crouches, guns
	trained on the dock as the boat still approaches.

		They're not Cong.

		We're Americans.

	Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure

	Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts:

		I thought it was pretty good,

<b>	160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK

	The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are
	a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save
	for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left
	eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a
	tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-
	troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-
	ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-
	aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons
	and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the
	dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the
	head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-
	cate, with a strength about him.

<b>				PHILIPPE
</b>		Hands on the heads.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		I can't steer with my goddamn
		feet.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Who is the commanding officer?

<b>				CHIEF
</b><b>		I --
</b>
<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
		This is Chief Warrant Officer
		Phillips -- it's his boat. We
		were shot up bad downriver and
		need repairs and food -- we can
		pay you in gold.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Philippe --

	Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope
	from the deck and ties it to the dock.

<b>				LANCE

	Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		As I said, we can pay you in
		gold.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

	He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --

<b>				GASTON
</b>		We share a common enemy -- you
		are our guests.
			(he steps back)
		I am Gaston de marais -- this is
		my family's plantation. It has
		been such for 121 years. It will
		be such after I die.
		This is my son, Philippe -- he
		has fought in Algeria and held
		the rank of Captain. And Henry
		LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
		at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
		servant, Tran Van Kac ---

	Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit
	and three women come forward from different positions --
	all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.

<b>				GASTON

		My youngest son -- Christian --

	They look the Americans over warily and assemble at
	Philippe's command.

<b>				WILLARD

<b>				GASTON
</b>		We took them from the dead.
			(smiles)
		Now -- I assume you want to rest,

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Shower.

	Willard's men look at one another, dazed.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We don't want to bother you any,
		we --

<b>				GASTON
</b>		A man of war is never bothered to 
		aid an ally -- you will follow me,
		Captain.

	Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks
	up his M-16 by the stock.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		A habit of men of war, sir --
		you understand.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Of course, Captain -- an
		unfortunate necessity.

	The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and
	follow.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		What about the boat?

<b>				PHILIPPE
</b>		My men will keep it for you --

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
		boat.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Chief.

		Come with us.

	They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs
	and follows.


<b>	164  FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS
</b>
	Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-
	ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the
	many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		A suitable accomodation for
		your men, captain -- you will,
		of course, be quartered with us --

	He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The
	Chief is hesitant.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Go ahead --

	Philippe leads them on, muttering.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Captain, this way.

	Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward
	the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and
	about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and
	young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the
	opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.
	Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.

<b>				GASTON
</b>			(continuing)
		Magnificent, eh, Captain?

	Willard looks.

<b>				GASTON
</b>			(continuing)
		It is very good -- there is no
		current -- It is very good. I
		have never seen one like it in
		all Indochina. I was in Paris
		when it arrived -- do you know
		what might have caused --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Looks like a two thousand pound
		to me. Yeah, a two thousand
		pound bomb.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		No, I've seen those in Normandy.
		This is much better.
			(pause)
		My country -- my country could
		never originate this. Magnificent.

	Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard
	looks between him and this big hole in the ground in
	amezement.


<b>	165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING

	A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The
	Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.
	Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,
	caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just
	stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,
	reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		A hot shower, hot damn.

	He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and
	caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and
	he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a
	shower is.

	Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of

	its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His
	battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and
	burns.

	He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above
	which is a large mirror. There is an album on the
	marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random.

</b>		Was it like this sixty years ago?
		Eighty years? But here, even
		eighty years is nothing.

	TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.
	The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.
	The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights
	up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		This food is wonderful ! I can't
		believe the chef is a slope.
		    (turning to Clean)
		Some more?

	Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance
	reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.

<b>				CHEF
</b>			(continuing)
		Hey -- Lance.

<b>				LANCE
</b>		Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
		wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,

	And then he looks to his friends for approval.

	Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain
	there is another, more elaborate table, where the
	De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES
	through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the
	group.

	The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.
	Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair
	next to him.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
		better.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		Je vais bien maintenant.

<b>				GASTON

		He is of a paratroop regiment.
		You know the difference between a
		paratrooper and a regular soldier,
		don't you , my dear?

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>			(smiling and taking
			  Willard's hand)
		Yes, they come from the sky.

	She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.

	Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of
	him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is
	forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I would like to know more about
		the .. uh, plaque...

	Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted
	wooden plaque with various tallies on it.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
			(hard)
		This is only  for this war, Captain.
		Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
		regular forces -- 15; South
		Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
		forces and otherwise.
			(pause)
		Americain -- 6. Of course, they
		were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Of course. I -- Once we make
		our repairs, we could send word,
		we could have you evacuated
		from here.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Captain?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You'll get blown outta here some
		day.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		We will never 'evacuate', Captain
		-- this is our home. Indochina is
		ours; it has been so for a hundred
		and twenty-one years, there is
		something to say for that.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		The Vietnamese think it's theirs
		-- I guess the Americans do,
		too.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		But we civilized it. A place
		belongs to those who bring light
		to it, don't you agree.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I always thought the French came
		here to get the rubber.

<b>				PHILIPPE
</b>		Excuse me, I must attend to my
		men.

	He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		May I ask where the Captain is
		going in his little boat?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We were going upriver when we
		got caught in a storm, ma'am.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Upriver? Why upriver? There is
		nothing there, only jungle.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Do you know that jungle?

<b>				GASTON
</b>		When I was a boy, my father would
		take me there, to hunt. There
		are a few savages, but no man
		can live there, no white man.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What about an American named
		Kurtz?

	There is a pause.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		We have never heard of him.

	Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.

<b>				GASTON
</b>			(continuing)
		Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,
		Captain.

	Willard turns.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Good night.

	Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The
	servants clear the table.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		You must realize, Captain -- we
		have lost much here -- I, my
		husband. Gaston -- his wife and
		son.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I'm sorry to hear that.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>			(rising)
		Cognac?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I should be checking on the
		boat.

<b>				ROXANNE

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No. Not really.
<b>	
</b>		I was discharged from the army
		four years ago. I went home,
		wasted some time, bought a Mustang
		Mach 1, drove it a week. Then
		I re-upped for another tour. No,

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		Then you are like us.

	She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>			(continuing)
		What will you do after the war?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I just follow my footsteps, one
		at a time, trying to answer the
		little questions and staying away
		from the big ones.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		What's a big question?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Kurtz.
			(pause)
		I know you've heard of him.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				WILLARD

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		That strange things.. terrible
		things have occured around this
		American, Kurtz.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What things?

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		Gaston would never tell me. It
		was asubject not to be spoken of,
		Captain.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yes.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		Did you know -- deeper in the
		jungle, upriver -- there are
		savages?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I know.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.

	A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for
	him.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>			(continuing)
		What a pity, you don't drink.
		Since my husband died, there
		are so many things I must do
		alone.

	She takes a sip.

	Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left
	partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace
	overlooking the river.

	Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and
	scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing
	into the darkness.

	the first disappears into the thicket.

	in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with
	a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick
	work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently,
	he drags the body out of sight.

	The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears

	He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE
	moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL
	BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up
	her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		I will fix you breakfast.

	He starts to get up.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I'm afraid I won't have time --
		I gotta --

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		Whe you reach the boat you will
		find that half your fifty calibre
		stores -- a case of grenades, a
		mortar and two M-16's and a
		case of clips are being
		transfered to us by your order.

	He stops -- seemingly stunned.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		So that's it.

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		You may think what you wish,
		Captain, but I like you very
		much.

	She turns to go.

<b>				WILLARD

<b>				ROXANNE
</b>		Then Philippe will have to kill
		all of you.

	She leaves.


<b>	189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS

	He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring
	ammunition boxes.

	Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the
	Chief and crew with M-16's.

<b>				GASTON
</b>		Two of my men deserted last
		night. It happens from time
		to time. I assume my daughter
		told you of our conditions.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Your daughter.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		They taking half our ammo,
		Captain -- said it was your orders.

	He pauses for a second.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		That's right -- I did.

	The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the
	engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I guess this is whAt men of war
		do -- eh?

<b>				GASTON
</b>		We endure, captain -- you can
		blow up the house and we will
		live in the cellar -- destroy
		that and we'll dig a hole in the

	The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over
	at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Next time we  get in a good fire
		fight -- I'd like to know how
		she was, Captain.

	Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls
	up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains
	the contents of all those ammo boxes.  .50 calibre; clips;
	grenades.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Holy shit.

<b>				CLEAN
</b>		What did you put in all those
		ammo boxes?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Rocks, sand -- those two men
		who deserted.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		When'd you do it?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		While you were sleeping.

	He lets the board drop.

	Willard moves to the back of the boat.


<b>	192  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW

	The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark
	and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of
	the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth,
	just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half
	speed, alert, ready for anything.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		We moved deeper and deeper into
		the jungle. It was very quiet
		there. It was like wandering on
		a prehistoric planet, an unknown
		world ... where the men thought
		they crawled to, I don't know.
		For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --
		exclusively.

	Willard looks out ahead and points.

	They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO
	REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank.


<b>	193  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE

<b>	194  POV. OF THE P.B.R.

	They pass in front of the village which is rundown and
	completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the
	flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what
	they once were.

<b>				CHEF (O.S.)
</b>		Flood.

<b>				CHIEF (O.S.)
</b>		No -- most of 'em are still

<b>	195  POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE
</b>
	The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
	the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown
	darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange
	birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge
	snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
	jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.


<b>	196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE
</b>
	Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
	and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
	upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
	vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
	the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
	dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
	up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
	once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
	gateway to paradise.

	The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
	seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
	orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
	The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
	were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
	and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
	peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
	it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
	being.

	Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
	cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
	hell.

	Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
	The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
	the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a
	darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this
	hole.

	The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back
	about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on
	the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls
	on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		-- All right, Lance --

	Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into
	the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a
	tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle
	as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE
	MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The
	smoke clears.

<b>				LANCE

</b>		No -- leave it --

<b>				CHIEF

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Thta's not Charlie's work --

	There is silence.

	past the smoking mound.


<b>	198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY
</b>
	The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist
	swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into
	an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		Toward the night of the fifth
		day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
		judged ourselves about eight
		miles from Kurtz' base.
		Everything was still, the trees,
		the creepers, even the brush
		seemed like it had been changed
		into some kind of stone. It was
		unnatural, like a trance. Not
		a sound could be heard. I began
		to think I was deaf -- then the
		fog came suddenly, and I was
		blind too.

	The boat disappears in the thick fog.

	We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close.

<b>				CHIEF
</b>		Which way? Right or left?

	But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his
	M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,
	and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having
	caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in
	horror.

	The P.B.R. moving up the river. The men are practically
	in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They
	don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons.


<b>	214  WHAT THEY SEE
</b>
	Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed
	in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts
	of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face
	paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity
	about them, men and boys, standing passively watching
	the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,
	white and blue.


<b>	215  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.
</b>
	The men of the crew are not the same men who began this
	voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.
	The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
	picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
	savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a
	hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with
	mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
	wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.
	Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
	difficult journey. They start to move to their gun
	positions.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Just stand here with me where
		they can see us. Do nothing.


<b>	216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.
</b>
	MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers
	and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The
	men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly
	without weapons. The natives standing across the river
	make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept
	the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-
	tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of
	feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in
	almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little
	boat to penetrate.


<b>	217  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms

	something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition
	was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.


<b>	218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER
</b>
	Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river
	now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping

		I know, I know, it's all right.
		Come in this way. It's mined
		over there. This way. It's

	Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and
	they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the
	water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina
	wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding
	them safely in.

	A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
	fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near
	the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-
	merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some
	of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the
	ground. Chef nods at the bodies.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Charlie?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Looks that way.

<b>				CHEF

		Who's he?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		God knows.

	tered with mud and blood.

<b>				WILLARD

		Who the hell are you?

</b>		Moonby. Got any Winstons?

<b>				WILLARD

		What <u>is</u> this?

</b>		Oh, they're simple enough people.

<b>				MOONBY
</b>		Oh, you don't talk to Colonel

		So Kurtz is alive.

</b>		Kurtz. I tell you, that man
		has enlarged my mind.

	He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his
	mind's expansion.

<b>				MOONBY
</b>			(continuing)
		But lemme tell you, <u>he</u> is the
		most dangerous thing in every
		way that I've come on so far.
		He wanted to shoot me. The
		first thing he said is, 'I'm

		I deserted from my army. He
		said, 'I'm going to shoot you
		just the same.'

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Why didn't he shoot you?

<b>				MOONBY
</b>		I've asked myself that question.
		I said to myself, why didn't he
		shoot me? He didn't shoot me,
		because I had a stash like you
		wouldn't believe. I hid it in
		the jungle; the wealth of the
		Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish
		-- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut
		Heroin; the Gold of the Golden
		Triangle. and Acid -- I make
		Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
		come on like piss. Now I'm
		Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen

		Everything. I forgot there's
		such a thing as sleep. Everything.
		Of love, too.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Love?

<b>				MOONBY
</b>		Oh, no, not what you think...
		Cosmic love. He made me see
		things -- things, you know.

	The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has
	picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress.

<b>	228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW

	As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
	where a moment before there was only jungle.

	They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
	than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
	and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
	in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
	AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
	emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
	equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
	are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
	of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
	if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
	the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
	where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
	the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
	primitive and more savage than any since the time
	of Captain Cook.

	They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
	appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
	wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
	loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
	strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
	long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
	decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
	this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Who are you?

<b>				MOONBY
</b>			(breaking in)
		His name is...

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I'm not ever goin' to tell you
		to shut up again.

	Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing
	comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they
	are to see him.

<b>				MAN
</b>		Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...
		Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.
		Walter Kurtz, commanding.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What happened here?

<b>				COLBY
</b>		What -- happened here.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Charlie?

<b>				COLBY
</b>		NVA regulars. They're coming
		again tonight. Tet -- their
		big -- assault.

	Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what
	to say to this man, but he understands the forces that
	pounded him. He takes his arm.


<b>	229  REVERSE ON COLBY
</b>
	looks at Willard, not understanding.


<b>	230  REVERSE ON WILLARD
</b>
	Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I'm taking you back.

	Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.

<b>				MOONBY
</b>		Oh, no, don´t say that.

<b>				COLBY
</b>		Take us back. Take us back !
		But, the operation -- the team.
		Colonel Kurtz has such plans for
		-- the team.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Take me to him, Major.

	Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on
	poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

<b>				COLBY
</b>		I had nothing to do with these
		operations -- I did not do the
		planning -- none of us did.
		It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
		was the genius. You'll see --
		the genius of our Colonel. He
		should be made a General, don't
		you think? A General? It's...

	Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
	knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

	Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
	a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
	attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
	though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
	primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
	well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
	with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes
	almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what
	seems to be a serious wound.


<b>	232  VIEW ON WILLARD
</b>
	This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,
	automatically, he comes to an attention.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		I'm Kurtz.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(he salutes)
		Captain B.L. Willard reporting
		his presence, sir.


<b>	233  VIEW ON KURTZ
</b>
	looking at him a long time. Then he returns the salute,
	and simply:

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		At ease...
			(pause, as he regards him)
		Sit down.


<b>	234  MED. VIEW
</b>
	There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.
	But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on
	the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.
	Then Kurtz does.

	Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to
	Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from
	man to man, ritualistically.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(slowly)
		Why did you come to ... my province.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We were attacked -- down river.
		We need supplies and medical 
		help.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		You were not coming here, to
		see me?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(finding it more and 
			 more difficult to go
			 on with this lie)
		No -- no, sir.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		You came up my river -- in that
		small boat. So simple. I
		always thought the final justice
		would come from the sky, like
		we did.
			(pause)
		You are the final justice,
		aren't you?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What do you mean, Colonel?

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(gently)
		What other reason could you
		have come? A Captain. Ranger.
		Paratrooper. Graduate of the
		Recondo School. Am I right
		about these things?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You know you're right.

	There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Then the Agency approached you.
		Maybe in a bar in Quinon or
		Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay
		for one life. Perhaps a village
		elder, or a tax collector.
		Nobody's orders but your own.
		Exciting work.


<b>	235  CLOSE ON WILLARD
</b>
	He remains silent.


<b>	236  CLOSE ON KURTZ
</b>
	He smiles.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		You've spent tome at the Royal
		Tracking School of Malaysia.
		I can tell from the way the
		laces on your boots are tied.
		I understand you, Captain. We
		understand each other.

	There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.
	Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws
	it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act
	assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Do you know me?

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Yes.

	Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
	word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>				(continuing)
		Do you know <u>me</u> ?

	He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
	back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
	heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
	distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Holy shit.


<b>	237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT
</b>
	Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like
	a primitive civilization.


<b>	238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL
</b>
	Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall
	next to him. He is exhausted.

	Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef
	approaches, crouches down.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Captain -- they've been probed
		all this week -- Cong and NVA
		regulars. There's gonna be a
		big offense any time.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I know.

	Lance stirs; starts to wake up.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		What are we doing here?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
		just like he said.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Yeah, I can see that. He's 
		fuckin nuts --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		He killed that guy without feeling
		anything.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Not a thing.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		When you kill Cong, don't you
		feel something.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Sure.
			(thinking)
		Recoil... I feel the recoil of
		my rifle.

	Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.


<b>	239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE
</b>
	Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
	and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
	emplacement.

	Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
	to Willard as he passes.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		This is good -- triple overlapping
		fields of fire -- walls so thick
		ordinary artillery just cleans
		the moss off their surfaces.

	A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
	runs off to her bunker.

	WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
	of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
	children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
	every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
	scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
	a big piece of almost raw meat.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		I've done things, when I was
		alone in the jungle -- that I
		never told anyone about.

	They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
	half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
	fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
	lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
	there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
	built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
	fire into the jungle beyond.

	Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their
	beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
	Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
	bayonets.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		This is evil -- evil, Captain.
		We're all gonna die here.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yeah, I know.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		I don't get it -- You said your
		mission was to kill him. Let's
		do it, an' get our asses outta
		here. This  Kurtz is ruining the
		war; I mean, this don't look
		good for America !

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(lost in his thoughts)
		... he's an amazing officer.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		You got to kill this sonuvabitch
		-- Lance and me, we don'´t
		understand none of this -- Jesus,
		Captain -- I don't wanna die here
		-- Do it quick.

	Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of
	nods, sucking a joint.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yeah. I know.

	He thinks.


<b>	240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
	VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with
	the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard
	steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.


<b>	241  WILLARD'S VIEW
</b>
	An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
	quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
	ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
	military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
	but have now fallen into decayed disuse.

	There are other indications of the modern headquarters
	this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
	tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
	There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
	maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
	garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
	spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
	fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
	"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

	Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
	Willard.

<b>				MOONBY
</b>		He's asleep -- don't bother him.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		I'm awake.

	Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(continuing)
		You. Get out.

	Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with
	Willard.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(continuing; suddenly)
		<u>I said get the fuck out !</u>
			(to himself)
		I'm going to kill the little
		weirdo myself tomorrow.
			(he shows some pain
			  when moving his
			  midsection)
		He´s only stayed alive this long
		because he's a good orderly and
		medic. He knows how to use a
		hypodermic.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You're gonna get hit tonight,
		bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
		regulars.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		That's right, the little gook-
		pricks. But they are noble
		little gook-pricks, noble.
		Because they fight with their 
		guts, like animals. And for an
		<u>idea !</u> That's rich. We fight
		with ingenious machines and
		fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
		But I'll call in a major blotto
		airstrike tonight. We'll have
		ourselves a helluva airstrike
		tonight, a lightshow. How do
		you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
		Light My Fire...'

	Willard shrugs.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(continuing)
		Do you?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yeah, I like it...

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		I <u>love</u> it.

	He rests back, grinning.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You've gone crazy.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(angrily)
		No. My thinking is clear.
			(calmly)
		But my soul has gone mad.

	Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his
	stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He
	literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(continuing)
		My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !

	Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the
	wound.


<b>	242  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
	Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,
	witnessing the proceedings inside.

<b>				CHEF
</b>			(muttering)
		Kill him -- come on, why don't
		you kill him


<b>	243  INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD -
</b><b>	         NIGHT
</b>
	Willard examining the wound.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(in pain)
		Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.

	Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He
	takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing
	Kurtz and injects him with the drug.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(continuing; looking
			  up in pain)
		You see how stupid it would have
		been to blow out my brains? I'm
		dying from the gut anyway.

	Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly
	frightened, holds up his hand.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(continuing)
		No -- I don't want to sleep.
		I want to think. Water. Give
		me water.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You can't have water after
		morphine.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Still playing by the rules.
			(almost
			  affectionately)
		You're a damn good kiler.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(still holding the
			  second morphine)
		How's the pain?

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		How's yours?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I can handle it.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Pain is easy to handle -- but
		nobility.. the nobility of a
		man is judged by how much Truth
		he can handle.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What Truth?

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		The truth that you were sent
		here to murder me, ans so far
		you haven't done it. And do
		you know why?
			(looks at him)
		Yes, you know why.
			(he looks)
		Your mission makes about as much
		sense as those idiots who sent
		you on it. <u>Asshole</u> ! <u>Schmuck</u> ! 
		How long does it take you to
		figure out that nobody knows
		what they're doing here.
			(coldly)
		Except me.

	He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(continuing)
		Gimme water.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		No water.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		You know what you're doing?
		<u>You are interfering with my</u>
		<u>plans</u> !

	He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches
	him impassively.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(continuing)
		This water's got Moonby's acid
		in it --

	He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all
	over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(continuing)
		Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
		Think of it. A whole regiment
		of those shitty little Cong --
		War. Total war -- war like you've
		never known it. It's beautiful
		-- you'll love it. Trust me.


<b>	244  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT
</b>
	We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen
	to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
		do it.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
		napalm on Speed, too. It's
		spectacular, you'll see.

	Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern
	with Chef.


<b>	245  INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
</b>
	Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his
	hand.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Look into the jungle. You can't --
		it's too terrible. You have to
		smear yourself with warpaint to
		look at it -- you have to be a
		cannibal.
			(whispered)
		That's why warpaint was invented.
		Then it becomes <u>your</u> jungle.

	Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		How did we get here?

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Because of all the things we do,
		the thing we do best -- is <u>lie</u>.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I think think a lie stinks.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Oh Captain, that is so true.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Stinks. I could never figure --
			(he drinks from
			  the canteen)
		I could never figure how they
		can teach boys how to bomb villages
		with napalm -- and not let them
		write the word 'fuck' on their
		airplanes.

	Willard drinks more of the LSD water.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(angrily)
		You could never figure it because
		it doesn't make sense.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Fuck no.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		I'll tell you what makes sense !
		<u>Air strikes</u> ! <u>White Phosphorus</u> !
		<u>Napalm</u> ! We'll bomb the shit out
		of them if they don't do what
		we want.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		We'll exterminate the fuckers !

	Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified.
	He draws his bayonet.

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Captain -- kill him.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Think of it -- for years, millions
		of years, savages with pathetic
		painted faces were scared shitless
		that fire would rain down from
		the sky. And goddamn, we made
		it happen. <u>God</u>  <u>bless</u>  <u>Dow</u>  !

<b>				CHEF
</b>		Kill him !

	Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively,
	Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic
	FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets.

	He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort

<b>	249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER

	Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay-

	Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions
	around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior --
	Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans,
	even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow,
	salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates
	around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and

	A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted
	operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS
	BURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly
	loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid
	stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as
	7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of
	the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-
	geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally
	as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is
	blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.

	The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS
	penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.
	Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face
	seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to
	another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv-
	ing in front of us.

	The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene-
	trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men
	LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight.

	Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter.


<b>	265  FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE

	the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.
	Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce
	weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol-
	ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE.


<b>	266  FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY

	The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming.
	Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands,

	biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most
	horrible savagery.

	The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break
	over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into

	cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches

<b>	271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ

	at his side and steps out.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>			(yelling)
		Charles !

	They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one
	who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his
	gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his
	holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz
	beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He
	moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding
	it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls
	and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and
	rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly
	encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The
	machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty
	and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.

	all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz
	into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the
	crawling Kurtz

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Go away -- hide yourself.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		What are you doing?

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Going back  - to the jungle to
		die.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I'm taking you back. You can 
		still live.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		I had immense plans.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I'm gonna get you out of here.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		I was on threshold of great 
		things.

	Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck,
	holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The
	spectacle continues in the b.g.


<b>	277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER
</b>
	This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls
	out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages
	to get him onto the boat.


<b>	278  EXTREME FULL SHOT
</b>
	The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of
	Nu Mung Ba.

<b>							FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>	FADE IN.
</b>

<b>	279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING
</b>
	The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds
	circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere
	is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and
	some Montagnards sit near them.

	Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and
	they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the
	field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something.
	Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the
	f.g. below is Lance, dead.

	Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

<b>				COLBY
</b>		Who is he?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		He was the tragedy -- the tragedy
		of this war.

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>

<b>	280  THE P.B.R.
</b>
	battered, moving slowly down the river.


<b>	281  TIGHTER VIEW
</b>
	Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious.
	Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those
	left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.
	Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.
	Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.
	The battle is not over.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Don't. Don't frighten them away.

	Willard looks down at him.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		So you understand this?

	Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his
	eyes. There is a slight smile.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Do I not?


<b>	282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW
</b>
	The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		My river... my people... my jungle...
		my ideas... my country... 		
		my wife...
			(he looks at Willard)
		... my death.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You had immense plans... immense plans...

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		Yes...

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I'm taking you back.

	Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming
	intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper
	at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry
	that is no more than a breath.

<b>				KURTZ
</b>		The horror, the horror.

	We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.
	The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,
	craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

<b>				COLBY
</b>		There.

	Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC
	helicopters hooping toward them.

<b>				COLBY
</b>			(continuing)
		How did they know?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		They must have seen the fire.

	The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of
	them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US.

<b>				COLBY
</b>		They're coming to rescue us.
		They're Medevac.


<b>	283  CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD
</b>
	He stares up at the sky.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>					(to himself)
		They're coming to take us back.

	Copters directly overhead.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>			(continuing)
		Yeah.

<b>				COLBY
</b>		Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yeah.

	He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap-
	proaching rescue helicopter.


<b>	284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER
</b>
	It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the
	sky.


<b>	285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY
</b>
<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yeah.

	Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in FIRING at
	the retreating American helicopters.


<b>	286  HELICOPTER'S POV - ON THE BOAT
</b>
	The men in the boat FIRING AT US as we fly further into
	the air, the boat getting smaller and smaller.

<b>				WILLARD (V.O.)
</b>		... Don't remember a lot about my
		rehabilitation... but I was sent
		back to the world before the fall
		of Saigon...


<b>	287  EXT. MARINA DEL RAY - EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
</b>
	MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina.

	Pause. Willard is very silent.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		I never answered questions about
		Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his
		unimportant papers -- but for the
		most part I saved everything.
		There were other letters, personal
		ones written earlier to his wife.
		I brought them to het. I watched
		the fall of Saigon on television
		in a bar in Alameda...


<b>	289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</b>
	A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-
	borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.

	Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past
	the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under
	his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working
	on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy
	looks back.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Hi.

	Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the
	door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in
	mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a
	sense of purity about her, though she is not young.

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		Come in, Captain Willard.

	He enters.


<b>	289  INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY
</b>
	Everything good and secure and desirable about America.

	She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous.

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		Can I get anything for you?

	There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is
	there in the various stages of his career.

	Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her.

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>			(continuing)
		Did you know him very well?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You get to know each other pretty
		well out there.

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		And you admired him?

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		He was a remarkable man. It was
		impossible not to --

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		Love him... Yes, it is true.
		That's the hard part for me... I
		knew him better than anyone ... I
		knew him best.

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		You knew him best.

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		You were his friend... You must
		have been, if he had given you
		this...
			(the packet)
		If he sent you to his home. He
		was the best this country had --
		he was --

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yes, I know...

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		I'll never get over it -- But
		I'll always remember him...

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Both of us...

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		Men looked up to him...
			(she loses herself
			  in a thought)
		He died as he lived...

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		His death was -- yes, he died as
		he lived.

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		Were you with him, when...

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		Yes I was... He said his last
		words to me.

	Pause.


<b>	290  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD
</b>
	A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what
	she will ask.

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		What were they?


<b>	291  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>
<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		Tell me.


<b>	292  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD
</b>
	remembering that incredible day moving down the river.

	Our VIEW LOOSENS

<b>				KURTZ'S WIFE
</b>		Tell me what he said.

<b>				KURTZ (V.O.)
</b>		The horror ! The horror !

<b>				WILLARD
</b>		He spoke of you, ma'am.

	He sits there looking at her.


<b>	293  EXT. TIGHT HIGH ANGLE ON THE MARINA DEL REY BOAT
</b>
	The cocktail party is breaking up. Willard is one of
	the few guests left.

	We MOVE FROM Willard standing alone on the deck of the
	boat. Moving back through the departing guests. Charlie
	is getting ready to leave himself. We MOVE CLOSER to
	Willard.

<b>							DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>	294  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. - DAY
</b>
	the boat floating down the river. Kurtz's body; an exhaust-
	ed, half-dead Colby. And HOLDING Kurtz, Willard. We HEAR
	THE DOORS' "THE END" as we present the END TITLES.

<b>							FADE OUT.
</b>


<b>	              				THE  END
</b>
