In 1896, a construction engineer from the British Army, J.H.
Patterson is sent to build a railway bridge across Kenya's Tsavo River for the British East African Railway.
Soon after he arrives, workmen begin to disappear at night from their tents - never to be seen alive again.
The engineer soon discovers that a pair of man-eating lions are stalking around the bridge and campsites, killing the workmen for food.
He tries a number of different methods to get rid of them, but the beasts always seem to know what Patterson is doing and avoid being shot.
After 30 men have been killed Patterson's boss recruits a hunter, Charles Remington to hunt down and destroy the lions.
But the lions continue killing the workmen until they flee the camps, jumping onto the train as it rolls through Tsavo.
Now Remington, Patterson and his aide must face these brilliant yet frightening monsters alone.
