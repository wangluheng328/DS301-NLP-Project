A new doctor finds himself with a ward full of catatonic patients.
He is disturbed by them and the fact that they have been catatonic for decades with no hope of any cure.
When he finds a possible chemical cure he gets permission to try it on one of them.
When the first patient awakes, he is now an adult having gone into a catatonic state in his early teens.
The film then delights in the new awareness of the patients and then on the reactions of their relatives to the changes in the newly awakened.
