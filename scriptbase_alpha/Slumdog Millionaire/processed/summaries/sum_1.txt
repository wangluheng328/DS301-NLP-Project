Eighteen year old Jamal Malik is having an amazing answering streak on Kaun Banega Crorepati?
(2000), the Indian version of the television game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (1998).
He's only one correct question away from the big prize.
However, some, including those associated with the game show, question how someone like Jamal, a self confessed non-genius who grew up in the slums of Mumbai, can be doing so well on the show when others who are brighter, more educated and wealthier than him have failed.
Is Jamal cheating?
Is it purely luck that they have asked him the questions to which he knows the answers?
Seeing Jamal's life journey to this point ultimately answers these questions.
His life journey includes being orphaned at an early age; growing up with an older brother, Salim, who was both his guardian/protector and antagonist; and having a relationship since childhood with another orphaned child, a girl named Latika.
His motivation for being on the show also may provide some answers to his success.
Perhaps it was all just meant to be.
