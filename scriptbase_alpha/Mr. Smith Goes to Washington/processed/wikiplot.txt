The governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert "Happy" Hopper (Guy Kibbee), has to pick a replacement for recently deceased U.S.
Senator Sam Foley.
His corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), pressures Hopper to choose his handpicked stooge, while popular committees want a reformer, Henry Hill.
The governor's children want him to select Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), the head of the Boy Rangers.
Unable to make up his mind between Taylor's stooge and the reformer, Hopper decides to flip a coin.
When it lands on edge – and next to a newspaper story on one of Smith's accomplishments – he chooses Smith, calculating that his wholesome image will please the people while his naïveté will make him easy to manipulate.
