Brian is born in a stable on Christmas, right next to You Know Who.
The wise men appear and begin to distribute gifts.
The star moves further, so they take it all back and move on.
This is how Brian's life goes.
The Jews are looking for a release from the Romans, Spiritual and political decay, keep looking for signs and a group decides Brian is the Messiah.
He cannot convince them he is not.
He joins the Peoples' Front of Judea, one of several dozen separatist groups who actually do nothing, but really hate the Romans.
While not about Jesus, it is about those who hadn't time, or interest to listen to his message.
Many Political and Social comments.
