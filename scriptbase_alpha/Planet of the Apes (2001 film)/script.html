</p><p>INTO FRAME: JUPITER. A massive swirl of colors. FILLING THE SCREEN for a beat.
</p><p>CONTINUE PAST THE PLANET: as JUPITER'S MOONS come INTO VIEW forming a breathtaking line of frozen orbs.
</p><p>CHANGE DIRECTION

</p><p>INTO FRAME
</p><p>a long, fur-covered FINGER punches buttons on the board.  In a precise SERIES.  A course is digitally IMAGED.
</p><p>TILT AND REVEAL: the <u>startling</u> vision of a CHIMPANZEE at the controls.  Fitted with monitoring helmet and vest.  His deep brown eyes sentient, intense.
</p><p>A RED LIGHT suddenly <i>FLASHES</i> ON THE PANEL.  A <i>BEEP</i> sounds harshly.
</p><p>The chimp (PERICLES) quickly re-enters his command sequence.  The <i>BEEP</i> gets faster. And the faster
      it gets, the more flustered he gets.
</p><p><span class="heading">int. flight simulator - continuous
</span></p><p>THROUGH THE WINDOW the LIGHT BEGINS to FILL THE FRAME. Pericles tries to shield his eyes; now he can't see the BUTTONS on the board. Begins to SLAP at the controls in confusion.
</p><p>The <i>BEEP</i> turns into one long wail.  The view in the WINDOW <i>FREEZES.  </i>The CONTROL PANEL goes BLACK.
</p><p>REFLECTED ON THE CONTROL PANEL - A SECOND FACE

<p>Pericles bangs the equipment hard like a toddler.

<p>Leo grabs a branch to defend himself.  Holds it like a spear.

</p><p>But ATTAR attacks like a force of nature, graceful with his power, unrestrained with his speed.  The humans in his way are overwhelmed.  Only Karubi and Daena are left at large from this group.
</p><p>NEW ANGLE: a slight BOY (BIRN, 15) eludes several APES.  Feral and wild, he is very agile.  But he doesn't see an APE HANGING ONTO A TREE A LIMB.  THE APE SNAGS BIRN WITH HIS FEET.  Wrenches him into the air.
</p><p>KARUBI circles back to try and rescue the Boy.  Two more APES drop down -- slam him to his knees.  Daena is bowled over.  Karubi covers her with his body as a NET envelops them.

</p><p>AN APE ON HORSEBACK crashes through the brush dragging two HUMANS behind.  Leo waits til the Ape rides by --- then launches himself at the APE RIDER.  Grabbing onto the reins, swinging himself up and KNOCKING THE APE off his mount.

<p>LEO reaches out for a CHAIN snaked in the dirt -- suddenly whips it around the foot of his HANDLER. Yanks him off balance. His SPEAR flies from his hand. Leo grabs it. Points it right at Ari's neck.

<p>Karubi and Daena watch intently.
</p><p><span class="shot">widen

</p><p>CLOSER: LEO LOCKS EYES WITH ARI. Ari is thrown by the intimacy of this act. No human has ever dared look her in the eyes this way. LEO LEANS INSIDE THE 'SPACE' BETWEEN HUMANS AND APES. HE SPEAKS INTENSELY.

<p>Ari is startled, frozen.
</p><p>ANGLE
</p><p>DAENA realizes the HANDLERS have been distracted by Leo.  The DOOR TO THE FEMALE PEN is still open.  She suddenly breaks out and runs for the gate.  Limbo knocks her down hard.  Turns furiously to Ari.
</p><p>limbo
</p><p></p><blockquote>Look what you've started.  Now I'm getting a headache. </blockquote>
<p>Leo starts to back up, pressing the spear to her neck.
</p><p>leo
</p><p></p><blockquote>Get back.</blockquote>
<p>Limbo raises his hands, as if he's scared.
</p><p>limBO
</p><p></p><blockquote>Oh, please, please don't hurt her.</blockquote>
<p>Leo keeps his eyes on Limbo's hands -- and doesn't see LIMBO USE HIS FOOT to reach up and grab the spear.  In one second he <i>wallops</i> Leo.  Stands over him.
</p><p>limBO (CONT'D)
</p><p></p><blockquote>Who needs this aggravation.  Hold him.</blockquote>
<p>Limbo hefts the spear. Ari makes her choice --
</p><p>arI
</p><p></p><blockquote>Sell him to me. </blockquote>
<p>limBO
</p><p></p><blockquote>Are you crazy?  He's wild... </blockquote>
<p><span class="parenthetical">(re: Daena)
</span></p><p></p><blockquote>... they're both wild.  </blockquote>
<p>arI
</p><p></p><blockquote>Then I'll buy them both.</blockquote>
<p>Limbo freezes -- a look comes over his face.  Nothing gets his attention like money.  Leo and Daena exchange a look.
</p><p>liMBO
</p><p></p><blockquote>That would be expensive ... very expensive.  </blockquote>
<p>ari
</p><p></p><blockquote>I'm sure we could come to a deal.</blockquote>
<p>Limbo scratches his head. He can't resist.
</p><p>arI (CONT'D)
</p><p></p><blockquote>Deliver them to my house.</blockquote>
<p>liMBO
</p><p></p><blockquote>I'll have to mark him first.</blockquote>
<p>In one quick thrust Limbo BRANDS Leo.

</p><p><span class="parenthetical">(<i>reacting</i>)
</span></p><p></p><blockquote>You know what this is.</blockquote>
<p>Thade does. He is stunned. Caught off guard. Everything has turned around so quickly ... until --
</p><p><span class="shot">onto the bridge:
</span></p><p>Ari rushes in looking for Leo, but finds --
</p><p>THADE -- who leaps on her so quickly Leo dare not shoot. THADE stands with one hand gripping Ari's throat tightly. Leo points the gun at Thade.
</p><p>leo (CONT'D)
</p><p></p><blockquote>Let her go.</blockquote>
<p>thADE
</p><p></p><blockquote>I'm willing to die. ... Are you willing to see her die? </blockquote>
<p>Leo realizes he has no option. He sets down the gun.  KICKS it to Thade.  It spins on the hard surface.  INTO FRAME -- ATTAR -- appears on the bridge.  Picks up the gun.  HOLDS IT UP as if he can't trust his eyes.
</p><p>thADE (CONT'D)
</p><p><span class="parenthetical">(to Attar)
</span></p><p></p><blockquote>With that weapon they are no longer the weaker race.  We can't allow it. </blockquote>
<p>Leo speaks quickly to Attar.
</p><p>leo
</p><p><span class="parenthetical">(re: ship)
</span></p><p></p><blockquote>Look around ... this is who you really are. We brought you here. We lived together with you in peace ... until Semos murdered everyone.</blockquote>
<p>atTAR

<p><span class="parenthetical">(turns to Thade)
</span></p><p></p><blockquote>Can it be true?</blockquote>
<p>thADE
</p><p></p><blockquote>They'd make us their slaves. ... <u>Bring me the gun.
</u></blockquote>
<p>Attar is confused. He finally presents it to Thade.  Thade shoves Ari to the floor. Takes the gun. Thade let's his long finger wrap around the gun's trigger.
</p><p>thADE  (CONT'D)
</p><p></p><blockquote>Does it really make a difference how we arrived here? We are the only ones who will survive.</blockquote>
<p>Ari pleads with Thade.
</p><p>ari
</p><p></p><blockquote>Please don't hurt him.</blockquote>
<p>Thade <i>reacts</i>, looks at Ari.
</p><p>thADE
</p><p></p><blockquote>I was always less than human to you.</blockquote>
<p><span class="parenthetical">(points the gun)
</span></p><p></p><blockquote>Someday if humans are even remembered, they will be known for what they really are... weak and stupid ...</blockquote>
<p>Thade PULLS THE TRIGGER.  Nothing happens.  He pulls it over and over.
</p><p>leo
</p><p></p><blockquote>Stupid people, smart guns.</blockquote>
<p>Thade turns to Attar.
</p><p>thADE
</p><p></p><blockquote>Kill them. </blockquote>
<p>CLOSE ON ATTAR -- He doesn't move.
</p><p>THADE (CONT'D)
</p><p></p><blockquote>  I'm your commander.  Obey me.</blockquote>
<p>atTAR
</p><p></p><blockquote>Everything I have believed in... is a lie. You and your family have betrayed us. I will not follow you anymore.</blockquote>
<p>CLOSER -- LEO IS MANEUVERING THADE TO ONE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE AWAY FROM ARI AND ATTAR.
</p><p>thADE
</p><p></p><blockquote>When you're dead and this place buried beneath the rocks ... no one know the truth.</blockquote>
<p>Leo takes one more STEP aside.
</p><p>leo
</p><p></p><blockquote>You will ... forever.</blockquote>
<p>LEO PRESSES HIS HAND TO THE WALL.  Thade doesn't understand what he's doing until —

</p><p><span class="shot">close on thade's hands
</span></p><p>With a terrifying <i>roar</i> Thade struggles and begins to slide the DOOR back.

</span></p><p>Thade slams his hands down on the buttons.  He is trapped.
</p><p><span class="shot">angle

<p>Ari touches Leo in a gentle, grooming manner. There is heartbreak in her voice.
