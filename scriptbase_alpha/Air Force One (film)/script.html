<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               INT. C-130 HERCULES TURBO-PROP - NIGHT
</b>
               Eighteen combat-ready special forces, wearing assault black, 
               jump packs and combat gear, stare down the deep end of a 
               greasy ramp into the night sky.  Village lights flicker 19,000 
               feet below.

               The STRIKE FORCE LEADER signals to his team.

               Without a moment's hesitation, they dive into the darkness 
               and plummet toward earth.

<b>               EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
</b>
               A military GUARD, old Soviet-style uniform, rounds the corner 
               of the large estate toting an AK-47.

               A red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and, after a 
               beat, the red dot seems to bleed.  The Guard collapses dead.  
               Two other GUARDS are dispatched with single, silenced shots.

               A Strike Team member at a junction box awaits a signal.

               Through infra-red binoculars the strike Force Leader watches 
               his assault troops as they take positions.

<b>                                     STRIKE FORCE LEADER
</b>                              (into headset/in 
                              Russian)
<b>                         GO!
</b>
               On the estate - as the power goes out.  The team on the 
               mansion's front porch pops the door and pours in.

<b>               INT. MANSION - NIGHT
</b>
               FOLLOWING - the FIVE TEAM MEMBERS as they rush a stairway in 
               phalanx formation.  They nearly knock over an old lady, who 
               in turn lets out a blood curdling scream.

<b>               UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR -
</b>
               The team kicks open a door.  Rushes into the room.

<b>               INT. BEDROOM -
</b>
               Assault weapons pointed at the bed.  The soldiers yank back 
               bedsheets to reveal IVAN STRAVANAVITCH, a middle-aged man 
               and his half-naked 18-year-old concubine.

<b>                                     SOLDIER
</b>                              (in Russian)
                         Get up, now!  Up!

               The soldiers pull Stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out 
               of the room.

               FOLLOWING -  As they push down the hallway.

               MANSION SECURITY GUARDS rally with haphazard gunfire.

               Out come the strike force's flash-bang grenades.  Exploding 
               everywhere, disorienting Stravanavitch's men.

<b>               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT
</b>
               Signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position.  
               The Strike Team evacuates across the field and forces a 
               struggling Stravanavitch into the low-hovering copter.

               The commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of 
               Stravanavitch's guards break into the clearing.  They open 
               fire.

               And the mounted machine guns on the helicopter return.

               One of the Strike Team members takes a bullet to the neck.  
               He's' pulled by his comrades into the chopper as it lifts 
               into the sky, its guns spitting lead...

                         Forks clanking against plates and 
                         the din of a hundred conversations, 
                         broken by...

               The DING, DING, DING of a SPOON tapping against a wine glass.

               SUPER TITLE:   "MOSCOW - THREE WEEKS LATER

<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               INT. BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Hundreds of men and women in formal evening wear sit at round 
               banquet tables.  A HUSH falls over the guests as the DINGING 
               continues.  All attention turns to the front table.

               A rotund, silver haired-man in his late sixties rises and 
               sidles past U.S. and Russian flags up to the podium 
               microphone.  He is STOLI PETROV, President of Russia.

<b>                                     PETROV
</b>                              (in Russian)
                         Thank you for joining us this evening.

               Petrov's harsh Russian issues through the room.  But over it 
               we hear a young woman's voice translating.

<b>                                     TRANSLATOR (V.0.)
</b>                         Tonight we are honored to have with 
                         us a man of remarkable courage, who, 
                         despite strong international 
                         criticism...

<b>               AT THE FRONT TABLE -
</b>
               A translator's words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man 
               in his mid-forties.  Worry lines crease his forehead and the 
               touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult 
               years in office.

               This man is JAMES MARSHALL, and he is the PRESIDENT of the 
               UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  He busily makes last minute changes 
               to his speech.

<b>                                     TRANSLATOR
</b>                              (V.0. earpiece)
                         Has chosen to join our fight against 
                         tyranny in forging a new world 
                         community.  Ladies and gentlemen, I 
                         give you the President of the United 
                         States of America...

               Mr. President.

               Thunderous applause as Marshall rises and approaches the 
               podium.

               At the back of the room, DOHERTY, a senior policy adviser 
               whispers to the President's Chief of Staff ED SHEPHERD...

<b>                                     DOHERTY
</b>                         Maybe we should consider running him 
                         for re-election instead of the U.S.

               The applause dies as Marshall begins to speak.

<b>                                     MARSHALL
</b>                              (in Russian with 
                              subtitles)
                         Good evening and thank you.  First I 
                         would ask you to join me in a moment 
                         of silence for the victims of the 
                         Turkmenistan massacres.

               The room remains silent a few beats.  Most guests respectfully 
               bow their heads.

               Marshall begins again, but this time in English.  The young 
               woman translates simultaneously for the Russian audience.

<b>                                     MARSHALL
</b>                         As you know, three weeks ago American 
                         Special Forces, in cooperation with 
                         the Russian Republican Army, secured 
                         the arrest of Turkmenistan's self-
                         proclaimed dictator, General Ivan 
                         Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic 
                         reign had given new meaning to the 
                         word horror.  I am proud to say our 
                         operation was a success.

               Applause from the audience.  Marshall turns the page on his 
               speech.

<b>                                     MARSHALL
</b>                         And now, yesterday's biggest threat 
                         to world peace... today awaits trial 
                         for crimes against humanity.

               During the applause, Marshall pulls a page from the speech, 
               folds it and slides it into his pocket.  He removes his 
               glasses and looks out into the crowd.  His tone becomes more 
               personal.

                         finally pulled our heads out of the 
                         sand, we finally stood up to the

                         Every time we ignore these atrocities-- 
                         the rapes, the death squads, the 
                         genocides- every time we negotiate 
                         with these, these thugs to keep them 
                         out of gig country and away from gig 
                         families, every time we do thiS.E. 
                         we legitimize terror.

               Terror is not a legitimate system of government.  And to 
               those who commit the atrocities I say, we will no longer 
               tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer

               and waves at them dramatically.

                         You know, most girls aren't as lucky 
                         as you.  For most girls seeing the 
                         Bolshoi ballet would be the experience 
                         of a lifetime.

               Rose nods, smiling a half-smile.  After a thoughtful beat, 
               Alice gets up and crosses to the Presidential suite.  She 
               exchanges words with the Aide standing outside the door and 
               comes back, covering her disappointment.

               As Marshall moves toward the conference room, he bends and 
               gives Rose a quick peck on the cheek.  It all reeks of

               SHOOTS each of the agents in THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

               Silenced pistol. Blood all over the desk. Gibbs removes each 
               of the agent's weapons and slips them into his waistband. He 
               waits a few beats, takes a long sip of coffee, then exits

               Gibbs nods to Korshunov. Korshunov nods one of his men.  
               NEVSKY removes one of his videotapes, pops the front cover 
               exposing the tape. Across the face of the tape is a thin 
               strip of a rubbery substance. Nevsky pulls the strip up and 
               out, making a kind of fuse. He reaches for a pack of 
               matches... courtesy matches, sporting the Seal of the 
               President.

               SERVICE AGENTS try to get at their weapons, but Gibbs has 
               caught them completely off-guard.

               Several silenced central nervous system shots (head and neck) 
               and the five agents slump back, their red blood cascading 
               down the creases of the fine Corinthian leather chairs.

               Nevsky tosses the cassette up the corridor... smoke pours 
               out of it. Smoke screen.

               BAZYLEV and ZEDECK catch the guns Gibbs tossed and hold them

               A SECRET SERVICE AGENT emerges. Sees what's happening. Reaches

               Marshall cautiously enters the room. Ready for action.

               The room is empty, but it's been trashed by the firefight.

               The sound of voices... coming from the Duke game which still 
               plays. Marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones.

               It's dead. He tries the regular phone. Dead. Hangs it up in 
               disgust.

               He steps on some glass. It's a broken frame holding a 
               PHOTOGRAPH of Alice and Rose. He picks up the photo and lays 
               it on a table.

               He thinks for a beat... glances around the room, searching...

               Then he crosses to the closet, opens it and begins rifling 
               through his wardrobe.

               removed one of the ceiling panels. Air supply ducts and

               corridor.

               Vlad still faces the opposite direction.

               Marshall creeps down the hallway, when...

               Beep... Beep... Beep...

               Marshall's watch alarm goes off.

               Marshall dives for the nearest doorway. Vlad swings round to 
               see a figure slip into the senior staff cabin.

               Vlad, unsure of what he saw., cautiously heads toward the 
               staff cabin. As he nears, he bends over a dead Secret Service 
               agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening 
               watch. It wasn't Marshall's after all. No matter. Vlad 
               continues to the staff Cabin.

               Marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a 
               weapon. In the room: some video monitors, leather chairs and 
               phones. stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of 
               the walls.

               Marshall throws the cabinet doors open, revealing...

               A fully stocked MEDICAL CENTER... fold-down operating

               table... high-intensity lights. Equipped to deal with any 
               medical emergency the president might encounter.

               But too late. Vlad kicks the door open.

               Marshall yanks down the operating table, and it smashes into 
               Vlad, knocking him down. Marshall lunges with his knife, but 
               Vlad OPENS FIRE. A HALF DOZEN ROUNDS pump into Marshall's 
               belly. He's thrown back against the wall, then slumps to the 
               floor.

               Vlad approaches the crumpled body. Leans down to examine his 
               victim. He cups his hand under the man's chin and lifts his 
               head. Recognizes him.

               He springs, shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket 
               and into Vlad's spleen. Vlad freezes, unsure of what just 
               happened.

               Marshall is on his feet. Never letting go of the twisting 
               knife, he grabs Vlad by the back of the head and slams his 
               face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink. The 
               mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorist's 
               face. The blood drips down into the white porcelain sink, 
               swirling into the drain.

               Vlad elbows Marshall in the neck, stunning him momentarily.

               He wipes the blood from his face, spins and hits Marshall 
               with a devastating right cross. Marshall reels back against 
               the wall, and Vlad follows, shoving the MP5 into Marshall's 
               throat. Marshall grabs the gun near the trigger...

               Marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his 
               forefinger, then knees Vlad in the balls. Viad pulls the 
               trigger repeatedly as he goes down, but nothing happens.

               Instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against Marshall's 
               face. Like a bat hitting a baseball, it knocks Marshall into 
               the medical closet. The gun goes flying, skittering

               Marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his 
               legs from buckling. Vlad grabs some I.V. tubing and wraps it 
               around Marshall's neck. Marshall struggles for breath, clawing 
               at the tube.

               Marshall pulls his head forward, straining against the plastic 
               tubing. Then slams back into Vlad's head. Viad releases his 
               grip just for a moment...

               The beeping becomes a steady whine.

               ... but a moment is all Marshall needs as he grabs the def 
               ib's CARDIAC PADDLES, turns, and SLAMS them on either side 
               of Vlad's head.

               Vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds... his 
               eyeballs roll, his hair stands on end.  then he collapses to 
               the floor.

               Marshall catches his breath for a moment. Pulls open his 
               shirt. Beneath it he wears a bulletproof Kevlar vest. He 
               lifts the vest and a half-dozen angry welts have blossomed 
               across his skin. The stuff may be bulletproof, but each of

               door. Locked. He knows the others will be coming so he 
               flattens himself against the corridor wall. Trains his gun

               off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the 
               corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some 
               gauze.

               The terrorists seize the moment of quiet, descending the 
               stairs to take position.

               Marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made Molatov

               cocktail and throws it down the corridor. The bottle crashes 
               into a BALL OF FLAME. Catching Bazylev on fire. He yells, 
               drops and rolls. FIRE SUPPRESSING FOAM immediately sprays 
               down from overhead.

               Serge hops Bazylev's burning body and heads down the corridor, 
               looking for this new wildcard. Korshunov grabs a fire 
               extinguisher from the galley and attends to Bazylev.

               toward the rear of the plane.

               Serge moves to the next one. Same procedure. It's empty.

               Moves to the last bathroom, confident he's got him. He wails 
               with his MP5, turning the hatch into swiss cheese. Waits a

               He takes a moment to pull himself together, to clear his 
               head. He hefts the MP5, refamiliarizing himself with the 
               weight and texture of a gun. He checks the clip. Only a

               reluctanty descends to the main cabin.

                         from being a sports fan.

               Zedeck brings the cup of water to Marshall's lips. Marshall 
               tips his head back to receive it.

               Water spills over Marshall's face. He shakes it off.

</b>                         It ain't over, til it's over.

               With blinding speed, Marshall leaps to his feet and swings 
               his arm around Zedeck's throat. He snaps Zedeck's neck with 
               quiet efficency.

               Gibbs fires at Marshall, but Marshall, using Zedeck as a 
               shield, grabs hold of the terrorist'sMP5 and lets loose...  
               mowing down the former Secret Service agent.

               The rest of Gibb's shots pelt against the cockpit controls 
               sending showers of sparks flying.

               Korshunov whips out his gun and lines up a clean shot at 
               Marshall's head.

               Major Caidwell dives in front of the bullet spray taking the 
               rounds in his chest.

               Marshall turns his aim to Korshunov... but Korshunov grabs 
               Alice and presses his pistol to her head.

               Stand-off.

               Korshunov backs away to the steps. Marshall does not lower 
               his gun. Korshunov disappears down the staircase.

               struggling and fighting Alice.

               Korshunov is a foot away from the edge of the ramp... two 
               steps back, he and Alice will take the plunge.

               Marshall lines up his shot. Korshunov laughs as he presses 
               his pistol to Alice's ear.

               Marshall fires, his bullet ripping apart a good deal of 
               Korshunov's face and snapping his body back.

               Korshunov tumbles off the platform, but his limbs are caught.  
               in Alice's. She's knocked to her belly and his dead weight 
               drags her off the edge of the platform.

               Marshall dives down the sloping platform, reaching out for

               Alice tries to grip the platform with her hands, but she 
               can't hold on. Her hand slip off the metallic lip.

               But as she falls, she's caught by the wrist. Strong arms 
               pull her up. Her father's arms. He carries her back to the 
               safety of the plane. She's sobs uncontrollably.

               Marshall turns to see this soldier, a fresh-faced, 19-year-
               old kid, saluting his Commander-in-chief.
