In Blithe Hollow, the outcast boy Norman Babcock lives with his father Perry, his mother Sandra and his teenage sister Courtney.
Norman is considered a freak by his schoolmates since he speaks to the dead, including his grandmother who watches horror movies on television with him.
However nobody believes that Norman has this ability besides his friend Neil.
Norman's deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast meets Norman and tells him that he must protect Blithe Hollow from a witch's curse.
Soon Mr. Prenderghast dies and his ghost explains to Norman that he should get his book and perform a ritual in the witch's grave.
Norman finds the book - a fairytale - and then goes to the seven graves where the men who condemned the witch are buried.
However, Norman is interrupted by the school bully Alvin, and the dead arise and invade the town.
Soon Norman has a dream and finds that the witch is the girl Agatha that was sentenced to death in 1712 due to her medium ability.
Now Norman needs to convince Agatha that her revenge is making her the same as those who killed her.
