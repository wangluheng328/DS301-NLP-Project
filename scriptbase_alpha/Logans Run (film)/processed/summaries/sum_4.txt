In the year 2274, after the world has been decimated by a holocaust, a new society is built and resides in a domed city.
However, it is forbidden for humans to live beyond 30 and you are given two choices, either to go through a ritual called Carousel with the promise of being "renewed", or go on the run and risk being hunted down by an elite police force known as Sandmen.
Logan 5 is just such a man, and when he and his partner Francis 7 find and kill a runner, Logan takes an ankh symbol which identifies a person as a runner.
When the computers of the city find out that Logan is in possession of the amulet, they order him to go undercover and find Sanctuary, the place where all the runners go to live out the rest of their lives.
To ensure this, the computer adds four years to the time crystal on his palm to make it appear that he is on the verge of turning 30.
Logan then meets up with Jessica 6, a member of the underground group that helps runners escape to Sanctuary.
Logan then begins to run, but in the process realizes that there is much to live for and that he is just entering the prime of his life.
