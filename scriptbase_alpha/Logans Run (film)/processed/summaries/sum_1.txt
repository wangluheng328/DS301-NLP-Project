Logan, a Sandman (police assassin), is forced to search for "Sanctuary" - a place to which people have apparently escaped from the sealed city of the future in which he lives.
Jessica is caught up along the way and becomes his companion fugitive as they are both pursued by Francis, a fellow Sandman.
Sanctuary is not what they expect.
