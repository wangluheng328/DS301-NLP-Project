In the year 2274, the remnants of human civilization live in a sealed domed city, a utopia run by a computer that takes care of all aspects of their life, including reproduction.
The citizens live a hedonistic lifestyle but understand that in order to maintain the city, every resident when they reach the age of 30 must undergo the ritual of "Carrousel" [sic].
There, they are vaporized and ostensibly "Renewed."
To track this, they are implanted at birth with a "life-clock" crystal in the palm of their hand that changes colors as they approach their "Last Day."

Most residents accept this promise of rebirth, but some realize it is a brutal population control, and go into hiding to avoid Carrousel.
These fugitives are known as Runners, and there are Sandmen who are assigned to pursue and terminate them.
