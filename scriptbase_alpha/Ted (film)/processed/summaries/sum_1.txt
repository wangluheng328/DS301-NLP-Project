When he was eight years old, John Bennett, friendless and thus lonely, wished that his only friend, Ted his teddy bear who had a voice recorded message "I love you", would love him forever.
John got his wish as Ted miraculously came to life, which garnered Ted his proverbial fifteen minutes of fame.
Twenty-seven years later, John and Ted have remained best friends.
Although physically the same, Ted now has grown-up urges, as vulgar, perverted and immature as they be.
Although she loves John and likes Ted as John's friend, professionally successful Lori Collins, John's girlfriend of four years, believes that John's emotional immaturity and lack of professional drive - John works in a dead end job at Liberty Car Rental - is because of his friendship with Ted, with who he parties all the time.
Although Lori does see John as being her husband one day, that cannot happen as long as the current situation with Ted remains.
But other pressures may prevent a John-Lori happy ending.
One is Rex, Lori's wealthy boss, who does whatever he can to make himself look good and John look bad in Lori's eyes, despite she showing no interest in him whatsoever.
And two and three are father and son Donny and Robert, super-fans of Ted's who will go to any length to have a talking teddy bear as their own.
