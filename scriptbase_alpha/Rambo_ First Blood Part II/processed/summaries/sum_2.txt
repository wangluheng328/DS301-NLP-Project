John Rambo who is now in prison after the ruckus he caused in the previous movie, is approached by his former superior, Colonel Trautman.
It seems that the government's looking for American MIA's in Vietnam, that are still being held there.
Now the man in charge of the mission, Murdock, tells Rambo that his job is to go in, confirm their presence by taking photographs.
Rambo senses that Murdock is not what he seems.
Rambo goes in takes the photographs, but also takes one of the prisoners with him.
When Murdock learns of this, he orders the chopper that's suppose to pick him up to pull out.
Rambo is then captured.
Obviously Murdock's desire was not to find anyone.
Trautman warns him that Rambo's going to come after him.
And that's what Rambo's going to do but first he is going after the Vietnamese and Russians, who brutalized him.
