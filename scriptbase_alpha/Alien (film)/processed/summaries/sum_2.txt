When commercial towing vehicle Nostromo, heading back to Earth, intercepts an SoS signal from a nearby planet, the crew are under obligation to investigate.
After a bad landing on the planet, some crew members leave the ship to explore the area.
At the same time as they discover a hive colony of some unknown creature, the ship's computer deciphers the message to be a warning, not a call for help.
When one of the eggs is disturbed, the crew do not realize the danger they are in.
