In the near future, during its return to the earth, a commercial spaceship Nostromo intercepts a distress SOS from a distant planet.
The seven-member crew are woken up from the hypersleep and the spaceship subsequently descends on the planet.
While exploring the planet, a three-member team of the crew discovers a derelict spaceship and a huge chamber inside it containing thousands of eggs.
When a curious team member goes too near the egg the parasite inside the egg attacks him, rendering him unconscious.
He is brought back aboard, the spaceship takes off.
After a little while the parasite dies and his host wakes up seemingly unruffled.
Everything returns back to normal - but not for long.
