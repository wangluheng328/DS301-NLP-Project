Sam and Molly are a very happy couple and deeply in love.
Walking back to their new apartment after a night out at the theatre, they encounter a thief in a dark alley, and Sam is murdered.
He finds himself trapped as a ghost and realises that his death was no accident.
He must warn Molly about the danger that she is in.
But as a ghost he can not be seen or heard by the living, and so he tries to communicate with Molly through Oda Mae Brown, a psychic who didn't even realise that her powers were real.
