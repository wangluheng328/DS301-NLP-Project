Rudy Duncan is a reformed car thief who's just a day away from being released from prison.
His cellmate and best friend, Nick is on the way out with Rudy, whom he constantly brags about the female penpal he's constantly been writing to.
But in an unlikely turn of events, Nick ends up out of the picture, and Rudy stupidly assumes Nick's identity and ends up spending time with Ashley, Nick's penpal after he's released.
But Ashley's brutal sibling Gabriel and his crew of thugs knew Nick used to work for a casino.
And now Rudy must keep his identity as Nick to save his life, but must reluctantly aid Gabriel and his thugs to rob the casino.
But things aren't what they appear to seem.
