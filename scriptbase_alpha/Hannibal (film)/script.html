<b>     SHE BRUSHES BACK THE HAIR FROM THE SIDE OF HER FACE.

<b>                          STARLING

                instrument of the Italian vernacular, 
                which he called the <u>vulgari eloquentia</u>--
                the eloquent voice of the people: 
                Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core

<b>     ANGLE HER POV. 
</b>
<b>     THE LIGHT HITTING THE SHOVEL OF THE GRAVEDIGGER IN THE 
</b><b>     STRAW HAT.  THE GRAVEDIGGER IS HALF HIDDEN BY THE GROUP HE

</b>
<b>                          MAPP 
</b>                ...<u>what</u>...?

<b>     ANGLE 
</b>
<b>     ON STARLING, AS SHE LOOKS AT THE APPROACHING FIGURE.
</b>
<b>     ANGLE HER POV 
</b>
<b>     THE GRAVEDIGGER, AS HE EMERGES FROM THE GROUP.  WE SEE HE IS

<b>     ANGLE 
</b>
<b>     ON STARLING, AS SHE SHAKES HER HEAD.
</b>
<b>     ANGLE
</b>
<b>     ON THE LABORER, AS HE PASSES BY AN ARRIVING, OLDER LIMOUSINE, 
</b><b>     STARLING AND MAPP IN THE BACKGROUND.
</b>
<b>     ANGLE
</b>
<b>     ON STARLING AND MAPP, AS MAPP AND JIM TAKE THEIR LEAVE FROM
</b><b>     STARLING, WHO IS INDICATING, "I JUST WANT TO BE ALONE FOR A
</b><b>     WHILE." 
</b>
<b>     WE SEE MAPP NOD, AS SHE AND JIM GET INTO THEIR CAR.

</b><b>     LABORER.
</b>
<b>     ANGLE 
</b>
<b>     ON STARLING, AS SHE TAKES HER LEAVE OF MAPP AND MAPP'S
</b><b>     FRIEND, WE SEE THEM PASS BY ANOTHER SMALL FUNERAL, SEVERAL
</b><b>     BLACK CLAD MOURNERS AND AN OLD LIMOUSINE, AT THE GRAVESIDE. 
</b>
<b>     STARLING CHATS WITH MAPP FOR A MOMENT, OBVIOUSLY SAYING SHE,
</b><b>     STARLING, WANTS TO STAY ON AT THE GRAVE.  MAPP NODS, AND SHE
</b><b>     AND HER FRIEND GET INTO THEIR CAR AND DRIVE AWAY.
</b>
<b>     ANGLE 
</b>
<b>     ON STARLING, AS SHE PASSES BY THE OTHER FUNERAL, BACK TOWARD
</b><b>     HER FATHER'S GRAVE. 
</b>
<b>     ANGLE INT THE LIMO.  WE SEE, THROUGH ITS WINDSHIELD, STARLING
</b><b>     CROSS, AND MOVE OUT OF FRAME. 
</b>
<b>     WE SEE THE BLACK COATED ARM OF THE LIMO DRIVER MOVE.  HIS
</b><b>     HAND COMES UP TO THE REARVIEW MIRROR, AND WE SEE STARLING IN
</b><b>     THE REARVIEW MIRROR, AND WE SEE THE DRIVER'S HAND HAS THE
</b><b>     SMALL SCAR IN THE SHAPE OF THE NUMERAL THREE.
