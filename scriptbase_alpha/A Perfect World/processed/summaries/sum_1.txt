A Perfect World touches you from the bottom of your heart.
It is a story about a man and a boy.
A man escapes from a prison with his partner who he does not like.
After escaping, they kidnap a little boy.
It is not a simple kidnapping story as people expect with violence and blood.
This man, as he describes himself, is not a good guy, but not the worst either.
The boy, living with his mom and two sisters, follows their family's religion, which forbids him from celebrating Halloween and Christmas.
The man gives the boy opportunities to play the games that he wants to, tells him what is wrong and what is right, and asks him to be independent and make his own choices.
