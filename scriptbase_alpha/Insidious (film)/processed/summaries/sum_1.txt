The teacher Josh Lambert and his wife Renai move with their three children, the boys Dalton and Foster and the baby Cali, to a big house.
When Dalton is exploring the attic, he falls from the ladder and hits the head on the floor.
On the next morning, Dalton does not wake up and stays in coma, but the doctors are not able to diagnose his problem.
Three months later, weird things happen in the house and Renai sees apparitions.
She is sure that the house is haunted and convinces Josh to move to another house.
Sooner Renai sees ghosts in the new house and Josh does not believe in his wife.
But his mother Lorraine tells him that she had also had a vision of a fiend in Dalton's room.
They invite the medium and Lorraine's old friend Elise Rainier, who brings her team of ghost hunters Specs and Tucker to investigate the supernatural phenomenon.
Elise explains that Dalton is a traveler with the ability of leaving his physical body and travel in astral projection.
Now his spiritual body is lost in a place called Further that is not for the living and entities are gathered trying to get inside his empty physical body.
Among these entities there is a demon that needs Dalton's body to cause pain to the others.
Further, Lorraine discloses that Josh is also a gifted traveler and must seek out Dalton in Further and bring him back.
