In 1967, mine workers find the remnants of an ancient vanished civilization named Abkani that believe there are the worlds of light and darkness.
When they opened the gate between these worlds ten thousand years ago, something evil slipped through before the gate was closed.
Twenty-two years ago, the Government Paranormal Research Agency Bureau 713 was directed by Professor Lionel Hudgens, who performed experiments with orphan children.
On the present days, one of these children is the paranormal investigator Edward Carnby, who has just gotten an Abkani artifact in South America, and is chased by a man with abilities.
When an old friend of foster house disappears in the middle of the night, he discloses that demons are coming back to Earth.
With the support of the anthropologist Aline Cedrac and the leader of the Bureau 713, Cmdr.
Richard Burke, and his squad, they battle against the evil creatures.
