<b>                             X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE 
</b>

                                    Written by

                            David Benioff &amp; Skip Woods





<b>          EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY
</b>
          A two-lane road carves through an endless forest of towering
          black spruce. A flock of pintails skims over the treetops,
          heading south before the first snowfall.
          A young BOY (12), undersized and feral, trudges home, bookbag
          strapped to his back. Black-haired and pale-skinned, the boy
          looks as if he hasn't had a good meal in a long time.
          Before we hear anything the boy turns, watching the bend in
          the road behind him. After a moment we hear the thrum of a
          hard-charging engine.
          An Oldsmobile Super 88 rounds the bend, accelerating as it
          hits the straightaway. The boy steps away from the road but
          the car comes straight at him.
          The boy closes his eyes. The Oldsmobile's brakes clamp down
          on the wheels and the car shivers to a halt with inches to
          spare. Laughter spills from the car's open windows.
          Four HIGH SCHOOL LETTERMEN pile out of the car, wearing their
          leather-sleeved football jackets. GILMAN, the largest of the
          four, shakes his head and laughs.

<b>          GILMAN
</b>          Kid didn't even move. You see that?
          Where's your survival instincts,
          boy?
          The boy says nothing. He readjusts his bookbag and resumes
          his long walk northward.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          Hey!
          Gilman grabs the boy's shoulder and spins him around-
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          The hell you going? You hear me
          talking to you?
          One of the other football players, MASON, walks over and
          inspects the boy's face.

<b>          MASON
</b>          This is the kid whose old man
          robbed the truck stop last year.
          Gilman curls his meaty hand around the back of the boy's neck
          and pulls him closer, scrutinizing him. The four lettermen
          tower over the small boy.

<b>          CONTINUED:
</b>
<b>          GILMAN
</b>          You the one with the convict daddy?
          The boy stares back at Gilman, unblinking.

<b>          MASON
</b>          That's him.

<b>          GILMAN
</b>          What's the matter, you about to
          piss your pants? Answer me.
          The boy says nothing, never looking away from the bully.
          Gilman presses his fist, adorned with a heavy class ring,
          against the.boy's cheek.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          You a tough guy like your daddy?
          Gilman shoves the boy, forcing him to stumble backwards. The
          boy regains his balance, never taking his eyes off Gilman.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          You want to play tough guy with me?
          Huh?
          Provoked by the boy's lack of fear, by the insolence of his
          stare, Gilman rears back and punches him in the face.
          The boy falls to the ground. Blood spills from a gash in his
          cheek where the class ring cut him.

<b>          MASON
</b>          (a ringside announcer)
          Right cross to the face... and he's
          down!
          The football players laugh, looking down at the fallen boy.
          The boy stands. There is still no sign of emotion on his
          face. No fear, no anger, no evident pain.

<b>          GILMAN
</b>          What's the matter? You want some
          more?
          The boy doesn't look away. The bully swings, cracking the boy
          in the side of the head, knocking him down again.
          GILMAN (cont'd)
          (to his friends)
          Let's get out of here.

</b>          Walking back to the car, Mason slaps Gilman on the shoulder.

<b>          MASON
</b>          You gave that little pissant
          something to think about.
          Gilman grins and looks back at the boy, expecting him to be
          sprawled and crying on the ground.
          Instead the boy stands again, brushes the dirt off his shirt,
          and walks toward Gilman.

<b>          GILMAN
</b>          You got to be kidding me. I'm gonna
          knock the--
          But Gilman's words die in his throat as he sees something
          impossible happening. The gash on the boy's cheek knits
          itself shut, leaving no sign of injury.
          Gilman is so shocked he doesn't see the boy's fist whizzing
          toward him, striking him in the nose. And then another punch.
          And then another.
          The boy is far smaller and weaker than Gilman, but he fights
          with a ferocity that seems inhuman, punching and kicking and
          headbutting, doing whatever it takes to fell his enemy.
          Gilman, stunned by the intensity of the assault, goes down,
          trying to protect his face from the blur of blows.
          Mason tries to pull the boy off his friend and suffers a bite
          to the hand. He howls with pain and backs off.
          The other two football players, amazed to see their leader
          getting pummeled by a boy half his size, watch in awe.
          The boy growls as he batters the bully. He grabs Gilman's
          collar and lifts the football player's head off the ground,
          prepared to deliver the coup de grace with his right fist.
          Three bone claws spring from the boy's hand, serrated and
          razor sharp.
          Everything stops. Mason, clutching his wounded hand, quits
          hollering and stares. The other two football players blink
          and slowly back away.
          Even Gilman, moaning on the ground, hushes and tries to crawl
          backwards, away from this beast on top of him.

</b>          But the boy is more shocked than-any of them. He stares with
          horror at the claws, this part of him he never knew existed.
          He stands and stumbles away from Gilman. Mason runs over,
          lifts his punch-drunk friend to his feet, and hustles him
          toward the Oldsmobile.
          The other football players pile in, slam the doors shut, and
          speed off, leaving the boy alone by the side of the road.
          The boy stares at his claws and for the first time we see
          fear in his eyes. He screams, a scream that echoes over the
          black spruce, into the darkening northern sky.

          LOGAN wakes. with a wordless shout, sitting upright,
          shirtless, in a bed covered with shredded bedsheets.
          KAYLA SILVERFOX (25) wraps her arms around him and whispers
          in his ear.

<b>          KAYLA
</b>          It's okay... shh... it's okay.
          Logan pants, chest heaving, eyes wild, gripping the tattered
          sheets in his fists. Kayla holds him tight until his bone
          claws retract.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          I'm right here with you. Okay? I'm
          right here with you.
          Kayla, a full-blooded Innu, wears her long black hair pulled
          back in a ponytail. She's been sleeping in one of Logan's
          flannel shirts.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          The war dreams or the one where
          you're a kid?
          Logan takes a deep breath, finally calming down. He relaxes
          into Kayla's arms.

<b>          LOGAN
</b>          The one where I'm a kid.
          Kayla runs her fingers through his thick hair, kissing his
          forehead. He sees that she has a small cut on her forearm. He
          takes her arm and looks at the wound.

<b>          EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT
</b>
          A traveling carnival has come to a seaside New England town.
          The brightly-lit Ferris Wheel spins a few hundred yards
          inland from the dark Atlantic.
          LOCALS roam through the carnival, lining up to ride the Tilt-
          A-Whirl. KIDS carrying plumes of cotton candy race from shoot-
          'em-up games to free throw competitions.
          A CARNY BARKER of the old school, wearing a patched-suit and
          a derby, beckons the curious to his attraction.

<b>          CARNY BARKER
</b>          Come see the notorious Bird Man!
          Half-man, half-eagle, is he an
          angel from Heaven or a spawn of
          Satan? Ladies and gentlemen,
          tonight is your last chance to see
          the creature you've all been
          hearing about:
          We follow two BOYS who hand the barker their tickets, pull
          aside the curtain and step into the sideshow...

          .joining a small crowd of CURIOUS ONLOOKERS. The tent is
          dark save for a spotlight fixed on a tiny stage.
          SHERRLENE, a peroxide-blonde in her fifties, whose tanned
          hide is covered with interlaced tattoos, slaps a tribal beat
          on a pair of bongos.
          The crowd hushes. A tall man in a hooded robe shuffles toward,
          the stage like a boxer long past his prime. He stands in
          front of the gawkers, head bowed, face shadowed by his hood.

</b>          Finally BEAK throws off his robe and raises his wings to the
          crowd. As advertised, he looks like an amalgam of man and
          bird, with three-toed, clawed feet and dirty-feathered wings.
          His very human, tired brown eyes are set in a face dominated
          by a long sharp beak. He stares back at the gaping crowd.
          Beak looks more pathetic than monstrous. His skinny limbs
          don't seem very strong and he projects an air of weary
          resignation, not menace.
          But when he flaps his gray wings and caws at the onlookers,
          the children shriek in terror and bury their faces in their
          father's legs.

          Sherrlene and Beak sit at a card table, playing gin and
          drinking bourbon.

          He throws down his hand in disgust.

<b>          SHERRLENE
</b>          You always hold out for gin. You
          could have knocked a while ago.

</b>          Yeah, well, I'm an eternal.
          optimist.
          Sherrlene tallies the points.

<b>          SHERRLENE
</b>          All right, I'm gonna hit it. You
          want to come look for shells with

</b>
          The small log cabin sits in a clearing in a jack pine forest.
          Winter has come to the north country; the ground and tree
          branches are covered with several inches of snow.
          Logan chops firewood behind the cabin, splitting the logs
          with expert axe strikes, smoking a cheap cigar.
          His nose wrinkles as he sniffs the air.

</b>          Smells like government.
          Behind Logan, two approaching men in dark suits and black
          overcoats glance at each other. Logan, halving another block
          of wood, doesn't turn around.
          One of the newcomers, STRYKER, was a colonel in the Special
          Forces. He still has the look. His hair is cropped short, his
          bearing is military, and his blue eyes are fierce.

          Logan parks in the lot of a sprawling brick grammar school.
          He gets out of the truck and walks toward the main building.
          The school day has ended. STUDENTS meet up with their MOMS or
          DADS for the ride home.
          As Logan rounds a corner, he stops in his tracks, looking
          around. Something's not quite right.
          Logan'ducks his head at the last. possible second and a
          snowball whizzes past, missing him by inches.
          Six FOURTH GRADERS (four boys and two girls) charge at him,

          graders chase after him, round the corner with their throwing
          hands cocked, ready to launch some serious ice.
          Logan is nowhere in sight.
          The fourth graders turn in confused circles, searching for
          their target, snowballs melting in their hands.

          floor window ledge. He has already formed six perfect
          snowballs, with which he proceeds to pelt the fourth graders.
          The kids run, screaming and laughing, nearly colliding with
          Kayla, who rounds the corner and stares up at Logan.

          limbs from fallen trees. TEAMSTERS in forklifts load logs
          onto flatbed trucks.

          Rounding a corner on the narrow access road, Kayla nearly
          collides with a man in a long black coat. She slams on the
          brakes and the truck shudders to a halt.
          The man's back is turned to the truck, his head bowed. His
          hair hangs below his shoulders, clotted with dirt, as if he's
          been sleeping in the woods for weeks.
          Kayla leans out of the open truck window. Before she can
          speak, the man in the long black coat turns.
          It's not just his size that frightens us, though the man is
          massive. It's not just the four-inch-long black talons

          The local dive opens early. TOWN DRUNKS sit by themselves,
          smoking cigarettes, sipping the day's first hair-of--the-dog,
          reading the paper or staring into their beer.
          Victor Creed sits at the bar, carving a crude smiley face
          into the wood with the claw of his index finger. He looks up
          and sees the BARTENDER staring at him. The bartender doesn't
          approve of the vandalism, but he's not about to say anything.
          Creed taps the rim of his glass. The bartender comes over
          with a bottle of George Dickel Tennessee whiskey. He fills
          Creed's glass halfway-- a standard pour.
          Creed stares at the bartender. He taps the glass again. The
          bartender, hand shaking, fills the glass to the brim.
          Creed raises the whiskey to the light.

          He downs the full glass of whiskey with a swallow. He looks
          around the bar, at the pool table in the back, the Wurlitzer
          jukebox, the stacked bottles of liquor.

          Finally Creed turns to look at Logan. He stands, towering
          above the smaller man.
          Logan sees a splotch of dried blood on the back of Creed's
          hand. Creed knows Logan is looking at it. He lifts his hand
          to his mouth and licks the blood off.

          Sweet girl. Tasted like strawberry
          jam.
          The bone claws burst from Logan's hands, pale, white, and
          serrated. He growls and swings at Creed's head.
          The big man is fast. He ducks under the claws, grinning and
          circling like a boxer, happy that he's finally got a decent
          adversary.
          The bartender and the local drunks have seen plenty of bar
          fights, but not ones featuring clawed mutants. They run.
          VICTOR CREED (cont'd)
          You can scare off the civilians
          with those, sonny boy. But I got
          claws of my own.
          He swings, raking his talons across Logan's chest, drawing
          first blood. Logan lunges at Creed and the battle begins.
          -The pace of the combat is startling, the physical power
          stupendous. A missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing out
          the guts of the jukebox. Logan jumps at his enemy and gets
          swatted into the wall, smashing the plasterboard.
          Creed grabs Logan by the collar and tosses him onto the pool
          table. Creed brings his fist down, looking to pulverize
          Logan's skull, but the smaller man rolls clear. Creed's fist
          shatters the slate and the table collapses.
          Clearing his head on the sawdusted floor, Logan sees the
          eight ball rolling past. He picks it up and hurls it at
          Creed's head.
          Creed catches the eight ball in his left hand and squeezes
          his fist shut. He opens his hand and lets the powdered
          remains spill onto the floor.
          Logan springs to his feet and swings at creed, again and
          again, his claws whooshing through the air.

          glass shards and alcohol.
          Logan sees a lit cigarette in an ashtray on one of the
          tables. He picks the butt up and flicks it over the bar.
          The cigarette ignites the spilt alcohol. Creed roars and
          rises to his feet, a burning man.
          He vaults over the bar and advances on Logan. The flames
          consume his overcoat, licking at his skin. Creed slaps them
          out with his palms, apparently oblivious to the pain.

          A full moon shines down on the frozen landscape. Logan has
          exited the Alkali Lake complex beyond the high walls of the
          compound. The lake itself shimmers in the moonlight.
          Logan stares at the lonely moon. A wolf howls in the
          distance.
          His breath rises above him in the cold air; his wet hair
          freezes. Ignoring the gusting wind and bitter chill, he runs
          through the snow toward the distant woods.

<b>          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Logan runs. Pine trees tower above him. He enters a clearing
          where the virgin snow glitters beneath the moon.
          He stops moving and peers through the darkness. He smells
          something coming closer.
          A pack of GRAY WOLVES emerges from the woods, surrounding
          Logan. Snow dusts their fur. They look hungry, their blue
          eyes unblinking as they watch this pale interloper.
          The LEADER OF THE PACK, a muscular brute far bigger than his
          comrades, snarls at Logan. Logan stares back at the wolf.
          The wolf jumps at Logan, fangs bared, aiming for the man's
          throat. Logan sidesteps and the wolf hurtles past, skidding
          on the snow when he lands.
          Logan and the wolf circle each other, looking for weakness.
          The wolf gnashes its wet teeth and pounces again.
          Man and beast battle in the moonlight, a shadowy combat of
          ferocious velocity, of gleaming fangs and gray fur.
          The wolf lunges for Logan's throat again, but this time Logan
          catches the wolf in one hand and slams it to the snow.
          The wolf, desperate to escape, rakes Logan's arm with his
          claws. Logan ignores the bloody welts.

          Logan stands over the newly-subservient alpha wolf. The other
          wolves in the pack stare at the strange champion.
          Intense light shines on Logan's face. He turns and sees that
          he's surrounded by a dozen SOLDIERS wearing tactical armor.
          Powerful flashlights are mounted to the barrels of their

          neighborhood.

<b>          EXT. SHEEP BARN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Logan bursts out of the barn on the Harley. The tires spin on
          the snow but Logan is an experienced rider. He steadies the
          bike, steers it onto the blacktop and accelerates, heading in
          the opposite direction from Agent Zero.

<b>          EXT. HUDSON FARM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Agent Zero grabs his rifle and jogs over to a black SUV with
          tinted windows and off-road tires.

<b>          EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY
</b>
          Logan speeds down the road, Agent Zero in hot pursuit. Zero
          gains ground, both hunter and quarry racing past 100 MPH.

<b>          INT. SUV - DAY
</b>
          Agent Zero grabs an Atchisson assault shotgun from a rack
          behind his seat that holds an impressive array of weaponry.
          He lowers the passenger window and gets a bead on Logan, who
          swerves to keep himself (and his more fragile motorcycle) a
          tricky target.

<b>          EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY
</b>
          Agent Zero fires six shells in rapid succession. Hundreds of
          steel pellets scream over the motorcycle, perforating the
          face of a smiling farmer on a fertilizer billboard.
          Logan turns and sees the SUV closing on him. Agent Zero rams
          the bumper into the Harley and Logan very nearly loses
          control, managing to right the bike at the last second.

</b>          Logan accelerates and opens up thirty yards of breathing
          room. He turns and sees Agent Zero catching up again.
          Logan clamps on the brakes, hard.
          He holds out his left hand and extends his claws. The tips of
          the blades scrape the asphalt and sparks fly.
          The SUV cannot brake in time. As it hurtles past the
          motorcycle, Logan's claws hit the SUV's front tire and shred
          it instantly. A split-second later he shreds the rear tire.
          The SUV totters, falls to its side, and barrel rolls across
          the empty road. It ends up on its roof in a drainage ditch,
          wheels still spinning in the air.
          Logan turns his bike and pulls up next to the upended SUV. He
          lowers the kickstand, stands, and walks to the driver's side.
          Agent Zero, bloodied and dazed, has managed to push open the
          door. He leans out and aims his shotgun at Logan, who slices
          the weapon into four pieces with a sweep of his claws.
          Logan grabs Agent Zero by the back of the neck and hauls him
          out of the car.

<b>          LOGAN
</b>          Those were good people back there.
          Innocent people.
          Agent Zero surreptitiously pulls a commando knife from a
          sheath on his ankle.

<b>          AGENT ZERO
</b>          You ever notice good people tend to
          die when they spend time with you?
          He swings the knife at the side of Logan's neck.`Logan
          catches Agent Zero's wrist and slams it against the door
          frame.
          Agent Zero drops the knife with a pained smile. He didn't
          think that would work.

          Logan stands at a pay phone beside the Texaco station,
          watching a couple of SKATEBOARD PUNKS practice their ollies.

          open bags of pork rinds and pouring them down his gullet.
          Dukes is the biggest man you've ever seen. By a long shot.
          Just shy of seven feet tall and weighing in at half a ton,
          he's beyond fat. Beyond obese.
          His eyes look like pinpricks in the swollen enormity of his

          flanks, his flesh trembling with each breath.

          Maybe it's time to give the pork

          Dukes swings his arm. Despite his enormous mass, the man
          moves with surprising speed. Not quick enough to catch Logan,
          though, who ducks beneath the blow.
          Dukes's forearm, thicker than a fire hydrant, smashes through
          the steel shelving. Bags of pork rinds and potato chips
          tumble to the floor.

          for the exits.
          Dukes blasts through the cereal aisle, too, with a great

          face, angering him further. Logan jumps out of the way as
          Dukes brings down his massive fists. Coconuts explode.
          Dukes charges after Logan, shattering watermelons, stacked
          grapefruits, clusters of bananas.
          After a thirty second rampage Dukes is exhausted, his giant
          chest heaving as he gasps for air, his hands and face
          splattered with remnants of crushed fruit.

          around, trying to buck the little rider, but Logan's got one
          arm wrapped around Dukes' throat and he's not letting go.
          The spinning makes Dukes a little dizzy and he slows down.
          Three adamantium claws shine in the big fellow's face,
          reflecting the overhead fluorescent lights.
          Dukes quits, his massive shoulders slumping. He sinks to his

          commando knife. The third drums the beat of the current song
          on the vinyl booth's backrest.
          The fourth hand pets PANTERA, the nubile mutant sitting on
          his lap, a beautiful young woman entirely covered in
          glistening black fur. Her yellow eyes glitter.
          Logan approaches the table. Barbarus stares up at him.
          Pantera purrs, yellow eyes on Logan.

          Logan ducks under them and continues to bob and weave as
          Barbarus advances behind a whirlwhind of black steel.
          Logan slashes and one severed hand falls to the ground.
          Barbarus howls, stabbing at Logan with his three good arms.
          Logan's claws flash through the air again, and another neatly
          severed hand lands on the table.
          Logan retracts his claws and curls one finger: come at me.
          Barbarus, shamed and furious, gathers himself and charges.
          Logan times his punch perfectly, pivoting on the ball of his
          foot and hitting Barbarus with an uppercut that sounds like a
          well-hit baseball.
          Barbarus crashes to the floor. Pantera hisses and pounces at
          Logan, her black claws aimed at his face. Logan backhands
          her. She hits the floor and slides across the hardwood.

          An instant before impact, Creed sidesteps the car and punches

          Created in the 1960s by an underground hydrogen bomb test,
          the Alkali Lake cavern is the second biggest in the country,
          smaller only than the salt caverns of the Gulf Coast, home of
          the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

          size of the Super Dome, with walls of rough granite, the
          cavern is loud with the constant thrum of ventilation and
          high-powered machinery. Heavy steel pillars support the
          ceiling of the cavern.
          Ten thousand stainless steel isolation tanks crowd the floor,
          arrayed in a grid, each tank slightly larger than a coffin.
          TECHNICIANS walk in between the tanks, checking gauges,
          writing notes in clipboards.
          More technicians sit on a raised podium in the center of the
          cavern, overlooking the Eleven, entering information into the
          computers that monitor the sleeping army.
          Logan is awed by the sight. Hines has descended the staircase
          ahead of him. He follows after her.

          Kayla sits behind the wheel of her pickup. Victor Creed walks
          toward her, black talons raking five gashes on the hood.
          Kayla has been expecting him. She pulls her backpack out from
          behind the seat and takes from it a hypodermic needle and a
          plastic IV bag filled with dark blood.
          Creed tears the truck's door off its hinges and tosses it

          Logan sits panting in the chair, gripping the ends of the arm

          electricity. It comes and he arches again, all the muscles in

          Kayla steps into the room. Logan sits slumped motionless in
          the electric chair. She detaches the copper halo. The skin
          beneath the metal is singed but it quickly begins to heal.
          Kayla stares at the man she betrayed, hesitates for a moment
          and exhales.
          She unfastens the titanium manacles. Logan is still
          unconscious. Kayla shakes him gently.

          Creed swings at Logan's head, Logan ducks, and the fight

          This is melee so efficient that no motion is wasted. Every
          lunge would kill any other adversary. Every parried blow
          would shatter a normal man's arm.
          Kayla, bleeding from the nose, staggers to her feet. She
          helps up Hines and pushes her toward the door.

          Creed tries to stomp Logan's face, but the smaller man rolls
          out of the way and gets back on his feet.
          The mutants battle down the corridor, claws whistling through
          the air.
          A team of SENTRIES charge around the corner, wearing tactical
          armor and carrying XM8 assault rifles. They level their

          The sentries wave cheerfully and depart.
          Creed and Logan are equally skilled, but Creed's superior
          size and strength begin to wear the smaller man down.
          Creed slams him into the wall, opening fissures. Holding both

          enhanced kneecap into Creed's groin.
          The big man groans. Logan spins Creed around, jamming him
          against the wall. He tries to skewer Creed with the claws of
          his right hand but Creed moves his head at the last moment.
          Logan's claws are buried to the hilt-in the wall. He strikes
          at Creed with his left hand, but Creed dodges again. All six
          of Logan's claws are deep in the solid rock wall.
          He brings his hands. together, the adamantium blades slicing
          through granite as if it were cheesecake.
          Creed ducks under the claws an instant before they shred him.
          He grabs Logan in a-bear hug.
          A large section of the wall behind them falls out, and,
          unable to halt their momentum, Logan and Creed tumble through
          the hole, disappearing from sight.

          abandon your mission, and your
          mission is simple! Kill the
          mutants! Kill them wherever you
          find them!
          Stryker points at Logan.
          STRYKER (cont'd)

<b>          THIS IS YOUR FIRST ENEMY!
</b>          Ten thousand cloned murderers turn on Logan, soulless black
          eyes focusing on their target.
          Logan stops his march beside one of the massive steel pillars.
          that supports the cavern ceiling.

<b>          LOGAN
</b>          (to Kayla)
          Get the hell out of here.

<b>          KAYLA
</b>          What are you doing?

<b>          LOGAN
</b>          Bringin' down the house.
          He sweeps his claws clean through the pillar, at an angle.
          The uppermost section shears off and drills into the floor
          with a concussive whump that spiderwebs the concrete for
          thirty feet around the impact site.
          Stryker realizes what Logan is doing.

<b>          STRYKER
</b>
<b>          ATTACK! ATTACK!
</b>          The Eleven charge. From above we can see the full-scale of
          the onslaught, wave upon wave of cloned murderers closing in.

</b>          Logan runs to the next pillar and slices through it. Creaks
          and groans sound overhead, as the tremendous weight above
          exerts pressure on the remaining weight-bearing supports.
          Most of the ten thousand can't get close to Logan, but they
          all want in on the first kill.
          Whirling, slashing, stabbing, kicking, Logan scythes a circle
          of devastation, spray-painting the floor with the black blood
          of the Eleven.
          He reaches a third pillar and chops through it.
          Kayla eyes the ceiling nervously and hurries toward the exit.
          STRYKER (cont'd)

<b>          STOP HIM, YOU IDIOTS! STOP HIM!
</b>          Even Logan can't hold back the tide for long. Talons rake his
          face, his arms, his chest. But still he battles, slicing
          through a fourth pillar, a fifth.
          Tremendous fissures split the rock ceiling. Dust and rocks
          fall onto the cavern floor as the fissures widen.
          Logan sees that the cavern's collapse is imminent. He can no
          longer hold off the Eleven's assault.
          An instant before the clones can shred him, he jumps, using
          his claws to scale one of the still-standing steel pillars
          with the grace and speed of a leopard climbing a tree.
          One of the clones follows, using his black talons in the same
          fashion, grabbing at Logan's feet.
          When Logan is forty feet above the throng of teeth-gnashing
          clones, he severs the pillar below his feet. The clone
          chasing him can climb no farther, can do nothing but roar and
          hiss at his escaping prey.
          Logan swings himself onto the steel staircase, where Kayla
          waits beside the open door. He races up the stairs.
          Stryker sees his dream in ruins. He runs for the nearest
          exit.
          Kayla and Logan are a few feet from the door, from safety,
          when the cavern ceiling gives out. Thousands of tons of stone
          and steel come crashing down.
          Logan grabs Kayla and hauls her to safety an instant before
          she would be crushed.

<b>          EXT. ALKALI LAKE - DAY
</b>
          The compound has essentially imploded, the major structures
          falling into the massive pit created by the cavern's
          collapse.
          Severed gas lines and ruptured boilers have turned the crater
          into a raging fire pit. Smoke billows up from the molten
          core.
          A few dazed survivors, SOLDIERS and SCIENTISTS, have escaped
          the carnage, but Alkali Lake no longer exists as a military
          base. Thousands of singed documents flutter in the wind.
          Logan and Kayla walk away from the burning crater, never
          looking back. They head through the woods toward the lake
          that glitters in the sunlight.

<b>          KAYLA
</b>          One of them could have survived.
          Logan glances at her.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          The clones. They've got your
          healing factor.
          Logan looks back at the devastation.

<b>          LOGAN
</b>          Unless someone comes along who can
          move a few million tons of steel,
          they ain't going anywhere.

<b>          EXT. ALKALI LAKE - LATER
</b>
          They stop at the edge of the lake. Paper from the destroyed
          base drifts through the air, falling on the water and the
          shore.

<b>          LOGAN
</b>          Almost looks peaceful from here.

<b>          KAYLA
</b>          There's something I want you to
          know.
          He looks at her.

          A blossom of blood opens up on her chest. She stares down at
          it in wonder before sinking to her knees.
          Logan turns and sees Stryker walking toward them.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          No...
          Stryker fires again. The adamantium bullet rips through
          Logan's forehead with an unholy sound.
          Logan falls to the ground. Stryker stands above him and fires
          another bullet into Logan's head.
          Stryker turns the gun on Kayla.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          You don't need to waste another
          bullet. I'm already dead.
          Stryker blinks and hesitates. Kayla coughs, her strength
          beginning to fade.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          Maybe you should turn that gun on
          yourself, Colonel.
          Stryker nods, pointing the gun at his own head.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          It would be good for the mutants if
          I made you pull the trigger..

<b>          (BEAT)

          Stryker's finger trembles on the trigger.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          Is it because your son is one of
          us?
          For the first time, perhaps, we see something human in the
          cold blue of Stryker's eyes.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          Enough killing, Colonel. Throw your
          gun in the lake.

          Leave us. Keep walking till your
          feet start to bleed.
          Stryker turns and walks away.
          Kayla crawls over to Logan. She lifts his head onto her lap.
          He's unconscious but breathing. The bullet holes in his skin
          have already healed. She strokes his jaw. and smiles sadly.
          One of the scraps of paper from the base blows against her
          leg. She takes it and looks down at the blank page.
          She has no pen. She touches her chest, just above her heart,
          wetting her finger with her blood.
          She writes four words on the page, blows on it to dry it,
          folds it once and places it in Logan's hand.
          She kisses his lips and rests his head gently on the ground.
          Fighting the pain, a dying woman, Kayla manages to stand.
          KAYLA (cont'd)
          If you ever remember what I did to
          you, try to forgive me. I was a
          fool. And you were right... I
          always loved you.
          She turns and walks toward the lake, never looking back,
          never hesitating as the waters rise above her knees, above
          her waist, above her shoulders, above her head.

<b>          EXT. ALKALI LAKE - SUNSET

          Logan's eyes flutter and open. For a moment he squints into
          the blue sky.
          He sits up, looking around. The woods are empty.
          He stands, completely disoriented, a stranger in the world.
          He realizes that he's holding a piece of paper in his hand.
          He unfolds it and reads the message written in blood.
          You are my Wolverine.
          He stares at it for a moment before folding it carefully and
          putting it in his pocket.

          He doesn't know who he is. He doesn't know where he's going.
          But the wind blows through his hair, the last of the sunlight
          feels good on his skin. He is a free man.
          He walks toward his destiny..
