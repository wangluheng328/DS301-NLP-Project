Guy Haines is a well known amateur tennis player who wants to go into politics in his post tennis life.
He is equally well known in the society papers as a man who wants to divorce his shrewish and cheating wife, Miriam, so that he can marry Anne Morton, the refined daughter of a state senator.
To spite Guy, Miriam refuses to divorce him, while she plans to continue cavorting with other men.
Bruno Antony is a charming and gregarious man, who lives off the wealth of his father.
He's also a sociopath who loves his mentally childlike mother, but detests his father, who he believes is the repressive cause of his problems.
Guy and Bruno meet each other one day on a train.
Their social chit-chat, directed by Bruno, leads to discussion of what Bruno considers the perfect murders: each of two strangers kill the other's "problem" person, as each killer would have no ties to the person murdered.
In their case, Bruno would kill Miriam, while Guy would kill Bruno's father.
As Guy and Bruno part company, Guy believes Bruno's talk was just social chit-chat all in fun.
However, Bruno believes they have a pact as witnessed by the fact that he does end up killing Miriam.
Guy knows Bruno killed her, but doesn't feel he can go to the police with the fantastical story, which be thinks will implicate himself more.
The situation gets worse for Guy as Bruno starts implicating himself in Guy's life to pressure Guy into keeping to his supposed end of the bargain.
Guy has to figure out what to do so as not to implicate himself, not kill anyone and keep those around him safe, which may be a problem for Anne's sister Barbara who has a physical resemblance to Miriam.
The other problem for Guy in going to the police is that Bruno has his personalized cigarette lighter, which he may use to implicate Guy if Guy doesn't comply.
