Tennis star Guy Haines meets a stranger on the Washington-to-New York train who offers to exchange murders.
The stranger, Bruno Anthony, will kill Guy's estranged wife if Guy will kill Bruno's hated father.
Guy doesn't take Bruno seriously until his wife, Miriam, is found murdered in an amusement park.
Guy becomes the chief suspect, which threatens his tennis career; his romantic involvement with a U.S. senator's daughter, Anne Morton; his hopes for a political career; and even his life.
When it becomes evident to Bruno that Guy isn't going to kill his father, he tells Guy that he intends to establish Guy's guilt conclusively by planting his monogrammed cigarette lighter on the island where Miriam was murdered.
With Anne's help, Guy attempts to stop Bruno after rushing through an important tennis match and racing to the amusement park.
