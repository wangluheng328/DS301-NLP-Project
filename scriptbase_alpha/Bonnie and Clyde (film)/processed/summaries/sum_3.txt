Adrift in the Depression-era Southwest, Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker embark on a life of crime.
They mean no harm.
They crave adventure -- and each other.
Soon we start to love them too.
But nothing in film history has prepared us for the cascading violence to follow.
Bonnie and Clyde turns brutal.
We learn they can be hurt -- and dread they can be killed.
