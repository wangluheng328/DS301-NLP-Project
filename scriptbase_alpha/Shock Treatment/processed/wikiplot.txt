A narrator introduces the audience to TV executive Farley Flavors.
As Flavors watches, his television studio - which now encompasses the entire town of Denton - is steadily filled with the former residents of Denton, who gleefully assume their new roles as studio audience members of a 24-hour live television broadcast ("Overture").
The sole holdout in the celebration is Brad Majors, who, despite the insistence of his wife Janet that things will be OK, is ambivalent about the town's transformation ("Denton, U.S.A.").

Brad and Janet are chosen as contestants on Marriage Maze, a supposed game show whose only purpose seems to be committing people to "Dentonvale", Denton's resident insane asylum.
Janet is given the opportunity to have Brad committed by the show's host, a supposedly blind Austrian named Bert Schnick, who promises her that the experience will improve their marriage ("Bitchin' in the Kitchen").

Upon arriving at Dentonvale, Brad and Janet are greeted by the staff: Nurse Ansalong, Rest Home Ricky, and Dentonvale's supervisors, the apparently incestuous siblings Dr. Cosmo and Nation McKinley.
Despite Brad's objections, Cosmo has him drugged, bound, gagged, and placed in a padded cell known as the "Terminal Ward".
Before Janet can sign the papers permitting the McKinleys to treat Brad, Ansalong tells her to wait a day, to give her time to make up her mind.
Meanwhile, Janet's parents, Harry and Emily, are brought onto Marriage Maze and promised a prize if they offer a psychological assessment of Brad.
Deciding that he's regressing into childhood, the Weisses are awarded a vacation home on another of DTV's programs.
Janet goes to meet them there and laments Brad's lack of assertiveness ("In My Own Way").
Harry chastises Janet for marrying Brad, an orphan whose parents died in a car crash, rather than other boys from more stable home backgrounds ("Thank God I'm a Man").

Meanwhile, the McKinleys are informed that financing for their show has been taken over by Flavors' own personal company, a fast food enterprise which Farley hopes to use to finance a pop psychology movement, using a new TV program, Faith Factory, as the platform and the McKinleys as his mouthpieces.
The reluctant McKinleys are quickly taken in by a persuasive videotaped pitch, and on Farley's orders, they recruit Janet to be the face of Farley's "Sanity For Today" movement, as he believes she is the perfect example of the girl next door ("Farley's Song").
Janet moves into Dentonvale with the McKinleys and Bert Schnick, with the promise that her new life as an exciting model will make her desirable to Brad again ("Lullaby").
Meanwhile, Judge Wright and Betty Hapschatt, two DTV hosts sympathetic to Brad, look into the histories of Farley and the McKinleys, suspecting that there is a sinister motive behind Faith Factory.

Cosmo strokes Janet's ego and designs a sexy new outfit for her, transforming her into "Miss Mental Health" ("Little Black Dress").
DTV manufactures Janet into an overnight sensation, and the newfound fame goes to Janet's head ("Me of Me").
Janet, her parents, and Bert go to visit Brad at Dentonvale, where the Weisses question whether the McKinleys can really help him.
The Dentonvale Staff assure everyone of their competency, "curing" Bert's blindness to demonstrate their abilities ("Shock Treatment").
Janet's ego becomes difficult for the McKinleys to control.
To keep her manageable, they drug her, resulting in a dream sequence in which she patrols Denton looking for sex while Brad begs her for love ("Looking for Trade").

As the premiere of Faith Factory nears, Bert, the Dentonvale Staff, and the Weisses prepare for their new TV roles; meanwhile, Betty hacks into DTV's computer and learns that the McKinleys are in fact character actors and that "Dentonvale" isn't a real hospital ("Look What I Did to My Id").
Faith Factory goes on the air, opening with a live musical performance by Janet's groupies, a punk band called Oscar Drill and the Bits ("Breaking Out").
Using the performance as a cover, Wright and Betty break Brad out of Dentonvale, telling him that they've learned Farley is his biological brother, who was split from him during the adoption process and grew up poor; now Farley wants to destroy Brad's life out of jealousy, and is planning to seduce Janet on national TV as the last part of his plan.

Brad, Wright, and Betty break through the wall of the Faith Factory set, and Brad confronts Farley about his plan ("Duel Duet").
Farley demands Brad be remanded to the hospital, but Janet, snapped out of her ego-trip, informs him that she never signed the consent forms.
Angry, Farley has Brad, Janet, Wright, and Betty arrested, and hastily names DTV host Macy Struthers as the new "Miss Mental Health".
Farley invites the studio audience to join in, to which they readily agreeâ€”they are all summarily handed straight jackets, which they happily don.
Brad, Janet, Betty, and Wright escape the holding cell they were placed in for disturbing the live show, and the foursome resolve to leave Denton behind.
With the help of Oscar Drill and the Bits, they hot-wire a car that was meant to be a prize on Faith Factory and drive away, as Farley and the Dentonvale staff celebrate having just committed the entire town of Denton to the terminal ward ("Anyhow Anyhow"/"Denton, U.S.A. (Reprise)").
