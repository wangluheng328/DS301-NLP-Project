SHOOTING SCRIPT
October, 1980

        THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW featured an ordinary
        couple, Brad and Janet, innocent victims of a flat
        tyre and a wet night, caught in a bizarre Horror
        Movie nightmare.

        SHOCK TREATMENT features Brad and Janet, innocent
        members of a live TV audience, drawn into a new
        and equally bizarre nightmare of Soap Operas,
        Game Shows and Media Manipulation.  The madness
        accelerates until they don't know where Television
 ends and reality begins.

FADE IN

THE ENTIRE FILM IS LOCATED IN A TELEVISION STUDIO.

SHOT OF MOON                                                    1

Clouds passing.

                                VOICE OVER
        Once upon a time.  In a town
        not far from yours...
CLOSEUP - FARLEY'S FACE                                         2

wreathed in cigar smoke.

                                VOICE OVER
                ...there lived a real fast guy...

OVERTURE                                                        3

DIGITAL TITLES PROCEED ACROSS BOTTOM OF FRAME.  CAMERA PULLS
BACK ON interior control room.  FARLEY sitting in executive
chair in front of a wall of monitors.  IMAGES OF TITLES
reading "D.T.V.," "MARRIAGE MAZE," "DENTONVALE,"
"HAPPY HOMES," "DENTON DOSSIER," "FAITH FACTORY" INERSPERSED
ON MONITORS WITH SHOT OF studio activity.  Farley is sitting
at a table flanked by VANCE PARKER standing at attention.
To his right are seated MAC and NATION.  To his left RALPH
and MACY.  Directly opposite him, back to CAMERA, is
BERT SCHNICK.

                                VOICE OVER
                His life was fast.  His friends
                were fast.  Even his food was
                fast...

Parker moves to stairwell exit.

                                VOICE OVER
                But he was still not satisfied...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL control room facade.  A billboard with
"DENTON.  HOME OF HAPPINESS" in neon illuminates a
heart-shaped logo which closes on interior scene.  The control
room and facade are suspended over a studio-audience seating
block.  Parker appears on staircase and proceeds down aisle
to consult with FLOOR MANAGER and crew.  Floor Manager moves
across to dressing rooms adjacent to seating.  He knocks on
doors then proceeds down spiral staircase.

                                VOICE OVER
                He wanted to share his fast
                philosophy with someone else...

Floor Manager crosses behind the studio setup for opening
song with giant Hollywood-epic letters spelling "D-E-N-T-O-N."

                                VOICE OVER
                ...a beautiful girl.

Floor Manager proceeds to Parker now positioned by studio door

                                VOICE OVER
                Trouble was...she was in the
                arms of someone else...

They slide back to reveal awaiting AUDIENCE under a nightscape
of moon and clouds.  DIGITAL TITLES CONTINUE ACROSS BOTTOM
OF FRAME as Audience proceed towards seating block passing
CAMERA in twos and threes, staring INTO LENS like passersby
viewing themselves in shop-window video displays.  As overture
continues we PICK UP ON various elements of studio preparation
-- wardrobe racks being wheeled, cameras setting up shots,
artists readying themselves, lighting adjustments etc.  As
overture concludes Audience have settled and CAMERA HAS
LIGHTED ON title card reading "D.T.V. - COMMUNITY
ANNOUNCEMENT."

The words "DENTON DOSSIER" appear.  CRANE DOWN set TO REVEAL
the compere BETTY HAPSCHATT.  During the following dialogue
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Betty seated behind "Denton Dossier" desk
with her guest -- JUDGE OLVER WRIGHT.  Both have prominent
nameplates on the desk.

                                BETTY
                Well how about that?  Wasn't that
                terrific?  A community anthem
                brought to you by our new sponsor
                Farley Flavors whose new program
                'Faith Factory' premieres on this
                channel tomorrow night.  I, for
                one, can't wait!  Now let's turn
                to our regular in-depth discussion
                with Judge Oliver Wright, Denton's
                leading social scientist.

                                BETTY (Cont.)
                        (addresses him)
                Did you enjoy our anthem
                Judge Wright?

                                OLIVER
                In a way...

                                BETTY
                I detect a note of reticence.
                Are you, perhaps, one of those
                amongst us who feel this
                emotive form of presentation
                is overly manipulative?

                                OLIVER
                Well, Betty, there are many
                ways that the spider may catch
                the fly...

                                OLIVER
                        (voice over)
                Monetary inducements.

                                NEELY
                Hi Brad!  Hi Janet!  Come for
                the Marriage Maze?

                                OLIVER
                        (voice over)
                Seduction.

Brad and Janet nod.

                                NEELY
                I'm exhausted working on this
documentary about Farley's new
show.

Janet looks puzzled.  Neely explains:

                                NEELY
                Farley Flavors!  Our new
                sponsor.
                        (makes "hot"
                        gesture)
                Wheeew!

                                OLIVER
                        (voice over)
                Prejudice.

                                NEELY
                        (confiding)
                I tell you, Janet, that guy's
                as close as we'll come to a
                successful man in this town.

Brad looks uncomfortable.

                                OLIVER
                        (voice over)
                Lies!

Janet smiles enigmatically.

                Thank you so much, Judge Wright,
                for another wonderful interview.

                Time for a coffee before you

                                OLIVER
                Delighted, Betty -- That is if
                you don't mind being seen with
                an older man.

                                BETTY
                Why, Oliver, since Ralph and I
                separated maturity is something
                I look for in a man.

                seconds --

We heard a drum roll.

                                VOICE OVER
                And here, to bring you your just
                desserts and a recipe for a
                perfect marriage, is that
                gorgeous gourmet, tossing the
                uproarious salad of life,
                counselor Bert Schnick!

Applause.  Fanfare.  Bert appears with sunglasses and a cane.
He's blind.  The "Marriage Maze" has three entrances,
"Happy Home," "Home Base," "Rest Home."  In front is a
contestant podium with central placement for Bert and, either
side, seats marked "Him" and "Her."

                                BERT

We SEE Ralph and Macy in the Audience.  They half-stand and
wave self-consciously.  (Here we discontinue phonetics in Bert's 
accent.)

                                BERT
                Loved the commercial, Macy!

                                MACY
                Thanks, Bert!

                                BERT
                You got a good show for us
                tomorrow, Ralph?

                                RALPH
                You bet, Bert.

                                BERT
                Good!  I'm gonna be there.

Betty shoots a jealous look at her ex-husband Ralph.

                                BETTY
                Macy Struthers -- God I must
                have been blind -- still, the
                weaker the man, the dumber the
                blonde.

                                OLIVER
                Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors
                sitting down front?  What an
                ideal couple.

We SEE Brad and Janet sitting together.

                                OLIVER
                        (voice over)
                More than anyone else in Denton
                they represent the old values.

CUT BACK TO Oliver and Betty.

                                OLIVER
                        (not without irony)
                Eisenhower would have been
                proud of them.

CUT TO Bert who seems to be receiving instructions from a
small earplug.

                                BERT
                So would the first couple who
                seem to have made a hash of
                their marriage and cooked their
                goose step this way please.

He points to a surprised Brad and Janet.

                                JANET
                That's us.

                                BRAD
                I don't want to get up there.

                                JANET
                We've got to, Brad, everyone's
                watching.

                                BERT
                What's cooking down there?
                Come up here and let's feel you!

Indulgent laughter at "blind" joke.
CUT TO Oliver and Betty who register astonishment.
CUT TO Brad and Janet taking their "Him" and "Her" places.

                                BERT
                That's it -- Look at the camera --

Farley's chair swivelled to face monitors.  A WALL of Brad
and Janet IMAGES.

                        (voice over)

                                JANET
                        (voice over)
                I'm Janet Majors and this is
                my husband Brad.

Farley SWIVELS INTO CLOSEUP.

"MARRIAGE MAZE"                                                 14

                                BERT
                We've been hearing some bad
                things about you, Brad.

                                JANET
                He needs help.

CUT TO a concerned Oliver and Betty.

                                BERT
                        (voice over)
                Face it, Janet!  Brad's an
                emotional cripple.

Audience roar with laughter.

                                JANET
                I know, I know, it's just...

                                BERT
                Looks like 'Rest Home' for this
                marriage.

SHOT OF "REST HOME" lights flickering.  Applause.

                                BERT
                Do you watch 'Dentonvale,'
                Janet?

                                JANET
                I've caught it once or twice.

                                BERT
                Of course!  D.T.V.'s most popular
                Hospital series featuring those
                perennial favorites, Cosmo and
                Nation McKinley.
                Neuro-specialists par excellence
                ...if you'll pardon my French.
                I recommend you send Brad to
                them for treatment!

Oliver and Betty can't believe it.

                                JANET
                I know he's boring but...
                Neuro-specialists!  That sounds
                pretty drastic.

                                BERT
                It's no use pussyfooting around,
                Janet -- we have to cut quick
                and deep.

                                OLIVER
                        (as if he has
                        heard the name
                        before)
                McKinley?...McKinley?

                                BETTY
                Bert brought them over from
                Europe.  They had a very
                popular series together.  It's
                still rerun in a lot of
                countries.  You must have seen
                them in 'Dentonvale?'


                                OLIVER
                Never watch it.

                                BERT
                There's no use delaying another
                moment.

Floor Manager holds a card, reading "DENTONVALE," up to cue
Audience.

                                BERT
                I'm afraid there's only one
                solution.  Tell them, Folks.
                One, two, three...

                Don't go away.  We'll be right
                back to see if Brad and Janet
                want to play or pass...

Shocked look from Betty.  Oliver glances suspiciously towards
control room.

Commercial break.  Technicians make adjustments.  Bert pats
Janet's shoulder.

                                BERT
                Congratulations!  I think your're
                making a wise decision.

Bert moves o.s.

                                JANET
                But...

He's gone.

                                BRAD
                I'm not going, Janet.

                                JANET
                        (trapped)
                What are you trying to do?  Make
                Bert look like a fool?  He's made all
                the arrangements.

                                BRAD
                But I don't need treadment.

Brad knocks over Bert's water jug.

                                BERT
                        (o.s.)

White Room.  Mac and Nation behind twin desk.  Filing
cabinets encircle them.  Double doors opposite them fly open
and Janet, Ricky and Brad enter.  Cosmo (Mac) McKinley rises
to greet them.

                                MAC
                Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How
                wonderful to see you.  I am
                Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is
                my sister, and colleague,
                Nation McKinley.

                                NATION
                We understand you've been going
                through a rather trying time.

                                JANET
                Well yes, but...

Brad leaps out of wheelchair.

                                BRAD
                Listen!  There's nothing wrong
                with me... It's just that Janet
                and I haven't...

Ricky hypos him -- as he drops, he kicks the wheelchair under
him.

                                MAC
                        (to Janet)
                Does he do that often?

Stunned, she doesn't know Ricky hit him with the hypo.

                                JANET
                No!  He's never done that before.

                                MAC
                Good!  Well there's still hope.
                Lots of hope.

                If anyone can help Brad.  We can.

Mac nods to Ricky who leaves.

                                JANET
                Well, he needs help.

NURSE ANSALONG runs in -- colliding with the departing Ricky.

                                MAC
                Ah.  Nurse Ansalong - you're
                here.

Ricky continues on his way.

                                ANSALONG
                        (adjusting uniform)
                Well it was pretty short notice
                but I...

                                NATION
                ATTEND to Mr. Majors, Nurse.

Ansalong adjusts wheelchair and herself.

                                MAC
                There are just one or two
                formalities that have to be
                dealt with, Mrs. Majors.
                There are contracts to be signed...

But Ansalong has started to wheel Brad away -- Janet wants to
follow.  Nation grabs the contract and glances at it.

                                JANET
                Could I do that later?

                                NATION
                Of course.

Janet follows Brad -- Mac grabs the contract back and chases
after them.

Ansalong wheels Brad.  Janet keeps up.  Mac appears behind
them.

                                ANSALONG
                        (sotto voce)
                Sign the contract tomorrow...

Mac catches up.

                                MAC
                        (with papers)
                Just one or two details.  Does
                he have any living relatives?
                Blood relatives?

                                JANET
                No...couldn't I do this later?

Nation catches up with them.

                                NATION
                Of course.

Nation restrains Mac.  Ansalong continues with Brad in
wheelchair and Janet trying to keep up.

                                JANET
                        (to Ansalong)
                Why did you tell me not to sign
                now?

The wheelchair is pushed through double doors at the end of
the corridor.  Janet follows.  CAMERA TILTS UP TO neon above
door reading "TERMINAL WARD."

                Well I hadn't.  I was worried
                about inherited craziness when
                they married.  I said to Janet
                'What do we know of his parents?'

Janet has arrived at a door ending the corridor.  Mom appears
through door holding (behind her back) a dress.

                                MOM
                Oh my poor baby.

                                JANET
                Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.

                                MOM
                I know.

They hug, Mom only using one arm.

                                MOM
                I know baby.  He's going to get
                all the help he needs but in
                the meantime -- Look!!!  For you.

She pulls out the dress and savagely bites off a piece of
cotton after which she thrusts the dress towards Janet.  Holding
it by the shoulders, she lets it drop and we SEE it's a replica
of the one she herself is wearing -- a red Chinese "Cheong Sam."

                                MOM
                They call it a new look at an
                old favourite I copied it from the
                'Window on the World' show.  The

Adjacent to their set Oliver and Betty work in an office
overlooking the studio floor.  They are in deep discussion as
they drink their coffee.

                                BETTY
                Conspiracy?  That sounds a little
                farfetched.

                                OLIVER
                It's happened before.  Remember
                Lieutenant Orpheus?  He
                disappeared into that Underworld
                series and never came back.

                                BETTY
                Sounds like my husband.  He never
                came back either.  At least not
                after Flavors gave him a commercial
                break.

                                OLIVER
                Ah yes.  Farley Flavors.  You know,
                I find it...

Ralph is seen approaching through glass door.

                nation's indigestion.

Ralph knocks.  Enters.

                Oh.  Ah, I'm not calling at an
                inconvenient moment am I?

                        (look to Oliver)
                And I have mine.

                                RALPH
                Yeah, well.  Here, Betty.
                        (hands envelope)
                I just came to give you this.

Betty grabs envelope as Macy appears by Ralph's side.

                                RALPH
                I better get going.  Tomorrow's
                the big one, and, well, Farley
                expects!

                                OLIVER
                        (wry smile)
                Of course.

Betty opens door.

                                RALPH
                        (backing out)
                I'll leave you young things to it.

                                BETTY
                        (whisper)
                Shove it, Ralph!

                                RALPH
                        (hisses back)
                You too, Betty!

Door slams.  Betty tears open envelope.

                                BETTY
                Alimony is just another word
                for rape!

She stops on discovering the contents.  Their notice of
dismissal.

                                BETTY
                Conspiracy is right.  The
                Denton Dossier is...

                                OLIVER

Betty nods.

                That's out of the question, he's
                sleeping like a baby.

We hear a distant scream.  Mac and Nation commence a quick
interrogation to unnerve Janet.

                                MAC
                It's you we're concerned about,

Video flickers to life with a glamorous "Movie Star" image of
FARLEY FLAVORS.  Suave in tuxedo, a carnation glistens in his
lapel.  He looks uncannily like a sophisticated fast-talking
version of Brad.

approvingly.

                Me?

                It's classical.  Almost a textbook

Janet cries.

                That's an extremely negative
                response.

                Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying
                to Brad.

                        (through tears)
                Is it because I'm becoming
                too popular?

                                BERT
                On the contrary.  He wants to see
                your ratings soar.  He needs a
                woman of exceptional desirability.

                So you see, Janet, you can help us

                be here any minute now.

Dressing room door flies open and Janet followed by Mac,
Nation and Bert dance down spiral staircase to chorus reprise
of "Little Black Dress."  Crew applauds the entrance.

                Janet, I can't tell you how
                excited I am.  For you.

Janet moves across the studio surrounded by make-up and
wardrobe persons.  In the b.g. Macy is settling into
Betty Hapschatt's desk and the "Denton Dossier" sign is being
replaced with "Good Morning Denton."  Neely tries to keep up.

                                NEELY
                We've got the band and dancers
                standing by.  Betty Hapschatt is...
                indisposed.  So Macy will have to
                do the links.

                                JANET
                I don't need linking.

to view the action.  Betty spies Macy in her place and

                Hey.  What about that!
                Janet was a knockout.

Photo blow-up of Farley being positioned.  Bert, Janet, Mac, Nation
samba into rehearsal for "Faith Factory."  A few kids (Oscar and Brenda
Drill, Glish Davison and Drummer) hover.  Ralph and Macy greet Janet.

                    RALPH
          Hi, Janet!  Welcome to the 
          'Faith Factory' team.  We're 
          all pretty excited about tonight.

                    JANET
               (indicating Farley's
               huge picture)
          Do I get one of those?

                    RALPH
               (embarrassed)
          Uh...yeah...sure...It's being
          done now.

He gives Macy Struthers a "get on with it" look.

                    MACY
               (grinning a fixed,
               some might say
               plastic smile)
          Hi!  Macy Struthers -- co-host 
          on the F. F. show.

                    RALPH
          Ah, Macy.  Why don't you help
          Janet freshen up before rehearsal.

                    MACY
          Surely.

Flashbulbs pop.  Three boys get Janet's autograph.  Brenda pushes
through to Ralph.

                    BRENDA
               (to Ralph)
          You promised an introduction.

Macy hovers -- disapproving.

                    RALPH
               (embarrassed)
          Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could
          you spare a moment?

                    BERT
               (giving Mac and 
               Nation a superior
               look)
          Of course.

Mac and Nation exchange looks.  Janet, Macy, Glish, Brenda, Oscar and
Drummer move towards dressing room.

                    GLISH DAVISON
               (to Brenda)
          Who are those creeps with Janet?

                    BRENDA
          They're no creeps!
               (superior tone)
          /Ralph/ says they're neuro-diagnosticians.

                    OSCAR
          Oh yeah.  When did Ralph say that?

                    BRENDA
               (taunting)
          Never mind.

Neely's CAMERA FOLLOWS.  Neely thrusts a microphone at Janet as she
heads up spiral staircase.

                    NEELY
          Janet!  A quick word.  Could you
          tell our viewers what exactly you will represent
          tonight.

                    JANET
               (entering room)
          Sanity for today!

Door slams.  Neely fumes but smiles TO CAMERA.  She passes Ralph and
Bert hovering in a corner.  Ralph holds a clipboard with schedule.

                    RALPH
          How's Brad?

                    BERT
          A wreck.

                    RALPH
          Check.
               (sotto voce)
          The quacks are willing tools?

                    BERT
          Fools!

                    RALPH
          I wouldn't mind doing Janet one
          or two favours.

                    BERT
          Time to check with Flavors.

INT. DRESSING ROOM                              83
          
Janet and Company are relaxing.  Nation mixes cocktails.  Chanting in
b.g.  Cassette plays a bland C&W background (carte blanche).

                    MACY
               (a bit thin-lipped)
          Anything else you'd like?

                    JANET
          Yes.  A new carpet.  I hate the
          colour.

Macy leaves.

                    NATION
          It's only one night, Janet.
          Let's not forget who we're 
          doing this for?
          
                    JANET
          Who?

                    MAC
          Brad!

                    JANET
               (megalomania has
               taken over)
          I'm sick of hearing about that 
          lame dog.  I've got a lot going
          for me.  I'm going places.  I'm
          going to be someone.  I'm gonna
          win my way into the lives and
          hearts of people even if I have 
          to kill to do it.  I'll make the
          pathetic little crumbs love me.
          I don't even know why I'm wasting
          my time here with you.  I should 
          be with my people...

Janet storms out of room onto balcony.  Cheers from outside.  Mac
exchanges a look with Nation who is lacing a cocktail.

Janet waves to cheering kids from balcony.

          Hi!  My name's Brenda Drill...
          and I think you're beautiful...
          this is my brother Oscar and our
          friend Glish Davison...you're
          beautiful...you really are.

                    OSCAR
          Are you a rock singer?  I bet
          she's a rock singer...

                    GLISH
          Yeah.  I saw the Breakfast Show.
          You're terrific.

Nation appears behind Janet, hands her the drink containing sedative.

          This is Janet.  She's a phenomenon.

Janet gulps drink.

          SO IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A STANDARD
          TO WHICH YOU CAN ASPIRE -- THEN BABIES
          LOOK AT ME!

Mac and Nation assist swooning Janet inside.

Doors close.  Kids chant "We Want Janet."

Kids chanting "We Want Janet" throughout.  Macy and Ralph are being
interviewed by Neely Pritt amidst a bevy of crew activity.  Betty and
Oliver lurk on the sidelines -- eavesdropping.

                    MACY
          So all in all it's going to
          be an exciting new series for
          us...

                    RALPH
          ...and an attractive financial
          prospect for Denton.

CUT TO Betty yawning.  Oliver listening intently.

                    NEELY
               (voice over)
          and fashion-wise?

                    BETTY
               (suddenly alert)
          What did I tell you.

Macy answers.

                    MACY
          Well, I can just say that
          'Faith Factory' will be introducing 
          a new look that will show off
          one or two old faces in an
          entirely new light.

                    NEELY
          Really!  Sounds promising.

Betty is bristling.

                    BETTY
          Did you /hear/ that, Oliver.

                    OLIVER
          Yes, Betty.  But the false promise
          of a new dawn is usually followed
          by a most bloody sunset.

Betty is despondent.

                    BETTY
          Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?

                    RALPH
               (voice over)
          No!  I don't know what Janet's
          next move will be...but you can 
          be sure of one thing...it all
          starts here!

                    OLIVER
          Care to indulge?

                    BETTY
          Indulge?

                    MOM
          Too flashy...they'll clash with
          the new outfits.

Brad moans -- Mom feeds him a pill.

          It's all right, Brad dear...have
          another sedative...we'll miss
          you on the show tonight.

They set off.

          Hi, Janet.  They wouldn't let us

          were sleeping.

          The Band.  We've been rehearsing
          for the new show.  My sister 
          Brenda persuaded Ralph to let us
          play.

          You got any friends?

Dummy dressed as Farley FILLS SCREEN.  From behind it a woman's hand

Betty.

          I don't mind telling you, Oliver...
          I'm not looking forward to this.

They grab lab coats from a medical rack labelled "F.F."

          Betty, it's imperative we get
          Janet out of Flavors' fast fingers
          and Brad out of that hell-hole
          before they both disappear forever.

          Betty, this is beginning to add

          What'll I pin this on?

Brenda has organised coffee to sober Janet up.  Glish and Oscar site
mesmerised; like most people, they are mistaking histrionics for
greatness.  Mac and Nation check in on Janet.

                    JANET
               (mumbling)
          Brad!  Oh, Brad.

          He's a lame dog, remember?  But
          even he wouldn't want to see you
          like this.

The door opens -- Ralph is there with Neely's News Team.

                    NEELY
          Listen, Ralph, I need a final
          statement from her -- and if 
          I don't get it now, *Right now!*
          There's going to be trouble.

                    RALPH
          Later, Neely.

Slams door.  Neely's voice complaining in distance.

                    RALPH
          How is she?

Nation shrugs.

                    RALPH
          Yeah!  Well, I just got word Farley's
          expecting her any minute.  You Guys!!
          (Oscar and Glish)  Get yer asses in
          front of those cameras, warm up that
          crowd and earn yourselves a reputation.
          Okay?  *Move*!!!

Ralph rushes out.  Oscar and Glish shuffle a bit -- Oscar puts a couple
of grubby pills on the table.

                    OSCAR
          For you, Janet -- they'll make
          you feel real good.

                    GLISH
               (awkwardly)
          Yeah, right.

products, "Faith Factory" T-shirts, etc.  Above, on the gantry, Betty
and Oliver, disguised as Medicos, are making plans.  Betty moves to
stairway behind their old office while Oliver heads around behind the
set.  Meanwhile Neely is entertaining the Audience with some last-minute
reportage.

                    NEELY

          exotic trends in fashion you'll
          find plenty to keep you going

          feeling the excitement and not 
          wishing to stick out like a sore
          thumb, I had to get an outfit of          
          my own together...and this is it...

She tries at first to be the reporter in a funny costume but then we see
a look in her eyes that says...*Look* at *Me*.

          We've heard rumors that you're

          a new series tonight.  Is this 
          true?

                    FARLEY
          Absolutely correct.

                    NEELY
          Could you tell us a little about 
          it?

                    FARLEY
          Let's just say that I'm putting 
          sanity back on the national 
          menu.

                    NEELY
          And how does *'local girl'*
          Janet Majors fit into the scheme

          We bring you...MISS MENTAL HEALTH.

A rather confused Janet dressed as a cross between Miss America and a
bride appears at the entrance to the colonnade.  During the following

Nation has the microphone.

          The dress Janet is wearing has 
          been given by Creme de la Creme Modes of 
          Downtown Denton, and we've been asked 
          that you take note of the individual 
          styling and exquisite tailoring...
          This is just one of the many gifts 
          that have been so freely and generously 
          given to Janet, the first of 
          (we hope) many Miss Mental Healths...

          of yours and mine.  You've revelled
          in his recipes.  You've marvelled 
          at his marriage guidance.  Yes, the
          all-knowing, and now all-seeing
          Bert Schnick!!

Bert races around colonnade to take his place at the microphone.

                    BERT
          Sank you!  Velcome!  Sank you!

                    RALPH
          What's cookin', Bert?

                    BERT
          I tell you what's cooking.  She
          made the blind see and it was a
          gift!  Who was it from?  Let's 
          hear an 'F" for...

                    ALL
          Farley!

INT. "DENTONVALE" - CORRIDORS                         125

Oliver and Betty are wheeling Brad around corridors but seem quite lost.
All pointing different directions.

                    BERT
               (voice over)
          And another one for...

                    ALL
          Flavors!

INT. "FAITH FACTORY"                              126

Farley progresses around Colonnade to tremendous ovation.  Music plays.
He takes microphone.

                    FARLEY
          My Friends!  And you are
          my friends.  My friends.
          Tonight, we are taking the
          first step of defiance and
          starting something that will
          grow so big that the whole 
          world will reverberate to its
          sound.  And wherever our
          slogan 'SANITY AND VANITY'
          is uttered it will be
          linked incontravertably with
          this night...this station
          ...and...this...beautiful
          face.

Farley moves to Janet.  Groom to Bride.

INT. CORRIDORS                                   127

Trio roars around corner.

INT. "FAITH FACTORY"                              128

Farley's hand takes Janet's.  He is about to kiss her as the trio
crashes through the photo blowup of Janet and Brad lands between them.

                    BRAD
          SEDUCER!

Chord.

                    FARLEY
               (amazed)
           Who are you, Sir!

Chord.

                    BRAD
               (defiant)
          Your twin brother!  And your 
          accuser!

General consternation.  Janet looks from one to another.  They are
indeed identical.

                    JANET
          BRAD!  

                    MAC
               (to Parker)
          Arrest that man!  He's committed 
          to our care.

                    JANET
               (to Mac) 
          I never signed the contract.  
               (to Parker)
          He's not going anywhere.

Chord.


                    OLIVER
               (to Farley) 
          To revenge your twin--you 
          tried to abuse her.

                    FARLEY
          Ridiculous accusations!  You
          force me to refuse her.  

                    BRAD
          Then why did you choose her?

CLOSEUP of Farley glaring at Brad.

                    FARLEY
               (voice over)
          Because...of *you*, Sir!

                    FARLEY
               (voice over,
               singing)
          YOU'RE A LOSER...AN ABOMINATION
          IN THE EYES OF ANY SENSITIVE MAN

CLOSEUP of Brad glaring back at Farley.

                    BRAD
               (voice over)
          AN' YOU'RE A BLIND ALLEY CRUISER
          ALWAYS HEADING DOWN A LOSING 
          STRAIGHT
          DREAMIN' THAT YOU'RE SCREAMIN' AT
          FATE

INT. CORRIDORS - BRAD'S P.O.V.                         129

Pursuing Farley down corridor.

                    BRAD
               (voice over)
          YOU'RE A DEAD-END, DEAD-BEAT,
          NO-WHERE MISTER 
          WITH A KISS LIKE A MISSISSIPPI
          ALLIGATOR'S SISTER

Farley turns.  They now spit their thought at each other in song:

                    FARLEY
          I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY
          MAN CAN
          YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART

CLOSEUP - BRAD.

                    BRAD
          YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE

CLOSEUP - FARLEY.

                    FARLEY
          YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST 
          YOUR BALLS
          YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST
          YOUR GRIP
          SO SAY BYE-BYE

Farley walks away.  Brad pursues.

                    BRAD
          WE LOST OUR MOM, WE LOST OUR DAD
          AN' IF I'M LOSING YOU, WELL THAT'S
          JUST TOO BAD

Farley turns.

                    FARLEY
          WELL THE BEST THING YOU COULD
          EVER DO...IS DIE

Farley moves on.

                    BRAD
          YOU'RE A FAILURE...
          A MALFORMATION IN THE GUISE OF
          MANY, AN ALSO-RAN

Farley turns.

                    FARLEY
          AN' YOU'RE A WEEPER AND A WAILER
          ALWAYS TREADING THE TOES OF
          THE GREAT
          GENERALLY SPREADING YOUR WEIGHT
          YOU'RE A SPITEFUL, HATEFUL
          ASININE CREATURE
          A PUPIL WITH NO SCRUPLES WHO
          KNEW BETTER THAN THE TEACHER

CLOSEUP - BRAD.

                    BRAD
          I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY
          MAN CAN

CLOSEUP - FARLEY.

                    FARLEY
          YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART

CLOSEUP - BRAD.

                    BRAD
          YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE

CLOSEUP - FARLEY.

                    FARLEY
          YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST 
          YOUR BALLS
          YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST
          YOUR GRIP
          SO SAY BYE-BYE

Farley moves off.

                    BRAD
          WE LOST OUR HOME AND OUR FAMILY
          YOU'VE LOST COMPASSION, NOW 
          YOU'RE LOSING ME

Farley turns.

                    FARLEY
          THE BEST THING YOU COULD EVER DO
          IS DIE

CLOSEUP - BRAD.
                    BRAD
          THE BEST THING YOU COULD EVER DO
          IS DIE.

INT. "FAITH FACTORY"                              130

CUT BETWEEN CLOSEUPS OF Brad on floor in straitjacket and Farley
standing in tuxedo.

                    BRAD AND FARLEY
               (voice over)
          THE BEST THING YOU COULD EVER
          DO IS DIE.

                    FARLEY
          Take no notice of him.  He's 
          mad.

                    BRAD
               (spluttering) 
          I'm as sane as you are.  Saner!

Mac grabs microphone.

                    MAC
          And he was only with us for 
          a day.

Crowd jeers and laughs.

                    BERT
               (half to himself)
          They should be sent to the
          Danube before Dawn.

                    RALPH
               (sharply)
          What?

                    BERT
               (caught out)
          Nothing.  Just...memories!

Ralph confides to Farley:
                    RALPH
          We'll edit the tapes.  This
          will never see airplay.
               (steps to microphone)
          I hope Mr. Flavors will accept 
          apologies on behalf of Denton 
          for this unfortunate incident.  
          *Everyone* wants to be related 
          to the great.

                    FARLEY 
          No offense!  On the contrary, 
          this is a perfect examples of 
          what we're here to combat. 
               (whispers to Janet)
          The choice is yours...

Janet looks from one to another.  She chooses Brad.  Farley indicates
the quartet of Brad, Janet, Oliver and Betty.  He starts CHANTING.

                    FARLEY
           Out!  Out!  Out!

Audience picks up CHANT until "OUT!  OUT!  OUT!" becomes a DEAFENING 
ROAR
and the quartet retreats in fear of their lives.  Audience roar turns to
CHEERS as Parker escorts the Quartet off the set to the "Denton Dossier"
office where he shuts them in.

                    FARLEY
               (triumphant) 
          And the way we got rid of that 
          dirty little dish is the way
          we're going to put the rest of 
          our house in order.
               (tapping his brain)
          Including the UPSTAIRS!

CHEERS, white doves are released.  Neely nudges Bert but Ralph gets the
idea and pushes Macy towards Farley.

                    FARLEY
               (to Macy)  
          Would you care to join me up
          here, Miss, and help us
          inaugurate the Farley Flavors 
          FAITH FACTORY, transmitting
          from coast to coast and     from 
          continent to continent...step 
          up, please, Miss...?

                    MACY
          Macy...Macy Struthers.

Betty gives the finger from the glass door.

                    BETTY
               (with venom)
          Who loves *you*, Baby!

                    BRENDA's MOTHER
               (shouts out)
          My Brenda's better than both of 
          them!

Brenda looks appalled.  "Bits" are worried by the turn of events.
Janet's Mom looks suicidal...Dad consoles.

                    MOM
          What a nerve!  What a mouth!


                    DAD 
          Shut up, Emily, and listen to 
          a success story.

                    NEELY 
               (in tears) 
          I can't stand it.  Everything 
          good always happens to other 
          people.

                    NATION 
               (sotto voce to Mac) 
          This could be worse than the 
          old series.

                    MAC
               (sotto voce to 
               Nation)
          In the old series we didn't 
          have a convertible.

He rattles the keys.

                    FARLEY
          And remember.  Sanity today
          is the springboard to a 
          hygienic tomorrow.

Audience applauds.

                    FARLEY
          Now will you join us down the 
          D.T.V. trail to DENTONVALE?

                    AUDIENCE
          Yes!

Oscar, Brenda and the Bits decline but everyone else storms into
colonnade path which is seen to form the entrance to the corridors.
Straitjackets are handed out on entry.  Neely winds up her documentary.

                    NEELY
          And Fast Food Giant 
          Farley Flavors has given 
          Miss Mental Health what can 
          only be described as an 
          official kiss of approval and
          the crowd are loving it as 
          they follow her down the
          Dentonvale trail.

In office Brad indicates everyone disappearing to Parker.  He reacts and
rushes off after Neely who is trailing with her long-suffering Crew.
Betty produces the hairpin and gets to work on the lock; Janet and
Oliver undo the straitjacket on Brad.

"ANYHOW!  ANYHOW!"                              131

          BUT

Music starts.  They stand.  They dance across colonnade to now-deserted
seating block.

They are joined by Oscar, Brenda, Glish, Drummer who have been hiding in
Lappsy's auto.  They repeat chorus, dancing along colonnade towards
studio door:

EXTREME TOP ANGLE ZOOMING SLOWLY BACK FROM Farley, Mac, Nation, Bert,
Ralph, Macy, Ricky, Ansalong, Mom, Dad and Mrs. Drill celebrating with
champagne in Dentonvale office.  As SHOT WIDENS we SEE Audience all in
straitjackets, running around the corridors in and out of rooms.  The
SHOT WIDENS as does the chaos UNTIL IT TAKES IN the entire studio.
