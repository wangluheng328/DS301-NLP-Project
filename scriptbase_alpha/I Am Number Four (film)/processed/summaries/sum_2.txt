John Smith, tries his best to play the nondescript high school senior who's just moved to a small mid-Western town in Ohio with his single-parent dad, Henri.
But maturity ushers in the onset of extraordinary powers that are John's birthright as one of the very few individuals who escaped the genocidal rampage of the Mogadorians, an alien race that destroyed the inhabitants of Lorien, the planet where John was born.
A total of eight infants escaped to Earth, each accompanied by a warrior to serve as their guardian and protector.
The Mogadorians quest to destroy the last of the Loriens has led them to Earth.
Three of their targets have already been eliminated.
It becomes John's task to find and join with the remaining members of his race before he becomes victim number four.
