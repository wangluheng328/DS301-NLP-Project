Kyle has just gone through the trauma of losing her husband who jumped off the roof of their apartment building in Berlin.
Now, she and her six year old daughter Julia are flying his casket back to the United States on a plane she helped design.
About 3 hours into the flight, Kyle wakes up from a nap to find Julia missing and no one remembers ever seeing her.
The flight crew begin to search the plane until the Captain comes back with information that when her husband jumped, he took Julia with him.
As Kyle fights to discern the truth, she takes matters into her own hands.
