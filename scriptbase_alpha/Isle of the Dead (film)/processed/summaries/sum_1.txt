On a lonely Greek island, a disparate group of people are in fear.
Plague has come to the island making them virtual prisoners and then there is talk of the vorvolakas, a vampire-like creature that preys on the living.
Among those trapped there is General Nikolas Pherides, nicknamed the Watchdog, who is taken aback when he is visits his wife's mausoleum only to find her grave empty.
As several of those quarantined die from the plague, paranoia sets in creating a tense, fear-filled atmosphere.
