This is the story of Charles Foster Kane.
The film opens with a long shot of Xanadu - the private estate of one of the world's richest men.
In the middle of the estate is a castle.
We see, inside the castle, a dying man examining a winter scene within a crystal ball.
As he drops it, it smashes, and one word is heard - "Rosebud..." What follows are pieces of newsreel-like footage detailing how Kane amassed his fortune, and turning around full circle at the end.
