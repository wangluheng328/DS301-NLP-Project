This is the story of Adam and Barbara who live in a beautiful house in New England.
One day while driving home they are involved in a terrible auto accident.
They manage to walk home only to discover later that they have died and now haunt their house.
When their house is purchased by an out of state family, they feel their home is threatened by the over-the-top artists wife and real-estate idea-man husband.
Their only relief is the Gothic daughter of the family.
Their attempts at scaring the family out of the house are ignored or laughed at.
Finally they fall to the temptation to use the people-exorcizer Beetle Juice.
When they find his tactics too dangerous, they attempt to contain him and save the family they were trying to boot.
