               ON THE FULL MOON

               Millions of glittering stars behind it and as we start pulling 
               back off the stars, we HEAR the even VOICE of --

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         Tonight's the night. And it's going 
                         to happen again and again. Has to 
                         happen.

               PANNING DOWN

               Passing the moon -- wonderfully bright in all its redness.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Nice night.

               PANNING FURTHER DOWN UNTIL

               The moonlight illuminates the restless, inner city streets 
               of Miami and we start moving through them -- passing the 
               neon lit bars with enthusiastic DRINKERS, clueless GERMAN 
               TOURISTS, wearing shorts, black socks and sandals, long legged 
               MODELS flirting on the boulevard, blue collar CUBANO MEN 
               sipping espresso, a few scantily clad HOOKERS hawking johns 
               and a band of RUNAWAYS looking for handouts --

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Miami's a great town -- love the 
                         Cuban food, pork sandwiches -- my 
                         favorite...but I'm hungry for 
                         something different now.

               A nervous middle-aged COUPLE, clearly lost, RACES in and out 
               of the pools of light cast by the city street lights.

                                                                         2.


           2   A CAR, CIRCA EARLY 1990'S                                      2   

               Drives into frame, turns a corner, drives down a main 
               boulevard, approaches an intersection -- the overhanging 
               light turns RED and as the car stops, we push into --

               THE WINDSHIELD AND SEE

               A MAN behind the wheel of that Car but <u>we can't see his face</u>. 

                                                                    CUT TO:

           3   EXT. BAND SHELL - PARK - MIAMI, FL - NIGHT                     3   

               PROUD PARENTS sit on the grass, opened picnic baskets in 
               front of them.

               Their eyes focused on two dozen BOYS (12-14) wearing snappy 
               looking, matching shirts, singing a beautiful rendition of 
               "Bach Magnificat."

               With a flourish, the tropically dressed CHOIR MASTER (40's), 
               handsome, all-American looking, with a scrubbed clean face, 
               guides the boys to the stunning crescendo.

               The CROWD stands, ERUPTS with applause. The boys smile.

               The Choir Master turns, bows to the audience -- more applause, 
               then rises, blows kisses to his perky little WIFE and their 
               TWO young DAUGHTERS standing in the front row.

                              (contained excitement)
                         There he is -- </tt><i><tt>Mike Donovan</tt></i><tt>. He is 
                         the one.

           3A  MOMENTS LATER                                                  3A  

               The kids all walk off the stage, join their happy parents on  
               the lawn.  The Choir Master joins his wife, bends down, gives 
               her a kiss, hugs his two sweet little girls. Other PARENTS 
               walk over extend their heartfelt thanks to the Choir Master. 

               Everyone starts packing up their picnic baskets --

                                                                    CUT TO:

           4   EXT. STREET - BORDERING THE PARK - MIAMI, FL - LATER           4   

               The Choir Master walks his wife and daughters to a Buick 
               sedan. Helps them get in, buckles up the kids -- waves as 
               the car drives off.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         3.


               He turns, walks up the street.

                                     NEW ANGLE
                         The Choir Master comes closer, closer 
                         to a --

               FORD TAURUS STATION WAGON

               And STOPS right before us, so close we can almost touch him.

               He fumbles in his pocket for his keys and after a beat, the 
               key finally enters the lock, the station wagon door opens 
               and

               as the Choir Master slides in behind the wheel, SUDDENLY --

                                     A MAN
                         POPS UP from the back seat, quicker 
                         than a jack in the box, and with 
                         incredible quickness WHIPS a fishing 
                         line around the Choir Master's neck, 
                         pulls it very TIGHT.

               THE CHOIR MASTER'S EYES go wide and his face turns white.

               The MAN behind him turns toward the camera, and we finally 
               SEE --

               DEXTER'S FACE (30's), good looking with carefully constructed 
               features, eyes that are full of life.

               </tt><b><tt>FREEZE FRAME ON HIS FACE

</tt></b><tt>                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         My name is Dexter -- Dexter Morgan 
                         and I'm going to kill this man 
                         tonight.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Dexter turns back to Donovan, leans in close to his ear, 
               whispers menacingly.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         You're mine now, so do exactly as I 
                         say.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (struggling, barely 
                              audible)
                         What do you want..?

               And Dexter pulls the fishing line tighter, cuts into Donovan's 
               skin.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         4.


                                     DEXTER
                              (hard)
                         I want you to be quiet.
                              (beat)
                         And if you're good, maybe I'll let 
                         you live a little longer. Now drive.

               And Donovan pulls out of the spot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           5   EXT. DIRT ROAD - OUTSKIRTS OF MIAMI, FL - LATER                5   

               The station wagon driving down a dirt road flanked by 
               swampland. It doesn't look good. We can see it in Donovan's 
               eyes.

                                     DEXTER
                         Turn here.

               Donovan turns the wheel and the car rumbles toward --

           6   EXT. THE CISTERN - OUTSKIRTS OF MIAMI, FL - SAME               6   

               The car stops in front of an old, abandoned concrete cistern.  
               To the side, is a small yard where we see THREE MOUNDS of 
               dirt piled high.

               The car STOPS. Donovan stares at the mounds, then snaps his 
               eyes shut. Dexter releases the noose.

                                     DEXTER
                         Get out.

               Donovan STUMBLES out of the car, falls to the ground, starts 
               to whimper.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                              (sharp, demanding)
                         You have to listen and do what I 
                         say.  You should know that. It's 
                         important.

               After a beat, Donovan slowly gets up and the two of them 
               stare at each other. There's a weird understanding between 
               the two. Dexter smiles, says softly --

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         In the house.

               Dexter whips the fishing line back around Donovan's neck and

               they both walk up to the front door and enter --

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         5.


           7   INT. THE CISTERN - OUTSKIRTS OF MIAMI, FL - SAME               7   

               Dexter KICKS the door closed, quickly flips on a flood lamp, 
               lights up the room, leans into Donovan's ear, whispers...

                                     DEXTER
                         Look.

               Donovan is too scared, tries to turn his head away --

                                     DONOVAN
                         No.

                                     DEXTER
                         Oh yes...

                                     DONOVAN
                              (struggling)
                         NO! NO!

               But Dexter twists the noose tighter and Donovan's SCREAMS 
               are cut off.

                                     DEXTER
                         It's horrible, isn't it? Isn't it?

               But Donovan SLAMS his eyes shut even tighter.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (pleading)
                         Please.

               Dexter GRABS the back of Donovan's neck, SPINS him around, 
               SLAMS his face into a wall, then grabs his hair and pulls 
               Donovan's head back.

                                     DEXTER
                         OPEN YOUR EYES AND LOOK AT WHAT YOU 
                         DID -- LOOK OR I'LL CUT YOUR EYELIDS 
                         RIGHT OFF OF YOUR FACE.

               Donovan's eyes pop open wide, and we finally SEE ---

               THREE SMALL BODIES

               Three little dead BOYS laid out on plastic sheets and spread 
               out in a semi-circle before them.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         It took me a long time to get all 
                         these little boys clean -- one of 
                         them had been in the ground so long 
                         he was falling apart -- Pulled him 
                         out in bits and pieces.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                         6.


                                     DONOVAN
                         </tt><i><tt>NO.

</tt></i><tt>               And then in a deeply heartfelt voice Donovan starts mumbling 
               in a mantra-like way --

                                     DONOVAN (CONT'D)
                         Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord...

                                     DEXTER
                              (furious)
                         </tt><i><tt>STOP! That never helped anyone.

</tt></i><tt>                                     DONOVAN
                         </tt><i><tt>Please</tt></i><tt>.

                                     DEXTER
                         It's time for the truth.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (pleading again)
                         </tt><i><tt>Please...You can have anything --

</tt></i><tt>                                     DEXTER
                         That's good. Beg. Did these little 
                         boys beg?

               Donovan SCREAMS and Dexter lets go. Donovan falls forward 
               and lands on his face sobbing, sniveling.

                                     DONOVAN
                         I couldn't help myself, I just 
                         couldn't...Please, you have to 
                         understand.

               Dexter looks down at him --

                                     DEXTER
                         Trust me, I definitely understand.

               Then Dexter grabs him, lifts him up, </tt><i><tt>stares </tt></i><tt>into his eyes.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         See, I can't help myself either.

                                     DONOVAN
                              (rhetorical, plaintive)
                         Why?

                                     DEXTER
                         I have standards.

                                                                         7.


               And then in a flash, Dexter pulls a syringe out of his pocket, 
               PLUNGES the needle deep into Donovan's neck. His eyes 
               instantly roll up and into the back of his head and when we 
               see nothing but white, he collapses onto the floor.

               Dexter leans down, picks him up by his collar, drags him up 
               the stairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

           8   INT. THE CISTERN - OUTSKIRTS MIAMI, FL - LATER                 8   

               Flood lamps illuminate the clean, freshly prepared room. The 
               windows are sealed with thick plastic sheets and on the table 
               in the middle of the room --

               Donovan lies naked, but his arms and legs are strapped down 
               with duct tape. His eyes wide open and his mouth is stuffed 
               with thick wads of white gauze.

               Placed strategically around the room are boxes lined with 
               white garbage bags and on a smaller table next to the Choir 
               Master are bottles of chemicals, small saws, drills, scalpels 
               and knives of every shape and size. It's an unseemly display 
               of gleaming metallic, sterile utensils.

               Dexter, now wearing a clean, form fitting Hazmat suit and a 
               pair of surgical gloves, looks down at Donovan.

                                     DEXTER
                         Soon, you'll be packed into a few 
                         neatly wrapped Hefties and my own 
                         small corner of the world will be a 
                         neater, happier place. A better place.

               Dexter lifts a very sharp scalpel and an eye dropper off the 
               table, leans over Donovan and with the scalpel makes a small 
               precise little incision on the man's forehead.

               Blood trickles out and using the eyedropper, Dexter very 
               carefully, sucks a few blood droplets up and into the small 
               tube of glass.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Blood. Sometimes it sets my teeth on 
                         edge.

               When he sees the blood, Dexter clearly gets excited --

               But after a beat, he controls himself, then very carefully 
               squeezes the rubber top of the eye dropper over a glass slide 
               and a few tear drops of blood gently spatter onto the slide, 
               then he presses a second piece of glass over it, seals the 
               two slides together --

               BACK TO SCENE

               Dexter slips the glass slide into his shirt pocket, smiles, 
               then grabs a small surgical saw off the table -- we HEAR the 
               whirl of its motor running and as Dexter slowly brings the 
               saw down toward Donovan's crotch --

           9   EXT. DEXTER'S BOAT - CANALS - MIAMI, FL - EARLY MORNING        9   

               Dexter, back in casual clothes, stands behind the wheel of 
               his boat, puttering past an early morning fishing boat -- a 
               huge smile on his face.

               Dexter eyes a leather-skinned FISHERMAN standing on his  
               commercial fishing boat -- waves to him.

                                     DEXTER
                         Ahoy -- Ahoy there, Captain. Any big 
                         Marlin out there today?

               The fisherman smiles, waves back and Dexter smiles wide.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Whatever made me the way I am left 
                         me hollow, empty inside. People fake 
                         a lot of human interactions -- but I 
                         fake it </tt><i><tt>all </tt></i><tt>and I fake it very well.

               Dexter navigates his boat out of the bay.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         And that's my plight -- I care about 
                         people as much as I care about lawn 
                         furniture but I can't blame my foster 
                         parents for that. Harry and Doris 
                         Morgan did a wonderful job raising 
                         me.  But they're both dead now.
                              (beat)
                         I didn't kill them.

               And just then a testosterone injected SPEED BOAT cuts across  
               his bow causing a large wave to SPLASH over Dexter's deck 
               and we --

               </tt><i><tt>It's a beautiful, warm Sunday afternoon and the boat is </tt></i><tt>

               father -- a diamond in the rough, tough exterior, but soft 
               at heart -- pulls a flask out of his pants pocket, slowly 
               unscrews the top, downs a slug of booze, then slips the flask 
               back into his pants.

               And as his boat disappears into the morning fog, passing 
               large container ships and oil tankers, we see the back of 
               the boat and it's named the "</tt><b><tt>SLICE OF LIFE</tt></b><tt>."

                                                                    CUT TO:

          11A  EXT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - MIAMI, FL - EARLY MORNING           11A  

               Dexter bounces up the exterior spiral staircase of his 
               apartment building and as he heads down the 2nd story balcony 
               toward his door, he sees a GARDENER whacking away with a 
               machete trimming a tree.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          12   INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - SAME                                12   

               Dexter walks into his apartment, closes the door behind him.  
               It appears more like a library than a home -- book shelves 
               are everywhere and all the books are categorized, alphabetized 
               and lined up perfectly and in that collection, among other 
               medical books, is a copy of Gray's Anatomy.  Some of the 
               walls are covered with framed, family photos.

               Dexter walks past his coffee table stacked with neat piles 
               of Pop culture magazines and "How To.." books.  In the middle 
               of the room is a large desk with a computer on top. Dexter 
               drops his keys and wallet on the desk, then walks to the far 
               wall, approaches his air conditioner unit, turns it up even 
               colder. He then pulls off the front panel of the "modified"

               air conditioner and inside we see two sets of condenser coils. 
               Dexter pulls off one of the coils, reaches inside and 
               retrieves a long rectangular wood box, sets it on his desk, 
               lifts off the lid and from his shirt pocket, pulls out the 
               slide of blood we saw him extract from Donovan.

               Dexter stares at it for a beat, then --

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         At least the code of Harry, my 
                         wonderful father, is satisfied.
                              (beat)
                         And so am I.

               He files it amongst many other slides inside the box, slams 
               the lid shut, then places the box back inside the air 
               conditioner, reaches back in and pulls out a stack of files, 
               all labeled "MISSING PERSONS: PROPERTY OF MIAMI-METRO P.D."  
               The file on top reads: "JANE SAUNDERS." Dexter leafs through  
               it and we see a mug-shot of a seedy looking dude, labeled 
               "JAWORSKI."

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         He was a great cop here in Miami, 
                         taught me how to think like one, 
                         even though I'm not. Taught me how 
                         to cover my tracks.

                         I'm a very neat monster.

               As he puts the folder down, he notices his answering machine 
               is BLINKING -- Dexter eyes it, then presses a button and we 
               HEAR --

                         That's Harry's daughter, my marvelous 
                         foul-mouthed foster sister, Deborah.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          15   INT. BATHROOM - DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LATER                    15   

               Dexter takes a very hot shower, lathers up all over, scrubs 
               his face hard, then kneads the shampoo deep into his scalp 
               and enjoys the whole experience a great deal. Dries himself 
               in front of the mirror.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         She's the only person in the world 
                         who cares if I'm alive or dead. She 
                         loves me. Why? I don't know. I'm 
                         unlovable.  I have no feelings about 
                         anything.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          16   INT. BEDROOM - DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LATER                     16   

               Dexter finishes his morning push-ups then quickly gets 
               dressed. Slips on a snappy looking shirt, khakis, all bright, 
               light and airy. He's good to go.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         ...But if I could have feelings at 
                         all, I'd have them for Deb.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          17   EXT. PARKING LOT - 7 SEAS MOTEL - MIAMI, FL - LATER           17   

               Dexter gets out of his air conditioned Car and is momentarily 
               stunned by the brutally hot morning sun.

               He heads toward A CROWD OF polyester-wearing RETIREES, hand-
               me-down-wearing CUBANO refugees and bikini-wearing TOURISTS, 
               standing behind the yellow police tape cordoning off this 
               dingy low-life, hell-hole of a motel advertising hourly rates.  
               But right now, the rooms are empty and the parking lot is 
               full with COP CARS and MEDICAL EXAMINER VANS.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         There's something strange and 
                         disarming about looking at a homicide 
                         scene in the bright daylight of the 
                         Miami sun. It makes the most grotesque 
                         killings look antiseptic, staged --
                         like you're in a new and daring 
                         section of Disney World. Dahmer-Land.

               Dexter scoots under the yellow tape when SUDDENLY a very 
               intimidating-looking UNIFORMED COP blocks his path.

                                     COP
                         You better be a cop.

               Dexter flashes his OFFICIAL MIAMI-METRO FORENSIC DEPT. I.D.

                                     DEXTER
                         No. Forensics.

               The Cop eyes the badge then waves him in. Dexter walks past 
               him, then SEES amongst all the other COPS hanging around --

               Debra still looking like a cheap whore, running up to him.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Jeeze Deb, where the hell do you 
                         keep your gun?

                                     DEBRA
                              (catching her breath)
                         Cut the crap -- They found another 
                         hooker. At least, they think it's a 
                         hooker.

                                     DEXTER
                         Why?

                                     DEBRA
                         Hard to tell from what's left. That's 
                         the third in the last five months.

                                     DEXTER
                         Third?
                              (intrigued)
                         You mean there's...

                                     DEBRA
                         Hell yeah we got a serial killer, 
                         Bro - the other two were up in Broward 
                         County -- chopped up in bits and 
                         pieces too, and they say there's no 
                         connection. Any drooling moron could 
                         see these kills are connected. But 
                         that bitch...

                                                                        14.


                                     DEXTER
                         What bitch?

                                     DEBRA
                         That bitch. That big-hipped dope, 
                         Lieutenant LaGuerta -- Look at her.  

               And Dexter turns and SEES -- 

               LT. MARIA LAGUERTA (30's), the intensely sexy, Cuban born 
               head of Miami-Metro homicide, talking rapid fire to a clearly 
               nervous Cuban PORTER.

                                     DEBRA (CONT'D)
                         She's the lead on the case. How the 
                         hell does that happen?

                                     DEXTER
                         She's a born politician -- kiss enough 
                         ass and you get the post. Maybe you 
                         should try it sometimes.

                                     DEBRA
                         Blow me. She's convinced there's a 
                         witness and I want in on this case --
                         it's my beat but instead of using 
                         me, she's got some detectives I never 
                         met interviewing my whores who -- 
                         trust me -- are not going to talk to 
                         those dudes. What an idiot. Idiot. 
                         Idiot.

               LaGuerta catches Dexter's eye and in the midst of her rapid 
               paced conversation with the Cuban Porter, smiles at Dexter, 
               then her eyes quickly scan the crowd, the crime scene.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         Uh oh...there's that frown and those 
                         darting eyes. Perhaps she's hoping a 
                         clue will leap out of nowhere and 
                         she can shoot it.

                                     DEBRA
                         Dex...DEX...Jesus, come on, what the 
                         hell am I going to do?

               Dexter turns, smiles at Deb.

                                     DEXTER
                         What are you going to do?

                                     DEBRA
                         I'm going to get the hell out of 
                         this sex suit and get into the

                         homicide division, that's what I 
                         want to do.  But that ass kissing 
                         puta is gonna stick her bubble ass 
                         in the way.  Shit, why does she have 
                         to hate my goddamn guts?

                                     DEXTER
                         Cause you hate hers.

                                     DEBRA
                         Look, I don't need you to reiterate 
                         the fucken obvious. Okay? Now are 
                         you going to help me?

                                     DEXTER
                         I'll do anything for you, but...

                                     DEBRA
                              (cuts him off)
                         Don't be fucken dense on me now. You 
                         know what I need, Dex -- you have 
                         these things, these hunches -- you 
                         know with these types of murders.

                                     DEXTER
                         Just sometimes, Deb...
                              (off her look)
                         All right, let me take a look and in 
                         the meantime, avoid LaGuerta and 
                         talk to the Captain and ask him to 
                         put you on the case. But keep the 
                         sex suit on - it'll help your cause.

                                     DEBRA
                              (shakes her head)
                         Why do I love you?

               And with that, she takes off. Dexter smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          18   EXT. THE POOL - 7 SEAS MOTEL - MIAMI, FL - SAME               18   

               Dexter walks down and into the empty pool and SEES --  

               VINCE MASUKA (30's), slight, half Japanese, half white, 
               sporting a shaved head, meticulously brushing the pool tiles 
               for fingerprints.

               ANGEL BATISTA (30's), the corpulent, chain-smoking Miami-
               Metro Medical Examiner, leans down and very carefully plucks 
               out body parts which are all individually wrapped up in white 
               butcher's paper and neatly tied with twine.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        16.


               Batista's last grab is clearly a foot and...Batista sets it 
               down amongst a lot of other body parts (legs, hands, 
               individual fingers...) on a blue plastic tarp, and like a 
               puzzle we're beginning to see the complete human figure laid 
               out. It's gruesome, but still, there's something...</tt><i><tt>something 
               almost intriguingly artistic about it</tt></i><tt>.

               Masuka looks up, wipes the sweat off his brow, sees Dex and 
               smiles with a big fake smile.

               </tt><b><tt>FREEZE ON MASUKA'S FACE

                         Something's wrong with this guy, 
                         Masuka. It's like he learned how to 
                         smile from those models in a Sears 
                         catalogue.

                         Nice haircut, Masuka.

                                     MASUKA
                              (too excited)
                         Saw your sister. Damn...looking hot.

                                     DEXTER
                         She should. It's hot as hell out 
                         here.

                                     MASUKA
                              (shrugs)
                         So what brings you here?

                                     DEXTER
                         Came to see how the real experts 
                         operate.

               Masuka flashes that fake smile again, then starts laughing -- 
               his whole body convulsing in great heaves and gasps, almost 
               sounds like he's drowning.

               Dexter stares at him in amazement, then --

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         And that laugh. Do I perform CPR or 
                         the Heimlich?

               Masuka finally stops laughing.

                                     MASUKA
                         Seriously, why are you here?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        17.


                                     DEXTER
                              (rhetorically)
                         It's a crime scene.

                                     MASUKA
                         Yeah, but you do blood spatter.

                                     DEXTER
                         So?

                                     MASUKA
                         So, there's no blood here.

               Dexter stares at him, then suddenly feels light-headed, takes 
               a step back, something has happened. His world is clearly 
               rocked. Finally, he recoups, focuses back on Masuka.

                                     DEXTER
                         What was that?

                                     MASUKA
                         Yeah...There's no blood in or on or 
                         near the body at all. It's the 
                         weirdest thing you ever saw.

               PUSHING INTO DEXTER'S HORROR STRICKEN FACE

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         No blood. No sticky, hot, messy, 
                         awful blood. NO BLOOD AT ALL.
                              (beat)
                         Why hadn't I thought of that? No 
                         blood.
                              (and then his face 
                              relaxes)
                         What a gorgeous idea.

               Dexter quickly spins around to Batista, then whips out a 
               pair of surgical gloves, snaps them on, leans down next to 
               Batista who's slowly unwrapping </tt><i><tt>a hand </tt></i><tt>with his scalpel.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         How does he do it? How does the killer 
                         get rid of the blood?

                                     BATISTA
                         Hard to say. The body's in good shape 
                         and she was muy bonita. Had a big 
                         ass too. Her head's over there, take 
                         a look.

               Dexter ignores that, leans in, inspects the exposed hand.

                                     DEXTER
                         This is unique.

                                                                        18.


                                     MASUKA
                              (laughs)
                         No shit and no prints either.

               Batista picks away until he finally reveals the tip of an 
               ankle.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         This guy's good. I've never seen 
                         such clean, dry, neat looking dead 
                         flesh.  Wonderful.

               Dexter looks at Batista.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Very clean.

                                     BATISTA
                         Yeah, but he didn't finish - no 
                         terminado.

                                     DEXTER
                         Looks pretty completo to me, Angel.

                                     BATISTA
                         No, look -- he cut the leg in four 
                         pieces, almost like using a ruler, 
                         but this leg is only in two pieces, 
                         and here. Looks like he started to 
                         make a third cut but stopped. 
                         Possible, he got interrupted.

                                     MASUKA
                              (laughing)
                         That's why LaGuerta is looking for a 
                         witness. Working on that motel Porter 
                         back there. God help him.

               Dexter looks at them both.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         No blood. I can't think.
                              (beat)
                         I have to get out of here.

               Dexter rises -- takes one last look at all the marvelous 
               bloodless body parts laid out on the tarp, then without saying 
               anything, turns, walks away from Masuka and Batista.

                                     BATISTA
                         Dex, donde vas? Where you going?

                                     DEXTER
                              (spins around)
                         Hey...no blood -- no trabajo.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        19.


               And Dexter climbs out of the pool and disappears behind a 
               group of COPS standing by the squad cars.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          19   EXT. PARKING LOT - 7 SEAS MOTEL - MIAMI, FL - SAME            19   

               Dexter keeps walking, passes LaGuerta who winks at him.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         I wish she'd stop that. It's one of 
                         those mating rituals which I really 
                         don't understand.

               Dexter ducks past a group of REPORTERS who suddenly surround 
               LaGuerta pushing their microphones and cameras into her face, 
               spewing questions and as Dexter looks back at the crime scene, 
               we hear --

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         But that bloodless body -- This guy  
                         may have exceeded my own abilities.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          20   EXT. HOTEL - MIAMI, FL - LATER                                20   

               Dexter slowly pulls to a stop near the front entrance of the 
               hotel -- focuses on the VALET STAND where we see -- 

               JAMIE JAWORSKI (30's), a short, stocky, pleasant enough 
               looking man, whose large brown eyes might be a little too 
               close together, wearing a traditional valet outfit.  A sleek 
               BMW pulls up -- Jaworski opens the door and a sexy ASIAN 
               WOMAN dressed in a skimpy tennis outfit, steps out of the 
               car. Jaworksi watches her sashay into the hotel and as he 
               closes the door, we SEE a large tattoo of a naked woman, but 
               with a featureless face emblazoned across his forearm.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Jaworski leers at a gorgeous BLOND -- spandex outfit painted 
               on her body, a gym bag slung over her shoulder -- as she 
               gets out of another car and enters the hotel.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Six months ago, I think he fell in 
                         love with a pretty brunette, Mrs. 
                         Jane Saunders.

               Dexter opens a Miami-Metro P.D. missing person's file, pulls 
               out a picture of Jane Saunders -- and she is a very beautiful 
               brunette.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         A sweet mother of two, married to 
                         Harry Saunders a successful banker.

               Dexter shuffles through a series of still photos --

                                     DEXTER
                         They all lived a pleasant life in an 
                         overgrown modern house, until she 
                         unfortunately disappeared.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         The cops arrested the husband for 
                         murder. They never convicted him, 
                         but all wasn't lost because they 
                         still managed to destroy his life....

               Another LADY enters the hotel drops her tennis bag, bends 
               over and Jaworski freezes, stares at that pantalooned bottom.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         My favorite valet was a suspect for 
                         a while but the cops could never 
                         make anything stick.

               After a beat, Jaworski, slides into her car and drives away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          23   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MIAMI, FL - LATER                  23   

               Dexter, carrying a large box of donuts, walks past the 
               SERGEANT sitting behind the command desk talking on the phone --

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        21.


               the Sergeant quickly gets up, reaches into the donut box 
               grabs one -- 

               Dexter smiles, heads down the glass enclosed office cubicles, 
               passing UNIFORMED COPS -- weaves in and out of a bunch of 
               casually dressed POLICE DEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATORS, then comes 
               upon two veteran DETECTIVES.

                                     DETECTIVE BOB
                         Hey Dex...

               They stop, dig into the box, each grab a cream-filled donut.

                                     DEXTER
                              (happily)
                         Hi Bob, Dan...How're the families?

                                     DETECTIVE DAN
                              (with mouth full)
                         Mmmm...good...You..?

               Dexter nods, smiles.

                                     DETECTIVE BOB
                         See you at the next blood bath?

                         Never miss a party.

               The Detectives laugh, mumble "thanks" and keep walking.

               He turns around, sees Deb smiling, dressed in plain clothes 
               and running toward him.

               Debra reaches into his box of donuts, grabs a powdered one.

               rows of ceiling high metal shelves packed with records and 
               files. She looks up, smiles wide, then eyes Dexter 
               suspiciously.

                                     CAMILLIA
                         Keeping your fingernails clean?

                         Never leave home without my rubber 
                         gloves.

               And Camillia dives in, grabs a few crullers.

                                     CAMILLIA
                         Good boy.

               Beat, then Dexter eyes her, a small smile crosses his face.

                         Anything new?

               And she hands him a fat file, labeled "Jaworski."

                              (playful)

                         tell me...

               Dexter slips the file in to a manila envelope and heads out.

          25   INT. LAB - POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MIAMI, FL - SAME             25   

               Dexter, light footed as ever, walks through the large, glass 
               enclosed lab, passing the "Analytical," "Forensic" and 
               "Serology (blood)" sections all packed with SCIENTISTS and 
               ANALYSTS in white coats, hovering over microscopes, computers, 
               and other high tech machines.

               He reaches into his box of donuts, grabs the last one. Stares 
               into the empty box.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         Just like me. Clean, crisp outside, 
                         and nothing at all on the inside.

               Dexter dumps that box into a garbage can, passes Masuka 
               cataloging prints, heads toward the back of the room and 
               enters his small little glass enclosed office --

          26   INT. DEXTER'S OFFICE - POLICE HQ - SAME                       26   

               Where he's immediately confronted by --

               SGT. DOAKES (30's), a large, imposing BLACK MAN, whose cold 
               frosty eyes are framed by a face fixed with a permanent look 
               of hostility -- especially when he's around Dexter.

                                     SGT. DOAKES
                              (hard, impatient)
                         Where the hell you been?

                                     DEXTER
                         Crime scene?

               Doakes stares at him then looks around the office, eyes --

               The poster of Miami's, "Matador's Hockey Team," taped to one 
               of the glass walls, but the other walls are plastered with 
               images of blood stained walls, floors, and carpets -- looks 
               almost like a "</tt><i><tt>Jackson Pollack exhibit.</tt></i><tt>"

                                     SGT. DOAKES
                         What about these?

               Doakes shoves a few oversized color photos of A COUPLE OF 
               BODIES, lying dead on the carpeted floor of a large hotel 
               room into Dexter's hands.

                                     SGT. DOAKES (CONT'D)
                              (hard)
                         The hotel coke-head murders? This 
                         dealer and the girl?

               Dexter scans them -- eyes the blood spatter on the walls.

                         die by the hands of a professional 
                         killer. Nope. This is child's play.  
                         Messy work -- all that blood on the 
                         walls -- looks like finger painting.

                                     SGT. DOAKES
                         You give me the fucking creeps, you 
                         know that Dexter?

                         Yeah, I know. Sorry about that.

                         Yeah. You can give me your fucking 
                         analysis on the blood spatter on

                         And Doakes storms out of the office, 
                         Dexter eyes all the Lab Technicians, 
                         Cops and Detectives.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         The only real question I have is 
                         why, in a building full of cops...all 
                         supposedly with a keen insight into 
                         the human soul, is Doakes the only 
                         one that gets the creeps from me?

                                                                    CUT TO:

          28   INT. OCEAN VIEW HOTEL SUITE - MIAMI, FL - LATER               28   

               The sliding doors on the balcony are open and hot gusts of 
               wind whip the curtains around.

               And in the middle of this suite are a couple of (what look 
               like) tall microphone stands and -- Emanating from the top 
               of each stand is a series of individual strings stretched 
               across the room and pinned to the blood splattered on the 
               opposite wall and curtains.

               On the far right side of the room, the wall is almost entirely 
               covered with one big dripping splotch of blood.

               The left side of the room is very different.

               The wall is covered with thousands of seemingly random little 
               </tt><i><tt>dots of blood</tt></i><tt>, but like a Pissaro painting, when you step 
               back and away, those abstract dots suddenly transform into a 
               beautiful series of descending arcs, like rainbows of blood.

               Dexter pins yet another string to a tiny splat of blood on 
               the wall completing a complex maze of strings -- a massive 
               cat's cradle hanging across the room.

               Dexter walks back away from the wall, stands next to a young 
               buff UNIFORMED COP (20's). Dexter admires his work --

                                     UNIFORMED COP
                         So you're going to catch this guy in 
                         this big fucking spider web you're 
                         making?

                                     DEXTER

                         Heard they brought them out in chunks. 

                                     DEXTER
                              (up-beat)
                         And lots of little pieces too.

                                     UNIFORMED COP
                         So this killer used a sword?

                                     DEXTER
                         Nope, probably a very sharp knife.  
                         Look at the blood spatter. Look at 
                         the patterns, tells a story. See 
                         this big pond of blood right there?

               And he steps to the large blot on the right side of the wall.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         That was from the initial slice. The 
                         male victim was standing right here...
                              (points)
                         ...and the killer's knife swooped 
                         across, slashed his throat.  See -- 
                         Notice the long, thick, heavy drips, 
                         here and here.

                                     UNIFORMED COP
                         Yeah, nice.

               And Dexter points to the arcs of blood on the left side.

                                     DEXTER
                         Now over here are nice clean sprays 
                         of blood and there's a rhythm to 
                         them, and that can only happen when 
                         you're holding something light, moving 
                         quick, nice, sharp slices through 
                         the body -- no splashes, no drips, 
                         clean and easy, graceful cuts like 
                         skipping pebbles across a lake. This 
                         guy knew how to use a blade.

                         hey, you never know.

               Dexter walks around the room, picks up his camera, focuses

                         Now I eat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          29   EXT/INT. DEXTER'S CAR - STREETS - MIAMI, FL - LATER           29   

               Dexter drives down a squalid residential street, surrounded 
               by low income housing, barbecue joints and crumbling Catholic 
               Churches. Gang-looking KIDS hang out in front of bodegas, 
               drinking, smoking -- their boom boxes blasting.

               Eating a juicy Cuban pork sandwich, Dexter pulls into a 
               parking spot, then puts the sandwich down.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         The problem with eating and driving, 
                         which I love to do, is not being 
                         able to employ the ten-two hand 
                         position on the wheel. It's a matter 
                         of public safety.

               He picks up the new "JAWORSKI" file Camillia gave him.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         But there's always a sacrifice.

               Dexter scans a few pages of the Jaworski file.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Looks like Jaworski's been busy...

               He turns his head, looks across the street and focuses on a 
               small shitty looking house with a rusty chain link fence 
               blocking the side alley running along the house.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        29.


                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         ...recently picked up for a peeping 
                         tom episode and flashed a poor soccer 
                         mom.
                              (beat)
                         Time to take a little tour.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          30   INT. JAWORSKI'S HOUSE - MIAMI, FL - DAY                       30   

               And as soon as Dexter steps inside the side door, we HEAR 
               the loud, vicious BARKS of a massive DOG and Dexter FREEZES.

               He then slowly turns and SEES that massive mangy dog, snarling 
               and licking its chops at the end of the hallway.  Dexter and 
               the dog lock eyes and then -- The Dog suddenly charges at 
               Dexter, but Dexter calmly closes the hallway door and the 
               dog SMASHES into it -- Bam. 

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         Animals don't like me. Especially 
                         dogs.

               But that monster dog keeps banging against the door  
               desperately wanting to take a bite out of Dexter. 

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         I don't think they approve of what I 
                         sometimes do to their masters. And 
                         that dog recognizes me, as easily as 
                         I can recognize Jaworski...or any 
                         other killer.

               Dexter looks around the house. It's small and messy, but 
               above all, sordid. There's a paper towel holder next to the 
               unmade bed. In the middle of the room is a desk with a 
               computer on it and an expensive looking digital video camera.  
               Dexter picks it up, eyes it curiously.

               He then notices a stack of S&amp;M porn magazines -- picks one 
               up -- flips through it, stops on the classifieds, reads a 
               few.  Some have been highlighted.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Interesting taste in literature. His 
                         needs are evolving -- turning violent.  
                         He's on the fast track.

               And as Dexter walks out of the house, closing the door behind 
               him, we HEAR --

          32   EXT. OCEAN DRIVE - SOUTH BEACH - EVENING                      32   

               Dexter, looking showered and fresh and wearing a snappy, new 
               outfit, carries a paper bag filled with goodies, walks through 
               the extraordinary parade of gorgeous MEN and WOMEN.  Rumba 
               music BLASTING through restaurant speakers follows him as he 
               goes.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         Friday night. Date night in Miami.
                         Every night is date night in Miami, 
                         and everyone's having sex, but for 
                         me, sex never enters into it.

               Dexter walks past a good looking COUPLE sitting at a table 
               at an outdoor cafe, stops -- does a double take...

               And sure enough the GUY is sipping a Mojito, while the pretty 
               young GIRL, smoking a cigarette with one hand, slowly and 
               casually massages the guy's crotch with the other.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         I don't understand sex. It's not in 
                         my nature. I don't have anything 
                         against women, and I certainly have 
                         an appropriate sensibility about 
                         men, but when it comes to the actual 
                         act of sex, it just seems so 
                         undignified.

               More sexy, young hip WOMEN wearing micro short, tight dresses 
               saunter up and down the boulevard.

               Dexter rises, walks into the living room -- modest and simple,

               KIOSKS selling hot pork sandwiches, ice cold beers, Jamaican

               And Rita pulls Dexter past the kiosks and into a seething 
               crowd of skimpily dressed WOMEN and MEN dancing and drinking 
               tequila under the intense midnight heat.

               Laser and strobe lights illuminate the crowd and D.J.'s on a  
               stage frenetically spinning an upbeat Reggae-ton tune. It's 
               a bacchanalian human flesh feast.  As Rita tries to get Dexter 
               to dance, Dexter suddenly becomes aware of some not so distant 
               blue and red flashing lights on the other side of the crowd. 
               No one else seems to notice, but Dexter cranes his neck and 
               SEES -- 

               A couple of POLICE CARS, AN AMBULANCE, their red and blue 
               lights twirling and the ubiquitous yellow "Caution Crime 
               Scene" police tape cordoning off a small area. 

               Dexter grabs Rita's hand tight, STOPS walking.

                         They don't always know they need me.

               And with that, he fights his way through the sweltering crowd, 
               heads toward the crime scene and Rita calls out --

               And Dexter suddenly feels light headed again, paces, recoups, 
               then leans down next to Batista -- focuses.

               Dexter takes a breath, looks at Batista.

                         and God knows what he's doing with 
                         it.

               Dexter stares at Batista, gets up and slowly walks away deep 
               in thought.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         He's certainly raising the bar. Damn, 
                         this guy is good.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          45   INT. DEXTER'S CAR - IN FRONT OF RITA'S HOUSE - SAME           45   

               The car stops. Dexter and Rita sit in silence, then --

                                     RITA
                         Will they catch him soon?

                                     DEXTER
                         Doubt it. The killer is an artist...

                                     RITA
                              (confused)
                         What do you mean?

               But now Dexter's in his own world and without even realizing  
               it, he slowly runs his hand over Rita's thigh, tracing out  
               the cut marks he just saw on the bloodless body. As he speaks 
               softly, his hand moves higher and higher up her leg. 

                                     DEXTER
                         His technique...it's incredible.

                                     RITA
                         What..? Dex, I can hardly hear what 
                         you're...

               But before she finishes, Dexter's hand is SUDDENLY way too 
               close to Rita's crotch and a look of horror crosses her face, 
               she PUSHES his hand away, and quickly jumps back.  She then 
               pats her dress down, frantically runs her hands through her 
               hair.

                                     RITA (CONT'D)
                         I'm sorry...I don't think I want to -- 
                         I mean, I'm not </tt><i><tt>ready </tt></i><tt>for -- Damn 
                         it, Dexter. WHY!?

               She unbuckles her seat belt, jerks the door handle up, jumps 
               out of the car, SLAMS the door shut -- runs into her house.

               BACK ON DEXTER

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         What have I done now? I'm not even 
                         interested. And why can't I get that 
                         neat stack of body parts out of my 
                         head.

                         Why did I touch her that way?

               And as we push in tight to Dexter's face, we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

          46   INT. LIVING ROOM - DEXTER'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT      46   

               And Dexter looks GRIM and ANGRY-- sits at his desk, faces 
               his computer -- the large "Jaworski File" just inches from 
               his fingers and right next to that, is the same porn magazine 
               we saw in Jaworski's apartment.

               Dexter pounds away on the keyboard and as the images on the 
               computer screen reflect off his face, his shoulders tighten, 
               and his eyes turn cold and black.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         That's it. He's definitely the one.
                              (beat)
                         "Scream Bitch Scream." The mother of 
                         all rape sites.

          A46  PLAYING ON THE SCREEN                                         A46  

               Is a grainy video of the attractive, but the struggling, 
               desperate Jane Saunders is tied down to a stained mattress 
               lying on a filthy basement floor -- and humping away on top 
               of her is -- a short, stocky, masked man with <u>the same 
               tattooed hands</u> we saw on Jaworski.

               It's unseemly and nauseating, then it becomes pure evil as 
               we watch Jaworski climax, reach under the mattress, pull out 
               a knife, and as he raises it high in the air, we --

               CUT BACK TO:

          46   THE FURIOUS DEXTER                                            46   

               Staring at the computer -- hatred all over his face.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         ...Now it's just a matter of time 
                         before he becomes a drop of blood in 
                         my glass slide collection.
                              (beat)
                         But I have to wait, because what I 
                         do requires infinite planning and I 
                         have to be careful and follow the 
                         code of my father.

               And as Dexter pushes back from his desk, we hear --

                         the body looked different from the 
                         others. Her pieces were cold -- Like 
                         meat packing cold, so that's what 
                         I'm pondering -- Is that what cell

                         Just state your case, clean and easy, 
                         and you'll be the hero.

               And just then, Masuka slides into a seat next to Deb.

                                     MASUKA
                         Deb, how about I give you a hundred 
                         bucks and you let me put my head 
                         between your babaloos?

                                     DEBRA
                              (right back and loud)
                         How about I stomp on your dick?

               Masuka starts heaving and choking with that laugh and Deb 
               stares at him with a mixture of amazement and disgust.

               ON LAGUERTA AT THE PODIUM

                                     LAGUERTA
                              (eyes Deb and Masuka)
                         Okay, settle down. Now, has anyone 
                         tracked down our witness?

               Mumbles throughout the room. Her face tenses, she's pissed.

                                     LAGUERTA (CONT'D)
                         COME ON, PEOPLE -- SOMEONE NEEDS TO 
                         FIND SOMETHING HERE.

                                     DEBRA
                         Uh -- Lt. LaGuerta...

               Everyone turns -- LaGuerta looks at Deb, rolls her eyes.

                                     LAGUERTA
                         Oh, Officer Morgan...Didn't recognize 
                         you with your clothes on.

               Titters all around. Deb hesitates then faces LaGuerta.

                                     DEBRA
                         I have an idea -- something in a

               Deb stands, takes a breath and says --

                         week or so.

               SILENCE. Everyone stares at Deb, then --

                                     LAGUERTA
                         Refrigerated trucks?

                         Like ice cream trucks?

               They lock eyes. It's a stand-off.

                         She doesn't get it -- None of the

                         isn't making them see it.

                         refrigerated truck that is mobile, 
                         so he'll be harder to catch -- a 
                         refrigerated truck, that might give 
                         us a lead.

               Everyone fidgets uncomfortably in their seats.

                         something so let's concentrate on 
                         finding that person. Okay?

                         But...

                         Okay, that's all for today.

               And as everyone rises and leaves the room, Dexter looks at 
               LaGuerta who winks at him.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         Shit...

               But Dexter RACES out of the room and down --

          55   THE HALLWAY                                                   55   

               Where he grabs Deb storming away. She spins and out of

               Then she PUNCHES Dex hard in his chest.

                         Ouch...Jesus, Deb...

                         Cock?

                                     DEBRA
                         You know what I fucking mean. I mean, 
                         what the fuck was I supposed to say?  
                         I'm just there because the Captain 
                         said they had to let me in.

                                     DEXTER
                         But he didn't say they had to listen 
                         to you.

                         There is another way. Find the truck.

               And just then LaGuerta appears.

                         Dexter. My office, please.

               LaGuerta turns, saunters away. Deb stares at Dex with a look 
               of utter amazement.

                                     DEBRA

               And Deb takes off.

                                     DEXTER
                         NO...Deb, wait...

                         It has nothing to do with drugs.

                         I think Sgt. Doakes is right.

               Dex eyes LaGuerta and Doakes looks like he's about to pull 
               his gun. Dex eyes him, then says evenly --

                         there to kill the woman -- not the

                         and old people from New Jersey. But 
                         this place ran out of money -- 
                         stalled, inert, lifeless.

               Jaworski pull up in his pickup, get out, a large wrench in 
               his hand. He steps through the puddles and heads into the

               And we see Jaworski slowly head up the stairs, walk down the 
               hallway, then disappear into a second story room.

               DOORWAY P.O.V.

               And we see Jaworski, struggling with a large piece of copper 
               tubing, turning his wrench, over and over until the tubing 
               is finally freed.

               Sweating, Jaworski, picks up a pile of tubing, cradles it in 
               his arms, heads for the door and as soon as he steps into 
               the doorway, he stops -- FREEZES.

                                     JAWORSKI
                         Hey, wait a...

               And with that, Dexter pulls a syringe out of his pocket, 
               plunges the needle deep into Jaworski's neck and Jaworski 
               crumbles to the ground.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          60   INT. LARGE ROOM - BAYWATER PROJECTS - MIAMI, FL - LATER       60   

               Jaworski's naked body is shrink wrapped down over a stack of 
               sheet rock. Duct tape stretched across his mouth.

               Next to him is a small table covered with a gleaming, lethal 
               set of filet knives of various shapes and sizes.

               Dexter peels the mask off his face, leans over Jaworski and 
               stares into his eyes.

                                                                        55.


                                     DEXTER
                         Let's talk.

               Jaworski struggles, shakes his head and Dexter rips the duct 
               tape off his face.

                                     JAWORSKI
                              (pained)
                         Fuck...

                                     DEXTER
                         Talk.

                                     JAWORSKI
                              (eyes wild with fear)
                         What? What do you mean?

                                     DEXTER
                         I think you know what I mean.

                                     JAWORSKI
                         No.

               And with that, Dexter very casually and smoothly, draws the 
               scalpel across Jaworski's cheek.

                                     JAWORSKI (CONT'D)
                         Oh, God...

                                     DEXTER
                              (tight, hard)
                         Now talk to me about Jane Saunders.

               Beat. Then Dexter lifts the scalpel again.

                                     JAWORSKI
                              (weakly)
                         Okay...okay...
                              (beat)
                         I did her.

                                     DEXTER
                         How?

               Beat.

                                     JAWORSKI
                         In a movie -- snuff film.
                              (and then)
                         But I'm not sorry.

                                     DEXTER
                         Of course not. And now, I'm not sorry, 
                         either.

                                                                        56.


               And with that, Dexter lifts up his knife, then suddenly stops, 
               reaches into his pants pocket and pulls out his cell phone.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)

                         like a little while. I'm really...What

                              (Beat)
                         Okay, bye.

               He hangs up, looks at Jaworksi, smiles, raises his knife 
               again and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dexter gently places a piece of Jaworski's leg into a white 
               Hefty garbage bags filled with other bits and pieces of 
               Jaworksi's body stacked in a pile across the room. He takes 
               a deep breath then whips his apron and gloves off -- 

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         I feel a lot better now. Always do 
                         afterwards.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          64   EXT. DEXTER'S CAR - BISCAYNE BLVD - LATER THAT NIGHT          64   

               Dexter drives down Biscayne Blvd, comes to a stop at a red 
               light. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        57.

               After a beat, he reaches into his shirt pocket, pulls out 
               the glass side of Jaworski's blood, looks at it.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         All in all it was good night -- One 
                         less amateur film maker polluting 
                         the internet.

               Just then, the beam of the headlights of a truck approaching 
               from behind creeps up on his hand and Dexter quickly looks 
               into his rear view mirror.

          B64  POV FROM THE TRUCK                                            B64  

               As it bears down on Dexter's car.

               And Dexter is instantly blinded by the light.

               THE TRUCK

               Slowly pulls around and --

               DEXTER

               Looks out of the passenger side window and sees --

               THE TRUCK

               Slowly pass him, and Dexter realizes </tt><i><tt>that it's a refrigerated</tt></i><tt>

</tt></i><tt>                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         No...Can't be.

               And just then the truck takes off -- Dexter's shocked. He 
               chases after the truck and --

          65   THE TRUCK                                                     65   

               Cruises down one block, takes a right.

          66   DEXTER'S                                                      66

               Speeds up -- Passes a sign that reads: "Port of Miami. 
               Restricted Area."

               Speeds after the truck and drives onto --

               THE OLD PORT BRIDGE

               And as he speeds up the causeway, he suddenly realizes that 
               he's coming to a dead end.

               DEXTER

               Sees the truck stopped ahead and --

               Slams his brakes and comes to a stop and watches --

          69   THE TRUCK                                                     69   

               Slowly begins a three point turn, and when it stops, it's 
               now facing --

          70   DEXTER                                                        70   

               Who is now unnerved. It's a Mexican standoff. Beat.

               Squints and when he opens his eyes, he SEES --

          71   THE TRUCK                                                     71   

               RACING BACK </tt><i><tt>TOWARD DEXTER -- </tt></i><tt>and it's getting closer, closer.

          72   DEXTER                                                        72   

               Turns white, then grips the wheel tighter and as the oncoming 
               truck gets closer --

          73   OMIT 73                                                       73

               Flies into Dexter's windshield. The glass CRACKS, SPIDERS 
               and...

          75   THE HEAD                                                      75   

               Rolls off the hood, BOUNCES onto the wet causeway and starts 
               rolling and skipping, heading straight toward the edge of 
               the road and coming dangerously close to falling into the 
               water below.

          76   DEXTER                                                        76   

               Jumps out of the car, RACES after the rolling head, catches 
               up to it, bends down and GRABS IT --

               But the rain soaked, bloodless-head SLIPS through his fingers 
               and scoots away from him. Then with a burst of energy, Dexter 
               lunges -- GRABS it pulls it in close and tight with his hands.

               He takes a couple of deep breaths, rises to his feet and...

               Standing alone in the middle of the empty road, Dexter lifts 
               the head up, looks into her eyes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dexter sits on the hood of his car, watching the PARAMEDICS 
               pick up the head and drop it into a bag, then carry it into 
               n ambulance. Dexter waves --

                                     DEXTER
                         Bye, bye.

               Dex looks across the street at --

               Sgt. Doakes and Debra leaning against an unmarked police car 
               nd Debra smiles wide, gives him a thumbs up and just then --

               LaGuerta's car pulls up, headlights momentarily blinding 
               Dexter.

               He shields his eyes, then after a beat, he sees LaGuerta get 
               ut of her car, and lock eyes with --

               Deb who smirks at her, then turns, nods to Doakes. They both 
               get into the unmarked car and take off.

               LaGuerta shakes her head, SLAMS her door shut and walks 
               towards Dexter.

                                     LAGUERTA
                         You okay?

               LaGuerta approaches. Dexter eyes her then says wryly.

               LaGuerta looks around, then takes a step towards him.

                                     LAGUERTA (CONT'D)
                         So did you see the driver of the 
                         truck?

                                     DEXTER
                         Nope.

                                     DEXTER
                         No question.

                                     LAGUERTA
                         You seem pretty certain.

               She steps in even closer.

                                     DEXTER
                         Certain is my middle name.

                                     LAGUERTA
                              (seductively)
                         I like a confident man.

               And she presses her tempting, elegant body against his body.

                                     LAGUERTA (CONT'D)
                         Nice job on the coke head murders.  
                         Doakes picked up the killer. It was 
                         her boyfriend. But Doakes still hates 
                         you.

               Her hand drops down, starts massaging his thigh.

                                     LAGUERTA (CONT'D)
                         How'd you get so smart, Dexter?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        61.


               She runs her hands over his chest, then through his hair.

                                     LAGUERTA (CONT'D)
                         And you always wear such nice clothes.

                                     DEXTER
                         Lt, I don't think...

               She presses harder against him, whispers seductively --

                                     LAGUERTA
                         Shhhh...

                                     DEXTER
                         No, Lt...not here.

                                     LAGUERTA
                         That's right, not here. My place.

               And as she leans in for the kiss, Dexter quickly turns his 
               face away, scoots to the side and...LaGuerta falls forward, 
               hitting the car hard.

                                     DEXTER
                              (horrified)
                         Lt...I'm so, so sorry.

               LaGuerta rights herself, whips around -- venom in her eyes.

                                     LAGUERTA
                         </tt><i><tt>You son-of-a-bitch.

</tt></i><tt>                                     DEXTER
                         No...Lt...Please, listen...I just 
                         had a head thrown at me and I'm 
                         feeling a little out of sorts and 
                         I'm afraid I might disappoint you.

               They lock eyes. Dexter smiles wide and bright and LaGuerta 
               finally buys it -- smiles back.

                                     LAGUERTA
                         Okay, some other time...When you're 
                         less traumatized.

               They lock eyes, Dexter nods, then ducks into his car and 
               drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

          78   EXT. RITA'S HOUSE - MIAMI, FL - EARLY MORNING                 78   

               Dexter stands in front of Rita's door, presses the bell. 
               Ding, dong, ding, dong. The door swings open and Dexter SEES 
               Rita bundled up in her robe.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        62.


               After a beat --

                                     RITA
                              (gently)
                         Dex...it's been eight hours...

                                     DEXTER
                         I'm sorry.

                                     RITA
                         I was worried and I didn't know what 
                         to do...
                              (beat)
                         I called in sick...I mean, are you 
                         okay?

                                     DEXTER
                         Yeah, sure, I'm fine...I'm sorry...it 
                         was, you know -- another...

                                     RITA
                         Oh...
                              (beat)
                         The kids slept over next door --
                              (beat)
                         They can stay a little longer...

                                     DEXTER
                         Okay.

               Beat.

                                     RITA
                         Would you like to come in?

                                     DEXTER
                         Okay.

               And he steps --

          79   INT. RITA'S HOUSE - MIAMI, FL - SAME                          79   

               Dexter follows Rita into the living room -- she turns, faces 
               him.

                                     RITA
                         I don't want to lose you, Dex.

                                     DEXTER
                         Okay...Sure...

                                     RITA
                         And I want you...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        63.


               And with that, she opens her robe and shyly shows Dexter the 
               simple but elegant nightgown she's wearing underneath.

                                     RITA (CONT'D)
                              (nervously)
                         DEX...I want to </tt><i><tt>make love to you.

</tt></i><tt>                                     DEXTER
                         Oh, okay, thanks.

                                     RITA
                         You're welcome.

               And Rita reaches out, slowly pulls him close. They start to 
               kiss, then she stops, pulls back --

                                     RITA (CONT'D)
                         Don't worry, the Doctor's cleared up 
                         that little problem I had.

                                     DEXTER
                              (hesitantly)
                         Okay, that's...that's good.

               And they kiss and then it builds until Dexter guides Rita to 
               the couch and as he slowly lays her down, we --

                                                                    CUT TO:

          80   INT. DEXTER'S APARTMENT - COCONUT GROVE, FL - MORNING         80   

               Dexter steps inside, closes the door.

                                     DEXTER (V.O.)
                         Wow. Sex. How did that happen? But 
                         she seemed pleased so I guess I didn't 
                         disappoint her.

               He looks around the room, all seems fine and he heads into --

               THE DARK KITCHEN

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         But that's because I don't care, and 
                         chances are if you don't care about 
                         something, you'll be better at it.

               He flips on the light --

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         Performance anxiety must be a bitch.

               And then he SEES --

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                        64.


               BARBIE DOLL'S HEAD

               Scotched taped and hanging by its hair on the refrigerator 
               door and Dexter FREEZES -- stares at the head. He's clearly 
               tense, unnerved.

               Dexter slowly approaches the refrigerator, touches the Barbie 
               head and as it swings gently back and forth, he slowly opens 
               the freezer door and inside he finds --

               THE BARBIE DOLL BODY PARTS

               Neatly stacked and tied together with little pink ribbons --
               just like the bloodless bodies, sans the little pink ribbons.

               After a beat, Dexter's body relaxes --

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         I suppose I should be upset, even 
                         feel violated, but I'm not.

               And then he notices --

               SMALL VANITY MIRROR

               Stuck in one of Barbie's hands. He pulls the tiny mirror out 
               of the doll's hand, stares into it. And we see little 
               fragmented images of Dexter's face off the mirror.

                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         No...In fact, I think this is a 
                         friendly message -- Kind of like, 
                         'Hey, want to play?'

               Dex puts the mirror down, closes the freezer door, and as he 
               looks down at the little Barbie head swinging on the 
               refrigerator door again, we --

               </tt><b><tt>FREEZE ON DEXTER'S SMILING FACE

</tt></b><tt>                                     DEXTER (CONT'D)
                         And yes, I want to play...I really, 
                         really do.

               And on that, we --

                                                                   FADE TO:
