                              conversational tone)

                         Or a song?

               EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT

               We see the flat, monumental surface of stone rising to the 
               sky.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Does stone ever feel weariness?

               INT. A MODEST APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Windows open, a fan humming. A man lies asleep, face down, 
               sprawled out; his hair is tousled, his pajama top open and 
               twisted, the sheet thrown back.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                              (wearily)
                         Some people think it's easy to be a 
                         bank teller. Oh brother!

               EXT. AN EAST-SIDE TENEMENT FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               A husband and wife are sleeping on bad clothes on the fire 
               escape.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                              (reflectively)
                         I wonder how many stitches in a dress? 
                         I'll have to count 'em sometime.

               There is a SOUND: of a caterwauling cat.

               The woman turns over. CAMERA HOLDS on sleeping couple.

               CAMERA PANS DOWN TO:

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                              (amused)
                         I wonder how many meals I've cooked 
                         in my life? And how many dishes I've 
                         washed?

               EXT. CAT - NIGHT

               digging into an open garbage pail. Nearby another cat sits 
               patiently.

                                     NARRATOR
                         A city asleep --

               EXT. THE SKY - NIGHT

               We see the silhouette of a plane with its lights winking for 
               a landing.

                                     NARRATOR
                         -- or as nearly asleep --

               EXT. THE CITY AS SEEN FROM THE PLANE - NIGHT

               We see the outline of the boroughs, the lighted bridges that 
               link them, the lighted arteries and veins, the upthrust 
               fingers of stone.

                                     NARRATOR
                         -- as any city ever is.

               EXT. SINGLE ELEVATED TRAIN MOVING SLOWLY ON ITS TRACKS - 
               NIGHT

               SOUND: Train wheels.

                                     NARRATOR
                         The pulse of a city like the pulse 
                         of a man --

               FREIGHT - NIGHT

               SOUND: Boat whistle.

                                     NARRATOR
                         -- can be felt in sleep, slow and 
                         steady --

               INT. ATTENDANT IN AN ELECTRIC CO. SUB STATION - NIGHT

               SOUND: Hum of dynamos.

                                     NARRATOR

               RADIO STATION

               SOUND: A hot jive recording that blends into the click of 
               linotype keys.

                                     JOCKEY'S VOICE
                              (fast)
                         It starts hot and it ends gutty.

                                     OPERATOR'S VOICE
                         Wonder what the ol' lady made me for 
                         lunch tonight? If it's liverwurst 
                         again she's got a divorce.

               INT. A CLEANING WOMAN VACUUMING A CARPET IN THE LOBBY OF THE 
               RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - NIGHT

               SOUND: Low hum of the vacuum cleaner.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                              (wearily, over vacuum 
                              sound)
                         From where I stand this world's made 
                         up of nothin' but dirty feet.

               INT. A DRUNKEN, UNSHAVEN BUM IS WATCHING A WINDOW DRESSER IN 
               A SMART FIFTH AVENUE DRESS SHOP - NIGHT

               The Dresser is having difficulty in pulling a girdle down 
               over the length of a dummy figure. A sign over the shop reads: 
               Madge Livingston.

                                     BUM'S VOICE
                              (Hoarse)
                         Hey, buddy, do they pay you for that 
                         or --
                              (as girdle slips into 
                              place over hips)
                         -- whoops!

               INT. WELL-FURNISHED APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A group of well-dressed, middle-aged men and women are playing 
               bridge and drinking. Among them are Dr. and Mrs. Lawrence 
               Stoneman.

               SOUND: Rhumba music.

                                     NARRATOR
                         And while some people work and most 
                         sleep, others are at the close of an 
                         evening of relaxation --

               SOUND CONTINUES OVER INTO:

               INT. NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

               Focusing on a ringside table where a couple -- Ruth Young 
               and Robert Niles -- are watching floor show.

               On the bass drum of the orchestra are the words: Trinidad 
               Club.

               SOUND: Music swells to a more and more intense beat and then 
               is suddenly cut off.

               INT. A WELL-FURNISHED BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The only light is from the moon through the half-raised shade.

               We dimly perceive an act of murder: a woman on a bed is being 
               chloroformed by two men. She is in a nightgown. One man, 
               Garza, holds her from behind. The other, Backalis, holds a 
               handkerchief over her face. Her body twists spasmodically, 
               uselessly.

               There is no sound except the creaking of the bed and the 
               heavy breathing of the men.

                                     NARRATOR
                              (voice sharp, intense)
                         And still another -- is at the close 
                         of her life.

               The woman's struggles cease. She slumps back. The men hold 
               her still, the handkerchief over her face. Both men are 
               wearing gloves. We can't see the faces of either man. One of 
               them (Backalis) is wearing a distinctive jacket.

                                     BACKALIS
                              (nervous whisper)
                         Let's go.

                                     GARZA
                              (angry whisper)
                         Don't be a fool. This has to be sure. 
                         Lift her up.

               The men lift the body.

                                     BACKALIS
                              (nervously)
                         Whatcha gonna do?

                                     GARZA
                              (slight laugh)
                         It's a hot night. We'll give her a 
                         bath.

               They carry the woman into the adjoining bathroom. They lower 
               her into tub. CAMERA FOLLOWS A HAND as it turns on the faucet 
               and the water rushes out.

               EXT. A STREET - DAWN

               CLOSE SHOT WATER RUSHING OUT

               Water is flowing from a spigot on a street-washing machine 
               that is proceeding slowly down a street in the East Sixties. 
               First faint morning light.

                                     NARRATOR
                              (quietly)
                         A hot night working its way toward 
                         dawn. And everything is as usual --

               HOLLAND TUNNEL - DAWN

                                     NARRATOR
                         Jersey lettuce for New York markets --

               EXT. WEST WASHINGTON POULTRY MARKET - DAWN

               A chicken escapes from a crate and a man runs after it.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Tonight's fricassee is somewhat 
                         reluctant --

               INT. FIRE HOUSE - DAWN

               CAMERA is shooting from open doorway at interior. A man at 
               desk, the fire trucks, a sleeping dalmatian dog.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Everything as usual --

               EXT. EAST SIDE PIER IN SHADOWS - DAWN

               Two men are walking to edge of pier.

                                     NARRATOR
                         -- and even this, too, can be called 
                         routine in a city of eight million 
                         people --

               CLOSE SHOT BACKALIS AND GARZA

               Backalis, holding a bottle of whiskey, is drunk. Garza watches 
               him carefully. Both men are in shadows. As Backalis talks, 
               he sits down on edge of pier and looks out over water. He 
               turns so that we see his face. We don't see Garza's face in 
               entire scene.

                                     BACKALIS
                              (drunkenly -- 
                              tragically)
                         I done a lot of things but I never 
                         killed nobody... Gonna stay drunk 
                         for a long time... Don't know what 
                         I'm gonna say to God when my time 
                         comes. He's got a big heart, I'm 
                         told, but He don't like --

               Backalis never finishes. Garza swings his fist from behind 
               and hits Backalis a blow behind the ear. There is a dull 
               thud as Backalis topples over, his head striking the pier. 
               Garza kneels, pulls the bottle of whiskey out of his hand.

                                     GARZA
                              (angrily)
                         I thought you were off the liquor?
                              (angrily -- during 
                              action)
                         Liquor is bad. Weakens your character -- 
                         fuzzes your brain -- turns you soft. 
                         How can a man like me trust a liar 
                         like you? I can't!

               Garza angrily throws the whiskey bottle over the pier. We 
               HEAR a splash. Quickly he thrusts his hand into Backalis's 
               pocket, takes out a chamois bag, puts it in his own. He 
               removes Backalis's wallet, tosses it over. He looks around 
               swiftly, then lifts Backalis with his powerful arms.

               Garza heaves Backalis over edge of pier. A low splash. Garza 
               rises, spits angrily into water, starts off.

               EXT. THE SKY - DAWN

               IT IS STREAKED BY MORNING LIGHT

                                     NARRATOR
                              (softly)

               room. The blinds are drawn so that the light is dim. Martha 
               hesitates at doorway, then enters quietly. The room is 
               attractively furnished. Martha puts her purse down, crosses 
               to bedroom door, listens. She knocks softly, knocks again. 
               She opens door, peeks in. Bedroom is dark, blinds drawn. She 
               sees that bed is unoccupied. She goes in.

               She crosses to blind and then notices an overturned, smashed 
               lamp. As she crosses to it we hear a SOUND from open bathroom 
               door of water dropping from a tap that has not been completely 
               shut. Martha looks toward bathtub. With her, we see that the

               by horror. Her mouth opens in a soundless scream. Then she 
               turns and runs.

               CAPTAIN SAM DONAHUE is at his desk, looking at a folder. He 
               is a husky man of sixty with a wide, pleasant smile and an 
               intelligent face. Seated in a chair nearby is Lieutenant Dan 
               Mulvey, whom we saw, earlier, at breakfast. He is a short, 
               middle-aged man, who might pass for a bookkeeper. His speech 
               contains a bit of Irish and a lot of Brooklyn. He is smoking 
               a pipe. He has a second folder in his lap.

               There is nothing in the manner, dress or speech of either 
               man to suggest the accepted notion of policeman or detective.

                                     DONAHUE
                              (looking up from folder)

                         did?

                         No -- but I see eighteen years of 
                         feeling lonely and beaten. So he --

                              (thoughtfully)
                         Maybe... Sometimes I wonder what the 
                         human heart's made out of.

                                     MULVEY
                         My wife, rest her soul, always said 
                         she'd rather look into a man's heart 
                         than into his head -- that you could 
                         tell more about him.

               Donahue turns as BEN MILLER, a chunky police stenographer in 
               plain clothes, enters. He hands a slip of paper to Donahue.

                                     MILLER
                         This just came in, Captain.
                              (to Mulvey, as he 
                              goes out)
                         Morning, Lieutenant.

                                     MULVEY
                         Morning, Ben.

                                     DONAHUE
                              (reading paper)
                         You're free, aren't you, Dan?

                                     MULVEY
                         I haven't had a hard day's work since 
                         yesterday.

                                     DONAHUE
                              (handing him paper)
                         Woman drowned in a bathtub. Your 
                         assignment.

               Mulvey nods, gets up, looking at paper.

                                     MULVEY
                         Who's to do my leg work?

                                     DONAHUE
                         How about young Halloran again?

                                     MULVEY
                              (going toward door)
                         All right. I like the boy.

                                     DONAHUE
                         How's he doing?

                                     MULVEY
                         He's makin' the same mistakes I made 
                         at his age.

                                     DONAHUE
                         Too bad. I thought he showed promise.

               Mulvey reacts, goes out.

               INT. MANHATTAN HOMICIDE SQUAD OFFICE - DAY

               A large office with several desks and chairs behind a wooden 
               railing. Through an open door can be seen some of the cots 
               of the dormitory where men on night duty sleep. On a bench 
               talking to Ben Miller is Detective James Halloran, the tall, 
               pleasant-looking young man whom we saw saying good-bye earlier 
               to his wife. Mulvey takes his hat off a hat rack. He comes 
               up behind the bench and pauses a foot away to listen to 
               Halloran, who is talking seriously, with great interest in 
               what he's saying.

                                     HALLORAN
                         -- but that's the point, Ben. In the 
                         first six months of a baby's life, 
                         the father can't get to know it unless 
                         he takes care of it physically. The 
                         idea is to do things for the kid -- 
                         like bathing it.

                                     MILLER
                         But I'm scared to bathe mine. Looks 
                         like it'll break.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Then learn how to change it. Is it a 
                         bottle baby?

                                     MILLER
                              (boastfully)
                         Not mine, he's...

                                     MULVEY
                         Begging your pardon -- is this the 
                         Board of Directors of the Diaper 
                         Institute?

                                     HALLORAN
                              (rising)
                         Hi, Dan.

                                     MULVEY
                         We're on a case, you baby experts.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (eagerly)
                         What sort of a case? Something hot?

                                     MULVEY
                              (as they go)
                         Dead woman in a bathtub. Something 
                         cold.

               They go out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE ON WEST 69TH STREET - DAY

               The ambulance, seen earlier, and two police cars are parked 
               in front. A small crowd of people is gathered around the 
               entrance. A dark police sedan drives up. Mulvey, Halloran, 
               Miller step out.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

               CAMERA IS SHOOTING from POV of watching crowd.

                                     PATROLMAN
                              (to Mulvey, with a 
                              slight hand salute)
                         This way, Lieutenant.

               Mulvey, Halloran, and Miller pin their badges on their coat 
               lapels as they follow the patrolman.

               EXT. TO ONE SIDE OF ENTRANCE MIDDLE-AGED GENTLEMAN, 
               NURSEMAID, GIRL - DAY

               as they look after detectives. The middle-aged gentleman is 
               tall, thin, shabby, but with pretense to elegance. He carries 
               a walking stick, wears pince-nez spectacles. The nursemaid 
               is thirtyish, bovine, in uniform. The girl is five.

                                     MIDDLE-AGED GENTLEMAN
                              (to nursemaid)
                         Detectives! You see! I told you it 
                         was a murder. I knew!

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                              (pulling nursemaid's 
                              hand)
                         I wanna go to the park. I wanna see 
                         the seals.

                                     MIDDLE-AGED GENTLEMAN
                              (to nursemaid)
                         I have the finest crime library in 
                         the world... with pictures.

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                              (wailing)
                         I wanna see the seals.

                                     NURSEMAID
                              (angrily)
                         You saw the seals yesterday. This is 
                         a murder. It'll educate you.

               INT. IN FRONT OF JEAN DEXTER'S APARTMENT - DAY

               A patrolman at door gives a half salute, admits detectives.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Two plainclothes detectives are standing in the room. The 
               maid, Martha Swenson, is seated in an easy chair. She is 
               distraught and evidently has been crying. Near her is NED 
               HARVEY, the apartment superintendent, a thin, middle-aged 
               man, wearing work pants and a grey sweater. Throughout scene 
               Miller takes shorthand notes of what is said.

                                     MULVEY
                         Who's in charge here?

               One of the plainclothes detectives steps forward.

                                     DETECTIVE
                         Me, sir -- Detective Sergeant 
                         Shaeffer, 20th Precinct.

                                     MULVEY
                         What's the story?

                                     SHAEFFER
                              (consulting notebook)
                         The dead woman's name is Jean Dexter. 
                         Twenty-six years old, unmarried. She 
                         used to be a dress model at Madge 
                         Livingston's, on Fifth Avenue. Her 
                         parents live in Lakewood, New Jersey. 
                         Their name is Batory -- that's Polish. 
                         Her name used to be Mary Batory until 
                         she came to New York. The ambulance 
                         doctor says she died of drowning... 
                         that's all I have.

                                     MULVEY
                              (to Miller)
                         Got it?

               Miller nods, scribbling. Puffing on his pipe, Mulvey walks 
               over to an end table and squats down a little to look at a 
               framed photograph without touching it.

               INSERT BEAUTIFUL BLONDE GIRL IN EVENING DRESS

                                     MULVEY'S VOICE
                         This her?

                                     SHAEFFER'S VOICE
                         Yeah.

               INT. BACK TO SCENE - DAY

               Mulvey looks inquiringly at Martha Swenson.

                                     SHAEFFER
                         Martha Swenson, the woman's 
                         housekeeper. She found the body.
                              (indicating Harvey)
                         Mr. Harvey, the house superintendent. 
                         He called headquarters.

                                     MULVEY
                              (nodding)
                         Where's the body?

                                     SHAEFFER
                              (pointing)
                         In there.

               Mulvey starts toward bedroom followed by Halloran and Miller.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               On the bed is a body covered by a sheet. Standing by the bed 
               is a uniformed patrolman. A white-coated ambulance doctor is 
               filling out a paper form. The door to the bathroom is open, 
               with part of the tub visible.

               As Mulvey sees the body on the bed, he stops.

                                     MULVEY
                              (quiet... but angry)
                         Didn't this woman drown in a bathtub, 
                         doctor?

                                     DOCTOR
                         She was on the bed when I got here.

               Mulvey goes toward living room angrily.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               as Mulvey comes into doorway.

                                     MULVEY
                         Who moved the body?

                                     MARTHA
                              (rising; upset)
                         When I came in and... saw her like 
                         that in the tub... I called Mr. 
                         Harvey, here. He -- helped me.

                                     MULVEY
                              (sharply)
                         You should've waited for the police! 
                         Both of you should have known better.

                                     MARTHA
                              (wringing hands)
                         I was so upset...

                                     HALLORAN
                              (entering)
                         There's a bottle of pills under the 
                         bed, Dan. Looks like sleeping pills.

                                     MULVEY
                              (holding out hand)
                         Let me see 'em.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (startled)
                         I left 'em there.

                                     MULVEY
                         Why, thank you for that, Jimmy.
                              (looks at Martha and 
                              Harvey)
                         This is moving day around here. I 
                         thought maybe you caught the fever.

                                     HALLORAN
                         About those pills... maybe the dame 
                         took an overdose?

                                     MULVEY
                              (patiently)
                         Jimmy, it's our obligation to wait 
                         for the medical examiner. He's a 
                         learned physician employed by the 
                         city to determine the causes of 
                         mysterious deaths. Let the good man 
                         earn his money.

               Halloran grins with slight embarrassment.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BEDROOM GROUP (FAVORING DR. HOFFMAN) - DAY

               Standing by the bed is the medical examiner, whom we saw 
               earlier; Mulvey, Halloran are with him. Ben Miller is taking 
               notes in the background. Nick, whom we saw earlier in the 
               Technical Laboratory, is standing by with his spray equipment 
               for fingerprints.

                                     DR. HOFFMAN
                         No accident and no suicide. There 
                         are bruises on her throat, shoulders 
                         and arms. Those slight burns around 
                         her mouth and nose were caused by 
                         chloroform. She was chloroformed 
                         after a struggle, then dumped into 
                         the tub alive.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (eagerly)
                         How can you tell that, Doctor?

                                     HOFFMAN
                         By the white foam around her mouth. 
                         It's proof she drowned.
                              (to Mulvey; indicating 
                              Halloran)
                         New?

                                     MULVEY
                              (nodding)
                         New.

               INT. ANOTHER ANGLE THE GROUP - DAY

               A police photographer has set up his lighting equipment and 
               large 8-by-10 camera.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                              (to Mulvey)
                         Okay, Lieutenant?

                                     MULVEY
                              (to Hoffman)
                         Okay, Doctor?

                                     DR. HOFFMAN
                              (putting instruments 
                              away)
                         The body's yours.

                                     MULVEY
                         Start working, gentlemen.

               The room becomes very active. Halloran goes into bathroom. 
               Photographer begins taking flashlight pictures of room, bed, 
               etc. Nick begins to spray a glass on a night table with a 
               colored powder from an atomizer, seeking fingerprints.

               Mulvey writes a note, looks at bed, writes another note. 
               Halloran comes out of bathroom with a pair of men's silk 
               pajamas.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Dan... these were in the laundry 
                         hamper. No laundry marks and no label.

               Mulvey takes the pajamas, feels the material.

                                     MULVEY
                         Real fancy. You don't get these for 
                         three ninety-five.
                              (to Nick)
                         Pick up these pajamas on your way 
                         out, Nick. I want 'em under your X-
                         ray machine.

                                     NICK
                         Right.

               Mulvey, followed by Halloran and Miller, goes into living 
               room.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Martha Swenson and Harvey are seated on a couch as Mulvey, 
               Shaeffer, and Halloran enter the room. Patrolman stands at 
               door. Throughout this scene we get flashes of light from the 
               busy photographer in the bedroom.

                                     MULVEY
                         Who belongs to these?

                                     MARTHA
                         I -- I don't know, sir.
                              (wringing hands)
                         I'm so unstrung.

                                     MULVEY
                              (quietly)
                         I know you are. But I think you'd 
                         like to help us.

                                     MARTHA
                         I would -- I would. Such a sweet 
                         girl, she was. A little wild, by my 
                         standards maybe, but live and let 
                         live, I say. Always treated me swell.

                                     MULVEY
                         The pajamas, Martha.

                                     MARTHA
                         I'm all in pieces. I...

               Mulvey holds out the pajamas.

                                     MARTHA
                              (hesitantly)
                         They could belong to Mr. Henderson.
                              (wringing hands)
                         This is awful. I might be getting 
                         someone in trouble.

                                     MULVEY
                         We don't want to get the wrong person 
                         in trouble either... What's his first 
                         name?

                                     MARTHA
                              (in a rush)
                         Philip, I think. He lives in 
                         Baltimore. That's what she told me. 
                         I only saw him once or twice. I only 
                         know he was an admirer of Miss 
                         Dexter's.

                                     MULVEY
                              (fingering pajamas)
                         Seems likely.

                                     MARTHA
                         Oh, I'm all in little pieces. What a 
                         nightmare!

                                     MULVEY
                         You're being a big help to us, 
                         Martha... How old would you say Mr. 
                         Henderson is?

                                     MARTHA
                         Oh... fifty about.

                                     MULVEY
                         What does he look like?

                                     MARTHA
                         Oh -- he's real distinguished, real. 
                         About as tall as him.
                              (points to Halloran)
                         Got grey hair. And strong-looking 
                         for his age. No corporation on him, 
                         if you know what I mean.

                                     MULVEY
                         Uh-huh.
                              (to Miller)
                         Got it?
                              (Miller nods... to 
                              Harvey)
                         Do you know Henderson?

                                     HARVEY
                         Never saw him.

                                     MULVEY
                              (to Miller)
                         Shoot a wire on this to Baltimore.

               Miller nods. Hoffman comes into living room, carrying medical 
               case.

                                     HOFFMAN
                         Here's the ring she was wearing.
                              (Mulvey takes ring)
                         I'll phone you after the autopsy... 
                         Have fun.

                                     MULVEY
                              (looking at ring)
                         Likewise.

               Hoffman goes out.

                                     MARTHA
                              (eagerly)
                         Sir... that ring... it's a black 
                         star sapphire... very rare. She said 
                         her brother sent it from India.

                                     MULVEY
                         Did she have any other jewelry?

                                     MARTHA
                         Oh -- a lot. Valuable. She kept it 
                         in a jewel box, locked.

                                     MULVEY
                         Let's go get it.
                              (as Martha hesitates)
                         Please.

               Hesitantly Martha goes into bedroom, the others following. 
               At the moment of their entrance, Nick is spraying the surface 
               of the vanity table with iodine vapor. The photographer, 
               lying on his side, is making a photograph of the floor beneath 
               the bed.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                              (to Nick)
                         Okay... You can pick up that bottle 
                         under the bed now.

                                     NICK
                              (spraying)
                         Check.

                                     MULVEY
                         Nick -- can we open a drawer in that 
                         table?

                                     NICK
                         Yeah. I've gone over them.

                                     MARTHA
                              (horrified)
                         What are you doing to the furniture?

                                     NICK
                              (smiling)
                         Investigating it.

               During the ensuing scene, Nick puts down the atomizer, crawls 
               under bed and gets the bottle out by means of looping a string 
               over the neck of it.

                                     MULVEY
                         Come on, Martha.

               Martha opens a drawer. A startled look comes to her face. 
               She frantically pulls open the other drawer.

                                     MARTHA
                         She had bracelets and rings... diamond 
                         rings... They're all gone. It must 
                         have been thieves that killed her.

                                     MULVEY
                              (Softly, to Halloran)
                         Another detective.
                              (to Martha)
                         Could you describe the jewelry?

                                     MARTHA
                         Most of it, I think.

                                     MULVEY
                         Fine. Go in and rest yourself now.

               As Martha goes out, Nick stands up, holding the bottle of 
               pills by the looped string.

                                     NICK
                         Looks like Seconal.

                                     MULVEY
                              (Peering at it)
                         Jimmy -- I want to start questioning 
                         those two in there. You start your 
                         leg work. Get the number of this 
                         prescription, see the druggist. From 
                         him go to the doctor. Then go to the 
                         dress shop she worked at.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Right.

               He writes down druggist's name and prescription number. The 
               policeman comes to door of living room.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Lieutenant -- the newspaper men are 
                         here.

                                     MULVEY
                         Okay, I'm coming.
                              (to Nick)
                         Getting any fingerprints, Nick?

                                     NICK
                         Nothing good so far. Half prints, 
                         quarter prints -- that's all.

                                     MULVEY
                              (going toward living 
                              room... soberly -- 
                              to Halloran)
                         Looks to me like a heavy case -- a 
                         heavy case.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Halloran moves to one side to avoid a fat man with an English 
               bulldog on leash. An itinerant bootblack gestures toward his 
               shoes but he shakes his head. He pauses at the entrance to a 
               drugstore on the corner, checks the address against his memo 
               book, goes in.

                              (conversationally, 
                              heard above street 
                              noises)
                         An investigation for murder is under 
                         way now in the city of New York. It 
                         will advance methodically, by trial 
                         and error, by leg and brain work, by 
                         asking a thousand questions to get 
                         one answer. Ever look for a needle 
                         in a dark house? You can find it -- 
                         if you're patient enough. Just get 
                         down on your knees, examine every 
                         inch of every floor of every room -- 
                         and you'll find it. The Homicide 
                         Squad, my friends, is made up of 
                         patient men. Ever work a jigsaw 
                         puzzle? Ever try to find a murderer? 
                         Ever play button-button?

               INT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

               There is no one at the prescription counter. He rings a little 
               bell placed there for that purpose. The druggist appears, a 
               short, bald, stout man. Halloran shows him his badge in the 
               palm of his hand, speaks to him, reads from his memo book. 
               Druggist disappears for an instant, returns with his 
               prescription book, turns the pages until he finds the Dexter 
               prescription.

               DRUGGIST AND HALLORAN

                                     DRUGGIST
                         Dr. Lawrence Stoneman -- office in 
                         the Squibb Building.
                              (leans forward)
                         Confidentially -- a doctor in the 
                         dough -- high class.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (writing)
                         Do you happen to remember Miss Dexter?

                                     DRUGGIST
                              (shaking head)
                         A one-shot customer.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Not even by the fact you made up 
                         sleeping pills for her?

               Druggist laughs, leans forward.

                                     DRUGGIST
                         Confidentially, half the people in 
                         this city can't sleep without pills. 
                         Hurry up... hurry up... too much 
                         hurry up.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Thanks. You've been a help.

               As Halloran starts out of drugstore CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Ask a question, get an answer, write 
                         it down...

               INT. DEXTER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Patrolman at door. Martha Swenson on couch. Mulvey, puffing 
               his pipe, has memo book in hand. Mulvey has his coat off.

                                     MULVEY
                         Did she have any other men friends?

                                     MARTHA
                         None I know of, sir. Just this Niles 
                         man. Robert Niles -- a lovely man.

               Mulvey scribbles in memo book, rubs his nose thoughtfully, 
               rises, crosses living room to bedroom door, opens it.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               The bedroom lights have been switched off. Nick is operating 
               a portable ultra-violet lamp. It casts a beam of intense 
               violet light. He is using it like a searchlight to explore 
               every inch of the walls. The bedroom has been transformed 
               since we last saw it -- ripped apart. The bed has been taken 
               down, wallpaper stained in various spots, lamps taken apart, 
               etc.

                                     MULVEY
                              (softly)
                         How are you doing, Nick?

                                     NICK
                              (softly)
                         Not too bad. Found two grey hairs on 
                         the rug.

                                     MULVEY
                         Grey, eh?... How about fingerprints?

                                     NICK
                         No good ones yet.

               Mulvey closes door, crosses to Martha, looks closely at her 
               hair. Martha draws back in alarm.

                                     MULVEY
                              (smiling)
                         Don't you mind me. Just admirin' 
                         your hair.

               Martha smiles a little, flattered.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. A STREET - DAY

               Halloran is wiping his sweaty face as he walks. He stops, 
               looks up.

                                     NARRATOR
                              (leisurely)
                         Ask a question and take a walk. Hop 
                         a bus and ask a question. Jimmy 
                         Halloran's an expert with his feet. 
                         He pounded a beat in the Bronx for a 
                         year as a cop... during the war he 
                         walked halfway across Europe with a 
                         rifle in his hand. Ever play button-
                         button in a city of eight million 
                         people --

               EXT. SQUIBB BUILDING - DAY

               stretching to sky.

               EXT. AT THE ENTRANCE - DAY

               Halloran is entering building.

               INT. DR. STONEMAN'S RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

               A medium-sized room, tastefully furnished. Two patients 
               waiting, both women in their middle years, well dressed. An 
               elderly nurse at desk. Nurse looks up as Halloran enters. He 
               approaches desk, speaks quietly.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Is Dr. Stoneman in?

                                     NURSE
                              (dubiously)
                         Do you have an appointment?

                                     HALLORAN
                         I'm from the Police Department. It's 
                         quite important.
                              (shows his badge)

                                     NURSE
                         Just a moment.

               She goes out of room. Halloran walks to a large window that 
               looks out over the city.

               INT. THE CITY FROM HALLORAN'S POV - DAY

                                     NARRATOR
                         There's the layout, Jim. The man who 
                         killed Jean Dexter is somewhere down 
                         there. Can't blame him for hiding, 
                         can you?

                                     NURSE'S VOICE
                         Dr. Stoneman'll see you.

               INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

               Halloran follows nurse through door into a corridor, then 
               into an office.

               INT. STONEMAN'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY

               Dr. Stoneman, in a white gown, is just coming through another 
               door from an examination room. He is a handsome, keen-looking 
               man of fifty, with iron-grey hair. We saw him playing bridge 
               at 1:00 A.M.

                                     DR. STONEMAN
                         Yes sir. What can I do for you? Have 
                         a seat.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (sitting)
                         I want to ask you about a patient of 
                         yours -- Jean Dexter.

               Stoneman, who has been walking around to his swivel chair, 
               pauses, turns.

                                     DR. STONEMAN
                         Dexter? Are you sure she's my patient?

                                     HALLORAN
                         You wrote a prescription for her two 
                         weeks ago -- Seconal.

               Stoneman thinks, then nods.

                                     STONEMAN
                         Yes, a blonde girl. Very handsome, I 
                         remember now... Dexter.
                              (sits; starts going 
                              through card file)
                         What department are you from, Officer?

                                     HALLORAN
                         Homicide.

                                     STONEMAN
                              (stiffening)
                         Oh? Don't tell me that girl murdered 
                         someone?

                                     HALLORAN
                         Someone murdered her.

                                     STONEMAN
                         What?
                              (a pause -- very 
                              distressed)
                         My goodness... when...

                                     HALLORAN
                         Last night sometime.

               A pause. Stoneman shakes his head. Pulls card out of file.

                                     STONEMAN
                         What do you want to know?

                                     HALLORAN
                         Whatever you can tell me about her.

                                     STONEMAN
                              (angrily)
                         She needed a good spanking. Took 
                         Benzedrine by day, needed sleeping 
                         pills at night. I told her to slow 
                         up -- but no. Life was too short for 
                         her.
                              (shakes head again)
                         Burned out now. All her fresh, young 
                         beauty on a scrap heap. Excuse me, 
                         Officer, but I'm a doctor because 
                         I'm interested in people. I hate to 
                         see human beings waste themselves.
                              (shrugs, falls silent)

                                     HALLORAN
                         Can you tell me anything else about 
                         her? Her life -- her friends?

                                     STONEMAN
                         No. Nothing. I only saw her that one 
                         visit.

                                     HALLORAN
                         I guess that's all, Doctor. Thank 
                         you.
                              (stands)

               Stoneman nods and tosses the card on the desk. Halloran 
               leaves.

               EXT. MADGE LIVINGSTON'S DRESS SHOP ON FIFTH AVENUE - DAY

               This is the same shop we saw in the early morning. Two young, 
               shabbily dressed girls are staring at a glittering evening 
               dress on dummy in window.

                                     FIRST GIRL
                         Imagine me in that!

                                     SECOND GIRL
                         I can't imagine.

                                     FIRST GIRL
                         In the Sert Room of the Waldorf 
                         Astoria. With Frankie singing.

                                     SECOND GIRL
                         I can't imagine.

                                     FIRST GIRL
                         Gosh, I'd commit murder for a dress 
                         like that. It's a pome by Shakespeare, 
                         that's what it is. Lookit that feller. 
                         What do you suppose he's buying?

               HALLORAN FROM POV OF THE GIRLS - DAY

               He is talking to a woman.

                                     SECOND GIRL'S VOICE
                         I can't imagine.

                                     FIRST GIRL'S VOICE
                         Oh, you -- you're so uncooperative I 
                         could slam you.

               INT. MADGE LIVINGSTON'S DRESS SHOP - DAY

               Mrs. Livingston is handsome, middle-aged, well tailored, 
               with a fancy way of speaking.

                                     MRS. LIVINGSTON
                              (seriously)
                         ...and somewhere in the back of her 
                         pretty head there was a fixed notion 
                         that she couldn't be happy without 
                         being rich. I don't think Jean ever 
                         would have married unless the man 
                         had money -- real money.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Why did you fire her?

                                     MRS. LIVINGSTON
                              (shrugs)
                         Gentlemen sometimes come here with 
                         their wives. When Jean Dexter modeled, 
                         many of them left my shop a little 
                         too interested in her. Their wives 
                         didn't like it -- and neither did I.

                                     HALLORAN
                         I see. Can I talk to her friend now -- 
                         the model you spoke about?

                                     MRS. LIVINGSTON
                              (rising)
                         Ruth Young? Yes. I'll call her.

               She leaves.

               Madge Livingston and Ruth Young approaching him.

               Ruth Young is a lovely girl in her early twenties. She is 
               wearing a striking evening gown. As the two girls talk, we 
               see Mrs. Livingston introduce Halloran and Ruth and leave 
               them.

                                     FIRST GIRL
                         Oh, I can't bear it. Oh, I'm going. 
                         What a dress. It's a pome.

                                     SECOND GIRL
                         A pome. By you everything's a pome.

                              (leaving)
                         Oh, Millie -- you got no imagination.

               She leaves. Other follows, looking offended.

               INT. DRESS SHOP - DAY

               Ruth has a quiet, attractive manner, good speech.

                         Miss Young -- I understand you modeled 
                         with Jean Dexter?

                                     RUTH
                              (nodding)
                         We're friends, too.
                              (hesitates)
                         Is she in trouble, Mr. Halloran?

                                     HALLORAN
                         Well... She is kind of wild, isn't 
                         she?

                                     RUTH
                         Oh, no... Maybe Mrs. Livingston would 
                         call her wild, but I wouldn't. She's 
                         full of fun... wonderful company.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Do you know anybody who has cause to 
                         dislike her?

                                     RUTH
                         No...

                                     HALLORAN
                         How about Mrs. Henderson?

                                     RUTH
                         Who's she?

                                     HALLORAN
                         Well, Miss Dexter and Mr. Henderson 
                         are very friendly, aren't they?

                                     RUTH
                         She never told me about a man named 
                         Henderson.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (disappointed)
                         Are you sure?

                                     RUTH
                         Really, Mr. Halloran -- Jean's my 
                         friend -- I don't think I want to 
                         answer any more questions unless you 
                         tell me why you're asking them.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (watching her)
                         She was found dead this morning.

               Ruth gasps. Her face goes white. She looks as though she 
               will collapse. Halloran grabs her arm, pulls a chair up.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (gently)
                         Sit down... Rest a moment.
                              (Ruth obeys)
                         I'm sorry.

               Halloran walks over to a water cooler for a glass of water.

               EXT. 10TH PRECINCT STATION HOUSE - DAY

               An elderly fireman has opened a hydrant on this hot summer 
               day for the neighborhood kids. A half dozen kids in bathing 
               suits, trunks and underwear shorts are reveling in the water. 
               A boy of ten, lying on the street, puts his face in the water, 
               blows bubbles.

                                     BOY
                         I'm a whale. Lookit...
                              (blows bubbles)
                         Lookit me... I'm a whale.

               A tough little girl of twelve sneaks up behind him, pushes 
               his head under water, runs off. During this, two men have 
               come along street -- Niles and Perelli. Boy gets up, gasping.

                                     BOY
                         I'll moider you. I'll cut your head 
                         off.

                                     FIREMAN
                              (reprovingly)
                         Such language.

               One of the two men -- Robert Niles -- laughs.

               CAMERA HOLDS on two men going up station steps.

               INT. MULVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               A smaller office than Donahue's. Simply furnished. On Mulvey's 
               desk there is a photograph of a pleasant-looking woman in 
               her late twenties, with two little girls. They are dressed 
               in the fashion of 1920. Mulvey is at his desk, Miller in a 
               chair. Miller is reading from notebook.

                                     MILLER
                         The janitor's story of his whereabouts 
                         last night is being checked. Ditto 
                         the maid. No report yet on 
                         fingerprints. Constentino is on his 
                         way to Lakewood to see the girl's 
                         parents.

               Door opens. One of the two men we saw on the street a moment 
               earlier comes in. He is Detective Perelli, forty, husky, 
               hard-faced.

                              pipe)

               NILES enters, a man in his early thirties. He is tall, 
               unusually handsome, with a straightforward, attractive quality 
               about him. He wears a Service Discharge emblem. Perelli shuts 
               door, sits down in corner.

                                     MULVEY

                         So Henderson's our only suspect...

                                     MULVEY
                         How about this man?

               Mulvey crosses to the blackboard, picks up chalk. Underneath 
               Henderson's name he writes:

               JOSEPH P. MCGILLICUDDY

                                     HALLORAN
                         Who's he?

                                     DONAHUE
                              (smiling)
                         McGillicuddy is Dan's name for any 
                         unknown party in a case.

                                     HALLORAN
                         You mean two men did the murder?

                                     MULVEY
                         Maybe there were five. All I know is 
                         there was more than one.

                                     HALLORAN
                         How do you know?

               Mulvey looks around the room, then sits on his desk. He pats 
               it.

                                     MULVEY
                         This is a bed... For a moment, I'm 
                         an attractive little lady.
                              (smiles to Halloran)
                         How would you chloroform me, Mr. 
                         Henderson?

               Halloran studies the question, takes a handkerchief out of 
               his pocket.

                                     HALLORAN
                         I guess the best way'd be if I stood 
                         behind you.

               He goes behind Mulvey and gestures how he would lock his 
               forearm over Mulvey's throat, and use the other hand to apply 
               the chloroform.

                                     MULVEY
                         Correct -- that's the way one man 
                         would do it.

               He jumps down, opens drawer, brings out a pile of 8 by 10 
               photos, shuffles them, selects one. Meanwhile, he keeps 
               talking.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing)
                         We just got the photographs. They 
                         show finger marks on both arms.

               He tosses a photo on desk. All crowd around it.

               INSERT PHOTO

               It shows chin, neck, shoulders only. Visible are some blue 
               marks.

                                     MULVEY'S VOICE
                              (over close shot)
                         That means a man stood behind her 
                         and held her arms with both hands, 
                         while Henderson or someone else 
                         chloroformed her. A strong man, with 
                         thick, strong fingers.

               INT. BACK TO SCENE - DAY

               All look up from photo, gaze at Mulvey with excitement.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing)
                         And that man was my old, old friend, 
                         Joseph P. McGillicuddy.

               A pause.

                                     DONAHUE
                         You're right, Dan.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Now we have to find two men.

                                     DONAHUE
                         You have to find them. I'm busy on 
                         half a dozen other cases. Good night, 
                         gentlemen.

                                     ALL
                         Good night.

               Donahue leaves.

                                     MILLER
                         Need me any more?

               Mulvey waves him good night. Miller goes. Mulvey looks at 
               blackboard.

                                     MULVEY
                         A heavy case...
                              (thinks)
                         Why is Niles such a liar?
                              (pause)
                         What's in his heart? Is he just a 
                         blowhard or...?
                              (pause)
                         A heavy case...

               The door opens, Miller appears, wearing hat.

                                     MILLER
                              (excitedly)
                         Say... there's an old dame outside 
                         says she can crack the Dexter case.

               Mulvey gestures for her to be brought in. Miller steps out, 
               ushers in a sweet-faced old lady of sixty-five. She is dressed 
               in an old-fashioned manner and, in spite of the heat, wears 
               a feather boa around her neck. She has a folded newspaper 
               under her arm. She speaks with a Southern accent.

                                     OLD LADY
                         Are you the officer in charge of the 
                         bathtub murder?

                                     MULVEY
                         Yes, M'am.

                                     OLD LADY
                              (approaching)
                         This one?

               She spreads the newspaper on the desk.

                         My gran'daddy is Sheriff of Tuckahue

                         Your gran'daddy?

               Mulvey puts his hand out and touches Halloran warningly.

                                     OLD LADY
                              (explaining)

                              (gently)
                         And very handsome you are, too.

                         about me, I don't know what to do.

                         Oh yes -- about the murder. I almost 
                         forgot. We'll have to get a front 
                         tooth from a hound dog.

                                     MULVEY
                         Yes, M'am.

                              stops)
                         Prices are awfully high these days, 
                         aren't they?

                         Yes, M'am.

                                     OLD LADY
                         I had to decide whether to spend a 
                         nickel on an apple for my supper --
                         or spend it on the subway to come up 
                         here.

               Mulvey fishes in his pocket, comes up with a dime, gives it 
               to her.

                                     MULVEY
                         Please.

                                     OLD LADY
                         You're sweet. I'll put you down in 
                         my diary tonight. 'Bye now.

                         'Bye.

               The old lady leaves. Miller gives them a look, also leaves. 
               Mulvey and Halloran look at each other.

                                     HALLORAN
                         How much of that have you had in 
                         thirty-eight years?

                                     MULVEY
                         I couldn't count it. Every time 
                         there's a headline case. We'll be 
                         lucky if there isn't a lot more.

                                     HALLORAN
                         'Bye now.

                         'Bye.

               Halloran leaves. Mulvey turns to blackboard, looks at names. 
               He erases all the names except those of Henderson, Niles, 
               McGillicuddy. He stares at them.

               he observes newsboy with back turned. He walks off quickly 
               without paying, a pleased smirk on his face.

               EXT. HALLORAN'S HOME - DAY

               as he opens door of his two-family home and enters.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (calling)
                         Anybody home?

               He throws his hat and newspaper on the couch and starts taking 
               off coat. The room is combination living-room, dining-room 
               with standard Grand Rapids furniture. The small table is set 
               for dinner. In answer to his call, a voice comes from the 
               kitchen.

                                     JANEY'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hello, honey.

               She appears at kitchen door and comes toward him. She has on 
               a playsuit with bare mid-riff and an apron. She is pretty in 
               a quiet way, has a straightforward manner. Halloran pulls 
               off tie and starts unbuttoning shirt.

                                     JANEY
                              (continuing)
                         Bet it was hot in Manhattan today.

                                     HALLORAN
                         I was too busy to be hot. On a new 
                         case.
                              (as he takes off shirt)
                         The subway was a furnace, though.

                                     JANEY
                         You too warm to say hello?

                                     HALLORAN
                         Yup.

               He puts his arms around her, kisses her.

                                     JANEY
                         Got you a nice, cool supper. Jellied 
                         tongue.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (holding her)
                         Swell. I'm hungry. Stop holding on 
                         to me. Let's go, I'm starved.

               She laughs. He kisses her, lets her go.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (continuing)
                         Where's Billy?

                                     JANEY
                         I put him to bed. Listen, dear, I'm 
                         sorry to tell you but you've got a 
                         nasty job to do before supper.

               Halloran takes off the hip belt on which his gun holster 
               hangs and puts it up on the closet shelf. Janey continues 
               meanwhile.

                                     JANEY
                              (continuing)
                         Billy has to have a whipping.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Why?

                                     JANEY
                         He walked right out of the yard, 
                         crossed Stillman Avenue all by himself 
                         and went to the park.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Well... I'll give him a real talking 
                         to.

                                     JANEY
                         No you won't, you'll give him a real 
                         whipping, with a strap.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Just a minute, honey...

                                     JANEY
                              (interrupting)
                         I know -- I know -- you don't believe 
                         in whipping a child. Neither have I 
                         until now. But do you want Billy run 
                         over by a truck?

               Halloran is silent.

                                     JANEY
                              (continuing)
                         I've reasoned with him, I've pleaded 
                         with him, I've threatened him. But 
                         the minute my back is turned, he's 
                         off.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Well... he's a spunky kid, Janey.

                                     JANEY
                         I don't want him to be a dead kid.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (yielding)
                         No...

                                     JANEY
                         Go ahead then. Get it over with.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Yeah, I guess I will... right after 
                         supper.

                                     JANEY
                         Jimmy --
                              (points)

                                     HALLORAN
                         I can't just go in there and take a 
                         strap to that boy. I've got to work 
                         up to it a little bit.

                                     JANEY
                         You'd think I was asking you to kill 
                         him.

               Phone RINGS.

                                     HALLORAN
                         If you think it's so easy, you whip 
                         him.
                              (goes to phone)

                                     JANEY
                         Me? That's not a woman's job.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (at phone)
                         Why does it have to be a man's job?

                                     JANEY
                         It's always the man's job.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (raising phone)
                         Who says so? ...Hello.
                              (listens)
                         Oh... sure, Dan... yeah, right away.

               He hangs up, crosses to closet for gun.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Got a call. I have to meet Mulvey 
                         right away.

                                     JANEY
                         Without any supper?

                                     HALLORAN
                         Save it for me... I'll grab a 
                         hamburger meanwhile.

                                     JANEY
                         I wish you were an ice cream salesman 
                         or something. I don't like this night 
                         work and I don't like it every time 
                         you strap on that gun.

               Halloran is now putting on his shirt and tie. Janey takes 
               off her apron.

                                     HALLORAN
                         If I were an ice cream salesman, I'd 
                         get fat. Then you wouldn't like me.

                                     JANEY
                         I don't like you now.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (singing it)
                         Oh, yes you do.

                                     JANEY
                         Remember -- you've got a job before 
                         you leave this house.

                                     HALLORAN
                         What?

                                     JANEY
                         Billy.

                                     HALLORAN
                         I can't stop for that now.

                                     JANEY
                              (jumping up)
                         Halloran -- you're a coward.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (kissing her)
                         'Bye now.

               He grabs coat and starts off.

                                     JANEY
                         Jimmy.

               He stops. She goes up and catches his arm, kisses him.

                                     JANEY
                              (continuing)
                         I'll wait up for you.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Good deal.

               He runs his finger across her bare midriff. She wiggles a 
               little.

                                     JANEY
                         Where you going?

                                     HALLORAN
                         To see a pretty girl.

               He runs his finger across her midriff again. She wiggles.

                                     JANEY
                         Some place exciting, huh?

                                     HALLORAN
                         Yes, dear. To the morgue.

               He pokes her with his finger, starts out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BUILDING MARKED: CITY MORTUARY - NIGHT

               as Detective Constentino approaches with a plainly dressed, 
               middle-aged couple, the Batorys. The man and woman stare at 
               the sign for a moment and then follow Constentino inside.

               INT. ANTEROOM OF MORTUARY - NIGHT

               MULVEY, HALLORAN AND UNIFORMED NURSE

               are seated, but rise when Constentino enters with the man 
               and woman. Constentino is forty-five, husky, dark, competent 
               appearing. Mr. Batory is fifty, thin, looking both strong 
               and work-worn, with a neat little grey moustache and a bald 
               head. Mrs. Batory is the same age, stocky, with a face and 
               figure that show signs of an earlier peasant beauty. Mr. 
               Batory looks stunned, grief-stricken, shocked beyond 
               understanding. Mrs. Batory seems at the point of hysteria, 
               her eyes red, her hands plucking at her dress, her hair, her 
               face.

                                     CONSTENTINO
                         This is Lieutenant Mulvey.
                              (to Mulvey)
                         Mr. and Mrs. Batory, the girl's 
                         parents.

               Before Mulvey can say anything, Mrs. Batory bursts out in an 
               angry, injured, bitter tone.

                                     MRS. BATORY
                         I told her! I knew she'd turn out no 
                         good. All these young girls... so 
                         crazy to be with the bright lights. 
                         There's no bright lights for her 
                         now, is there?
                              (she stops, plucks at 
                              her dress)

                                     MULVEY
                              (gently)
                         She's at rest now, Mrs. Batory.

                                     MRS. BATORY
                              (bitterly)
                         No -- her kind of dead don't rest! 
                         And how 'bout us? The scandal -- God 
                         in Heaven! My husband's a gardener. 
                         He works for a banker, a highly 
                         respectable gentleman. He'll get 
                         fired now. Oh, I hate her, I hate 
                         her.

                                     MR. BATORY
                              (miserably)
                         Paula...

                                     MRS. BATORY
                         Never mind... I hate her. I say it 
                         out straight. So fancy she was. Even 
                         had to change her name. Hah!

                                     MULVEY
                              (uncomfortably)
                         We'd better go in now. If you'll 
                         please follow the nurse.

               FOLLOW SHOT

               as nurse leads the way down a short hallway and into a room. 
               The group follows. CAMERA is CLOSE on MRS. BATORY, who keeps 
               muttering as she walks.

                                     MRS. BATORY
                         I do hate her, I do. I warned her. A 
                         million times I warned her.

               INT. MORTUARY - NIGHT

               as group enters room. In the center is a table on which lies 
               a covered body, the face out of CAMERA range. The Batorys 
               stop dead. Mrs. Batory continues to mutter.

                                     MRS. BATORY
                         I hate her. I hate her for what she 
                         done to us.

               Mulvey gestures to nurse. She walks toward body to raise 
               sheet from face.

                                     MULVEY
                              (to Batorys)
                         Please tell me if she's your daughter.

               CLOSE SHOT BATORYS

               Mrs. Batory falls silent. An instant later we see by the 
               reaction on both their faces that the face of the dead girl 
               has been exposed. Mr. Batory seems to shrink back, become 
               smaller. Mrs. Batory's lips quiver.

                                     MR. BATORY
                              (dully)
                         That's her...

               Mrs. Batory stands with trembling lips. Her hand plucks at 
               her dress, her face. A sudden, hysterical scream bursts from 
               her lips.

                                     MRS. BATORY
                         My baby! Oh, my baby!

               She runs forward.

               INT. AT THE TABLE - NIGHT

               Mrs. Batory throws herself on foot of table, sobbing brokenly. 
               The nurse is replacing the sheet.

               EXT. DEAD END STREET OVERLOOKING RIVER - NIGHT

               as Mr. and Mrs. Batory come up to bench. She sits down, he 
               sits beside her. Behind them are Mulvey and Halloran. Mulvey 
               pauses near them, begins stuffing a pipe. Halloran leans 
               against a lamppost, smokes a cigarette. A police sedan, with 
               Constentino and a driver, pauses a bit down the street.

                                     MRS. BATORY
                              (low-voiced)
                         I feel better now. The walk was good 
                         for me.

                                     MULVEY
                         Are you sure you want to go home 
                         tonight? We can get you a hotel room.

               Batory looks at his wife, then shakes his head.

                                     MR. BATORY
                         We'll go home. We don't like this 
                         place...
                              (bitterly)
                         ...this fine city.

                                     MRS. BATORY
                              (diffidently -- to 
                              Mulvey)
                         You don't know... who done it, huh?

                                     MULVEY
                         Not yet.

               He fishes in his pocket, brings out the black star sapphire 
               ring that was on Jean Dexter's hand. He steps closer to them, 
               shows it.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing)
                         Did you ever see this?

               The Batorys look at it, shake their heads.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing)
                         Your daughter told someone it came 
                         from her brother, in India.

                                     MR. BATORY
                              (confused)
                         We only had her -- no other kids -- 
                         no boy.

               Mulvey looks at Halloran, puts ring in pocket.

                                     MULVEY
                         I see... And did your daughter ever 
                         mention a man named Henderson?

                                     MRS. BATORY
                              (bitterly)
                         We don't know any Henderson. We 
                         haven't seen Mary even for six months. 
                         She was too busy to come see us. Who 
                         knows what she ran around with?

                                     MR. BATORY
                              (to his wife)
                         She's dead, momma, don't...
                              (to Mulvey, 
                              passionately)
                         A good girl, I swear it! It's my 
                         fault maybe I didn't do better for 
                         her. When she was fifteen she was 
                         working already, the five and ten 
                         cent store. Oh it was hard, depression 
                         time, hard.

                                     MRS. BATORY
                              (to her husband)
                         So what? She's the only one didn't 
                         have it easy? Other people had it 
                         worse! Was that a reason to leave 
                         home -- to change your name?
                              (to Mulvey)
                         Wanting too much, that's why she 
                         went wrong. Bright lights and theaters 
                         and furs and night clubs. That's why 
                         she's dead now. Dear God, why wasn't 
                         she born ugly?
                              (begins to weep quietly)
                         What a heartache! You nurse a child, 
                         raise it, pet it, love it... and it 
                         ends like this.

                                     MULVEY
                         I've had my own children, Mrs. Batory. 
                         They turned out all right, thank 
                         goodness, but who's to know why or 
                         how? I've seen a lot of human misery 
                         in my work. I don't know where people 
                         start to go wrong.

                                     MRS. BATORY
                              (defensively)
                         We did our best. It wasn't our fault.

                                     MULVEY
                         Of course it wasn't. And maybe not 
                         even hers. When you think it over, I 
                         guess it was everybody's fault. People 
                         get so pounded and pounded in this 
                         life.
                              (shakes his head -- 
                              softly)
                         It's a jungle, a city like this. 
                         Eight million people struggling for 
                         life, for food, for air, for a bit 
                         of happiness. Seems like there ain't 
                         enough of everything to go around... 
                         and so sometimes it breaks out in... 
                         violence.

               A boat whistle blows mournfully from the river. Mulvey looks 
               out over the water.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing in a murmur)
                         ...an' we call it homicide...

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                         This time yesterday, Jean Dexter was 
                         just another name in the phone book...

               INT. A CAFETERIA - DAY A MAN

               INT. APARTMENT DOOR - DAY

               In front of door is a folded newspaper, and a bottle of coffee 
               cream standing on a piece of note paper. The door opens. We 
               hear a voice, half humming, half singing. Mulvey appears, in 
               trousers, slippers, no shirt, suspenders hanging. He picks 
               up newspaper, bottle, note.

                                     MULVEY

               INT. MULVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Still humming, he carries things back to table. He opens 
               note.

               INSERT: NOTE:

               Dear Mr. Mulvey:

               Sorry the cream was sour yesterday. About this new case you're 
               on -- I figure it's the janitor -- a sex crime. Do you want 
               any buttermilk?

               Your Milkman.

               INT. MULVEY - DAY

               He hums, grins, pours cream in coffee.

                         So I says to that detective: 
                         'Confidentially,' I says, 'that Dexter 
                         girl used to come in here night after 
                         night and pour her heart out to me -- 
                         ask my advice.' That'll be twenty-
                         five cents, please. And I told her 
                         'marry and settle down, have a couple 
                         kids,' I said! But it's too late 
                         now.
                              (leans forward)

                         This Dexter murder case! It says she

               EXT. JEAN DEXTER'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY

               A small crowd of people is gawking in front. A policeman 
               stands at door. A vendor with a peanut, ice-cream and hotdog 
               stand is at the curb, doing business.

               RANDOM VOICES ARE HEARD:

                                     FIRST MAN'S VOICE
                         Hey, Mac -- what's doin', why all 
                         the people here?

                                     SECOND MAN'S VOICE
                              (genially)
                         What's doin? Whatsamatter, you live 
                         in Canarsie or somethin'? This is 
                         the dump where that model was killed.

                                     FIRST MAN'S VOICE
                         You don't mean it! The bathtub girl, 
                         eh? So why didn't she take showers?

               Both men laugh.

               INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

                                     THE MAYOR
                              (to reporters)
                         That's all for this morning, 
                         gentlemen. Any questions?

                                     A REPORTER
                         Since Commissioner Wallander's here, 
                         do you have any statement on the 
                         Jean Dexter case?

                                     THE MAYOR
                         I don't. Do you, Commissioner?

                                     COMMISSIONER WALLANDER
                              (genially)
                         A case is a case. If it happens to 
                         lend itself to sensationalism, that's 
                         your good luck. But to the Homicide 
                         Squad, it's just another job.

                                     THE MAYOR
                         I'll tell you this: As Mayor of New 
                         York I expect criticism -- not only 
                         of me but of the Police Department. 
                         But as an ex-cop, I know a tough 
                         case when I see one. Not many murders 
                         go unsolved -- but it takes more 
                         than twenty-four hours to handle a 
                         case like this.

                                     COMMISSIONER WALLANDER
                              (to Mayor)
                         For that -- thanks.

                                     THE MAYOR
                         Don't mention it.

               EXT. MADISON AVE. - DAY

               Niles, wearing the phony ruptured duck in the lapel of a 
               Panama suit, comes down the street, enters a jewelry store.

                                     NARRATOR
                         The sun isn't too hot as yet. And 
                         it's pleasant to walk along Madison 
                         Ave...

               EXT. TWO MEN ON MADISON AVE. - DAY

               CAMERA IS SHOOTING ACROSS AND DOWN THE STREET

               The two men are looking toward CAMERA. They step into a 
               doorway.

                                     NARRATOR
                         ...there are shady doorways to rest 
                         in... for patient men who are not in 
                         a hurry.

               EXT. EAST SIDE ST. - DAY

               A hurdy gurdy player.

               SOUND: He is grinding out "After the Ball is Over."

                                     NARRATOR
                         It's pleasant on an early summer 
                         morning to listen to an old song...

               A coin bounces down on side-walk, rolls. A passerby picks it 
               up, gives it to hurdy gurdy man -- walks off. The passerby 
               is Garza.

                                     NARRATOR
                         ...it whiles away the time.

               EXT. AN EAST SIDE PIER - DAY

               where several adolescent boys are stripping off their clothes 
               for a swim. They wear tights underneath. The first boy, 
               undressed, steps up to the edge of the pier, ready to dive. 
               Suddenly he yells out and points.

                                     NARRATOR
                         ...So pleasant to dive into the East 
                         River even though sometimes the water 
                         is littered with a city's trash: a 
                         half-eaten apple... a chip of wood... 
                         a lady's hat...

                                     BOY
                         Look! Hey, look!

               The other boys run up, look down into water.

                                     NARRATOR
                              (softly)
                         ...a chip of wood... a lady's hat...

               Perelli. He goes toward door marked 'Lieutenant Mulvey', 
               enters.

               INT. MULVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               Mulvey, at desk, Constentino, Halloran. Mulvey is talking.

                                     MULVEY
                         This is Dexter's address book. Contact 
                         every name listed in it. Keep asking 
                         if they heard her talk about 
                         Henderson.

               Constentino nods, takes the address book, leaves. Mulvey 
               nods to Perelli.

                                     MULVEY
                              (to Halloran)
                         Start in on this ring of Dexter's.
                              (takes out black star 
                              sapphire)
                         Canvass every expensive jewelry shop 
                         in the city... maybe Henderson bought 
                         it for her.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (grinning)
                         Oh, my poor feet.

                                     MULVEY
                              (smiling)
                         Be glad you're not a horseback cop.

               Halloran leaves.

                                     MULVEY
                              (to Perelli)
                         What's with you?

                                     PERELLI
                              (takes a man's diamond-
                              studded cigarette 
                              case out of his pocket)
                         Niles sold this about an hour ago to 
                         a jeweler on Madison Avenue. Got six 
                         hundred dollars for it.

                                     MULVEY
                              (excited)
                         Well! Where's the list of stuff that 
                         was stolen from Dexter?

               He opens a desk drawer, pulls out a typewritten sheet of 
               paper. He examines cigarette case, looks down list.

                                     MULVEY
                              (disappointed)
                         It isn't on here. It's a man's item 
                         anyway.

               Perelli grimaces in disappointment.

                                     MULVEY
                              (slowly)
                         That's an interesting man, that Niles. 
                         He operates very strange.

                                     PERELLI
                         Say -- how about I check this 
                         cigarette case with the Department 
                         list of all jewelry stolen in the 
                         last year or so?

                                     MULVEY
                         All right... I don't think you'll 
                         get anything, though. He'd be crazy 
                         to pawn a stolen item in the middle 
                         of a hot case like this.

                                     PERELLI
                         Maybe he is crazy.
                              (rises)

                                     MULVEY
                         Not that one.

               Perelli leaves.

               Mulvey sits thinking, stuffs a pipe.

                                     NARRATOR

               EXT. A BEAUTY SHOP ON LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

               Constentino stops outside, checks number.

                                     NARRATOR
                         Relax, Constentino, your wife does 
                         this, too.

               He steps inside and blinks a little at the spectacle of eight 
               women in a row sitting under dryers. All of the women, 
               naturally, turn as one to stare at him. An operator walks up 
               to him. They talk for a moment. The operator shakes her head 
               several times. Constentino leaves.

                                     NARRATOR
                         ...How about a permanent, bud? How 
                         about a mud-pack for your complexion? 
                         Ever have your eyebrows plucked? 
                         What? Don't you even get your nails 
                         manicured? Hey, Constentino, wait! 
                         You could get to like it here.

                         No, I never saw this ring. It's an 
                         odd one. Hard to forget.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Thanks. You've been a help.

               Halloran emerges, looks at list of stores on paper. He starts 
               off.

                         How are the feet, Halloran? Would 
                         you care for some arch supporters? 
                         Would you be interested in knowing 
                         that there was a confession in this 
                         case only ten minutes ago?

                         What's your hurry, Mulvey? You're 
                         supposed to be a patient man. Why 
                         get so excited?

                         Hey, Constentino -- why don't you 
                         throw that address book away? This 
                         case is all washed up -- it's finished -- 
                         got a confession --

               INT. LIVING ROOM OF DEXTER'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Sitting down, head in his hands, is BISBEE, a tall, gaunt 
               young man who speaks in a reedy voice. A policeman is opening 
               the door. Mulvey and Miller burst in.

                                     POLICEMAN
                              (excitedly)
                         Here he is, Lieutenant. I caught him 
                         trying to get in the kitchen by the 
                         back door. He's a grocery boy in the 
                         neighborhood.

               Bisbee jumps up.

                                     BISBEE
                         Yes, I did it -- I killed her. I 
                         want to be punished. I'm guilty. My 
                         hands are stained with her blood.

                                     MULVEY
                         Why did you kill her?

                                     BISBEE
                         She deserved it. For months I've 
                         been watching her. I'd come up with 
                         packages and there she'd be -- in 
                         her negligee -- beautiful -- but no 
                         soul -- immoral. So I did it. I rid 
                         the world of her.

                                     MULVEY
                              (quickly)
                         The knife you stabbed her with. What 
                         did you do with it?

                                     BISBEE
                         You'll never find it -- never. I 
                         buried it -- I buried it.

                                     MULVEY
                              (to Cop)
                         Call Bellevue Hospital... Psychiatric 
                         Department.
                              (starts out)

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               INT. MULVEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               MULVEY, DONAHUE, MILLER

               Miller is cleaning his fingernails with a penknife. Donahue 
               is looking over various reports that Mulvey is handing him 
               from a folder.

                                     NARRATOR
                         It's seven-thirty in the evening 
                         now. It's been a great day on the 
                         Dexter case: Developments -- none; 
                         new clues -- none; progress -- none. 
                         Ever try to catch a murderer? It has 
                         its depressing moments.

               Donahue now returns the last report to Mulvey. Mulvey closes 
               the folder. Donahue rubs his forefinger thoughtfully up and 
               down the length of his nose.

                                     DONAHUE
                         I can't see you've missed anything.

                                     MULVEY
                              (wryly)
                         Boss, I can always trust you to 
                         comfort a man.

               Pause.

                                     DONAHUE
                         Any word today from Baltimore?

                                     MULVEY
                         No... and Henderson's pajamas were 
                         bought last week in a store on 34th 
                         Street -- but not by Henderson -- by 
                         Jean Dexter.

               Pause. Donahue shakes his head.

                                     DONAHUE
                         A heavy case...

                                     MULVEY
                         It's that.

               The door opens. Perelli appears, looking very pleased. He 
               takes the cigarette case sold by Niles out of his pocket.

                                     PERELLI
                         This cigarette case Niles sold this 
                         morning -- it's hot. It was stolen 
                         from Dr. Lawrence Stoneman.

                                     DONAHUE
                         Dexter's physician?

                                     PERELLI
                         Yeah. He reported a robbery in his 
                         apartment in March. Twenty-eight 
                         hundred dollars worth of stuff. None 
                         of it has ever shown up... Here's 
                         the Department list of stolen jewelry 
                         for the past year.

               He hands some typewritten sheets to Mulvey. Mulvey's eyes 
               are gleaming. The atmosphere of the office has completely 
               altered, from defeat to excitement.

                                     PERELLI
                              (continuing)
                         That's not all -- Niles bought a 
                         plane ticket for Mexico City -- one 
                         way.

                                     MULVEY
                         Leaving when?

                                     PERELLI
                         Tomorrow noon... Want me to pick him 
                         up?

                                     MULVEY
                         No. What else did he do today?

                                     PERELLI
                         ...Had lunch with Ruth Young. They 
                         held hands for an hour. She went 
                         back to her shop -- he went to the 
                         Park Central and had a swim. He's at 
                         Toots Shor's now.

                                     DONAHUE
                              (amused)
                         Buying a plane ticket -- pawning a 
                         stolen cigarette case -- that's not 
                         smart. What is this man -- an amachoor 
                         or something?

                                     MULVEY
                              (slaps the palm of 
                              his hand on the table)
                         That's what's in his heart! Now I 
                         know! He's had no experience at being 
                         a crook. He's a scared college boy 
                         way out in deep water. He's starting 
                         to thrash around now, he's in a panic.

                                     DONAHUE
                         A panic over what?

                                     MULVEY
                         I don't know, yet, Sam.

                                     DONAHUE
                              (excitedly)
                         And how does this Stoneman figure? 
                         Why should Niles pawn a cigarette 
                         case belonging to him?

               Door opens suddenly. Halloran strides in, excited.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Dan -- I got something, maybe.

                                     MULVEY
                         About what?

                                     HALLORAN
                         The black star sapphire Dexter was 
                         wearing when she was killed -- it 
                         didn't belong to her. She didn't buy 
                         it, Henderson didn't buy it for her. 
                         It belongs to a Mrs. Hylton, 482 
                         Park Ave. I found a jeweler who 
                         repaired it for her.

               Excitedly Mulvey picks up the Department list of stolen 
               jewelry. Perelli looks over his shoulder. Mulvey turns a 
               page, then another.

                                     DONAHUE
                              (muttering)
                         We started in a murder case and we're 
                         up to our necks in stolen jewelry.

                                     PERELLI
                              (suddenly... pointing)
                         Mrs. Edgar Hylton -- there it is.

                                     MULVEY
                              (excitedly)
                         Black star sapphire -- part of a 
                         sixty-two-hundred-dollar robbery of 
                         her apartment.
                              (to Halloran)
                         Did you see this Mrs. Hylton?

                                     HALLORAN
                         I thought you might want to see her.

                                     MULVEY
                         Now that was considerate of you, 
                         Jimmy. We'll telephone the lady and 
                         we'll both go to see her.

               He turns to Donahue with gleaming eyes.

                                     MULVEY
                         Have a beer on me, Sam. An' throw a 
                         pinch of salt over your shoulder. 
                         This case is starting to move.

               EXT. IN FRONT OF 482 PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

                                     NARRATOR
                         Ever watch a hound dog tracking A 
                         police sedan stops at the curb. Mulvey 
                         and Halloran get out, walk toward 
                         entrance. down a rabbit? It sniffs -- 
                         and sniffs -- and suddenly it begins 
                         to run...

               INT. APARTMENT HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Mulvey and Halloran are entering an apartment. A maid has 
               opened the door.

               INT. FOYER OF HYLTON APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A rhumba record is being played in an adjacent room.

                                     MAID
                         Mrs. Hylton's waiting for you.

               She leads the way to a sitting room, separated from the foyer 
               by heavy brocade curtains.

               INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

               as they enter. Rhumba music is coming over the radio. MRS. 
               HYLTON is sitting by the radio, her head cocked to one side, 
               listening to the music with obvious delight. She gestures 
               for them to come in but continues to listen to the music, 
               which is approaching the end of a tune. One foot is tapping 
               out the rhythm. Mulvey and Halloran exchange amused glances, 
               wait. The music ends, Mrs. Hylton switches off the radio, 
               then jumps up and comes toward them, beaming.

               She is a woman in her late forties, no more than five feet 
               tall, very slim, bright-eyed. Her speech, her gestures, her 
               walk, are all very quick, vigorous; she is as close to being 
               a hummingbird as any woman can be. She is dressed in an 
               attractive, expensive house-coat and is wearing diamond rings 
               on both hands, a diamond bracelet, a diamond clip in her 
               grey hair.

                                     MAID
                         Lieutenant Mulvey, M'am.
                              (she leaves)

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                              (gayly)
                         As you see, I'm crazy about rhumba 
                         music. Imagine, at my age!
                              (to Halloran)
                         My, what a nice-looking young man!
                              (to Mulvey)
                         You're the Lieutenant who telephoned 
                         me, aren't you? Did you get my jewels 
                         back?

               Mulvey produces the black star sapphire.

                                     MULVEY
                         Is this one of 'em?

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                              (with a shriek of 
                              delight)
                         Yes it is! Oh, wonderful, you 
                         wonderful men. Where's the rest?

                                     MULVEY
                         This is all we have.

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                         I'm so disappointed! But this is 
                         wonderful. I gave it to my daughter 
                         when she graduated from college. She 
                         was heart-broken when --
                              (stops talking... 
                              holds ring up to 
                              light)
                         Isn't it precious?
                              (laughs... holds out 
                              hands)
                         I love to glitter. It's a fixation.
                              (to Halloran)
                         My, you're nice looking.
                              (gesturing)
                         Sit down, gentlemen, get comfortable.

               Mulvey and Halloran sit. Both of them look a bit bewildered.

                                     MULVEY
                         Mrs. Hylton -- is your daughter here? 
                         I'd like to talk to her.

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                              (looking at wrist 
                              watch)
                         She's due any minute for dinner -- 
                         it's her night with Momma.
                              (laughs)
                         One of those career girls -- has her 
                         own apartment -- works. That's what 
                         you get when you send them to Vassar.
                              (laughs)

                                     MULVEY
                         If she doesn't live with you, how is 
                         it her ring was stolen from here?

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                         That was last December. She was living 
                         with me then.

                                     MULVEY
                         I see... Now... ah... I wonder if by 
                         any chance...

                                     GIRL'S VOICE
                         Mother? I'm here.

               Ruth Young appears in the doorway. Halloran bounds to his 
               feet.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Niles -- he's the connection!

                                     MULVEY
                         Easy, lad.
                              (crossing to Ruth)
                         You told me your name was Ruth Young -- 
                         not Hylton.

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                         Ruth's my daughter by a first 
                         marriage. She kept her father's name.
                              (to Ruth)
                         How do you know these men?

                                     RUTH
                         They're investigating Jean Dexter's 
                         murder. Jean modeled with me at the 
                         shop, Mother.

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                         Imagine!
                              (suddenly)
                         Look, darling.
                              (displays sapphire)

                                     RUTH
                         My ring!

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                         They brought it. Aren't they 
                         wonderful?

                                     RUTH
                         How did you get it?

                                     MULVEY
                         Your friend was wearing it when she 
                         was murdered.

                                     RUTH
                              (bewildered)
                         Jean?

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                         How did she get it?

                                     MULVEY
                         I was hoping your daughter would 
                         tell us that.

                                     RUTH
                         I have no idea. It was stolen with 
                         the other things.
                              (suddenly, to Halloran)
                         What did you mean before when you 
                         said, 'Niles -- he's the connection?'

               Halloran shifts awkwardly, says nothing.

                                     RUTH
                              (continuing)
                         What did you mean? Please...

                                     MULVEY
                         He was just wondering, Miss... how 
                         your ring came to be on her finger.

                                     RUTH
                         You don't think Robert...?
                              (laughs)
                         But that's silly. He hardly knew 
                         Jean.

                                     MULVEY
                         That ring on your hand now... is it 
                         your engagement ring?

                                     RUTH
                         Yes.

                                     MULVEY
                         Might I see it?

               Ruth takes it off, gives it to him.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing)
                         A pearl in an old-fashioned setting. 
                         Unusual.

               Mulvey gives ring and a list from his pocket to Halloran.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing)
                         Jimmy --

               Halloran nods, moves off a little, sits.

                                     RUTH
                              (composed)
                         What are you doing?

                                     MULVEY
                              (gently)
                         I'm sorry, Miss. We're checking your 
                         ring to see if it was stolen.

                                     RUTH
                              (trying to be nice 
                              about it)
                         You don't mind if I feel rather 
                         insulted, do you?

                                     MULVEY
                              (gently)
                         I'd expect you to.

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                         I'm sure you have to question everyone 
                         who knew Miss Dexter -- but this is 
                         fantastic.

                                     RUTH
                         Do you honestly think either Robert 
                         or I had anything to do with her 
                         murder?

                                     MULVEY
                         Just earning my salary, Miss.

               Halloran suddenly steps up to Ruth.

                                     HALLORAN
                         When did Niles give you this ring?

                                     RUTH
                         About six weeks ago.

                                     HALLORAN
                         On January 8th, Mrs. Charles Franklyn, 
                         382 Fern Ave., New Rochelle, reported 
                         the loss of this ring in a robbery.

               Ruth is stricken. She stares at him in horror. Mrs. Hylton 
               looks stunned.

               A pause.

                                     RUTH
                              (rising... anguished)
                         Mother, if you don't mind, I won't 
                         have supper with you tonight.

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                         Of course, dear.
                              (vaguely, to Mulvey)
                         Robert, a thief? But he's so educated. 
                         He studied philosophy in college...

               Mulvey, however, is paying no attention to Mrs. Hylton. He 
               calls sharply to Ruth Young, who has started out of the room.

                                     MULVEY
                         Miss Young.

               She pauses.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing)
                         Where are you going?

                                     RUTH
                              (in a whisper)
                         Whatever you're thinking, I know the 
                         sort of man Robert is. There's some 
                         explanation of this, and he'll give 
                         it to me.

                                     MULVEY
                         Okay -- but we'll have to go with 
                         you.

                                     RUTH
                         Oh!
                              (pause)
                         That's quite all right... Good-bye, 
                         Mother. I'll call you.

               Her mother is too stricken to reply.

                                     MULVEY
                              (on way out)
                         Good night, M'am.

               Mrs. Hylton stands, looking very distracted. The others leave. 
               Her hand goes to her face, plucks at her lip.

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                              (to herself)
                         Upsetting... everything's always so 
                         upsetting.

               Maid appears at entrance.

                                     MAID
                         Isn't Miss Ruth staying to supper?

                                     MRS. HYLTON
                         No... no, she isn't... I'll eat 
                         alone...
                              (starts out, pauses)
                         Put on some music, Margaret... a 
                         rhumba.

               EXT. A STREET IN EAST EIGHTIES - NIGHT

               A taxi comes slowly down the street, stops. Mulvey steps 
               out, looks around. A figure comes out of the shadow of a 
               building, joins him. It is Perelli.

               EXT. MULVEY, PERELLI - NIGHT

               In BG in taxi, are Ruth Young and Halloran. Ruth is twisting 
               a handkerchief in her hands.

                                     MULVEY
                              (low-voiced)
                         Is Niles in?

                                     PERELLI
                         Went in about half an hour ago.

                                     MULVEY
                         Alone?

                                     PERELLI
                         Yeah.

               Reaches in pocket, hands him a key.

                                     PERELLI
                              (continuing)
                         Apartment 7 E. Building on the corner.

                                     MULVEY
                         You can go home now.

                                     PERELLI
                         Thanks... I'm dead. S'long.

                                     MULVEY
                         Good night.

               Perelli leaves. Mulvey beckons to Halloran. He and Ruth get 
               out of the car as Mulvey pays hackie. They start across the 
               street, on the diagonal, toward the corner apartment house.

               INT. APARTMENT HOUSE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Mulvey, Halloran, Ruth stop at a door. A spill of light 
               underneath. Halloran rings the bell. They wait. He rings the 
               bell again. They wait.

                                     MULVEY
                              (calling)
                         Niles!

               There is no reply. Mulvey takes the key out of his pocket. 
               Halloran takes out his gun.

                                     MULVEY
                              (sharply, to Ruth)
                         Stand back.

               He pushes her to one side. He opens door, flings it back and 
               lets Halloran rush in.

               INT. NILES APARTMENT - NIGHT

               as Halloran, Mulvey, with Ruth following, burst in. Niles is 
               on the floor, unconscious. A chair is overturned, the contents 
               of a suitcase are strewn all over a divan.

                                     MULVEY
                         The window!

               Halloran races across the room to an open window, climbs 
               out.

               EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               as Halloran jumps out, looks down. Four stories below he 
               sees a shadowy, bulky figure, racing down. The sound of 
               pounding feet on the iron grid work comes up. Halloran snaps 
               up his gun, leans out, shoots. There is an instant metallic 
               ping as the bullet hits the fire escape somewhere down below, 
               then ricochets with a shattering of glass through a window 
               in the house. Halloran starts to run down as a yell comes 
               from below. Above the pounding of Halloran's feet we hear an 
               angry man's voice.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         What's going on here?

               EXT. HALLORAN'S FACE - NIGHT

               tense, breaking out with sweat, as he runs. We hear him 
               panting for breath.

               A light switches on in a window as he runs past it. A window 
               bangs up.

                                     A WOMAN'S VOICE
                              (screaming)
                         Police -- somebody call the police.
                              (she repeats it several 
                              times)

               EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

               We see the two running figures from the sidewalk below. 
               Halloran is now at the fifth floor; the man escaping is just 
               at the edge of the ladder which forms the last section of 
               fire escape. He swings down onto it; it slides down to the 
               ground.

               EXT. GARZA - NIGHT

               face bathed in sweat, eyes gleaming, chest heaving. He fires 
               twice at Halloran; the bullets slam into the grid work, 
               ricochet. Garza starts to run out of the alley.

               EXT. GARZA - NIGHT

               from Halloran's POV. Halloran stops running, leans out, 
               shoots. Garza keeps running, disappears into alley. Halloran 
               runs again.

               EXT. HALLORAN - NIGHT

               Seen from below. Lights are going on all over the house. 
               There is a babble of talk and shouts. Halloran comes to the 
               last section. He swings with it to the pavement. He runs 
               down the alley out into the deserted street. As he looks 
               down one way a voice yells to him. It is from a man in pajamas 
               in the window of a house opposite.

                                     MAN
                              (yelling)
                         What's going on there? What's the 
                         matter?

                                     HALLORAN
                              (yelling)
                         Police! Did you see a man run out of 
                         here?

                                     MAN
                         That way! Around the corner!

               Halloran runs around the corner. At the opposite corner is a 
               subway entrance. He pounds down the street, runs down the 
               subway steps.

               INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM (SHOOTING UP) - NIGHT

               as Halloran leaps down the last few stairs, gun in hand. 
               CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he vaults over the turnstiles. A 
               train is pulling out of the station. The platform is deserted 
               except for two elderly women coming out of the exit. They 
               cling together, stare at Halloran in horror as he hurries 
               through turnstile over to an elderly station attendant who 
               has not moved out of his booth.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (excitedly)
                         Police emergency! Is there any way 
                         of stopping that train at the next 
                         station -- keeping the doors locked?

                                     ATTENDANT
                         The train that just pulled out?
                              (Halloran nods)
                         Well, yes, I -- I guess there is.
                              (eager to help, but 
                              very ineffectual)
                         Let's see now. I'd have to call the 
                         main office first...
                              (reaches for phone)
                         ...or maybe I better call the 86th 
                         Street station. Which do you think?

                                     HALLORAN
                              (wearily)
                         Never mind. Thanks just the same.
                              (puts away his gun; 
                              starts out)

               INT. NILES APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Niles is still on the floor, but there is a pillow under his 
               head and his collar and tie have been opened. Ruth, on her 
               knees, is bathing his face with a wet towel. A basin of water 
               stands nearby. Mulvey is just crossing to the window as we 
               hear shouts from the outside.

                                     A WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Isn't anybody going to call the 
                         police?

                                     A MAN'S VOICE
                         What for? Somebody found somebody 
                         else in the wrong apartment, that's 
                         all.
                              (laughs)

                                     MULVEY
                              (shouting out window)
                         Listen to me, everybody -- this is 
                         Lieutenant Mulvey of the Police 
                         Department talking. The trouble's 
                         all over. Get quiet now and go back 
                         to sleep.

               He shuts window, returns to Ruth and Niles.

                                     RUTH
                              (muttering)
                         Darling, darling... Robert, Robert.
                              (to Mulvey)
                         Maybe some whiskey would help.

                                     MULVEY
                              (calmly)
                         Whiskey's not the thing to mix with 
                         chloroform. Suppose you go into the 
                         kitchen and see if there's a spot of 
                         coffee on the stove. It'll do fine, 
                         even if it's cold.

               Ruth jumps up, runs out. Mulvey bends down, raises Niles's 
               head with one hand. He proceeds to slap him smartly on both 
               sides of the face.

                                     MULVEY
                              (muttering)
                         Come on now, my sleepin' beauty... 
                         wake up.
                              (slapping him)
                         That's the sweet lad.
                              (slaps him)

               Niles groans, his eyelids flutter, his head turns. Mulvey 
               slaps him again, then reaches for the basin of water. He 
               pours the water over Niles's face. Niles's eyes open in a 
               bewildered stare. Ruth comes into room carrying a cup.

                                     RUTH
                         I found some cold tea.

                                     MULVEY
                         That'll do fine. He's waking up now.

               She runs to Niles, kneels.

                                     RUTH
                         Robert, darling.

                                     NILES
                              (still dazed)
                         Hello, Ruth.

               She kisses him, holds, him, cradles him, kisses him again.

                                     MULVEY
                              (muttering)
                         A touching scene.
                              (to Ruth)
                         The cold tea'll do him more good.

               The door opens, Halloran comes in. Mulvey joins him. They 
               whisper. Halloran's face is wet with sweat.

                                     HALLORAN
                         He got away. On the subway, I think.

                                     MULVEY
                         Get a look at him?

                                     HALLORAN
                         No. He was a big man -- that's all I 
                         got. What do I smell in here?

                                     MULVEY
                         Chloroform. I think this is our friend 
                         McGillicuddy again.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Oh!

               They both move into room. Niles is sitting up now, drinking 
               the tea with Ruth's help.

                                     MULVEY
                         You awake?

               Niles nods. He starts to get up, groans.

                                     NILES
                         I've got a head like a beehive.

               He feels the back of his head over one ear, winces. Halloran 
               takes him under both arms from behind, lifts him. On wobbly 
               knees Niles makes a chair, sinks down into it.

                                     NILES
                              (continuing)
                         Is that towel wet?

                                     RUTH
                              (giving it to him)
                         Want any more tea, darling?

                                     NILES
                         No.

               He looks at Mulvey, rubs his face with the towel.

                                     MULVEY
                         While you're thinking up a nice story 
                         about what didn't happen -- suppose 
                         you tell us what did?

                              (rubs his face with 
                              towel)

                         I was packing a bag and... I thought

                         Listen, Niles -- you came very close 
                         to not waking up at all. The party 
                         that killed Jean Dexter tried the 
                         same business on you. Who was it?

                                     NILES
                              (resentfully)

                         If you're afraid, I'll guarantee you 
                         police protection.

                         If I knew, I'd tell you. I'm not a 
                         fool. Do you think I enjoyed this?
                              (rubs face)

                                     MULVEY
                         Got any guess who it was?

                         It must've been a burglar. Came in 
                         by the fire escape, I suppose.

                                     MULVEY
                         A burglar? Maybe he stole something.

               Niles stiffens. He gets up as quickly as his condition 
               permits, goes to divan, searches anxiously through the 
               suitcase and among the things strewn about. It is clear that 
               he is searching for something he can't find. Then he stops, 
               turns.

                                     MULVEY
                         He got it -- didn't he?

                         hard -- your B.V.D.'s.?

               He takes out a jewel-studded cigarette lighter.

                         Jimmy --

               Halloran takes it from Niles, pulls Department list of stolen

                         dealing in stolen jewelry, sure. But 
                         it was society stuff. What does 
                         Backalis's record show?

                                     HALLORAN
                              (chagrined)
                         I didn't think of that. It was small 
                         time -- a pawn shop robbery in Queens.

                                     MULVEY
                         Y'see? I'm afraid these two cases 
                         are miles apart. If we drag every 
                         petty jewelry thief into this, we'll 
                         go crazy.
                              (looks at him)
                         But you're not convinced, are you?

                                     HALLORAN
                         I don't know, Dan. Trouble is, where 
                         are we on the Dexter case?

                                     MULVEY
                         This morning I sent out photos of 
                         Niles and Dexter to every Police 
                         Department on the East Coast. They'll 
                         check all jewelers.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Where can that lead?

                                     MULVEY
                         That's how you run a case, lad... 
                         from step to step.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Do me a favor, Dan. Let me waste 
                         some time on this Backalis angle.

               A pause. Mulvey thinks it over.

                                     MULVEY
                         Okay, lad. Phone in once a day.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Thanks.

                                     MULVEY
                         By the way...

               Halloran pauses.

                                     MULVEY
                              (softly)
                         This is only the third day now on 
                         the Dexter murder. The Department 
                         never calls a case unsolved in less 
                         than twenty years. Don't get 
                         impatient.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Good deal. Twenty years from now, 
                         I'll put my kid on it.

               He leaves, smiling. Mulvey grins.

               Halloran waits while a clerk looks in a file. Clerk takes 
               out a card.

                                     CLERK
                         Backalis's parole officer was Charles 
                         Freed. County Courthouse in the Bronx.

               Halloran turns, starts out.

               as Halloran enters.

               INT. AN OFFICE BRONX COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               Halloran is sitting with a parole officer, CHARLES FREED, a 
               man of fifty, bald.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Well, tell me this, Mr. Freed... Do 
                         you think Backalis could get so drunk 
                         he'd fall down on a pier, hurt himself 
                         and topple into the river?

                                     FREED
                              (thinking)
                         I doubt it. He seemed like one of 
                         those steady, all-day drinkers -- 
                         always with a load on, but never 
                         wobbly.

                                     FREED

                         Right on my doorstep! What do you 
                         know...

               EXT. BRIDGE ABOVE LONG ISLAND CITY RAILROAD YARDS - NIGHT

               EXT. HALLORAN AND HICKS - NIGHT

               a Negro patrolman.

                                     HALLORAN
                         About two and a half years ago you 
                         arrested Peter Backalis on a pawnshop 
                         entry.

                                     HICKS
                         That's right.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Did he do that job alone?

                                     HICKS
                         No -- there was another guy with him -- 
                         a feller he called Willie.

                                     HALLORAN
                         What happened to him?

                                     HICKS
                         He got away by the neatest trick 
                         I've ever seen. I nailed Backalis in 
                         the back alley. He yelled "Beat it, 
                         Willie," and this other customer 
                         throws a chair through a plate glass 
                         window -- dives right after it -- 
                         and comes up on his feet like an 
                         acrobat. Then he's off like a streak.

                                     HALLORAN
                         How was this fellow built?

                                     HICKS
                         Big -- like an all-American 
                         fullback... And listen... something 
                         funny about him. One of the things 
                         the owner reported missing was a 
                         harmonica. Now there's no resale 
                         value in a thing like that. So I 
                         always figured he must've liked to 
                         play one.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Maybe you're right. Much obliged.

                              (listens)
                         Jimmy, I don't know where you're 
                         going -- but I'm gonna start in and 
                         help you. I'm giving you Fowler and 
                         Constentino, starting tomorrow 
                         morning.

               Hangs up, yawns. Starts taking off coat.

               EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY

               Halloran, Constentino, Fowler are talking. The three men 
               separate, go in different directions.

                         His name is Willie -- maybe. He 
                         might've been a professional acrobat -- 
                         maybe. He might be the man we're 
                         looking for... maybe. Oh, yes -- 
                         he's a big man. Only half a million 
                         big men in New York.

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               A bald, thin, acidulous-looking man is talking to Halloran. 
               On wall, autographed photos from vaudeville actors.

                                     BOOKING AGENT
                         ...Not that I can remember. I been 
                         booking vaudeville acts, circus acts, 
                         night club acts, for thirty years. 
                         Lot of queer eggs among 'em -- but a 
                         acrobat who played the harmonica? 
                         That queer I never saw one.

                                     HALLORAN

               Men are working out in ring. Off to one side Fowler talks to 
               Stillman.

                         A harmonica player? No, sir, brother. 
                         A character like that I wouldn't 
                         even let work out here.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. A GYMNASIUM WHERE WRESTLERS PRACTICE - DAY

               Two wrestlers are intertwined on a mat; both are heavyweights. 
               A trainer and another wrestler are watching. Constentino 
               comes in.

                                     CONSTENTINO
                         Who runs this joint?

                                     TRAINER
                         I do. What do you want?

                                     CONSTENTINO
                              (showing badge)
                         Police.

               Instantly the two wrestlers freeze in an intertwined position, 
               look up.

                                     CONSTENTINO
                         Any of you guys ever know a wrestler 
                         who liked to play the harmonica?

                                     TRAINER
                         Sure -- Willie the harmonica player -- 
                         Willie Garza -- I teached him to 
                         wrastle.

               One of the wrestlers on mat looks up.

                                     WRESTLER
                         You didn't teach him so good. I 
                         kokalized him in Scranton five years 
                         ago.

                                     CONSTENTINO
                         Where's he now?

                                     TRAINER
                         Don't know -- don't care. He borrowed 
                         thirty-eight bucks from me once, 
                         never paid it back. A lousola.

                                     CONSTENTINO
                         Where'd he used to live?

                                     TRAINER
                         Don't know.

                         What's his brother's name?

                                     WRESTLER
                         Garza. All brothers got the same 
                         names.

                                     CONSTENTINO
                         I mean his first name.

                                     WRESTLER
                         I dunno.

                                     CONSTENTINO
                         Okay.

                         We're looking for your brother -- 
                         Willie.

                                     EDDIE GARZA
                         Me an' my brother Willie ain't got 
                         nothing to do with each other. He's 
                         no good.

                                     CONSTENTINO
                         When'd you see him last?

                                     EDDIE GARZA
                         Three months ago about.
                              (laughs)
                         Tried to sell me a diamond ring for 
                         my wife. I told him to go blow.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Any idea at all where he lives?

                                     EDDIE GARZA
                         He had a room somewhere around the 
                         Williamsburg Bridge. That's all I 
                         know.

                                     CONSTENTINO
                         You got a picture of him?

                                     EDDIE GARZA
                         No. But when he was wrestlin' the 
                         newspapers printed his mug a few 
                         times.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Okay.

               They start off.

                                     EDDIE GARZA
                         If you send him up, do me a favor... 
                         throw the keys away.

               Halloran, Fowler, and Constentino at a table. They have

               district.

                                     HALLORAN
                         The first guy to get a lead report 
                         to Mulvey.

               The others nod. Halloran gives them each a photo of Garza, a 
               wrestling pose, full-length.

               EXT. A STREET CORNER - NIGHT

               Fowler goes up to an old woman pretzel seller. He shows her

               INT. DRUG STORE PHONE BOOTH - DAY

               Halloran has the receiver to his ear, is waiting. While he 
               waits, he blocks out a street on his sectional map. A whole 
               series of streets have already been blocked out. He looks 
               tired, drawn.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (into phone)
                         Hello, Dan... Jimmy.

                         Sure, I'll keep going. What's doing 
                         at your end?

               INT. MULVEY'S OFFICE - DAY

               In the office are Mulvey, Niles, Miller, Perelli.

                                     MULVEY
                              (into phone)
                         Doing fine here. I'm talking to that 
                         clean-cut young American beauty again.
                              (listens)
                         I think he's going to tell us 
                         something this morning.
                              (Niles fidgets)
                         Okay -- report in.
                              (hangs up)

                                     NILES
                         I've told you everything I know.

                                     MULVEY
                              (pleasantly)
                         No, you haven't, sonny.
                              (rises, starts for 
                              door)
                         But you will.

               Mulvey opens door.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing)
                         Come in, Mr. McCormick.

               Niles jumps to his feet as a stout, middle-aged man enters.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing -- to 
                              McCormick)
                         Recognize this man?

                                     MCCORMICK
                         I certainly do.

               With surprising agility, McCormick lunges at Niles and punches 
               him in the jaw. Niles crumples under the weight of the blow 
               and sags to the floor. Perelli grabs McCormick.

                                     MULVEY
                         Sit down. If there's any more of 
                         that, you'll get yourself in trouble.
                              (to Niles)
                         Getting quite a slapping around these 
                         days, aren't you?

               McCormick sits. Niles has gotten up. He holds a handkerchief 
               to his mouth.

                                     MCCORMICK
                         I came all the way down from Boston 
                         to do that. That smooth-talking crook 
                         came to me with an introduction I 
                         had to honor. He gave me a song and 
                         dance -- his sister was terribly 
                         sick -- needed an operation -- he 
                         was trying to sell her jewels. I 
                         paid him over three thousand dollars. 
                         Now it turns out to be stolen 
                         property.

                                     NILES
                         Are you paying him to say that, 
                         Mulvey? You still can't prove 
                         anything.

                                     MCCORMICK
                         I can.
                              (pulls a letter from 
                              his pocket)
                         I run my business with great care. 
                         This is the letter of introduction 
                         he brought with him.

               Niles stiffens. Mulvey takes the letter, looks at it.

                                     MULVEY
                         Dr. Lawrence Stoneman!

                                     MCCORMICK
                         He treated my mother some years ago. 
                         I had to honor his letter.

               Mulvey's eyes are now riveted on Niles.

                                     MULVEY
                         Will you wait outside, Mr. McCormick?

               McCormick goes out. Perelli shuts door. Silence. Mulvey, 
               Perelli and Miller are all staring at Niles.

                                     MULVEY
                         How do you get a letter of 
                         introduction from a man like Stoneman?
                              (silence)
                         You're going to the penitentiary, 
                         Niles.
                              (pause)
                         But from now on in, the length of 
                         your sentence depends on you.
                              (pause)
                         Stealing jewelry is one thing -- but 
                         murder is different.

                                     MULVEY

                         five years for stealing jewelry. But

                         bluffing.

               Mulvey looks at the others in triumph.

               EXT. EAST SIDE STREET - DAY

               A street sign: RIVINGTON STREET CAMERA MOVES DOWN to take in 
               Halloran, looking at sign. He crosses a bit wearily to a 
               corner soda fountain that opens onto the street. He leans on 
               counter, blocks off another street on his sectional map. The 
               proprietress moves over, a middle-aged woman, stout, workworn, 
               wearing glasses.

                                     HALLORAN
                         You got any cold root beer?

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                         Like ice.

               As woman fills order, Halloran holds out a photo of Garza.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Ever see this man?

               The proprietress takes the photo, looks at it.

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                         He's a box fighter?

                         A wrestler.

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                              (laughs)
                         Boxing, wrestling, what do I know?
                              (returns photo)
                         Five cents, pleez.

               Halloran takes out coin, gives it to her. The woman's brow 
               furrows suddenly. She picks up photo again.

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                         Pleez.

               She studies photo, puts her hand across it to block out all 
               but the face.

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                              (continuing)
                         He's a feller likes to play the 
                         whatchamacallit?

               She gestures playing the harmonica. Halloran almost jumps 
               out of his skin.

                                     HALLORAN
                         The harmonica! Yes!

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                         Sure, I know him -- Willie!

                                     HALLORAN
                         Where does he live?

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                         This street someplace.

                                     HALLORAN
                         What house?

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                         Down the street someplace. I dunno.

               Halloran walks quickly around counter into store. He crosses 
               to phone, dials. The proprietress comes up to him with an 
               anxious look.

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                         Who you, Mista?

               Halloran doesn't answer.

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                              (continuing)
                         You from a collection agency, maybe?

                                     HALLORAN
                              (into phone)
                         Ben? This is Jimmy. Dan there?
                              (listens)
                         When he gets back, tell him I've 
                         located Garza. Somewhere on Rivington 
                         between Delancey and Essex. 'Bye.

               He hangs up. The proprietress timidly plucks his sleeve.

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                         Pleez, Mista -- by me Willie's a 
                         nice feller. A man likes kids, he's 
                         nice. Any little kid asks him, Willie 
                         plays his whatchamacallit. I don't 
                         want I should make trouble for him.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (showing badge)
                         Don't worry, lady.

               Halloran leaves.

                                     PROPRIETRESS
                              (calling after him)
                         You don't want your root beer, Mista?

               EXT. SQUIBB BUILDING - DAY

               Mulvey, Perelli, Niles and another detective are on their 
               way into the building. A police sedan is parked at curb.

               EXT. RIVINGTON STREET - DAY

               Halloran walks up to a thin, stooped woman who is sitting on 
               steps with a baby in her arms

                                     HALLORAN
                         Does Willie Garza live here?
                              (shows photo)

               The woman looks at photo, speaks with an Italian accent.

                                     WOMAN
                         He'sa not live here.

                                     HALLORAN
                         You sure?

                                     WOMAN
                         My hoosband he'sa janitor. I'm 
                         positive.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Thanks.

               He moves on.

               INT. CORRIDOR OF SQUIBB BUILDING - DAY

               Mulvey and his party are walking along a series of offices. 
               The windows are marked "Dr. Stoneman." An arrow points to an 
               entrance further on. Mulvey gestures to a detective we haven't 
               seen before, to cover Stoneman's last door.

                                     MULVEY
                         Nobody gets by you.

               The party goes on, enters reception room. There are three 
               patients waiting. Mulvey goes up to nurse, shows badge, 
               whispers.

                                     MULVEY
                         I'm Lieutenant Mulvey of the Police 
                         Department. Is Dr. Stoneman in?

                                     NURSE
                         He's with a patient.

                                     MULVEY
                         I want you to do exactly as I say, 
                         Miss. Tell the patients who are 
                         waiting that they have to leave.

                                     NURSE
                         But --

                                     MULVEY
                         Do what I say, Miss --

               The nurse looks at him, rises.

               EXT. RIVINGTON STREET - DAY

               Halloran walks up to two little girls who are playing jacks 
               on the steps of a house.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Do you kids know a man who lives on 
                         this street by the name of Willie 
                         Garza?

               The girls look at each other blankly.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (continuing)
                         He plays the harmonica.

               One of the girls smiles.

                                     GIRL
                         I know him. Willie.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Where does he live?

                                     GIRL
                         Across the street -- corner house, I 
                         think -- or the next one.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Good girl.

               Leaves.

               INT. STONEMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

               The nurse is just closing the door on the last of the 
               patients. She turns on Mulvey angrily.

                                     NURSE
                         This is really unheard of.

                                     MULVEY
                         I know, M'am.
                              (to Niles)
                         Sit there. Don't say anything.

               He points to a chair directly opposite the entrance to 
               Stoneman's office. Niles obeys.

                                     MULVEY
                              (continuing -- to 
                              nurse)
                         Tell Dr. Stoneman somebody out here 
                         has to see him. Tell him to leave 
                         his patient and come out right now. 
                         And don't tell him anything else.

                                     NURSE
                              (almost weeping)
                         I'll lose my job over this.
                              (picks up phone -- 
                              waits)
                         Doctor --
                              (beginning to sob)
                         There's someone here. He has to see 
                         you. You have to come right out.
                              (listens -- sobbing)
                         You must, doctor, right now, you 
                         must.

               The nurse hangs up with a bang and bursts into tears. Mulvey 
               and Perelli move quickly into a small recess in the office 
               behind the nurse's desk. The door opens. Stoneman comes out, 
               looking very irritated. He stops dead when he sees Niles.

                                     STONEMAN
                              (icily)
                         What are you doing here?

               Niles says nothing. He is looking at Mulvey. Stoneman turns.

                                     STONEMAN
                         Who are you?

                                     MULVEY
                         Lieutenant Mulvey of the Homicide 
                         Squad. Do you go by the name of 
                         Henderson?

               Slowly Stoneman seems to cave in.

                                     STONEMAN
                         Yes.

                                     MULVEY
                         You're under arrest for the murder 
                         of Jean Dexter.

                                     STONEMAN
                              (with a low cry of 
                              horror)
                         No! I couldn't do anything like that.
                              (swinging on Niles)
                         If anyone did it, it was him!
                              (buries head in hands, 
                              sinks into chair)
                         Finished -- I'm finished now...

                                     MULVEY
                         What was your relationship to Niles 
                         and Dexter?

                                     STONEMAN
                              (with a low cry of 
                              shame, ripped from 
                              his gut)
                         A lamb led to slaughter! An idiot 
                         robbed of self-respect, of manhood, 
                         of decency!
                              (half sobs; in a low 
                              voice)
                         I loved that girl the way a sick man 
                         loves alcohol or a narcotic. There 
                         was nothing right about it or good 
                         about it, only a sick hunger. I saw 
                         her a year ago in that dress shop. 
                         And from then on I was drunk with 
                         her, lost.
                              (turns on Niles)
                         For six months now I've known they've 
                         been using me. I was their tipster -- 
                         me -- Stoneman.

                                     MULVEY
                         What do you mean?

                                     STONEMAN
                         It wasn't enough I poured money out 
                         on her. Jean was twisted inside, 
                         too, like me.
                              (with a bewildered 
                              cry)
                         What does life do to people that it 
                         can set up such unnatural hungers in 
                         them -- me for a woman like her -- 
                         and she for money?
                              (gestures)
                         She was a common thief.
                              (looking at Niles)
                         Both of them. They used my social 
                         connections. My wife is a partygiver. 
                         Jean'd find out from me who was to 
                         be there. And it was only after months 
                         that I realized that when someone 
                         came to my house, his apartment was 
                         robbed the same night.

                                     MULVEY
                         Why didn't you go to the police?

               Stoneman gestures despairingly.

                                     STONEMAN
                         Why doesn't a drug addict stop taking 
                         drugs? She kept promising me each 
                         time was the last. I believed her 
                         because I wanted to believe her. I 
                         believed her because I was afraid to 
                         go to the police -- afraid of the 
                         scandal. You can read about sick 
                         people like me in medical literature. 
                         Here I am. Look at me. I'm 
                         contemptible.

                                     MULVEY
                         Did you arrange the robbery of your 
                         own apartment?

                                     STONEMAN
                         Yes. I even came to that. I was 
                         frightened and I had to wallow in my 
                         own filth.
                              (jumps up)
                         Oh, I'm so glad you came. Prison is 
                         much better than insanity -- and I'm 
                         half mad already.
                              (with a groan)
                         Oh, Stoneman, what have you become?

                                     MULVEY
                         What proof have you that you didn't 
                         kill Dexter?

                                     STONEMAN
                         Proof?
                              (rubs hand over brow)
                         I was someplace else -- Miss Owen -- 
                         my date book -- yes -- a birthday 
                         party -- at the Broughtons.

                                     MULVEY
                         Will you testify in court that Niles 
                         and Dexter did these robberies?

                                     NILES
                              (with a cry)
                         I never did!

                                     MULVEY
                         Shut up.

                                     STONEMAN
                         No, they were the fixers, the smart 
                         ones. They used me one way -- they 
                         hired other men for the actual 
                         robberies.

                                     MULVEY
                         Who?

               Stoneman rubs hand over brow.

                                     STONEMAN
                         I don't know.
                              (to Nurse)
                         Miss Owen -- my practice -- Oh, don't 
                         cry...
                              (groans)
                         You'll call Dr. Grenard.
                              (to Mulvey -- 
                              beseechingly)
                         Only don't let me have to see 
                         anyone... Not my wife... no friends... 
                         no lawyer. Just lock me up and hide 
                         me away.
                              (suddenly stiffens, 
                              looks around)
                         Me? Stoneman?
                              (with a cry)
                         It's impossible. I won't have it.

               Suddenly, with a distorted face, he hurtles himself across 
               the room toward the large window that faces the city.

                                     STONEMAN
                              (continuing)
                         I won't have it!

                                     MULVEY
                         Grab him!

               Perelli and another officer make a lunge for Stoneman, but 
               Niles is closest. Niles leaps for the doctor, tackling him 
               just as the doctor hits the window pane. The glass is 
               shattered, but the doctor -- a pitiful and forlorn figure -- 
               is pulled back into a chair. He puts his head in his hands, 
               sobs brokenly.

                                     MULVEY
                              (quietly)
                         I don't know much about medicine, 
                         doctor -- but I'm pretty sure that's 
                         one prescription never cured anything.
                              (to Niles)
                         Thanks, Niles. And as long as you 
                         finally made up your mind to 
                         cooperate, why not go all the way? 
                         You're not stupid. You're hooked 
                         now, and you know it. So why not 
                         spill the rest?
                              (quiet intensity)
                         Who did the jobs for you? Who was 
                         it?

               There is a strained silence for a moment. Then --

                                     NILES
                         Willie Garza. He and Backalis. They 
                         wanted more of a cut from the 
                         robberies. Garza killed Jean; then 
                         later that night he killed Backalis.
                              (leans forward)
                         I loved Jean. I didn't have anything 
                         to do with it. It was Garza... 
                         Garza... Garza...

               INT. TENEMENT HOUSE - DAY

               Halloran is walking up a flight of stairs. There is the SOUND 
               of someone practicing scales on the violin. He reaches the 
               landing, crosses to a door in the search for a number. As he 
               leaves door we hear a voice from within:

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         You must practice more -- practice --

               Halloran crosses to another door, listens, knocks. A deep, 
               hearty voice answers.

                                     GARZA'S VOICE
                         Come on in!

               Halloran enters.

               INT. GARZA'S APARTMENT - DAY

               A cheaply furnished, two-room apartment. Garza is lying on 
               the floor doing a wrestler's bridge by way of exercise. He 
               is a very muscular man in fine condition. At the moment he 
               is wearing only sneakers and tights. He swivels his head a 
               little to one side to see who has come in, but he doesn't 
               change his position. He has a face that combines toughness 
               and shrewdness; he appears to be about thirty-five.

               Throughout the scene we faintly hear the practicing of violin 
               scales from the other apartment.

                                     GARZA
                              (genially)
                         I thought it was the janitor for the 
                         rent. Who're you? Don't mind me. 
                         Just having a little work-out.

               As Garza says this, he swivels at the neck and turns his 
               body and feet and head over, so that he is face down. His 
               torso and legs have not touched the floor in the course of 
               the stunt.

                                     HALLORAN
                         My name's Hawkey -- I work up at 
                         Bellevue Hospital. Are you Willie 
                         Garza?

                                     GARZA
                         That's me. Ever see me wrestle? I 
                         wasn't so bad.
                              (swivels body over)

                                     HALLORAN
                         No, I never did. There's a patient 
                         at the hospital gave me your address -- 
                         asked me to see you.

                                     GARZA
                         Yeah. Who?

               He works his body up and down, exercising his abdominal 
               muscles.

                                     HALLORAN
                         Backalis his name is.

               Garza seems to pause for a second. Then he swivels over, 
               face down.

                                     GARZA
                         Pete? What's he doin' in the hospital?

                                     HALLORAN
                         He almost got drowned. Fell in the 
                         river when he was plastered. Some 
                         guy on a tug boat fished him out.

                                     GARZA
                         You don't say?
                              (laughs)
                         Oh, that Pete. Can't let the booze 
                         alone. So what does he want from me?
                              (swivels around)

                                     HALLORAN
                         He says he wants to see you.

                                     GARZA
                         You know what he wants?
                              (lowers body to floor)
                         He wants money.

               Now Garza raises legs high, then does a snap up. He lands 
               feet on floor.

                                     GARZA
                              (continuing)
                         Some condition I'm in, hey, brother?
                              (crosses to a chair 
                              for a towel)
                         Don't smoke, don't drink.
                              (rubs body with towel)
                         So Pete wants money again?
                              (shakes head... coming 
                              closer)
                         You know what you can tell him, buddy?

               Now, from several feet away, Garza suddenly leaps like a 
               cat. The heavy Turkish towel goes over Halloran's head. Garza 
               grabs him, trips him, slams him savagely to the floor. In 
               another second his legs have scissored over Halloran's and 
               one hand holds Halloran's arm in a hammer lock.

                                     GARZA
                              (continuing)
                         Lay still or I'll snap your arm like 
                         a wishbone.

               His free hand explores Halloran's pockets, then finds the 
               gun around his hip. He removes gun, presses it into Halloran's 
               ribs. Then he disengages himself, gets up. Halloran slowly 
               rises.

                                     GARZA
                              (continuing)
                         Copper, ain't you?

                                     HALLORAN
                         Yeah.

                                     GARZA
                         Just because I'm big, everybody thinks 
                         I'm dumb. I'm not dumb, I'm smart. 
                         Now how did I know you were a copper? 
                         Because nobody knows where I live -- 
                         not even Pete Backalis.

                                     HALLORAN
                         If you're smart, you'll come down to 
                         headquarters with me.

                                     GARZA
                         Ha-ha -- that wouldn't be smart. You 
                         know why? 'Cause Backalis ain't in 
                         Bellevue, he's in the morgue.
                              (dangerously)
                         Turn around.

                                     HALLORAN
                              (obeying)
                         Don't be a fool.

               From now on CAMERA becomes Halloran's eyes. We see only what 
               Halloran sees -- a stretch of dirty wallpaper and a cheap 
               reproduction of da Vinci's Last Supper thumbtacked to the 
               wall.

                                     GARZA'S VOICE
                         I'll prove I'm smart, copper. You 
                         know how? You're scared right now 
                         I'm gonna rub you out. But I ain't -- 
                         'cause I'm smart. Ain't nobody can 
                         prove I rubbed out Backalis. So why 
                         should I knock you off? Rub out a 
                         cop an' you'll really get the chair. 
                         All I need to do is put you to sleep. 
                         Then I'm off. Try an' find me. This 
                         is a great big, beautiful city. Just 
                         try an' find me.

               There is a grunt from Garza, the sound of a fist striking 
               flesh. The picture of the Last Supper suddenly blurs violently 
               as the CAMERA shakes. Then the CAMERA starts tilting towards 
               the floor.

                                     GARZA'S VOICE
                         That was a rabbit punch, Copper. 
                         It's strictly illegal.

               Again there is the crack of a fist. The screen goes black.

               INT. STONEMAN'S RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

               Mulvey is at the phone. Perelli, Niles, and Dr. Stoneman are 
               on their way out of the office.

                                     MULVEY
                              (into phone)
                         Yeah, he signed it. Wait a minute, 
                         Ben.
                              (to Perelli; calling)
                         Keep Niles away from the newspaper 
                         men.
                              (into phone)
                         And listen, Ben -- when Halloran 
                         calls in -- or Fowler or Constentino --
                         tell 'em that Willie Garza may be 
                         the gimmick in this case. So --
                              (stops talking, 
                              listens; suddenly 
                              snaps up)
                         When did Halloran call in? Was he

               swinging around in middle of street and then racing down 
               Third Avenue with siren screaming. The operator's voice 
               continued.

                                     OPERATOR'S VOICE
                         -- two men -- Detective James Halloran 
                         and William Garza. Halloran is twenty-
                         eight years old...

               INT. GARZA'S ROOM - DAY

               Halloran is stretched out near wall, unconscious. Garza has 
               put on a sport shirt and trousers. He still wears sneakers. 
               The butts of two guns show above his belt, at waist line. He 
               is stuffing four small chamois bags into both side pockets. 
               He grabs up a sports jacket, puts it on. He opens a cupboard 
               drawer, takes out a harmonica, puts it in a side pocket of 
               his jacket. Then he goes out. The instant the door shuts 
               Halloran sits up. The sudden movement makes him gasp with 
               nausea. He remains still a second, then slowly pushes himself 
               to his feet. On wobbly legs he starts for the door.

               INT. STAIRCASE - DAY

               Garza is coming rapidly downstairs.

               INT. GARZA - DAY

               as seen down stairwell by Halloran. Halloran starts down 
               slowly, on shaky legs, holding to banister.

               INT. FIRST-FLOOR LANDING - DAY

               CAMERA IS SHOOTING UP as Garza comes down.

               SOUND: A police siren; a second, a third, approaching. Garza 
               freezes for a second, then races down the last steps to the 
               landing. He runs to the front door, flattens himself against 
               the wall and glances out through the glass.

               EXT. TENEMENT ACROSS FROM GARZA - DAY

               CAMERA IS GARZA'S EYES.

               A black police sedan is moving slowly along. A detective is 
               questioning the two little girls who are playing jacks. One 
               of them points toward Garza's tenement. CAMERA SWINGS to 
               show cops and plainclothesmen leaping out of cars. CAMERA 
               SWINGS other way to show Mulvey and others starting across 
               street at a run.

               INT. HALLWAY - DAY

               Garza turns, starts running toward back of hall. As he does 
               so, he sees Halloran coming down last flight of stairs. Garza 
               pulls out a gun but keeps running. Halloran hurtles down, 
               swings out and around, trips and falls. At the same instant 
               of his falling, Garza has swung around while opening the 
               back door. He fires; the bullet shatters the window of the 
               front door. Garza leaps outside. Halloran gets up, runs 
               towards the back door. The front door swings open. Mulvey 
               rushes in, gun in hand.

                                     MULVEY
                              (yelling)
                         Jimmy!

                                     HALLORAN
                              (without stopping)
                         This way.

               Mulvey runs after him.

               EXT. BACK YARD TENEMENT HOUSE - DAY

               It is a mass of clotheslines, with wet wash hanging from 
               every line. Garza is about to climb the fence at one end, 
               when he spots Halloran in pursuit. He stops and fires another 
               shot. Halloran falls flat on the pavement; then gets up 
               untouched. He follows Garza over the fence. Mulvey appears 
               at Halloran starts over. He changes course, runs out down a 
               side alley.

               EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

               On the other side of the fence is a long alleyway, with ash 
               cans and piles of junk in evidence. Garza runs down the 
               alleyway with Halloran still in pursuit. Garza stops and 
               fires again. Halloran drops behind an ash can as the bullet 
               ricochets off it.

               EXT. END OF ALLEYWAY - DAY

               Garza climbs another fence, finds himself in back of a butcher 
               store. He dashes into the store, with Halloran following a 
               few seconds later.

               INT. BUTCHER STORE - DAY

               as Garza runs through with gun in hand, followed by Halloran. 
               The clerks and customers stare in horror.

               EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUTCHER STORE - DAY

               This is Delancey Street, a business thoroughfare. Across the 
               street stands the approach to the huge Williamsburg Bridge 
               which crosses the East River to Brooklyn. The street is 
               crowded with automobiles. Garza races across. Halloran 
               follows. Coming up behind Halloran is Qualen, the detective 
               we saw earlier at Stoneman's.

               EXT. DELANCEY STREET - DAY

               as Garza disregards traffic and runs across. A truck swerves 
               to escape hitting him. Another car jams on brakes. A third 
               car crashes into the second. A traffic cop blows his whistle 
               furiously. Halloran keeps after Garza. Qualen has caught up 
               with Halloran now. Garza starts up the stone steps to the 
               footwalk on the bridge. Qualen fires, misses. Garza turns, 
               fires. Both Qualen and Halloran hurl themselves to sidewalk. 
               Garza runs. They follow.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               Mulvey, detectives, run up. Traffic is now stationary. Mulvey 
               runs toward cop.

                                     MULVEY
                              (yelling)
                         Hold all bridge traffic.
                              (to a cop)
                         Stop traffic on the Brooklyn end.

               He runs to a radio car which swings into scene. Jumps in.

               EXT. BRIDGE FOOTWALK - DAY

               CAMERA FRAMES the city. Suddenly frame is filled by sweaty, 
               distorted face of Garza as he climbs onto footwalk. He turns 
               violently.

               EXT. QUALEN AND HALLORAN - DAY

               from Garza's angle. Garza fires, Qualen falls back down steps 
               into Halloran's arms, almost hurling Halloran down. Garza 
               turns, runs.

               EXT. ENTRANCE TO MANHATTAN SIDE OF BRIDGE - DAY

               stop traffic.

               EXT. LONG SHOT OF BRIDGE SHOOTING DOWN - DAY

               showing bridge traffic disappearing. CAMERA picks out running 
               men: Garza, Halloran, several cops. Then it picks out the 
               squad car in which Mulvey is. The car races ahead of Garza, 
               then stops. Men tumble out. Garza, seeing himself trapped, 
               breaks for the subway tracks in order to cross to the other 
               side. As he is climbing the fence, one of the squad car 
               policemen stops running, kneels, aims a rifle. He shoots. 
               Garza is hit, knocked over the fence and forward by the impact 
               of the bullet. He staggers, trips over a rail, falls to his 
               knees, slumps over -- and hits the third rail. There is a 
               shower of sparks, his body leaps convulsively -- then is 
               still.

               A siren WAILS, higher and higher. CAMERA TILTS toward 
               buildings of Manhattan, showing sky above. Siren fades out.
