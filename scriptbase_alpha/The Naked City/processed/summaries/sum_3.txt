In New York City, the police investigate the murder of an attractive young woman, Jean Dexter.
Led by Det.
Lt. Dan Muldoon and Det.
Jimmy Halloran, they suspect a suicide but the coroner confirms that it's murder.
Their initial suspect is her boyfriend, Frank Niles.
He's less than honest with them on a number of things but has an alibi.
The police slowly gather evidence and bit by bit, start to paint a picture of what happened.
The solution to the crime centers on identifying jewel thieves who have been robbing the rich.
