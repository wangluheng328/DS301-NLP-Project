</p><p id="dia">The Earth.  From space.  In all its glory, the most perfect, self-regulating organism you could imagine.  We went out there; we turned around; we looked back; we saw it.  You'd think we'd behold and learn something.

</p><p id="dia">We increased by 80 million people a year.  Pumped out our toxins beyond measure.  Destroyed our resources killed forests, trees, plants, animals...Anything that couldn't be trademarked and sold at a profit we annihilated without a thought.  We killed half of what was on the planet.  We didn't care.  Right about the millennium, we got another warning...

As the frogs breathe through their skin and react to toxins in the environment faster, this should have been a warning, canary in the coal mine kind of thing.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHANTILAS (V.O.)

It took us only another 100 to poison and overpopulate the planet so seriously that if we didn't go out and find somewhere else to live, we realized we were gonna die out as a species ourselves in the next two generations.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LOWENTHAL

</p><p id="dia">Proton flux.  MULTIPLE Event Upsets.  Ed, bye.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Santen is out of his seat and heading back as fast as he can.  Gallagher behind him.  ALARMS ring now as he rushes out, the artificial gravity begins to fail.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The crew madly scrambling everywhere.
</p><p></p><p id="act">On the MEV DECK, BUD CHANTILAS, Chief Science Officer (60s, graying) is pulling himself into a spacesuit.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Emerging onto the MEV deck, looking absolutely calm, COOPER BURCHENAL (40s, weathered, unconcerned) stops at an intercom station, presses a toggle - 
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL

</p><p></p><p id="act">6 High G couches are faceted about the interior walls, crew names stenciled on them.  (Bowman's remains conspicuously empty.)  Santen straps himself in.  Chantilas, Burchenal, Pettengill, and Gallagher stream aboard.  Start cinching themselves in as - 
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Kate continues to try to shut the ship down.  Some circuits do, others flicker/free flow and refuse to stop.  One particular circuit will clear, but only as long as she holds it shut manually - MEV Launch Release.  Only takes her a moment to decide.  She's not happy, but tries not to let her concern show as -
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOWMAN
</p><p id="dia">Gentlemen, it seems I will not be able to join you and will maintain the manual release for the MEV from the Flight Deck.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SANTEN
</p><p id="dia">We are green across the board.

</p><p></p><p id="act">...and join hundreds of journalists in the audience.  Lights dim.  In front, face lit from below at a podium, Senior Scientist HAROLD ERNEST, 60s, head of the Space Exploration Office.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ERNEST
</p><p id="dia">As many of you may know, in 2032 the Space Exploration Office began a series of unmanned flights to Mars.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The entire wall behind him, 40 feet by 100 feet, is a vid screen.  As he speaks the images appear.  Not as if he's narrating to the footage, but as if it's voice activated.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ERNEST
</p><p id="dia">It had been determined by 2020 that Mars harbored no life.  Although beginning with the same resources as Earth four billion years ago, Mars didn't support any life beyond the microbial stage in the last 300 million years.  Nor did it have an atmosphere or climate supportive of human life.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Exactly as he describes it, it occurs.  (Icecaps melt, temperature gradients rise, etc.).  In the audience are hundreds of journalists watching.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ERNEST
</p><p id="dia">It was, however, concluded that Mars was receptive to terraforming.  If we could raise the temperature of the planet by only four degrees, the resultant melting of the ice caps would increase the density of the atmosphere, thus holding greater heat, melting the icecaps further.  We could use the greenhouse effect to our benefit.  To do this, we needed to increase the oxygen content of the atmosphere.  Resultingly, a series of probes were sent, each releasing further and further genetically manipulated lichen and algaes designed to stand the rigors of the Martian environment while augmenting the oxygen content of the Martian atmosphere.  In the last 28 years, we have sent 2200 probes.  The terraforming was initially successful.
</p><p></p><p id="act">We see the probes launching and bursting in aerosol deployments over the Martian surface.  Algae blooms.  Red, orange, green, black, burnt sienna.  Every color you can imagine.  Valleys covered with color.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ERNEST
</p><p id="dia">The average temperature on Mars has increased two and a half degrees over the last three decades.  The oxygen content began to increase as well.  And then eleven months ago, the O2 on Mars suddenly began to decline.  Soon after, all the remote sensors on the planet ceased functioning.  We have no idea what's gone wrong.  We need to know why.  Man's very destiny may lie in the answer.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The color on Mars ebbs away.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ERNEST
</p><p id="dia">We are about to embark on the greatest mission of human exploration.  By using a number of Heavy Lift Launch Vehicles and a modified close lunar cargo ship, we have created a vessel capable of journeying to Mars.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SANTEN
</p><p id="dia">Somewhere downrange.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Santen pulls his HHC out of a pocket on his thigh.  2050 descendant of a laptop.  Mutters at it.  It whizzes past all Hab info
</p><p id="dia">schematics, the standard 360 degree pan from the landing site, topo map of Mars.  Zooms in to show where the Hab was deployed.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SANTEN
</p><p id="dia">Based on the last uncorrupted nav state, and given that we were in a full manual descent with no computer correction, I'd say...in this 60x120 mile ellipse.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Okay.  That's big.  There's a long moment of resignation.  It's a little irrational, but then, re the HHC -
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">We've got every other mission variable in here, we ought to be able to figure aerobrake friction and the speed and orbit of the Ares when we exited.  We should be able to close in on the downrange variables.  Tighten up the ellipse.  It's about the math.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher can't believe it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">This is it.  This is that moment they told us about in high school.  Where one day again we'd use algebra.  And it would save our lives.  And I thought they were fucking kidding.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher turns in frustration and walks away.  Chantilas calls to him - 
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHANTILAS
</p><p id="dia">Stay in range.  A thousand yards.  And your radio's line of sight.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Right, I wouldn't want to get lost.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He continues to wander off.  We can hear them discussing drag coefficients and whatnot.  It just makes him ill.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher stares out at the Martian plain.  It would be kinda cool.  Except for the fact he's gonna die here.  He's pissed and frightened.  Yanks his HHC out.  Mutters, images appear.  All the Hab details.  Stares at the map and then the 360 degree panorama.  Back at the map.  Back at the panorama.  Something about it strikes him.  Looks at it some more.  He gets up, looks around.  Looks around some more.  Heads back to the guys...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">I don't think it's about math.  I don't like math, so I'm biased.  I think it's about the picture.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He holds out the picture of the panorama.  Santen dismisses him - he's not a scientist, he's not a pilot, he should leave them alone.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SANTEN
</p><p id="dia">We're not in that picture.  If we were, we'd know where the Hab was.  We're trying to figure this out.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Robby ignores him, tosses a rock in the sand, wraps the the 360 degree panorama around it.  Screen bends and turns translucent as he does.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Look, say that's the lander.  At about 30 degrees in the distance, it sees this mountain with the funny top.  And at about 180 degrees it sees this funny set of twin peaks.  (points) 
</p><p id="dia">Now I see this mountain over there.  And these peaks over there behind me almost on a straight line.  And then there's this other peak maybe, which would put us on the line, say here.  Which leaves the angle to the Hab at about there...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Santen and Chantilas start to manipulate their HHCs faster than you can follow.  Muttering to them, hand-gesturing, cross-referencing back and forth to the map, as the ellipse shrinks and their landing location is...determined.

</p><p></p><p id="act">There's no up here, equipment is attached to the floor, ceiling and walls.  Santen and Bowman are on a large spinning bicycle-driven centrifuge.  Santen's pedaling.  By keeping up the speed, he's able to provide enough extra gravity for Bowman, on the other side, to lift free-weights.  They're both dripping sweat so it must work.  TIMER goes off, they slow to a stop.  Pettengill comes in.  He looks a bit uncomfortable.  Certainly out of his element.  A little, well, puny.

</p><p></p><p id="act">They lift him to the other side of the rock.  Gallagher stays with Chantilas a moment.  Stricken, speechless.  Inside Gallagher's helmet, we can see as the tears roll down.  Then -

</p><p id="dia">It's okay.  I'm not sorry I came.

We HOLD ON  Santen a moment and...Pettengill has picked up what would be a 250-pound rock back on Earth and is heaving it with all his might into Santen from behind.  It slams into him, bending him in half, knocking his feet out from under him.
</p><p></p><p id="act">For half-a-moment we think Santen might regain his footing.  But he doesn't.  He starts to fall past the edge of the cliff.  Slowly.  In .38 grav SLOW MOTION.  Flailing.

Science doesn't want to accept that.  We live in a moral world and have moral knowledge that tells us that love and truth are better than hatred and lies.

It's like if I stacked up a bunch of rocks in the right order and they become a dog.  I do that.  I chose when, I chose where, I chose how many fingers.   I just don't hold with mystical explanations for science, with organized religion, buildings with different symbols on 'em.  You spot God, you lemme know.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOWMAN

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">There's two of us.  And we can stop him from singing.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Pettengill considers.  Then sings along instead.  They only know the one line.  It's really annoying.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">What is that?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">I have no idea.  It's old, though.  It's classic music.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">Never mind.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Sing the one about the dogs again.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">It's about cows.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Then why does it say doggies?
</p><p></p><p id="act">All this time, they've been walking across a landscape pigmented with color - steel blue, alizarin crimson, malachite green - the algae varietals everywhere.  And then off to the left, the algae stops.  Erased, like it was never there, extirpated in a long crooked line.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PETTENGILL
</p><p id="dia">What the fuck?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, what the fuck?  You said doggies.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Then he sees as well.  They all see.  Can't help themselves.  They're drawn towards it.  Gallagher and Burchenal check their course in  the distance before veering off.  Pettengill is already heading towards it.
</p><p></p><p id="act">It's maybe 100 yards away.  At 50, something indistinct can be seen.  Sort of.  It's like the line, and the surrounding terrain is out of focus, blurry.  At 30, the blurriness comes into focus.  It's alive.  It moves slightly.  You can see through it.  At ten, you can see it undulating.  Slowly, TOWARDS us.  Erasing the algae, the color slowly spreading outwards behind and diffusing.  And then we can see...
</p><p></p><p id="act">A billion, a hundred billion...nematodes.  Little tiny translucent worms.  Eating the algae.  Slowly, irrevocably.  Advancing.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Pettengill pulls out his entrenching tool.  Carefully separates one out.  Lifts it up to the light to see.  Maybe three inches long, skinnier than an earthworm.  One end lifts in the air, a tri-part mouth with little crystalline teeth opening and closing, searching for something to eat.
</p><p></p><p id="act">It's fucking scary.  It gets worse when you realize how many of them there are.  The line's moved three or four inches closer as they stand there.  They take a step back.  No one can really speak yet.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">What...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PETTENGILL
</p><p id="dia">It's a nematode.   Or something like one.  It's probably this skinny so it defrosts each morning when the sun hits them.  Or they'r enot water-based at all.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Is it something we sent up by accident with the probes?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PETTENGILL
</p><p id="dia">No.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">I thought we said there wasn't any life on this planet.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PETTENGILL
</p><p id="dia">We did.  We were wrong.  Maybe there wasn't when we checked.  I don't know.  It's not from Earth.

</p><p id="dia">And it's not from here.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">This can't be.  This can't be.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Burchenal actually seems kind of upset about it.  Gallagher looks at him.  Say what?  Burch is upset.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">It can't be here.  You don't understand.  The odds of there being any other life in the universe are infinitesimally small.  The odds that it could survive on something other than its home planet are equally astronomical.  The odds that it could travel to another solar system, let alone one where life already existed are...impossible.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">But it's here.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">Yeah.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Burchenal seems almost unhappy about this.  It rocks his world.  In a bad way.  Gallagher turns to Pettengill happily and untroubled....
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Well, it looks like we're not alone in the universe.  You just discovered life on another planet, pal.
</p><p></p><p id="act">It takes a moment for this to sink in.  Then something hits Robby.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Made by God.  That's what's stamped on the bottom.  That's what Bud would have said.  He woulda loved this.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher gets down on one knee and looks at them.  They're kinda horrible, but as he turns to Pettengill -
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">You know what this means?  You're gonna be more famous than Darwin.  They're gonna name buildings after you.  Spacecrafts, cities on Mars...
</p><p></p><p id="act">The enormity of how badly Pettengill has screwed up - that in the space of one day, he's committed murder and discovered life on another planet - begins to dawn on him.  He doesn't handle it well.  He's fucked up like few people can imagine.  He tries to reset, it doesn't work.  The worm twists about, starts to eat the metal right off the entrenching tool.  He flicks it back to its relatives.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PETTENGILL
</p><p id="dia">Right.  Right.  Motherfuck.  Motherfuck.
</p><p></p><p id="act">And then he says something really odd -
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PETTENGILL
</p><p id="dia">Name them after Santen.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">You hated Santen.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PETTENGILL
</p><p id="dia">Yeah.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He storms away.  They're both confused by this.  Pettengill finds a rock, sits down behind it.  He's obscured except for his head and shoulders.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PETTENGILL
</p><p id="dia">I need a minute or two.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">You wanna tell Houston?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PETTENGILL

</p><p></p><p id="act">They all disregard that last bit.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">Oh yeah.  They're here.  What did you think this was, hypoxia?
</p><p></p><p id="act">They did.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. MARS SURFACE - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Conversation's over.  Gallagher walks towards the rock -
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">We should get outta here.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Pettengill doesn't respond.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">Really.  We should get going...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher walks over.  We hear a familiar WHINE.  Don't recognize what it is at first.  Until Gallagher around the rock and sees...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Pettengill's flicked on the WHIZZING CUTTING EDGE of the entrenching TOOL.  Shreds his left wrist.  Lifts it and rips through his carotid arteries.  All but cuts off his head as he falls to the ground.  Suit's awash with BLOOD.  Overflowing onto the ground and him.  BURBLING in spurts.  Some hits the worms.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p id="dia">Jesus...Jesus God...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Burchenal's joined him.  There's nothing they could do.  Only watch in shock.  It gets worse.  The worms come.  Pulsating and undulating towards Pettengill.  As if some secret message the food is here has spread through the billions of them in burst of knowledge.
</p><p></p><p id="act">A diaphanous, hungry wave crests onto Pettengill and engulfs him.  He's covered in translucence as they devour him.  Gallagher and Burchenal stagger backwards in horror as a red aureole grows around him as he's eaten.  Color spreads out around him in a perfect ever-growing circle.  It's a feast.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDE
</p><p></p><p id="act">The two of them walk along.  Can't tell if they're hurrying towards something or away.  They've both figured out what's up.  A beat, then -

</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher and Burchenal can see the darkness approaching.  Digging madly.   Cackling.  Losing their minds.  Can't tell who is who as they're silhouetted against the sun, one now inside the hillock throwing rock back as the other clears.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The sun continues to drop.  Terminus continues its pernicious HISSING and freezing approach.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Halfway inside now.  On his knees, suit light on, Gallagher chops away at the rock.  When he's thigh-deep in debris, he backs out, dragging the leavings with him.  Burchenal leaps in, replacing him.  Dripping in sweat, nutty, but at least they're doing something.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The last of the sun disappears.  Their breath is in the air.  The darkness and frost reaches them now.  The sweat begins to freeze, ice in their hair and eyebrows and stubble.

He calls for it to change to a horizon projection.  The machine freezes, computes.  Brings up a horizon.  It matches what Robby sees.  And highlights a star sitting just above the horizon that will lead them on their way.  Canis Minor.  They start to run...

</p><p></p><p id="act">Up and over the next long, long gradient.  They lose the star over this false horizon as they climb.  There's something odd, however.  A faint broad wash of light coming over the lip.  They crest the rise to reveal - 
</p><p></p><p id="act">VALLEY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Completely covered in phosphorescent algae.  Pale green and glowing.  A mile across, a mile wide.  If they weren't rushing for their lives, it would be worth stopping to stare.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Across the vale Canis Minor sits directly in the center of a small mountain pass.  They're about to dash onward when something - intuition, it's hard to say what - hits Burchenal.

</p><p id="dia">Stop.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">What?

</p><p></p><p id="act">The algae glows.  Otherworldly.  And then movement.  In the f.g. a worm, green, glowing and filled with algae, slithers through.  And then another.  And another, indistinguishable from the plants around them they've imbibed.
</p><p></p><p id="act">And then as Burchenal plays his light out across the valley we realize it's entirely full of worms.  Gallagher takes an appalled step back.  They're fucked.

</p><p id="dia">Yeah.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Perhaps Gallagher ought to give this more thought.  But he doesn't.  Maybe it's the exhaustion.  Maybe it just never would have occurred to him.  Burchenal disapears into the darkness and the distance.  Gallagher waits.  Then -

</p><p id="dia">You ready?

</p><p id="dia">Yeah.

</p><p id="dia">Good.  Lemme know when it starts to clear.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher doesn't get it.  But a moment later, a shiver runs through the worms.  And they start to undulate away.  Towards Burchenal.  Pulsing faster and faster until it's clear in a moment or two, like a giant amoebae withdrawing, he will have clear access to the pass.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BURCHENAL
</p><p></p><p id="act">at the far end, is five hundred yards into the worms.  They know.  They've told each other.  And they're coming in pulsating waves.  Towards him.  At the epicenter.  He gags.  And hears -

</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher turns.  He can see now what Burchenal has done.  A tiny glowing figure can be seen 1000 yards away.  Gallagher's speechless at first...

As Robby flees, we PULL BACK, FURTHER and FURTHER until he's just a tiny figure in the landscape - until we are AT what was Burchenal.  The frenzy is all but over.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The phosphorescence is gone in the center of the circle.  The edges are the color of his suit.  Then blood red for forty yards.  Bits of bone white.  And then right in the dead center, as we watch; gray, spreading, spreading as what was once Burchenal's brain is food for worms.

</p><p></p><p id="act">And then...he shakes himself out of it.  Just feels foolish he's let himself go this far.  Gets up.  Done with feeling sorry for himself.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Well, this can't get any worse.  I guess.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Grabs himself to stay warm.  Hops up and down.  On one of the hops he ends up facing the direction he came from.  There's something green and phosphorescent coming over the ridge.  They've tracked him.  Footprint by footprint.

</p><p></p><p id="act">They don't really respond.  Except the ones in the front who rear up, and seem to listen or sniff for him.  And gnash their little crystalline teeth.  They split now to come at him from two sides.  Gallagher gets caught in a dry-heave.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Oh, man...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Sees the bucket of rocket fuel.  Lot closer to them than it is to him.  Gathers his nerve, runs, grabs the bucket.  Drags it twenty feet back.  Then tilts it, carefully pouring it out in a ring around himself and the Cosmos.  Worms closing in as he goes.  Leads a fuse of fuel back towards him.  Lights it.
</p><p></p><p id="act">It burns low and yellow in the oxygen-depleted atmosphere.  Doesn't look like much.  Certainly not a defence.  First worm gets near it.  Unsure.  Bewildered.  Pulls back.  But his compatriots are behind him, still coming.  No choice.  He advances.  And...POOF.  VAPORIZES in burst of red-orange as he touches the flame.
</p><p></p><p id="act">And the next...And the next.  Like little sparks.  Gallagher watches, puzzled by this...And then it hits.  Right as the ring of flame is about to die out.  The main wave touches the ring of fire.  And...they do burn.  And SCREAM.  Little WORM SCREAMS that multiplied by tens and hundreds of thousands begin to pierce the air.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">That's for eating the Hab!  And killing Cooper, you slimy worm fuckers!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rolling waves of flame.  Half plasma.  Flying blobs of burning worms rain down like napalm.  One lands on and torches the cobbled-together radio.  It's so damn hot for a moment Gallagher panics, thinking everything might explode.  Then it drops to embers and the wave burns over the hill like a wild fire.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher does a dance of triumph.  However short-lived.  Then it hits him -
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">How do you burn like that without oxygen??
</p><p></p><p id="act">There's a BLAST of flame from the far side of the ridge that rattles rocks and Cosmos.  Knocks him to the ground.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Holy shit...Holy shit!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher stares with wonder over the hill.  He figured it out.  There's a couple of dozen worms, unburnt and thrown free.  He picks one up, looks at it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">No!!  Not after all this.  No!!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">It ain't gonna work ever again.  All the shouting isn't gonna make a difference.  He knows the answer, he knows how to save the species and there's no one he can tell.

</p><p></p><p id="act">AMEE'S POV
</p><p></p><p id="act">The Cosmos down below.  And beneath it, his feet sticking out as he works on something, Gallagher.  He messed with her once; she recognizes him.  If she could bare her teeth like an angry dog, she would.  AMEE considers for a moment.  Makes her move.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. COSMOS SITE - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">She comes down the hill.  Twelve, sixteen, twenty-foot strides.  Doing forty or fifty miles an hour easy.  And all but silently.  Gallagher hasn't yet responded.  And then she's all the way to him.  She rears up to strike and -
</p><p></p><p id="act">And Gallagher, in his skivvies, bursts up from where he's buried himself in the sand, avenging, entrenching tool high over his head, already swinging as AMEE wheels back around and...He chops off both her eyes.  Sidesteps as she rushes him blindly and backhands her in her electronic Marine cranium from behind.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Whatever he's hit, the jolt stiffens his arm, throws him off.  The tool stays embedded.  She runs headlong into the Cosmos.  Smashes, stumbles, falls.  And before she can get back up to her feet...He wraps the sleeve of his shirt around his hand, rescues the entrenching tool and deals a death stroke to the silver arachnid.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Robust real-time response to the environment, my butt.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher grabs his satchel of tools and begins to unbolt her as fast as he can.  Checks his watch.  Whatever he's racing, there's only minutes to go.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Deep within the electronic entrails of AMEE, he dredges up her Esource.  Size of a soda can.  POWER CELL that runs her for year and a half.  HUMS as he removes it from its shielded container.  It's 280 volts.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Work.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He rips open a panel on the Cosmos, yanks out the dead cell and hooks the new one in.  It doesn't fit.  He's got nothing left but a couple of wrenches and a tube of epoxy.  Glues it in place.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Runs the launch Diagnostics on his HCC.  It flickers, goes to yellow, flashes on and off to green.  He yanks back on his suit.  Grabs a handful of the uncharred worms and seals them in the container that held the Esource.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Stuffs it in a side pocket.  Looks at the top of SRV.  Wedges himself under some cables and wiring on the top.

</p><p id="dia">We can get 'em back.  Slowly.  Fifty extra days.  And we're not going to be able to support food and and air for two people.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Russert nods.  Motions to Skavlem.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bowman and Gallagher listen as -
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SKAVLEM (V.O.)
</p><p id="dia">...that travel has been increased by approximate two months.  Concern is that available life support is untenable for duration and current crew strength.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gallagher's unimpressed.  Worms tried to eat him, robots tried to kill him and they're worried about this?  Feh.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Scientists.  Scientists sent us here.  Scientists figured the whole thing out with Mars.  I hate to bring this up, but they got us into this whole mess in the first place.  Hell, they shouldn't be allowed to drive 'cause they miss the turnoff as they consider the ramifications of the internal combustion engine.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He picks up the mike.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Hey, guys.  How 'bout we come about halfway home and you send a ship with air and food and stuff to meet us?  In the middle.  And we don't have to get all the way back.  Huh?
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. MISSION CONTROL - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Schlissel nods.  That'd work.  As Russert, Lowenthal and the big guys start to talk this over, Borokovski motions to Schlissel and his new friend the Tech.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOROKOVSKI
</p><p id="dia">I know where there is a rocket in Uzbeckistan.  For cheap.  A friend of mine has kept it.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. ARES - FLIGHT DECK - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">OUT the window, Mars drifts by in the view port.  Bowman looks at it kinda sadly.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOWMAN
</p><p id="dia">So much for saving humankind and living on Mars.  I guess the worms took care of that.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">The worms are not our enemy.  They're our friends.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He's pulled the container out of his pocket.  Unscrews it to show her the little slimy monsters.  She recoils in horror.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOWMAN
</p><p id="dia">You brought them back?  Are you insane??
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">It's okay, I'm pretty sure they don't like titanium. 
</p><p id="spkdir">(then) 
</p><p id="dia">We're gonna live.  On Mars.  Hell, maybe even back on Earth. Maybe anywhere we want.  And the reason we're gonna live, is the damn worms.  Yeah, they ate all the algae, and damn near everything else, but they store and excrete oxygen.
</p><p></p><p id="act">She finds this hard to believe.  But he explains.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">That's why we could breathe.  You should have seen these suckers burn when they went up.  I had some time to think about this.  I was in orbit for six minutes before you found me.  I shoulda been dead.  But the air locked in the suit was almost pure O2.  'Cause of the worms.  We didn't just find a new place to live on, we may have saved our old one.  Toxic waste, they'll eat it.  Poisonous landfills, they'll eat it.
</p><p></p><p id="act">She's still trying to absorb all this.  It's been a long couple of days.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">God's got a sense of humor.  He's giving us another chance.  If we can all get along this time.  Burchenal knew somewhere that it wasn't the science, it was about having something to believe in.  Bud always knew.  Wonders of the deep.  We just had to go to Mars to remind ourselves of what we should have been able to see back on Earth.  It's not all about us.  We can't kill everything and survive.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bowman looks back at Mars.  Astounded.  Believes.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOWMAN
</p><p id="dia">You wanna tell them back on Earth the species is saved and we're gonna live?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">How should I know, I'm the janitor.  
</p><p id="spkdir">(then)
</p><p id="dia">Look, Commander...I just fought off half a million screaming nematodes, and a killer robot and glued myself onto a rocket to get offa Mars, and I was wondering...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOWMAN
</p><p id="dia">If you could kiss me?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Yeah.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOWMAN
</p><p id="dia">Yeah.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He does.  She kisses him back.  They continue for a long damn time.  Finally, they break apart and...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BOWMAN
</p><p id="dia">It's an extra fifty days back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GALLAGHER
</p><p id="dia">Gee, wonder what we'll find to do with ourselves.
</p><p></p><p id="act">As she starts to laugh...
</p><p></p><p id="right">FADE OUT.
</p><p></p><p id="act">THE END
