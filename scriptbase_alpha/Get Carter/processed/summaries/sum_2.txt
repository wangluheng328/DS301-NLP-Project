London mobster Jack Carter returns to his home turf in Newcastle to attend his brother Frank's funeral.
His bosses in London aren't too keen on the trip fearing that Carter may cause trouble with local mobsters there.
Carter doesn't believe for one minute that his brother died accidentally and is certain it was murder.
He does his best to avoid the two London mobsters who've been sent to bring him back.
Cyrill Kinnear points him in the direction of Cliff Brumby but Brumby claims that Kinnear is responsible for Frank's death but doesn't know why.
It all falls into place when Carter recognizes a woman in a porno film.
