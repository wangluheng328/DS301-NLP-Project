</b>
<b>               IN BLACK AND WHITE:
</b>
               TRAIN WHEELS grinding against track, slowing. FOLDING TABLE 
               LEGS scissoring open. The LEVER of a train door being pulled. 
               NAMES on lists on clipboards held by clerks moving alongside 
               the tracks.

<b>                                     CLERKS (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Rossen... Lieberman... Wachsberg...

               BEWILDERED RURAL FACES coming down off the passenger train.

               FORMS being set out on the folding tables. HANDS straightening 
               pens and pencils and ink pads and stamps.

<b>                                     CLERKS (V.O.)
</b>                         ...When your name is called go over

               TYPEWRITER KEYS rapping a name onto a list. A FACE. KEYS 
               typing another name. Another FACE.

<b>                                     CLERKS (V.O.)

                         over there... you, come over here...

               A MAN is taken from one long line and led to the back of 
               another. A HAND hammers a rubber stamp at a form. Tight on a 
               FACE. KEYS type another NAME. Another FACE. Another NAME.

<b>                                     CLERKS (V.O.)
</b>                         ...Biberman... Steinberg... 
                         Chilowitz...

               As a hand comes down stamping a GRAY STRIPE across a 
               registration card, there is absolute silence... then MUSIC, 
               the Hungarian love song, "Gloomy Sunday," distant... and the 
               stripe bleeds into COLOR, into BRIGHT YELLOW INK.

<b>               INT. HOTEL ROOM - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHT
</b>
               The song plays from a radio on a rust-stained sink.

               The light in the room is dismal, the furniture cheap. The 
               curtains are faded, the wallpaper peeling... but the clothes 
               laid out across the single bed are beautiful.

               The hands of a man button the shirt, belt the slacks. He 
               slips into the double-breasted jacket, knots the silk tie, 
               folds a handkerchief and tucks it into the jacket pocket, 
               all with great deliberation.

               A bureau. Some currency, cigarettes, liquor, passport. And 
               an elaborate gold-on-black enamel Hakenkreuz (or swastika) 
               which the gentleman pins to the lapel of his elegant dinner 
               jacket.

               He steps back to consider his reflection in the mirror. He 
               likes what he sees: Oskar Schindler -- salesman from Zwittau -- 
               looking almost reputable in his one nice suit.

               Even in this awful room.

<b>               INT. NIGHTCLUB - CRACOW, POLAND - NIGHT
</b>
               A spotlight slicing across a crowded smoke-choked club to a 
               small stage where a cabaret performer sings.

               It’s September, 1939. General Sigmund List's armored 
               divisions, driving north from the Sudetenland, have taken 
               Cracow, and now, in this club, drinking, socializing, 
               conducting business, is a strange clientele: SS officers and 
               Polish cops, gangsters and girls and entrepreneurs, thrown 
               together by the circumstance of war.

               Oskar Schindler, drinking alone, slowly scans the room, the 
               faces, stripping away all that’s unimportant to him, settling 
               only on details that are: the rank of this man, the higher 
               rank of that one, money being slipped into a hand.

<b>               WAITER SETS DOWN DRINKS
</b>
               in front of the SS officer who took the money. A lieutenant, 
               he’s at a table with his girlfriend and a lower-ranking 
               officer.

<b>                                     WAITER
</b>                         From the gentleman.

               The waiter is gesturing to a table across the room where 
               Schindler, seemingly unaware of the SS men, drinks with the 
               best-looking woman in the place.

<b>                                     LIEUTENANT
</b>                         Do I know him?

               His sergeant doesn’t. His girlfriend doesn't.

<b>                                     LIEUTENANT
</b>                         Find out who he is.

               The sergeant makes his way over to Schindler's table.

               There's a handshake and introductions before -- and the 
               lieutenant, watching, can't believe it -- his guy accepts 
               the chair Schindler's dragging over.

               The lieutenant waits, but his man doesn't come back; he's 
               forgotten already he went there for a reason. Finally, and 
               it irritates the SS man, he has to get up and go over there.

<b>                                     LIEUTENANT
</b>                         Stay here.

               His girlfriend watches him cross toward Schindler's table.

               Before he even arrives, Schindler is up and berating him for 
               leaving his date way over there across the room, waving at 
               the girl to come join them, motioning to waiter to slide 
               some tables together.

<b>               WAITERS ARRIVE WITH PLATES OF CAVIAR
</b>
               and another round of drinks. The lieutenant makes a 
               halfhearted move for his wallet.

<b>                                     LIEUTENANT
</b>                         Let me get this one.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         No, put it away, put it away.

               Schindler's already got his money out. Even as he's paying, 
               his eyes are working the room, settling on a table where a 
               girl is declining the advances of two more high-ranking SS 
               men.

<b>               A TABLECLOTH BILLOWS
</b>
               as a waiter lays it down on another table that's been added 
               to the others. Schindler seats the SS officers on either 
               side of his own "date" --

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         What are you drinking, gin?

               He motions to a waiter to refill the men's drinks, and, 
               returning to the head of the table(s), sweeps the room again 
               with his eyes.

<b>               ROAR OF LAUGHTER
</b>
               erupts from Schindler's party in the corner. Nobody's having 
               a better time than those people over there. His guests have 
               swelled to ten or twelve -- SS men, Polish cops, girls -- 
               and he moves among them like the great entertainer he is, 
               making sure everybody's got enough to eat and drink.

               Here, closer, at this table across the room, an SS officer 
               gestures to one of the SS men who an hour ago couldn't get 
               the girl to sit at his table. The guy comes over.

<b>                                     SS OFFICER 1
</b>                         Who is that?

<b>                                     SS OFFICER 2
</b>                              (like everyone knows)
                         That's Oskar Schindler. He's an old 
                         friend of... I don't know, somebody's.

<b>               GIRL WITH A BIG CAMERA
</b>
               screws in a flashbulb. She lifts the unwieldy thing to her 
               face and focuses.

               As the bulb flashes, the noise of the club suddenly drops 
               out, and the moment is caught in BLACK and WHITE: Oskar 
               Schindler, surrounded by his many new friends, smiling 
               urbanely.

               A photograph of a face on a work card, BLACK and WHITE. A 
               typed name, black and white. A hand affixes a sticker to the 
               card and it saturates with COLOR, DEEP BLUE.

               People in long lines, waiting. Others near idling trucks, 
               waiting. Others against sides of buildings, waiting. Clerks 
               with clipboards move through the crowds, calling out names.

               The party pin in his lapel catches the light in the hallway.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Stern?

               Behind Schindler, the door to another apartment closes softly. 
               A radio, somewhere, is suddenly silenced.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Are you Itzhak Stern?

               At the door of this apartment, a man with the face and manner 
               of a Talmudic scholar, finally nods in resignation, like his 
               number has just come up.

<b>                                     STERN
</b>                         I am.

               Schindler offers a hand. Confused, Stern tentatively reaches 
               for it, and finds his own grasped firmly.

<b>               INT. STERN'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
               Settled into an overstuffed chair in a simple apartment, 
               Schindler pours a shot of cognac from a flask.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         There's a company you did the books 
                         for on Lipowa Street, made what, 
                         pots and pans?

               Stern stares at the cognac Schindler's offering him. He 
               doesn't know who this man is, or what he wants.

                         a Jew.

               Schindler looks puzzled, then shrugs, dismissing it.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         All right, you've done it -- good 
                         company, you think?

               He keeps holding out the drink. Stern declines it with a 
               slow shake of his head.

<b>                                     STERN

               Schindler nods, takes out a cigarette case.

                         enamelware, do you?

               He offers Stern a cigarette. Stern declines again.

                         whatever you do, you could make other 
                         things, couldn't you?

               Schindler lowers his voice as if there could possibly be 
               someone else listening in somewhere.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Field kits, mess kits...

               He waits for a reaction, and misinterprets Stern's silence 
               for a lack of understanding.

               But Stern does understand. He understands too well.

               Schindler grins good-naturedly.

                         other priorities.

               Schindler tries for a moment to imagine what they could 
               possibly be. He can't.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Like what?

               Stern smiles despite himself. The man's manner is so simple, 
               so in contrast to his own and the complexities of being a 
               Jew in occupied Cracow in 1939. He really doesn't know. Stern 
               decides to end the conversation.

                         get the better you'll do. It was a

                         Finding the money to buy the company, 
                         that's hard.

               He laughs loudly, uproariously. But then, just as abruptly 
               as the laugh erupted, he's dead serious, all kidding aside --

               Stern stares at him curiously, sitting there taking another 
               sip of his cognac, placid as a large dog.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

               He shrugs; it sounds more than fair to him. But not to Stern.

               with a salesman's pitch; just dressed better than most.

               Under lights, a crew of brick-layers is erecting a ten-foot 
               wall where a street once ran unimpeded.

<b>               EXT. STREET - CRACOW - DAY

               A young man emerges from an alley pocketing his Jewish 
               armband. He crosses a street past German soldiers and trucks 
               and climbs the steps of St. Mary's cathedral.

<b>               INT. ST. MARY'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

               A dark and cavernous place. A priest performing Mass to 
               scattered parishioners. Lots of empty pews.

               The young Polish Jew from the street, Poldek Pfefferberg, 
               kneels, crosses himself, and slides in next to another young 
               man, Goldberg, going over notes scribbled on a little pad 
               inside a missal. Pfefferberg shows him a container of shoe 
               polish he takes from his pocket. Whispered, bored --

               Goldberg doesn't bother; he pockets his little notepad and 
               intones a response to the priest's prayer, all but ignoring 
               Pfefferberg.

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG

                         I'm going to tell them.

               Goldberg glances to Pfefferberg for the first time, and, 
               greatly put upon, takes out his little notepad again and 
               makes a notation in it.

               He flips the pad closed, pockets it, crosses himself as he 
               gets up, and leaves.

               Pfefferberg at the front desk of a sleepy hotel with another 
               black market middleman, the desk clerk. Both are wearing 
               their armbands. Pfefferberg underlines figures on a little 
               notepad of his own --

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG
</b>                         Let's say this is what you give me. 
                         These are fees I have to pay some 
                         guys. This is my commission. This is 
                         what I bring you back in Occupation 
                         currency.

               The clerk, satisfied with the figures, is about to hand over 
               to Pfefferberg some outlawed Polish notes from an envelope 
               when Schindler comes in from the street. The clerk puts the 
               money away, gets Schindler his room key, waits for him to 
               leave so he can finish his business with Pfefferberg... but 
               Schindler doesn't leave; he just keeps looking over at 
               Pfefferberg's shirt, at the cuffs, the collar.

               Pfefferberg nods, Yeah, thanks, and waits for Schindler to 
               leave; but he doesn't. Nor does he appear to hear the short 
               burst of muffled gunfire that erupts from somewhere up the 
               street.

                         shirt like that.

               Pfefferberg knows he should say 'no,' let that be the end of 
               it. It's not wise doing business with a German who could 
               have you arrested for no reason whatsoever. But there's 
               something guileless about it.

               The clerk tries to discourage Pfefferberg from pursuing this 
               transaction with just a look. Pfefferberg ignores it.

               The clerk tries to tell Pfefferberg again with a look that 
               this isn't smart.

                         a good color. Dark blues, grays.

               Schindler takes out his money and begins peeling off bills, 
               waiting for Pfefferberg to nod when it's enough. He's being 
               overcharged, and he knows it, but Pfefferberg keeps pushing 
               it, more. The look Schindler gives him lets him know that 
               he's trying to hustle a hustler, but that, in this instance 
               at least, he'll let it go. He hands over the money and 
               Pfefferberg hands over his notepad.

               As he writes down the information, Pfefferberg glances to 
               the desk clerk and offers a shrug. As he writes --

               Schindler, too, nice blue shirt, jacket, only he doesn't 
               seem to be paying attention; rather his attention and 
               affections are directed to the blonde next to him, Ingrid.

                         have to be paid. Since it's the SS 
                         that's reserved the trains, logically 
                         they should pay. But this is a lot 
                         of money.

                         The Jews. They're the ones riding 
                         the trains, they should pay. So you 
                         got Jews paying their own fares to 
                         ride on cattle cars to God knows 
                         where. They pay the SS full fare, 
                         the SS turns around, pays the railroad 
                         a reduced excursion fare, and pockets 
                         the difference.

               He shrugs, There you have it. Brilliant. He glances off, 
               sees something odd across the yard. Two horses, saddled-up, 
               being led into the garden by a stable boy.

                         Excuse me.

               Schindler gets up from the table. Scherner, his wife and 
               daughter and son-in-law stare at the horses; they're 
               beautiful.

               Schindler appears, takes the reins from the stable boy, hands 
               one set to the bride and the other to the groom.

                         than one's wedding day. I wish you 
                         all the best.

               Scherner hails a photographer. As the guy comes over with 
               his camera, so does just about everybody else. Scherner 
               insists Schindler pose with the astonished bride and groom.

               Big smiles. Flash.

               Max looks at the man not without sympathy. He's never heard 
               of such a thing. It's really a bad deal. But then --

               The owner of the place just stares at Redlicht.

               The man doesn't answer. He watches Max get up and cross to 
               the front door where he says something to two of his guys 
               and leaves. The guys come in and start carting out anything 
               of any value: cash register, a chair, a loaf of bread...

<b>               EXT. CRACOW STREET - DAY

               Max strolls along the sidewalk, browsing in store windows.

               People inside and out nod hello, but they despise him, they 
               fear him.

               Just as he's passing a synagogue, some men in long overcoats 
               cross the street. Einsatzgruppen, they are an elite and wild 
               bunch, one of six Special Chivalrous Duty squads assigned to 
               Cracow.

<b>               INT. STARAR BOZNICA SYNAGOGUE - SAME TIME - DAY

               The Sabbath prayers of a congregation of Orthodox Jews are 
               interrupted by a commotion at the rear of the ancient temple.

               Several non-Orthodox Jews from the street, including Max 
               Redlicht, are being herded inside by the Einsatz Boys.

               They're made to stand before the Ark in two lines: Orthodox 
               and non. One of the Einsatzgruppen squad removes the parchment 
               Torah scroll while another calmly addresses the assembly:

                         over there.

               No one does anything for a moment. The liberals from the 
               street seem to say with their eyes, Come on, we're all too 
               sophisticated for this; the others, with the beards and 
               sidelocks, silently check with their rabbi.

               One by one then they file past and spit on the scroll. The 
               last two, the rabbi and Max Redlicht hesitate. They exchange 
               a glance. The rabbi finally does it; the gangster doesn't. 

               After a long tense silence.

               The Einsatz NCO glances from Max to the rabbi and smiles to 
               himself. This is unexpected, this rift.

               head. He's dead before he hits the floor.

               In BLACK AND WHITE and absolute silence, a suitcase thrown

               from a second story window arcs slowly through the air. As 
               it hits the pavement, spilling open -- SOUND ON -- and, 
               returning to COLOR --

               Thousands of families pushing barrows through the streets of 
               Kazimierz, dragging mattresses over the bridge at Podgorze, 
               carrying kettles and fur coats and children on a mass forced 
               exodus into the ghetto.

               Crowds of Poles line the sidewalks like spectators on a parade 
               route. Some wave. Some take it more soberly, as if sensing 
               they may be next.

               The little folding tables have been dragged out and set up 
               again, and at them sit the clerks.

               Goldberg, of all people, has somehow managed to elevate 
               himself to a station of some authority. Armed with something 
               more frightening than a gun -- a clipboard -- he abets the 
               Gestapo in their task of deciding who passes through the 
               ghetto gate and who detours to the train station.

               Pfefferberg, with his wife Mila, at the head of a line that 
               seems to stretch back forever, flicks at Goldberg's OD armband 
               with disgust.

               From the next apartment comes the liturgical solo of a cantor. 
               In this apartment, looking like they can't bear much more of

               Whether he's honest or not is impossible to say. Their glances

               Few glance up from their work at Schindler, the big gold 
               party pin stuck into his lapel, as he moves through the place, 
               his place, his factory, in full operation.

               He climbs the stairs to the offices where several secretaries 
               process Armaments orders. He gestures to Stern, at a desk

               Schindler goes to the wall of windows, his favorite place in 
               the world, and looks down at all the activity below. He pours 
               two drinks from a decanter and, turning back, holds one out

                         clever accountant. The first two...

               He dismisses them with a shrug; he's never had much use for 
               either. But the third -- he raises his glass to the 
               accountant. Stern's glass stays in his lap.

               His face is complete innocence. It's the first thing she 
               fell in love with; and perhaps the thing that keeps her from 
               killing him now. Klonowska emerges from the bedroom thoroughly 
               self-conscious.

               Really? Schindler opens the passenger door of the Mercedes 
               for his wife, and the doorman helps her in.

               of apparent success just don't fit his profile. Schindler 
               lets her in on a discovery.

                         have done about it, because you can't 
                         create this sort of thing. And it 
                         makes all the difference in the world 
                         between success and failure.

               It's so simple, how can you not know?

               Schindler stares out at the lights of the city. They look 
               like jewels.

               Emilie waves goodbye to him from a first-class compartment 
               window. Down on the platform, he waves goodbye to her. as 
               the train pulls away, he turns away, and the platform of the 
               next track is revealed -- soldiers and clerks supervising 
               the boarding of hundreds of people onto another train -- the

               As workers load crates of enamelware onto trucks -- back to 
               COLOR -- Stern and Schindler and the dock foreman confer 
               over an invoice.

               More to Stern --

                         see he's heavy, he's loaded too much. 
                         I point this out to him, I tell him 
                         to wait, he tells me he's got a new

                              (to Schindler)
                         -- that you know all about it and

               On the surface, Schindler remains calm; underneath, he's 
               livid. Clearly it's not "okay" with him.

               Stern and Schindler exchange a glance. Then --

               Pfefferberg and Schindler bang in through the front door, 
               startling a woman at a desk.

<b>                                     WOMAN AT DESK
</b>                         Can I help you?

               They move past her without a word and into the back of the 
               place, into a storeroom. They stride past long racks full of 
               enamelware and other goods.

               A man glances up, sees them coming. He's one of Schindler's 
               investors, the one who questioned the German's word. The 
               man's teenage sons rush to their father's defense, but 
               Pfefferberg grabs him and locks an arm tightly around his 
               neck.

               He turns and walks away. Pfefferberg lets the guy go and 
               follows. The investor's sons help their father up off the 
               floor. Gasping, he yells.

               -- but Schindler and Pfefferberg are already gone, coming

               Well, then, Schindler can't imagine what could be wrong. He 
               pats Pfefferberg on the shoulder and leads him away.

               No chance of that. Satisfied, Schindler returns the report 
               to his accountant and starts to eat. Stern knows he is 
               excused, but looks like he wants to say something more; he 
               just doesn't know how to say it.

                         like to thank you personally for 
                         giving him a job.

               Schindler gives his accountant a long-suffering look.

                         minute. He's very grateful.

               Schindler's silence says, Is this really necessary? Stern 
               pretends it's a tacit okay, goes to the door and pokes his 
               head out.

               An old man with one arm appears in the doorway and Schindler 
               glances to the ceiling, to heaven. As the man slowly makes 
               his way into the room, Schindler sees the bruises on his 
               face. And when he speaks, only half his mouth moves; the 
               other half is paralyzed.

               Schindler shakes the man's hand perfunctorily and tells Stern 
               with a look, okay, that's enough, get him out of here.

               Snow on the ground and more coming down. A hundred of 
               Schindler's workers marching past the ghetto gate, as is the 
               custom, under armed guard. Turning onto Zablocie Street, 
               they're halted by an SS unit standing around some trucks.

               Shovels scraping at snow. The marchers working to clear it 
               from the street. A dialog between one of the guards and an 
               SS officer is interrupted by a shot -- and the face of the 
               one-armed machinist falls into the frame.

               Herman Toffel, an SS contact of Schindler's who he actually

               Schindler knows it's not Toffel's fault, but the whole 
               situation is maddening to him. He shakes his head in disgust.

                         up with a lot of snow shoveling yet.

               Schindler gets up, shakes Toffel's hand, turns to leave.

                         He was a metal press operator, quite 
                         skilled.

               Toffel nods, smiles.

<b>               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               From a distance, Stern and Schindler slowly walk a wasteland 
               that lies between the rear of DEF and two other factories -- 
               a radiator works and a box plant.

               Stern's doing all the talking, in his usual quiet but 
               persuasive manner. Every so often, Schindler, glancing from 
               his own factory to the others, nods.

<b>               INT. SCHINDLER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               The party pins the two other German businessmen wear are 
               nothing compared to the elaborate thing in Schindler's lapel.

               He sits at his desk sipping cognac, a large portrait of Hitler 
               hanging prominently on the wall behind him.

                         boxes -- my products aren't for sale 
                         on the open market. This company has 
                         only one client, the German Army. 
                         And lately I've been having trouble 
                         fulfilling my obligations to my 
                         client. With your help, I hope the 
                         problem can be solved. The problem, 
                         simply, is space.

               Stern, who has been keeping a low profile, hands the gentlemen 
               each a set of documents.

                         I'd like you to think about it and

                         this is appropriate?

               The man glances to Stern, and back to Schindler, his look 
               saying, This is wrong, having a Jew present while we discuss 
               business. If Schindler catches his meaning, he doesn't admit 
               it. Kuhnpast almost sighs.

                         On salary.

               There's a long stunned silence. The Germans can't believe 
               it. After the initial shock wears off, Kuhnpast has to laugh.

               He sets it down, gets up. Hohne gets up. They return the 
               documents to Stern and turn to leave. They aren't quite out 
               the door when Schindler wonders out loud to Stern:

               The businessmen slow, but don't look back into the room.

               Pfefferberg wipes a smudge from the hood of an otherwise

               their house in robes, Scherner whispers to himself --

               Workers high on the side of the building toss down the letters 
               of the radiator sign as others hoist up a big "D." Under 
               armed guard, others unload a metal press machine from a truck.

               Crowded beyond belief, the place is like a post office gone

               pauses to speak with an elderly couple.

               A hand slaps a blue sticker on a work card. Slap, another.

               She opens her eyes and smiles. Schindler is holding a poodle 
               in his arms. She comes around to kiss him. He sets the dog 
               on the desk. Stern, across the room, watches blank-faced.

               Schindler, Stern and Klonowska turn to the voice. Two Gestapo 
               men have entered unannounced.

<b>                                     GESTAPO

                         And another to take you.

               Schindler stares at them in disbelief. Stern quietly slips 
               one of the ledgers on his desk into a drawer.

                         cancel my appointments for the day?

               He doesn't wait for their approval. He scribbles down some 
               names -- Toffel, Czurda, Reeder, Scherner. Underlining 
               Scherner, he glances to Klonowska. She understands.

<b>               INT. OFFICE, SS HEADQUARTERS, CRACOW - DAY

               A humorless middle-level bureaucrat sits behind a desk and 
               D.E.F.'s ledgers and cashbooks.

               The man slowly shakes his head 'no' to Schindler's offer of 
               a cigarette. Schindler tamps it against the crystal of his 
               gold watch.

               Schindler lights the cigarette and drags on it, all but 
               ignoring the man.

                         and respect.

               The quiet matter-of-fact tone, more than the comment itself, 
               throws the bureaucrat off his rhythm. His eyes narrow 
               slightly. There's a long silence.

<b>               INT. HALLWAY/ROOM - SS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               The two who arrested him lead Schindler down a long hallway.

               They reach a door, have him step inside and close the door 
               after him.

<b>               INT. SS "CELL" - EVENING

               Schindler knocks on the inside of the door. A Waffen SS man 
               opens it. The "prisoner" peels several bills from a thick 
               wad.

               Perched on the side of the bed in pajamas, Schindler works 
               on a breakfast of herring and eggs, cheeses, rolls and coffee.

               Someone has also brought him a newspaper. There's an 
               apologetic knock on the door before it opens.

               Schindler, the Gestapo clerk and one of the arresting officers 
               cross the foyer.

                         are.

               Schindler ignores the man completely. Reaching the front 
               doors, the clerk turns over the D.E.F. records to their owner 
               and offers his hand. Schindler lets it hang there.

               A Gestapo limousine pulls in through the gates of the factory, 
               parks near the loading docks. The driver, the same SS officer, 
               waits for Schindler to climb out, but he doesn't; he waits 
               for the SS man to come around and open the door for him.

               There are no less than forty able-bodied Jewish laborers 
               working on the docks, any one of which would be better suited 
               to the task. The Gestapo man calls to one of them.

                         They're working.

               The guy just stares. Finally he heads off with the ledgers.

               The poodle bounds out past him and over to Schindler. He 
               gives the dog a pat on the head.

               Elegantly dressed for a night out, Schindler and Klonowska 
               emerge from the building. As they're escorted to the waiting 
               car, Schindler hesitates. A nervous figure in the shadows of 
               an alcove is gesturing to him, beckoning him.

               Schindler excuses himself. Klonowska watches as he joins the 
               man in the alcove. Their whispered conversation is over 
               quickly and the man hurries off.

<b>               EXT. PROKOCIM DEPOT - CRACOW - LATER - NIGHT

               From the locomotive, looking back, the string of splattered 
               livestock carriages stretches into darkness. There's a lot 
               of activity on the platform.

               Guards mill. Handcards piled with luggage trundle by.

               People hand up children to others already in the cars and 
               climb aboard after them. The clerks are out in full force 
               with their lists and clipboards, reminding the travelers to 
               label their suitcases.

               Climbing from his Mercedes, Schindler stares. He's heard of 
               this, but actually seeing the juxtaposition -- human and 
               cattle cars -- this is something else.

               Recovering, he tells Klonowska to stay in the car and, moving 
               along the side of the train, calls Stern's name to the faces 
               peering out from behind the slats and barbed wire.

</b>                         He's on the list. If he were an 
                         essential worker, he would not be on 
                         the list. He's on the list. You can't 
                         have him.

</b>                         I'm talking to a clerk.

               Schindler pulls out a small notepad and drops his voice to a 
               hard murmur, the growl of a reasonable man who isn't ready -- 
               yet -- to bring out his heavy guns:

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

</b>                         Sir, the list is correct.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         I didn't ask you about the list, I 
                         asked you your name.

<b>                                     CLERK
</b>                         Klaus Tauber.

               As Schindler writes it down, the clerk has second thoughts 
               and calls to a superior, an SS sergeant, who comes over.

<b>                                     CLERK
</b>                         The gentleman thinks a mistake's 
                         been made.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         My plant manager is somewhere on 
                         this train. If it leaves with him on 
                         it, it'll disrupt production and the 
                         Armaments Board will want to know 
                         why.

               The sergeant takes a good hard look at the clothes, at the 
               pin, at the man wearing them.

                         nothing I can do.

</b>                         Schindler.

               The sergeant takes out a pad. Now all three of them have 
               lists. He jots down Schindler's name. Schindler jots down 
               his and flips the pad closed.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Sergeant, Mr. Tauber, thank you very 
                         much. I think I can guarantee you 
                         you'll both be in Southern Russia 
                         before the end of the month. Good 
                         evening.

               He walks away, back toward his car. The clerk and sergeant 
               smile. But slowly, slowly, the smiles sour at the possibility 
               that this man calmly walking away from them could somehow 
               arrange such a fate...

<b>               ALL THREE OF THEM --
</b>
               -- Schindler, the clerk and the sergeant -- stride along the 
               side of the cars. Two of them are calling out loudly --

<b>                                     CLERK &amp; SERGEANT
</b>                         Stern! Itzhak Stern!

               Soon it seems as if everybody except Schindler is yelling 
               out the name. As they reach the last few cars, the 
               accountant's face appears through the slats.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         There he is.

</b>                         Open it.

               Guards yank at a lever, slide the gate open. Stern climbs 
               down. The clerk draws a line through his name on the list 
               and hands the clipboard to Schindler.

<b>                                     CLERK
</b>                         Initial it, please.
                              (Schindler initials 
                              the change)
                         And this...

               As Schindler signs three or four forms, the guards slide the 
               carriage gate closed. Those left inside seem grateful for 
               the extra space.

<b>                                     CLERK
</b>                         It makes no difference to us, you 
                         understand -- this one, that one. 
                         It's the inconvenience to the list. 
                         It's the paperwork.

               Schindler returns the clipboard. The sergeant motions to 
               another who motions to the engineer. As the train pulls out, 
               Stern tries to keep up with Schindler who's striding away.

<b>                                     STERN

                         I tried to tell them it was a mistake, 
                         but they --

               Schindler silences him with a look. He's livid. Stern glances 
               down at the ground.

<b>                                     STERN

                              (contrite)
                         Thank you.

               Schindler turns away and heads for the car. Stern hurries 
               after him. They pass an area where all the luggage, carefully 
               tagged, has been left -- the image becoming BLACK and WHITE.

<b>               EXT./INT. MECHANICS GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
               Mechanics' hood-lamps throw down pools of light through which 
               me wheel handcarts piled high with suitcases, briefcases, 
               steamer trunks -- BLACK and WHITE.

               Moving along with one of the handcarts into a huge garage 
               past racks of clothes, each item tagged, past musical 
               instruments, furniture, paintings, against one wall -- 
               children's toys, sorted by size.

               The cart stops. A valise is handed to someone who dumps and 
               sorts the contents on a greasy table. The jewelry is taken 
               to another area, to a pit, one of two deep lubrication bays 
               filled with watches, bracelets, necklaces, candelabra, 
               Passover platters, gold in one, silver the other, and tossed 
               in.

               At workbenches, four Jewish jewelers under SS guard sift and 
               sort and weigh and grade diamonds, pearls, pendants, brooches 
               children's rings -- faltering only once, when a uniformed 
               figure upends a box, spilling out gold teeth smeared with 
               blood -- the image saturating with COLOR.

<b>               EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
</b>
               Fractured gravestones like broken teeth jut from the earth 
               of a neglected Jewish cemetery outside of town. Down the 
               road that runs alongside it comes a German staff car.

<b>               INT. STAFF CAR - MOVING - DAY
</b>
               In the backseat, Untersturmfuhrer Amon Goeth pulls on a flask 
               of schnapps. His age and build are about that of Schindler's; 
               his face open and pleasant.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         Make a nice driveway.

               The other SS officers in the car -- Knude, Haase and Hujar -- 
               aren't sure what he means. He's peering out the window at 
               the tombstones.

<b>               EXT. GHETTO - DAY
</b>
               The staff car passes through the portals of the ghetto and 
               down the trolley lines of Lwowska Street.

<b>               INT. STAFF CAR - MOVING - DAY
</b>
               As the car slowly cruises through the ghetto, Knude, like a 
               tour guide, briefs the new man, Goeth --

<b>                                     KNUDE
</b>                         This street divides the ghetto just 
                         about in half. On the right -- Ghetto 
                         A: civil employees, industry workers, 
                         so on. On the left, Ghetto B: surplus 
                         labor, the elderly mostly. Which is 
                         where you'll probably want to start.

               The look Goeth gives Knude tells him to refrain, if he would, 
               from offering tactical opinions.

<b>                                     KNUDE
</b>                         Of course that's entirely up to you.

<b>               EXT. PLASZOW FORCED LABOR SITE - DAY
</b>
               Outside of town, a previously abandoned limestone quarry 
               lies nestled between two hills. The stone and brick buildings 
               look like they've been here forever; the wooden structures, 
               those that are up, are built of freshly-cut lumber.

               There's a great deal of activity. New construction and 
               renovation -- foundations being poured, rail tracks being 
               laid, fences and watchtowers going up, heavy segments of 
               huts -- wall panels, eaves sections -- being dragged uphill 
               by teams of bescarved women like some ancient Egyptian 
               industry.

               Goeth surveys the site from a knoll, clearly pleased with 
               it.

               But then he's distracted by voices -- a man's, a woman's -- 
               arguing down where some barracks are being erected.

               The woman breaks off the dialog with a disgusted wave of her 
               hand and stalks back to a half-finished barracks. The man, 
               one from the car, Hujar, sees Goeth, Knude and Haase coming 
               down the hill and moves to meet them.

<b>                                     HUJAR
</b>                         She says the foundation was poured 
                         wrong, she's got to take it down. I 
                         told her it's a barracks, not a 
                         fucking hotel, fucking Jew engineer.

               Goeth watches the woman moving around the shell of the 
               building, pointing, directing, telling the workers to take 
               it all down. He goes to take a closer look. She comes over.

<b>                                     ENGINEER
</b>                         The entire foundation has to be dug 
                         up and re-poured. If it isn't, the 
                         thing will collapse before it's even 
                         completed.

               Goeth considers the foundation as if he knew about such 
               things. He nods pensively. Then turns to Hujar.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                              (calmly)
                         Shoot her.

               It's hard to tell which is more stunned by the order, the 
               woman or Hujar. Both stare at Goeth in disbelief. He gives 
               her the reason along with a shrug --

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         You argued with my man.
                              (to Hujar)
                         Shoot her.

               Hujar unholsters his pistol but holds it limply at his side.

               The workers become aware of what's happening and still their 
               hammers.

<b>                                     HUJAR
</b>                         Sir...

               Goeth groans and takes the gun from him and puts it to the 
               woman's head. Calmly to her --

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         I'm sure you're right.

               He fires. She crumples to the ground. He returns the gun to 
               his stunned inferior and, gesturing down at the body, 
               addresses the workers.

<b>                                     GOETH

                         were doing. That's somebody I needed.
                              (pause)
                         Take it down, re-pour it, rebuild 
                         it, like she said.

               He turns and walks away.

               Stable boys lead two horses into the pre-dawn light. The

               In addition to the exhaust from idling trucks and the curling

<b>               EXT. GHETTO - DAWN

               An empty street. Rooftops against a lightening sky. A few of

               The stable boys hoist saddles onto the horses, cinch the 
               straps. Leaning against the hood of the Mercedes, Schindler 
               and Ingrid, in long hacking jackets, riding breeches and 
               boots, share cognac from his flask.

               Untersturmfuhrer Goeth, soon to be Commandant Goeth, stands 
               before the assembled troops with a flask of cognac in his 
               hand. He looks out over them proudly; they're good boys, 
               these, the best. He addresses them --

               A fourteen year old kid hurries across to the square pulling

<b>               EXT. STABLES - DAWN
</b>
               Ingrid climbs onto one of the horses, Schindler onto the 
               other. As the animals gallop away with their riders toward a 
               wood, the stable boys wave.

                         hold, they prospered.

<b>               EXT. PARK, CRACOW - DAWN
</b>
               The fresh young faces of the Sonderkommandos, listening to 
               their commander.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         For six centuries, there has been a 
                         Jewish Cracow.

<b>               EXT. WOODS - DAWN
</b>
               The horses panting hard. Their hoofs hammering at the ground, 
               climbing a hill. Riding boots kicking at their flanks.

<b>               EXT. PARK, CRACOW - DAWN
</b>
               The boots of Amon Goeth slowly pacing. He stops. Tight on 
               his face, smiling pleasantly.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         By this weekend, those six centuries, 
                         they're a rumor. They never happened. 
                         Today is history.

<b>               EXT. HILLTOP CLEARING - DAWN
</b>
               The galloping horses break through to a clearing high on a 
               hill. The riders pull in the reins and the hoofs rip at the 
               earth.

               Schindler smiles at the view, the beauty of it with the sun 
               just coming up. From here, all of Cracow can be seen in 
               striking relief, like a model of a town.

               He can see the Vistula, the river that separates the ghetto 
               from Kazimierz; Wawel Castle, from where the National 
               Socialist Party's Hans Frank rules the Government General of 
               Poland; beyond it, the center of town.

               He begins to notice refinements: the walls that define the 
               ghetto; Peace Square, the assembly of men and boys. He notices 
               a line of trucks rolling east across the Kosciuscko Bridge, 
               and another across the bridge at Podgorze, a third along 
               Zablocie Street, all angling in on the ghetto like spokes to 
               a hub.

<b>               EXT. GHETTO - DAY
</b>
               The wheels of the last truck clear the portals at Lwowska 
               Street and the Sonderkommandos jump down.

<b>               INT. APARTMENT BUILDINGS - DAWN
</b>
               Families are routed from their apartments. An appeal to be 
               allowed to pack is answered with a rifle butt; an unannounced 
               move to a desk drawer is countered with a shot.

<b>               EXT. STREETS, GHETTO - DAWN
</b>
               Spilling out of the buildings, they're herded into lines 
               without regard to family consideration; some other 
               unfathomable system is at work here. The wailing protests of 
               a woman to join her husband's line are abruptly cut off by a 
               short burst of gunfire.

<b>               EXT. HILLTOP - DAWN
</b>
               From here, the action down below seems staged, unreal; the 
               rifle bursts no louder than caps. Dismounting, Schindler 
               moves closer to the edge of the hill, curious.

               His attention is drawn to a small distant figure, all in 
               red, at the rear of one of the many columns.

<b>               EXT. STREET - DAWN
</b>
               Small red shoes against a forest of gleaming black boots. A 
               Waffen SS man occasionally corrects the little girl's drift, 
               fraternally it seems, nudging her gently back in line with 
               the barrel of his rifle. A volley of shots echoes from up 
               the street.

<b>               EXT. HILLTOP - DAWN
</b>
               Schindler watches as the girl slowly wanders away unnoticed 
               by the SS. Against the grays of the buildings and street 
               she's like a moving red target.

<b>               EXT. STREET - DAWN
</b>
               A truck thundering down the street obscures her for a moment.

               Then she's moving past a pile of bodies, old people executed 
               in the street.

<b>               EXT. HILLTOP - DAWN
</b>
               Schindler watches: she's so conspicuous, yet she keeps moving -- 
               past crowds, past dogs, past trucks -- as though she were 
               invisible.

<b>               EXT. STREET - DAWN
</b>
               Patients in white gowns, and doctors and nurses in white, 
               are herded out the doors of a convalescent hospital. The 
               small figure in red moves past them. Shots explode behind 
               her.

<b>               EXT. HILLTOP - DAWN
</b>
               Short bursts of light flash throughout the ghetto like stars.

               Schindler, fixated on the figure in red, loses sight of her 
               as she turns a corner.

<b>               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAWN
</b>
               She climbs the stairs. The building is empty. She steps inside 
               an apartment and moves through it. It's been ransacked. As 
               she crawls under the bed, the scene DRAINS of COLOR.

               The gunfire outside sounds like firecrackers.

<b>               EXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT
</b>
               NIGHT Silence. Schindler and Ingrid are gone.

               Below, the ghetto lies like a void within the city, its 
               perimeter and interior clearly distinguishable by darkness.

               Outside it, the lights of the rest of Cracow glimmer.

<b>               INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
               Tables and tools and enamelware scrap. The metal presses and 
               lathes, still. The firing ovens, cold. The gauges at zero.

               Against the wall of windows overlooking the empty factory 
               floor stands a figure, Schindler, in silhouette against the 
               glass, black against white, not moving, just staring down.

<b>               EXT. FOREST - PLASZOW - MORNING
</b>
               Bloody wheelbarrows, stark against the tree line of a forest 
               above the completed forced labor camp, PLASZOW.

<b>               EXT. PLASZOW FORCED LABOR CAMP - MORNING
</b>
               Names on lists. Names called out. Tight on faces.

               Goldberg at one of several folding tables. The gangsterturned -- 
               ghetto-cop is now the Lord of Lists inside Plaszow.

               He and other listmakers call out names, accounting for those 
               thousands who survived the liquidation of the ghetto and now 
               stand before them in long straight rows.

<b>               INT. GOETH'S BEDROOM, PLASZOW - MORNING
</b>
               Amon Goeth stirs, wakes, glances at the woman asleep beside 
               him. Hungover, he drags himself slowly out of bed.

<b>               EXT. GOETH'S BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER - MORNING
</b>
               Goeth steps out onto the balcony in his undershirt and shorts 
               and peers out across the labor camp, his labor camp, his 
               kingdom. Satisfied with it, even amazed, he's reminiscent of 
               Schindler looking down on his kingdom, his factory, as he 
               loves to do, from his wall of glass.

               Life is great. Goeth reaches for a rifle.

<b>               EXT. PLASZOW SAME TIME - MORNING
</b>
               Workers loading quarry rock onto trolleys under Ukrainian 
               guard and a low morning sun. Every so often, one glances 
               with anticipation to the balcony of Goeth's "villa" -- which 
               is in fact nothing more than a two-story stone house perched 
               on a slight rise in the dry landscape.

<b>               EXT. GOETH'S BALCONY - CONTINUED - MORNING
</b>
               The butt of the rifle against his shoulder, Goeth aims down

               at the quarry -- at this worker, at that one -- 
               indiscriminately, inscrutably. He fires a shot and a distant 
               figure falls.

<b>               INT. GOETH'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MORNING
</b>
               The woman in bed groans at the echoing shot. She's used to 
               it but she still hates it; it's such an awful way to be woken.

<b>                                     MAJOLA
</b>                              (mutters)
                         Amon... Christ...

               She buries her head under a pillow. Goeth reappears. He pads 
               to his bathroom, goes inside and urinates.

<b>               EXT. PLASZOW - DAY
</b>
               Schindler's Mercedes winds through the camp, past warehouses 
               and workshops, trucks full of furs and furniture, work 
               details, barracks, guard blocks. A man standing alone wears 
               a sign around his neck -- "I am a potato thief."

<b>               EXT. GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - DAY
</b>
               The Mercedes pulls in next to some other nice cars parked on 
               a driveway made of tombstones from the Jewish cemetery.

<b>               EXT. PATIO, GOETH'S VILLA - DAY
</b>
               A patio table set with crystal, china, silver. Goeth and 
               Hujar are there, in pressed SS uniforms, and two 
               industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch. One chair is empty.

<b>                                     HUJAR
</b>                         Your machinery will be moved and 
                         installed by the SS at no cost to 
                         you. You will pay no rent, no 
                         maintenance --

               Hujar glances off, interrupted by Schindler's arrival.

               Although he's never been here, the industrialist comes in 
               like he owns the place. All but Goeth rise.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         No, no, come on, sit --

               He works his way around the table, patting Bosch and Madritsch 
               on the back -- he knows them -- shaking Hujar's hand, who he 
               doesn't know. He reaches Goeth.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         How you doing?

               Goeth takes a good long look at the handsomely dressed 
               entrepreneur and allows him to shake his hand.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         We started without you.

</b>                         Good.

               Schindler takes a seat, shakes a napkin onto his lap, nods 
               to the servant holding out a bottle of champagne to him.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Please.

               Goeth watches him. The others watch Goeth.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         I miss anything important?

</b>                         I was explaining to Mr. Bosch and 
                         Mr. Madritsch some of the benefits 
                         of moving their factories into 
                         Plaszow.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Oh, good, yeah.

               Schindler clearly doesn't care, but nods as though he did.

               He drinks. Goeth just watches him with what seems to be 
               growing amusement. He nods to Hujar to continue.

<b>                                     HUJAR
</b>                         Since your labor is housed on-site,

               Schindler laughs out loud, cutting Hujar off. Hujar glances 
               over to Goeth nonplussed.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         I'm sorry.

               He's not sorry at all, and starts in on the plate of food 
               that's set down in front of him.

<b>                                     GOETH

               Goeth slowly shakes his head no... then smiles.

                              (Schindler nods)
                         It's great.

                         don't know.

               He shrugs like, those are the breaks, too bad. Goeth just 
               smiles. The others watch the two of them, unsure how they're 
               supposed to react.

<b>               INT. GOETH'S OFFICE - PLASZOW - LATER - DAY

               The others have gone. It's just Goeth and Schindler now.

               Goeth pours glasses of cognac.

                         in our careers where duty and 
                         financial opportunity meet.

               Schindler nods pensively, perhaps in agreement, perhaps at 
               some other thought. There's a silence, broken finally by --

                         Some of the boys went crazy, what're 
                         you going to do? You're right, it's 
                         bad business, but it's over with, 
                         it's done.

                         Occasionally, sure, okay, you got to 
                         make an example. But that's good 
                         business.

               Schindler pours himself another shot from the bottle, nurses 
               it. He's in a foul mood. They study each other, trying to 
               determine perhaps who's more powerful. Eventually --

               Goeth tries to put the situation in perspective:

</b>                         You want to stay where you are. You

                         are good, you don't want anybody 
                         telling you what to do -- I can

                         What you want is your own sub-camp.

               Schindler admits it by not disagreeing. Goeth thinks about 
               it, nods to himself again, then frowns.

                         for me.

               Goeth mulls it over, his shrug saying "maybe, maybe not." A

               There's the word Goeth was waiting to hear.

<b>               EXT. D.E.F. SUBCAMP SITE - DAY
</b>
               An SS surveyor, with even paces, measures a distance of the 
               bare field adjacent to the factory. He sticks a little flag 
               into the ground.

<b>               EXT. D.E.F. SUBCAMP SITE - DAY
</b>
               A watchtower, half-erected, the little flag still in the 
               ground. Laborers hammer at it while others roll out barbed 
               wire fencing. A surveyor supervises the placement of a post 
               and carefully measures its heights; it has to be nine feet, 
               exactly.

               At a folding table in the middle of the field, Schindler 
               signs checks made out to the Construction Office, Plaszow -- 
               requisitioning more lumber, cement and hardware.

<b>               EXT. CONSTRUCTION OFFICE, PLASZOW - DAY
</b>
               Plaszow prisoners load the requisitioned building supplies -- 
               the lumber, cement and hardware -- onto trucks.

<b>               EXT/INT. WAREHOUSE, CRACOW - DAY
</b>
               The trucks parked not at Schindler's sub-camp, but at the 
               loading dock of Goeth's private warehouse in Cracow. Inside 
               the building can be glimpsed all kinds of Plaszow goods: 
               clothes, food, construction equipment, furniture.

               Checkbook laid out on the hood of his Mercedes, Schindler 
               pays for the requested materials a second time -- this time 
               with a check made out to Amon Goeth personally -- and hands 
               it over to his bagman, Hujar.

<b>               EXT. D.E.F. SUBCAMP FIELD - DAY
</b>
               Some SS architects groan over a set of blueprints. Schindler 
               and an SS officer walk by.

                         you have the Czechs beat the Poles, 
                         that way everybody stays in line.

</b>                         All I have is Jews.

               He shrugs, Too bad, what're you going to do? The SS guy has 
               to think. Yeah, that's a problem. Two huge leashed dogs yank 
               another SS man across their path.

<b>               EXT. D.E.F. - DAY
</b>
               As five hundred Plaszow prisoners are marched back onto the 
               grounds of D.E.F., any hope they may have had of a more 
               lenient environment is quickly dashed. The place -- completed -- 
               looks like a fortress: barbed-wire, towers, SS guards and 
               dogs.

<b>               INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY

               Where once they glimpsed the not too threatening figure of 
               Oskar Schindler strolling through the factory, the workers 
               who dare glance up now find armed guards moving past. And 
               further up, behind the wall of windows, Schindler moving 
               around, entertaining SS officer.

<b>               INT. GOETH'S VILLA - NIGHT

               The Rosner brothers in evening clothes, Leo on accordion, 
               Henry on violin, playing a Strauss melody, trying to keep it 
               muted, inoffensive. Few of the guests pay attention, which 
               is fine with them. An SS officer chats with Schindler.

</b>                         -- she's seventy years old, she's 
                         been there forever -- they bomb her 
                         house. Everything's gone. The

                         Thank God she wasn't there.

               Schindler, with yet another girl on his arm, endures the 
               officer's lies while sweeping the room with his eyes.

<b>                                     LEO JOHN
</b>                         I was thinking maybe you could help

                         stew pots, I don't know. Say half a 
                         gross of everything?

               Schindler looks at him for the first time, knowingly.

                         she can sell.

               Schindler's girl excuses herself to get a drink.

                         through you?

                         enclose a card.

               Schindler nods, Done. Both watch his date across the room 
               getting a drink. As usual, she's the best-looking on there.

</b>                         Your wife must be a saint.

               Whatever tolerance Schindler's had up to this point with 
               John leaves his face; the looks he gives him now is pure 
               contempt.

               Another round of laughs, only this time it's forced.

               Everybody knows it's true, but you don't say it out loud, 
               and Schindler knows better. Goeth gives him a look; they'll

               A folding table outside the prisoners' barracks. At it, 
               playing cards, two night sentries. A figure appears out of 
               the darkness. Schindler. He sets down on the table a fifth

               Stern, summoned from his barracks, watches as Schindler digs 
               through his coat pockets. Nearby, at the table, drinking 
               now, the sentries. From the hill, the villa, the Rosners' 
               music, faint, can be heard.

               He discreetly hands over to the accountant some cigars 
               scavenged from the party. From another pocket, he retrieves 
               and hands over some tins of food -- all valuable commodities.

               From another pocket, perhaps not so valuable, but then who 
               knows, a gold lighter. Regarding this last item --

               around a moment more before Schindler shrugs again, Sorry I 
               can't do more. He reaches out, pats Stern on the shoulder,

               Not daring to look up, all the worker sees of Goeth is the 
               starched cuff of his shirt.

               The rabbi-turned-metalworker gestures with his head to a 
               pile of hinges on the floor. Goeth nods. And in a tone more 
               like a friend than anything else --

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         I got some workers coming in 
                         tomorrow... Where the hell they from 
                         again?

</b>                         Yugoslavia. I got to make room.

               He shrugs apologetically and pulls out a pocket watch.

</b>                         Make me a hinge.

               As Goeth times him, Rabbi Levartov works at making a hinge 
               as though his life depended on it -- which it does -- cutting 
               the pieces, wrenching them together, smoothing the edges, 
               all the while keeping count on his head of the seconds ticking 
               away.

               He finishes and lets it fall onto the others on the floor.

               Forty seconds.

</b>                         Another.

               Again the rabbi works feverishly -- cutting, crimping, 
               sanding, hearing the seconds ticking in his head -- and 
               finishing in thirty-five. Goeth nods, impressed.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         That's very good. What I don't 
                         understand, though, is -- you've 
                         been working since what, about six 
                         this morning? Yet such a small pile 
                         of hinges?

               He understands perfectly. So does Levartov; he has just 
               crafted his own death in exactly 75 seconds. Goeth stands 
               him against the workshop wall and adjusts his shoulders. He 
               pulls out his pistol, puts it to the rabbi's head and pulls 
               the trigger... click.

               Annoyed, Goeth extracts the bullet-magazine, slaps it back 
               in and puts the barrel back to the man's head. He pulls the 
               trigger again... and again there's a click.

</b>                         God damn it --

               He slams the weapon across Levartov's face and the rabbi 
               slumps dazed to the floor. Looking up into Goeth's face, he 
               knows it's not over. As Goeth walks away --

               A dead chicken dangling from Hujar's hand, evidence of some 
               kind. Goeth slowly pacing before a work detail of twenty or 
               so men standing still, silent, in a row.

                         A man walks around with a chicken, 
                         nobody notices this.

               No one confesses. Goeth nods, All right, takes a rifle from 
               a guard and shoots one of the workers at random. With this 
               added incentive, he waits for someone to tell him who stole 
               the chicken. No one does.

               He shrugs, Okay, points the rifle at another worker -- and a 
               boy of fourteen, shuddering and weeping, steps out of line.

               Goeth goes over to the boy, and, like a distant relative to 
               a small child, tries to get him to look at his face.

               He's pointing at the dead man. And Goeth astonishes the entire 
               assembly of workers and guards by believing the boy.

               He returns the rifle to the guard and walks away. Hujar stares 
               after him, then knowingly at the boy.

                         of it in his situation. He's got 
                         this whole place to run, he's 
                         responsible for everything that goes 
                         on here, all these people -- he's 
                         got a lot of things to worry about. 
                         And he's got the war. Which brings 
                         out the worst in people. Never the 
                         good, always the bad. Always the 
                         bad. But in normal circumstances, he 
                         wouldn't be like this. He'd be all 
                         right. There'd be just the good 
                         aspects of him. Which is a wonderful 
                         crook. A guy who loves good food, 
                         good wine, the ladies, making money...

               But it isn't Stern who needs convincing; it's Schindler 
               himself. It's doubtful he even realizes this, but it's clear 
               to Stern. Schindler sighs either at the predicament itself, 
               or at the fact that he's allowed Stern to place him right in 
               the middle of it. He turns to leave, hesitates. He conducts 
               a mental search for a name and eventually comes up with it:

<b>               EXT. BALCONY - GOETH'S VILLA - NIGHT

               Distant music, Brahms' lullaby, from the Rosner Brothers way 
               down by the women's barracks calming the inhabitants. Up 
               here on the balcony, Schindler and Goeth, the latter so drunk 
               he can barely stand up, stare out over Goeth's dark kingdom.

</b>                         They don't fear us because we have 
                         the power to kill, they fear us 
                         because we have the power to kill 
                         arbitrarily. A man commits a crime, 
                         he should know better. We have him 
                         killed, we feel pretty good about 
                         it. Or we kill him ourselves and we 
                         feel even better. That's not power, 
                         though, that's justice. That's 
                         different than power. Power is when 
                         we have every justification to kill -- 
                         and we don't. That's power. That's 
                         what the emperors had. A man stole 
                         something, he's brought in before 
                         the emperor, he throws himself down 
                         on the floor, he begs for mercy, he 
                         knows he's going to die... and the 
                         emperor pardons him. This worthless 
                         man. He lets him go. That's power. 
                         That's power.

               It seems almost as though this temptation toward restraint, 
               this image Schindler has brush-stroked of the merciful 
               emperor, holds some appeal to Goeth. Perhaps, as he stares 
               out over his camp, he imagines himself in the role, wondering 
               what the power Schindler describes might feel like.

               Eventually, he glances over drunkenly, and almost smiles.

               A stable boy works to ready Goeth's horse before he arrives.

               He sticks a bridle into its mouth, throws a riding blanket 
               onto its back, drags out the saddle Schindler bought Goeth.

               Before he can finish, though, Goeth is there. The boy tries 
               to hide his panic; he knows others have been shot for less.

</b>                         Oh, that's all right.

               As Goeth waits, patiently it seems, whistling to himself, 
               the stable boy tries to mask his confusion.

<b>               EXT. PLASZOW - DAY
</b>
               Goeth gallops around his great domain holding himself high 
               in the saddle. But everywhere he looks, it seems, he's 
               confronted with stoop-shouldered sloth. He forces himself to 
               smile benevolently.

<b>               INT. GOETH'S VILLA - DAY
</b>
               Goeth comes into his bedroom sweating from his ride. A worker 
               with a pail and cloth appears in the bathroom doorway.

<b>               MORE TO THE FLOOR --

                         unable to remove the stains from 
                         your bathtub.

               Goeth steps past him to take a look. The worker is almost 
               shaking, he's so terrified of the violent reprisal he expects 
               to receive.

                         Soap? Not lye?

               The worker hasn't a defense for himself. Goeth's hand drifts 
               down as if by instinct to the gun in his holster. He stares 
               at the worker. He so wants to shoot him he can hardly stand 
               it, right here, right in the bathroom, put some more stains 
               on the porcelain. He takes a deep breath to calm himself.

               Then gestures grandly.

                         you.

               The worker hurries out with his pail and cloth. Goeth just 
               stands there for several moments -- trying to feel the power 
               of emperors he's supposed to be feeling. But he doesn't feel 
               it. All he feels is stupid.

<b>               EXT. GOETH'S VILLA - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

               The worker hurries across the dying lawn outside the villa.

               He dares a glance back, and at that moment, a hand with a 
               gun appears out the bathroom window and fires.

               Stern watches truck being unloaded of bags of flour, rice

               full, the trucks rumble off.

                         everybody uses everybody, it works 
                         out, everybody's happy.

</b>                         Not like him.

               Schindler glances away to the floor show, nods to himself.

               Glancing back again, he considers the SS men with great 
               sobriety.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Yeah, well, in some eyes it doesn't 
                         matter the amount we steal, it's 
                         that we do it. Each of us sitting at 
                         this table.

               His thinly veiled threat of exposure escapes neither SS man.

               The air seems thicker suddenly.

<b>                                     SCHERNER
</b>                         He doesn't deserve your loyalty. 
                         More important, he's not worth you 
                         making threats against us.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Did I threaten anybody here? I stated 
                         a simple fact.

               The threat still stands, despite Schindler's assurance 
               otherwise, and they all know it. So does Scherner's threat 
               back to him, and they all know that, too. But Schindler just 
               grins, and, glancing away --

</b>                         Come on, let's watch the girls.

<b>               INT. D.E.F. FACTORY - DAY
</b>
               In addition to the mid-day soup and break, there are bowls 
               of fruit on the long work tables. At one of them, several 
               workers are debating which of them will go upstairs to thank 
               Schindler.

<b>               INT. UPSTAIRS OFFICES, D.E.F. - SAME TIME - DAY
</b>
               In honor of Schindler's birthday, Goeth has brought over 
               Stern and the Rosners -- the musicians, at the moment, 
               accompanying the best baritone in the Ukrainian garrison.

               Surrounded by his friends and lovers, Schindler cuts a cake.

               He receives congratulations from the many SS men present and 
               the embraces, in turn, of Ingrid and Klonowska and Goeth.

               From Stern he gets a handshake.

               A Jewish girl from the shop floor is admitted and timidly 
               approaches the drunken group around Schindler. The SS men 
               consider her as a curiosity; Schindler, as he would any 
               beautiful girl. The music breaks and out of the silence comes 
               a small nervous voice:

<b>                                     FACTORY GIRL
</b>                         ...On behalf of the workers... sir... 
                         I wish you a happy birthday...

               She hesitates. She's surrounded by SS uniforms and swastikas 
               and holstered guns. Schindler smiles; this is a beautiful 
               girl.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Thank you.

               He kisses her on the mouth. The smiles on the faces around 
               them strain. Stern glances to heaven. Amon cocks his head 
               like a confused dog. The kiss is broken, finally, and 
               Schindler smiles again with impunity.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Thank them for me.

               The girl backs away nodding anxiously; all she wants now is 
               out before someone -- her, Schindler, both of them -- gets 
               shot. Henry Rosner nudges Leo and they begin another song.

               And the party tries to resume.

               Were they not asleep in their barracks, the prisoners would 
               no doubt shudder at the sight: the clerks are setting up 
               their folding tables.

               Other figures move around the parade ground in the murky 
               dawn light: these raising a banner, those wheeling filing 
               cabinets across the Appellplatz, this one wiring a phonograph, 
               that one saturating a pad with ink from a bottle.

               Goldberg, Lord of Lists, moves from table to table handing 
               out carbons of lists and sharing morning pleasantries with 
               the clerks.

               Some men in white appear like ghosts. A doctor's kid is 
               opened, a stethoscope removed. Another cleans the lenses of 
               his glasses. Someone sharpens a pencil.

</b>
               A trainman waving a lantern guides an engineer who's slowly 
               backing an empty cattle car along the tracks. It couples to 
               another empty slatted car with a harsh clank.

<b>               EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY
</b>
               The needle of the phonograph is set down on a pocked 78. The 
               first scratchy note of a Strauss waltz blare from the camp 
               speakers.

<b>               EXT. BALCONY - GOETH'S VILLA - DAY
</b>
               In his undershirt and shorts Goeth calmly smokes his first 
               cigarette of the morning as he listens to the music wafting 
               up from down below.

               Down there on the Appellplatz, the entire population of the 
               camp has been concentrated, some fifteen thousand prisoners.

<b>               EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY
</b>
               Though the music and banners struggle to evoke a country 
               fair, the presence of the doctors belie it. A sorting out 
               process is going on here, the healthy from the unhealthy.

               A physician wipes at his brow with his handkerchief as several 
               prisoners run back and forth, naked, before him. He makes 
               his selections quickly: this one into this line, that one 
               into that, and Goldberg moves them recording the names.

               Other groups of people run naked in front of other doctors 
               and clerks. Notations are made and lines are formed. The sun 
               beats down and the music lies.

<b>               EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY
</b>
               Some still pulling their clothes back on, the first wave of 
               the "unfit" is marched onto the platform. A guard slides 
               open the gate of a cattle car and this first unlucky group 
               climbs aboard.

<b>               EXT. APPELLPLATZ - PLASZOW - DAY

               Behind the camouflage of other women prisoners, Mila 
               Pfefferberg rubs a beet against her cheeks in desperate hope 
               of adding a little color to her skin.

               Amon Goeth, his shirtsleeves uncharacteristically rolled up, 
               chats with one of the doctors as another group strips.

               Whether the topic is this Health Aktion or the unseasonable 
               weather is unclear, but he nods approvingly.

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG (O.S.)
</b>                         Commandant, sir.

               Goeth glances up, finds Poldek among the group taking off 
               their clothes. Pfefferberg appeals to him with a look that 
               asks, Do I really have to go through this, and Goeth turns 
               to a clerk.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         My mechanic.

               Pfefferberg is motioned away from the others; he's okay, he 
               doesn't have to be put through this indignity. He calls out 
               to the Commandant again --

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG
</b>                         What about my wife?

               Goeth thinks about it a moment before he nods, Yeah, okay, 
               sure. A clerk accompanies Pfefferberg and, making a notation 
               on the way, finds Mila.

<b>               EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - DAY
</b>
               The sun is higher, the cattle cars hotter. Prisoners' arms 
               stretch out between the slats offering diamonds in exchange 
               for a sip of water.

<b>               EXT. PLASZOW - LATER - DAY
</b>
               The needle of the phonograph is set down on another record, 
               a children's song, "Mammi, kauf mir ein Pferdchen" (Mommy, 
               buy me a pony).

               Children are yanked from the arms of their parents. Wailing 
               protests quickly escalate to brawls with the guards.

               Revolvers and rifles aim at the sun and fire. Music, shots, 
               wails.

<b>               INT. BARRACKS - SAME TIME - DAY
</b>
               Guards traipse through a deserted barracks peering up at the 
               rafters, pulling planks from the floor, upending cots, looking 
               for some children.

<b>               EXT. BARRACKS - SAME TIME - DAY
</b>
               A small figure in red sprints across to another barracks, 
               past it, to a crude wooden structure beyond it.

</b>
               An arm held out to either side, the small girl lowers herself 
               into a pit into which men have defecated. She works her way 
               slowly down, trying to find knee and toeholds on the foul 
               walls, ignoring the flies invading her ears, her nostrils.

               Reaching the surface of the muck she lets her feet submerge, 
               then her ankles, her shins, her knees, before finally

               touching harder ground. As she struggles to slow her 
               breathing, her racing heart, she hears a hallucinatory murmur --

<b>                                     BOY'S VOICE
</b>                         This is our place.

               She sees eyes in the darkness; five other children are already 
               there.

<b>               EXT. DEPOT - PLASZOW - LATER - DAY
</b>
               Waves of heat rise from the roofs of the long string of cattle 
               cars. Inside, those who "failed" the medical exams bake as 
               they wait for the last cars to be filled.

               Schindler's Mercedes pulls up. He climbs out and stares 
               transfixed. He notices Goeth then, standing with the other 
               industrialists, Bosch and Madritsch, and strolls over to 
               them.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         I tried to call you, I'm running a 
                         little late, this is taking longer 
                         than I thought. Have a drink.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

</b>                         I got a shipment of Hungarians coming 
                         in, I got to make room for them. 
                         It's always something.

               He glances away at the train. The idling engine only partially 
               covers the desperate pleas for water coming from inside the 
               slatted cars.

<b>                                     GOETH

                         know what complaining is.

               He grins. Schindler watches as another car is loaded. It's 
               like they're climbing into an oven.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

                         brigade out here and hose down the 
                         cars?

               Goeth stares at him blankly, then with a What-will-you-think-
               of-next? kind of look, then laughs uproariously and calls 
               over to Hujar --

<b>                                     GOETH

<b>                                     HUJAR
</b>                         What?

               Hujar heard him, he just doesn't get it. Finally he turns to 
               another guy and tells him to do it.

               STREAM OF WATER CASCADE onto the scalding rooftops. The fire 
               trucks are there, the hoses firing the cold water at the 
               cars on the people inside who are roaring their gratitude.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         This is really cruel, Oskar, you're 
                         giving them hope. You shouldn't do 
                         that, that's cruel.

               And amusing, not just to Goeth, but to the other SS officers 
               standing around as well. Oskar moves away to talk with one 
               of the firemen. At full extension, apparently the hoses still 
               only reach halfway down the long line of cars. He returns to 
               Goeth.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

                         down at the end.

               Goeth finds this especially sidesplitting, and hollers --

               THE D.E.F. HOSES have arrived and are being coupled to 
               Plaszow's. As the water drenches the cars further back, the 
               people inside loudly voice their thanks, and the guards and 
               officers outside grin at the spectacle.

                         from?

               The joke takes on new dimension when, from the back of the 
               D.E.F. trucks, boxes of food are unloaded. Accompanied by 
               the laughter of the SS, Schindler moves along the string of 
               cars pushing sausages through the slats.

               Goeth is almost hysterical. But slowly then, slowly, the 
               amusement on his face fades. His friend moving along the 
               cars bringing futile mercy to the doomed in front of countless 
               SS men, laughing or not, is not just behaving recklessly 
               here, it's as though he were possessed.

               The water rains down on the last car.

               A German staff car pulls in across the factory gate, blocking

               The girl who brought Schindler best wishes on his birthday 
               glances up from her work to the Gestapo crossing through the

               Settled comfortably in the backseat, Schindler glances idly 
               out the window. As the car makes a turn, though, he looks 
               back. Apparently he expected it to turn the other way.

</b>                         Where are we going?

               The guys up front don't answer. Concern, for the first time, 
               registers on Schindler's face. The car approaches a building 
               block long with an ominous sameness to the windows.

<b>               INT. MONTELUPICH PRISON - CRACOW - DAY
</b>
               Schindler is made to empty his pockets, his money, cigarettes, 
               everything. Around him clerks speak in whispers, as if raised 
               voices might set off head-splitting echoes along the narrow 
               monotonous corridors.

<b>               INT. MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY
</b>
               He's led down a flight of stairs into a claustrophobic tunnel. 
               He's taken past darkened cells. Past shadowy figures crouched 
               in corners and on the floor.

<b>               INT. CELL, MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY
</b>
               A water bucket. A waste bucket. No windows. This is not a 
               cell for dignitaries; this arrest is different.

               Schindler, incongruous with the dank surroundings in his 
               double-breasted suit, slowly paces back and forth before his 
               cellmate, a soldier who looks like he's been here forever, 
               his greatcoat pulled up around his ears for warmth.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         I violated the Race and Resettlement 
                         Act. Though I doubt they can point 
                         out the actual provision to me.
                              (pause)
                         I kissed a Jewish girl.

               Schindler forces a smile. His cellmate just stares. Now 
               there's a crime; much more impressive, much more serious, 
               than his own.

<b>               INT. OFFICE - MONTELUPICH PRISON - DAY
</b>
               In a stiff-backed chair sits a very unlikely defender of 
               racial improprieties -- Amon Goeth. To an impassive SS colonel 
               behind a desk, Goeth tries to highlight extenuating 
               circumstances:

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         He likes women. He likes good-looking 
                         women. He sees a good-looking woman, 
                         he doesn't think. This guy has so 
                         many women. They love him. He's 
                         married, he's got all these women. 
                         All right, she was Jewish, he 
                         shouldn't have done it. But you didn't 
                         see this girl. I saw this girl. This 
                         girl was very good-looking.

               Goeth tries to read the guy behind the desk, but his face is 
               like a wall.

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         They cast a spell on you, you know, 
                         the Jews. You work closely with them 
                         like I do, you see this. They have 
                         this power, it's like a virus. Some 
                         of my men are infected with this 
                         virus. They should be pitied, not 
                         punished. They should receive 
                         treatment, because this is as real 
                         as typhus. I see this all the time.

               Goeth shifts in his chair; he knows he's not getting anywhere 
               with this guy. He switches tacts:

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         It's a matter of money? We can discuss 
                         that. That'd be all right with me.

               In the silence that follows, Goeth realizes he has made a 
               serious error in judgment. This man sitting soberly before 
               him is one of that rare breed -- the unbribable official.

<b>                                     SS COLONEL
</b>                         You're offering me a bribe?

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         A "bribe?" No, no, please come on... 
                         a gratuity.

               Suddenly the man stands up and salutes, which thoroughly 
               confuses Goeth since Goeth is his inferior in rank. But he 
               isn't saluting Goeth, he's saluting the officer who has just 
               stepped into the room behind him.

<b>                                     SCHERNER
</b>                         Sit down.

               The colonel sits back down. Scherner pulls up a chair next 
               to Goeth.

<b>                                     SCHERNER
</b>                         Hello, Amon.

</b>                         Sir.

               Scherner smiles and allows Goeth to shake his hand, but it's 
               clear, even to Goeth himself, that he has fallen from grace.

<b>               INT. GOETH'S VILLA - PLASZOW - NIGHT
</b>
               A tall, thin, gray Waffen SS officer has a request for the 
               Rosner brothers.

<b>                                     SS OFFICER
</b>                         I want to hear "Gloomy Sunday" again.

               He's drunk, morose; it seems unlikely he'll be on his feet 
               much longer. Indeed, as Henry and Leo Rosner begin the son -- 
               an excessively melancholy tale in which a young man commits 
               suicide for love -- the field officer staggers over to a 
               chair in the corner of the crowded room and slumps into it.

<b>                                     SCHERNER
</b>                         We give you Jewish girls at five 
                         marks a day, Oskar, you should kiss 
                         us, not them.

               Goeth laughs too loud, drawing a weary glance from Scherner.

               Schindler smiles good-naturedly. He's out, a little worse 
               for wear perhaps, a little more subdued than usual. Taking 
               him away from the others, taking him into his confidence --

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         God forbid you ever get a real taste 
                         for Jewish skirt. There's no future 
                         in it. No future. They don't have a 
                         future. And that's not just good old-
                         fashioned Jew-hating talk. It's policy 
                         now.

               THE THIN GRAY SS OFFICER is back in front of the musicians, 
               swaying precariously, a drink in his hand --

<b>                                     SS OFFICER
</b>                         "Gloomy Sunday" again.

               Again they play the song. Again he staggers across the crowded 
               room to his chair in the corner, paying no attention to the 
               visiting Commandant from Treblinka or anybody else --

<b>                                     TREBLINKA GUY
</b>                         -- We can process at Treblinka, if 
                         everything is working? I don't know, 
                         maybe two thousand units a day.

               He shrugs like it's nothing, or with modesty, it's unclear.

               Goeth is dully impressed; Schindler, only politely so.

<b>                                     TREBLINKA GUY
</b>                         Now Auschwitz. Now you're talking. 
                         What I got is nothing, it's like 
                         a... a machine. Auschwitz, though, 
                         now there's a death factory. There, 
                         they know how to do it. There, they 
                         know what they're doing.

               AGAIN THE GRAY OFFICER wavering before Henry and Leo. This 
               time they don't wait for him to ask for it --

<b>               LEO ROSNER
</b>
               "Gloomy Sunday" As the man stumbles back to his chair, the 
               Rosners not only play the song again, they play with it, and 
               him, this one somber man in the corner staring at them almost 
               gratefully, wrenching from the song all the sentimentality 
               they can, as if they could actually drive him to kill himself.

               No one else in the room is aware of the exchange going on 
               between them -- this man and this music -- which the brothers 
               play as if it were an invocation. Eventually, though, someone 
               does become aware, if not of the intention, at least of the 
               repetition, and interrupts the spell --

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         Enough -- Jesus -- God --

               The music falls apart. The brothers find Goeth in the crowd 
               looking at them like, Come on, for Christ's sake play 
               something else. Which they do -- defeated -- some innocuous 
               Von Suppe. Goeth turns back to one of his guests.

               Glancing back, as they play, to the corner, the Rosners see 
               the gloomy SS officer getting slowly up from his chair. He 
               stands there for a moment, staring at nothing, then slowly 
               makes his way out onto the balcony where he stands in the 
               night air, absolutely still, in silhouette to the Rosners.

               And, ruining a perfectly good party, he takes out a gun and 
               shoots himself in the head.

<b>               EXT. D.E.F. - DAY
</b>
               From a distance, Schindler can be seen arguing with an SS 
               officer who's trying to hand him papers, orders of some kind, 
               which the irate industrialist refuses to accept.

               Here, closer, carrying blankets and bundles, Schindler's 
               workers are marched under heavy guard out of the factory and 
               its annexes and across the fortified yard.

               His people are being taken. Where, is unclear. Schindler 
               abruptly breaks off the discussion with the SS man, climbs 
               into his car and drives off.

<b>               EXT. FOREST - PLASZOW - LATER - DAY
</b>
               A creek flowing gently through marshy ground under an umbrella 
               of trees. Leo John and his five year old son, on their knees 
               catching tadpoles, seem unaware of, or at least not distracted 
               by, a ghastly endeavor going on beyond them:

               Bodies being exhumed out of the earth, out of the mass graves 
               in the forest. The dead lay everywhere, victims of the ghetto 
               massacre, victims of Plaszow.

               Arriving, Schindler sees Goeth standing up at the tree line.

               Approaching him, furious, he hesitates. He sees a wheelbarrow 
               trundled by Pfefferberg, a corpse in it. He fears the body 
               is Mila's, but then sees her trundling another barrow, another 
               corpse in it. Goeth calls to Schindler --

<b>                                     GOETH
</b>                         Can you believe this?

               Goeth shakes his head, dismayed. Schindler joins him and 
               stares at a pyre of bodies built by masked and gagging 
               workers, layer upon layer.

<b>                                     GOETH

                         every body buried up here? And burn 
                         it?

               It's always something. He glances off. The pyre has reached 
               the height of a man's shoulder. The workers move around it 
               dousing it with gasoline.

               He sighs at the unfairness of it all, the dissolution of his 
               kingdom. His glance finds his man, Leo John, over at the 
               stream.

                         son.

               Tight on the gleeful boy with a tadpole in his hand. Behind 
               him, smoke from the pyre rises into the sky.

               Schindler, in silhouette against the wall of glass, stares 
               down at his deserted factory, his silent machines, the dark 
               empty spaces.

               Light pouring in through the windows. White sheets over the

               things are gone.

               Schindler's Mercedes, the backseat piled high with suitcases.

               A border guard returns his passport to him. The barrier is

               A church in the main square of a sleepy hamlet. A priest and 
               his parishioners, including Emilie Schindler, emerging from 
               it, morning Mass over.

               Some guys outside a bar/café, hanging gout, drinking, notice 
               the elegantly dressed gentleman outside the town's only hotel. 
               They recognize him. They come over.

               Schindler, the clothes, the car, the suitcases, the great 
               difference between their respective stations in life.

               Somehow their old ne'er-do-well friend has managed to do 
               quite well, and it amazes them.

               Across the square, Emilie has noticed him; and he, her. But 
               neither makes a move toward the other. Finally she walks 
               away; which Schindler interprets correctly to mean, Yes, 
               check into the hotel. He tips the porter extravagantly and 
               turns back to the guys from the bar.

               Except for the clothes of the working class clientele, the 
               scene is reminiscent of the SS nightclub in Cracow:

               Schindler, the great entertainer, working his way around the 
               tables making sure everybody's got enough to drink, making 
               sure everybody's happy. A guy at a table with a girl gestures 
               him over.

               He gestures to the bartender to refill his friend's and his

               The guy has to think; not because he doesn't know, but because 
               his old friend Oskar is so many things it's hard to know 
               which description to use. Finally --

               A woman asleep in the bed. The girl from the bar. In his 
               robe, at the window, Schindler calmly smokes as he stares 
               out at the NIGHT

               The town, off in the distance, nestled against the mountains.

               The sun, just coming up. Closer, here, ramshackle structures, 
               a long abandoned factory of some kind.

               Schindler, in leather riding gear, climbs down off a Moto-
               Guzzi motorcycle. He slowly wanders around, peers in through 
               broken windows, wanders around some more.

               Tight on his face, torn between conflicting choices, or 
               realizing there's no choice, or only one choice, and hating 
               it.

               Goeth considers his friend, greatly puzzled. Below them lies 
               the camp, still operating, at least for now, until the 
               shipments can be arranged.

               Goeth finds this whole line of reasoning impossible to 
               believe. He's sure Schindler's got something else going on 
               here he's not telling him.

                         be making three.

               Schindler admits it with a shrug.

               Goeth studies him, searching for the real answer in his face.

               He can't find it.

                         worth to you.

               Goeth thinks about it in the silence. Then a slow nod to 
               himself. He's going to make some money out of this even if 
               he can't figure it out. He smiles.

               another, types a name.

               It doesn't sound right. And Schindler doesn't answer. He's 
               avoided telling Stern the details of the deal struck with 
               Goeth, and balks telling him now. Finally awkwardly --

               Stern had no idea. And has no idea now what to say.

               Schindler shrugs like it's no big deal, but Stern knows it 
               is.

               Stern is really overcome by what this man is doing. What he 
               can't figure out is why. Silence. And then --

               He looks out over his audience, the citizens of Brinnlitz, 
               local government officials, many of them appearing bewildered 
               by him or the "situation" that has arisen.

               The noise begins, his audience's angry reaction. Raising 
               pitch of his own voice --

               He barely gets it all out before the protests drown him out.

               The uproar reaches such a clamoring level there's no point

               Goeth, at his writing desk, endures the bureaucratic tedium 
               of signing memoranda, transport orders, requisitions. He 
               comes to Schindler's list, initials each page and signs the 
               last with no more interest than the others. He hands the 
               whole stack of paperwork to Marcel Goldberg, Personnel Clerk, 
               Executor of Lists, Gangster.

<b>               INT. OFFICE, ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - PLASZOW - DAY

               Goldberg has the signature page of the list in a typewriter.

               He carefully aligns it and types his own name in a space 
               allowed by the bottom margin.

               At a folding table in the middle of the field, Schindler 
               signs his name to Reich Main Office directives, Evacuation 
               Board and Department of Economy form, Armaments contracts.

               Around him, the new camp is taking shape: Electric fences 
               are going up, watchtowers, barracks; shipments of heavy 
               equipment, huge Hilo machines, are being off-loaded from 
               flatbed train cars; SS engineers stand around frowning at 
               the lay of the land, some drainage problem no doubt.

               A train full of people destined for Auschwitz pulls away

               He knows what the prisoner means and the prisoner knows he

               The prisoner knows that, too, and discreetly turns over to 
               Goldberg a couple of diamonds from the lining of his coat.

               Names on a notepad, the first few crossed out. Goldberg types 
               the next name onto a page of The List, squeezing it into the 
               upper margin, and crosses that one out on the pad.

               He rolls the page down, types another name, tires of the 
               exacting task, tears the handwritten page of names from the 
               notepad, crumples it and throws it away.

               Schindler, on his way back to his hotel after a night of 
               drinking, is jumped by three guys, wrestled to the ground 
               and brutally kicked.

               As the forms of his attackers move away, he catches a glimpse 
               of one of them -- his "friend" who admired his car when he 
               first arrived back in town.

               Pfefferberg glances up from his work and studies the 
               blackmailing collaborator for a long moment.

               Pfefferberg suddenly attacks him with the wrench in his hand, 
               beating him across the shoulders and head with it.

               Goldberg goes down, tries to scramble away on his knees, the 
               blows coming down hard on his back.

               A cattle car is coupled to another, the pin dropped into 
               place. On the platform, clerks at folding tables shuffle 
               paper while others mill around with clipboards, calling out 
               names.

               Thousands of prisoners on the platform, some climbing onto 
               strings of slatted cars on opposing tracks. Some already in 
               them, most standing in lines, changing lines, the end of one 
               virtually indistinguishable from the beginning of another.

               Paperwork. Lists of names. Pens in hands checking them off.

               Some bound for Brinnlitz, the rest for Auschwitz, if they 
               can be properly sorted from one another.

               A boy is allowed to remain in a line with his father; his 
               mother is taken to another line composed of women and girls.

               This segregation is the only recognizable process going on; 
               the others, if they exist, are apparent only to the clerks 
               and guards, and maybe not even to them. It is chaos.

               Stern, wedged into a corner of an impossibly crowded car.

               This train may be headed for Schindler's hometown, but it is 
               no more comfortable than the others on their way to Auschwitz -- 
               Birkenau.

<b>               EXT. CROSSING - POLAND - DAY
</b>
               The train idles at a crossing in the middle of nowhere.

               Moving across the faces peering out from between the slats, 
               it becomes apparent there are only male prisoners aboard.

               Below, on a dirt road, a lone Polish boy stands watching.

               Just before an empty train roars past from the other direction 
               obscuring him, his hand comes up and across his neck making 
               the gesture of a throat being slit.

<b>               EXT. DEPOT - BRINNLITZ - DAY
</b>
               The train pulls into the small quiet Brinnlitz station. The 
               doors are opened and the prisoners begin climbing down. At 
               the far end of the platform, flanked by several SS guards, 
               stands Schindler. To his customary elegant attire he has 
               added a careless accouterment, a Tyrolean hat.

<b>               EXT. BRINNLITZ - DAY

               Leading a procession of nine hundred male Jewish "criminals" 
               through the center of town, Schindler ignores the angry taunts 
               and denouncements and the occasional rock hurled by the good 
               citizens of Brinnlitz lining the streets.

<b>               INT. BRINNLITZ MUNITIONS FACTORY - DAY

               Under the towering Hilo machines, a meal of soup and bread 
               awaits the workers. As they're sitting down to it, Schindler 
               addresses them --

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

                         received a cable this morning from 
                         the Personnel Office, Plaszow. The 
                         women have left. They should be 
                         arriving here sometime tomorrow.

               He sees Stern among the workers, smiles almost imperceptibly, 
               turns and walks away.

<b>               EXT. RURAL POLAND - DAY

               A train backs slowly along the tracks toward an arched 
               gatehouse. The women inside the cattle cars don't need a 
               sign to tell them where they are, they've seen this place in 
               nightmares. Pillars of dark smoke rise from the stacks into 
               the sky.

               It's Auschwitz.

               The stunned women climb down from the railcars onto an immense 
               concourse bisecting the already infamous camp. As they're 
               marched across the muddy yard by guards carrying truncheons, 
               Mila Pfefferberg stares at the place. It' so big, like a 
               city, only one in which the inhabitants reside strictly 
               temporarily. To Mila, under her breath --

               So often terrified by the sight of a clerk with a clipboard, 
               it is the absence of clerks which unsettles the woman now, 
               as though there remains no further reason to record their 
               names.

               Mila's eyes return to the constant smoke rising beyond the 
               birch trees at the settlement's western end.

               In Schindler's absence, the workers attempt to operate the 
               unfamiliar machines, to figure out the unfamiliar process of 
               manufacturing artillery shells. There's movement, there's 
               noise, the machines are running, but little is being produced.

               Untersturmfuhrer Jose Liepold, the Commandant of Schindler's 
               new subcamp, moves through the factory conducting an impromptu 
               inspection. He points out to a guard a kid no more nine, 
               sorting casings at a work table, and another boy, ten or 
               eleven, carrying a box.

               Mila and another woman cross back toward their barracks 
               carrying a large heavy pot of broth. Not more than a hundred 
               meters away stand the birch trees and crematoria, the smoke 
               pluming even now, at NIGHT out of the darkness appear 
               "apparitions," skeletal figures which surround the two women, 
               or rather the soup pot between them, dipping little metal 
               cups into it, over and over.

               Too startled to speak, Mila can only stare. The apparitions 
               clamor around the pot a moment more, than furtively slip 
               back into the same darkness from which they came. Mila and 
               the other woman exchange a glance. The pot is empty.

<b>               INT. HOSS' HOUSE - AUSCHWITZ - NIGHT
</b>
               In his en, over cognac, Auschwitz Commandant Rudolf Hoss 
               considers the documents Schindler has brought: the list, the 
               travel papers, the Evacuation Board authorization. Hoss nods 
               at them, then at Schindler.

<b>                                     HOSS
</b>                         You're right, a clerical error has 
                         bee made.
                              (pause)
                         Let me offer you this in apology for 
                         the inconvenience. I have a shipment 
                         coming in tomorrow, I'll cut you 
                         three hundred from it. New ones. 
                         These are fresh.

               Schindler seems to think about the offer as he nurses his 
               drink. It's "tempting."

               The ones on the list in Hoss' hand. Silence. Then:

</b>                         You shouldn't get stuck on names.

               Why, because you get to know them? Because you begin to see 
               them as human beings? Schindler suddenly has the awful feeling 
               that the women are already dead. Hoss misinterprets the look.

<b>                                     HOSS
</b>                         That's right, it creates a lot of 
                         paperwork.

<b>               EXT. CONCOURSE - AUSCHWITZ - DAY
</b>
               A large assembly of women. Guards calling out names from a 
               list. As each woman steps out of line, a guard unceremoniously 
               brushes a swathe of red paint across her clothes. New columns 
               are formed.

<b>               EXT. TRAIN YARD - AUSCHWITZ - DAY
</b>
               Schindler, standing at the end of the platform stone-faced, 
               watches the women whose names he is "stuck on," whose clothes 
               are slashed with red paint, climbing onto the cattle cars.

               As the cars fill, a train on another track arrives. The 
               "fresh" ones Schindler turned down. As the gates are closed 
               on the women's cars, the gates of the others are opened and 
               the people spill out.

               A horrified cry suddenly breaks through the noise of the 
               engines. One of Schindler's women, locked in, has seen her 
               son among those coming down off the train on the opposing 
               track.

               Another cry erupts, and another, another, as the women spot 
               their children, confiscated from the Brinnlitz factory, 
               brought here.

               Schindler becomes aware of what's happening and, passing 
               over other children, tries to corral these particular boys, 
               many of whom have noticed their mothers now and are echoing 
               their tortured cries with their own.

               Schindler manages to gather them together, the fifteen or 
               twenty boys, and, in the middle of the crowded platform, 
               appears to a guard:

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         These are mine. They're on the list. 
                         These are my workers. They should be 
                         on the train.

               He points across to the women's train, then down to the boys.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         They're skilled munition workers. 
                         They're essential.

               The guard glances from the frantic gentleman to the anxious 
               brook around him. These are essential workers?

<b>                                     GUARD
</b>                         They're boys.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Yes.

               Schindler is nodding his head, trying to think. The women 
               are shrieking their sons' names. The guard, who heard it 
               all, every excuse imaginable, is just turning away when 
               Schindler thrusts his smallest finger at him.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Their fingers. They polish the insides 
                         of shell casings. How else do you 
                         expect me to polish the inside of a 
                         45 millimeter shell casing?

               The guard stares at him dumbly. This he hasn't heard.

<b>               EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAY
</b>
               Like a mirage in the distance they appear -- the women, the 
               children, guards, Schindler, marching across a field toward 
               the factory.

               At the perimeter of the camp, at the wire, the men watch the 
               approaching procession. It appears to them that the women 
               are covered in blood -- or -- could it be paint? They're 
               walking, they're fine, some are even smiling.

               Liepold isn't smiling. Neither is Schindler; at least not on 
               the outside.

<b>               INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY
</b>
               The machines are silent, the people are not. Women are in 
               their husbands' arms, sons in their fathers'. There's food 
               on the tables but it's largely ignored, the reunion taking 
               precedence.

<b>               INT. SS MESS HALL - SAME TIME - DAY
</b>
               Schindler stands before the assembled camp guards. They are 
               seated at the long tables, their food getting cold, waiting 
               for him to say whatever it is he has to say.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Under Department W provisions, it is 
                         unlawful to kill a worker without 
                         just cause. Under the Businesses 
                         Compensation Fund I am entitled to 
                         file damage claims for such deaths. 
                         If you shoot without thinking, you 
                         go to prison and I get paid, that's 
                         how it works. So there will be no 
                         summary executions here. There will 
                         be no interference of any kind with 
                         production. In hopes of ensuring 
                         that, guards will no longer be allowed 
                         on the factory floor without my 
                         authorization.

               His eyes meet Liepold's, hold his icy stare, then return to 
               the guards, most of whom look like tired middle-aged 
               reservists.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         For your cooperation, you have my 
                         gratitude.

               As he steps away he gestures to some kitchen workers. They 
               tear open cases of schnapps and begin setting the bottles 
               out on the tables.

<b>               INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY

               Schindler strolls through his factory looking over the 
               shoulders of the workers, nodding his approval. The place is 
               in full operation, finally; the people, having figured out 
               the complicated Hilos, turning out shells by the caseload.

               Schindler pauses at one of the machines.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

<b>                                     WORKER
</b>                         Good. It's taken a while to calibrate 
                         the machines, but it's going good 
                         now.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Good.

               Schindler nods. Then frowns. He leans down and taps at the 
               crystal of one of the gauges.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         This isn't right, is it?

               The worker kneels down, takes a look. It looks right to him.

               Reaching over, Schindler changes the calibration of the 
               machine with a cavalier adjustment to a knob -- and all the 
               gauge readings shift.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         There. That looks right.

               He wanders off. The worker stares after him. He's just screwed 
               up settings that took weeks to get right.

               Schindler comes up to another worker, Levartov, the 
               hingemaker.

               He's at a machine buffing shells.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

<b>                                     LEVARTOV
</b>                         Good, sir.

               Schindler nods, watches him work, eventually glances away.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Sun's going down.

               Levartov, following Schindler's gaze, nods uncertainly.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         It is Friday, isn't it?

</b>                         Is it?

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         You should be preparing for the 
                         Sabbath, shouldn't you? What are you 
                         doing here?

               Levartov just stares. It's been years since he's been allowed, 
               indeed inclined, to perform Sabbath rites.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

                         to you. Come on, let's go.

               Schindler heads off. The rabbi keeps staring. Schindler 
               gestures back to him, offering casually --

</b>                         Come on.

               Levartov looks around. Finally, he hangs up his goggles and 
               follows after Schindler.

               Under the shadow of a watchtower, among the roof-high tiers 
               of bunks strung with laundry, Levartov recites Kiddush over 
               a cup of wine to workers gathered around him.

               On their bunks, the guards relax with schnapps, cards and 
               magazines. One of them becomes distracted by a distant sound. 
               Some of the others begin to hear it.

               Conversations cease. The barracks gradually becomes quiet, 
               silent, all the guards straining to hear. It sounds like... 
               singing. It sounds like Yiddish singing.

<b>               EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - SAME TIME - NIGHT
</b>
               On a watchtower, a night sentry, unsure where it's coming 
               from, listens to the distant singing. It seems like it's 
               emanating from the surrounding hills, from the trees.

<b>               INT. LIEPOLD'S QUARTERS - SAME TIME - NIGHT
</b>
               At his small desk, Liepold is typing a letter, denouncing 
               Schindler most likely. The pounding keys bury all other sounds 
               but when he pauses to reread what he's typed, he hears it, 
               the singing, faint, far away. He goes to his window, peers 
               out, listens for a moment more, then hears nothing.

               Only the night creatures.

<b>               INT. APATMENT BUILDING - BRINNLITZ - NIGHT

               The door to an apartment opens from the inside revealing 
               Emilie Schindler. She coolly considers the visitor on her 
               doorstep, her estranged husband, looking great as usual, 
               bottle of wine in his hand, smiling as if nothing is wrong 
               between them, as if nothing is wrong in the entire world.

               but he's not sure how to put it, he wants to get it right.

               Finally the words just tumble out --

               There, he's said it. But the bewildered look on Emilie's 
               face wonders, That's what was hard for you to say?

               She's the only woman he's even known who could make him 
               nervous just sitting across a table from him, saying nothing.

                         We can spend time together that way. 
                         We can see each other, see how it

                         dinner, go have a drink, go to a 
                         party, you know. This way we'll see 
                         each other at work, there we are, 
                         same place, we see how it goes...

               His voice trails off. A shrug adds, What do you think? She 
               doesn't answer, but she does love him. He loves her, too.

               It really is a shame they're not right for each other and 
               never will be.

               Stern glances up from his work; Schindler and Emilie have 
               come in and are walking toward the accountant's desk. He 
               gets up.

               Like the doormen and waiters of Cracow, Stern too never 
               imagined Schindler was married and has trouble hiding his 
               astonishment now. He extends his hand to her.

               It sounds strange to Stern hearing Schindler actually say

               He's never said it before.

               He's not sure what she's going to do there, she's not a nurse 
               or a doctor.

               Schindler nods, looks around, shrugs, offers his arm to his 
               wife, perhaps to take her on a tour of the place.

               The Schindlers leave. Stern sits back down at his desk and 
               smiles. He's never seen Schindler so uncomfortable.

               Schindler comes in carrying a radio. He sets it down on a 
               bench where Pfefferberg's working on the frame of a machine 
               motor with a blow torch.

               He leaves. Pfefferberg plugs it into an outlet and switches 
               it on. It works perfectly. A waltz.

<b>               INT. BARRACKS - BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
               In a male barracks, a group of workers including Pfefferberg 
               huddle in a corner around the radio, straining to hear through 
               heavy static a broadcast by the BBC, the Voice of London, a 
               sketchy report of an Eastern offensive by Allied Russian 
               forces.

<b>               INT. CLINIC - BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAY
</b>
               As a camp doctor attends to sufferers of dysentery, Schindler 
               and Emilie sort pairs of prescription glasses from a parcel, 
               shipped from Cracow. Stern comes in.

<b>                                     STERN

</b>                         Stern.

               Schindler sifts through the glasses still in the box, comes 
               up with a particular pair and holds them proudly. Not quite 
               sure what he's seeing is real --

<b>                                     STERN

</b>                         They arrived, can you believe it?

               Stern allows himself a smile, a rare thing for him.

               Schindler carefully slips the new glasses onto the 
               accountant's face. He looks around the clinic, Stern, 
               eventually settling on Emilie, crystal clear, standing near 
               a picture on the wall which, in other circumstances, he'd 
               find less than reassuring: Jesus, his heart exposed and in 
               flames.

<b>               INT. CLINIC - LATER - DAY
</b>
               In a quiet corner of the clinic, Schindler concentrates on 
               the disquieting news Stern has brought him:

<b>                                     STERN
</b>                         We've received a complaint from the 
                         Armaments Board. A very angry 
                         complaint. The artillery shells, the 
                         tank shells, rocket casings -- 
                         apparently all of them -- have failed 
                         quality-control tests.

               Schindler nods soberly. Then dismisses the problem with a 
               shrug.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Well, that's to be expected. They 
                         have to understand. These are start-
                         up problems. This isn't pots and 
                         pans, this is a precise business. 
                         I'll write them a letter.

</b>                         Well, sure. So would I. So would 
                         you. I wouldn't worry about it. We'll 
                         get it right one of these days.

               But Stern is worried about it.

                              (Schindler doesn't 
                              deny it)
                         I don't think that's a good idea.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                              (pause)
                         No?

               Stern slowly shakes his head 'no.'

</b>                         They could close us down.

               Schindler eventually nods, in agreement it seems.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         All right. Call around, find out 
                         where we can buy shells and buy them. 
                         We'll pass them off as ours.

               Stern's not sure he sees the logic. Whether the shells are 
               manufactured here or elsewhere, they'll still eventually 
               reach their intended destination, into the hearts and heads 
               of Germany's enemies.

</b>                         Fewer shells will be made.

               That's another difference. The main one. The only one 
               Schindler cares about. Silence. Then:

</b>                         Stern, if this factory ever produces 
                         a shell that can actually be fired... 
                         I'll be very unhappy.

               A nineteen year old boy with his hands in the air stands 
               terrified before Commandant Liepold and the revolver he 
               wields. Workers, trying to reduce the likelihood of getting 
               hit by a stray bullet when Liepold fires on the boy -- which 
               seems a certainty -- scramble out of the way.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER (O.S.)
</b>                         Hey.

               Liepold swings the gun around at the voice, pointing it for 
               a moment at Schindler, who is striding toward him, then aims 
               the barrel back at the boy's head, and yells --

<b>                                     LIEPOLD
</b>                         Department W does not forbid my 
                         presence on the factory floor. That 
                         is a lie.

               He waves a document at Schindler, throws it at him.

               Schindler doesn't bother picking it up. Instead, pointing at 
               the boy, he yells to Liepold --

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Shoot him. Shoot him!

               Liepold is so startled by the command, he doesn't shoot. He 
               doesn't lower the gun, though, either.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Shoot him without a hearing. Come 
                         on.

               His finger is on the trigger, Liepold is torn, frustrated, 
               hating the situation he has created. As the moments without 
               a blast stretch out, both and Schindler begin to settle down.

               Schindler glances to the boy. Then at the silent Hilo beside 
               him. Part of it is blackened from an electrical fire. To the 
               boy, concerned --

               The boy, too terrified to speak, nods.

</b>                         But the machine.

               Liepold glances to him. He seems almost distraught by the 
               destruction of the machine, Schindler.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

                         will preside over the hearing.

               Liepold isn't sure that's correct, but he has no 
               documentation, at least not on him, to refute it.

<b>               INT. FACTORY - NIGHT

               In the machine-tool section, a "judicial table" has been set 
               up. At it sit Schindler, Liepold, two other SS officers, and 
               an attractive German girl, a stenographer. The "saboteur," 
               the boy, Janek, stands before the court.

<b>                                     JANEK
</b>                         I'm unfamiliar with the Hilo machines. 
                         I don't know why I was assigned there.

               Commandant Liepold was watching me trying to figure it out. 
               I switched it on and it blew up. I didn't do anything. All I 
               did was turn it on.

               Gone tonight is Schindler's usual shop-floor familiarity. He 
               studies the boy solemn-faced.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

               Schindler dismisses the defensive comment with a wave of his 
               hand and gets up. He comes around and paces slowly before 
               the boy. Eventually, Janek dares to speak again --

<b>                                     JANEK
</b>                         Sir?

               Schindler glances up at him distractedly.

<b>                                     JANEK
</b>                         I did adjust the pressure controls.

               Schindler stops, looks to the panel, and back to the boy.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         What?

</b>                         I know that much about them. Somebody 
                         had set the pressure controls wrong. 
                         I had to adjust --

               Schindler slams the back of his hand so hard across Janek's 
               face, the boy almost falls. He's stunned. So are the others 
               at the table. They've never seen such violence from the 
               Direktor. He roars --

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         The stupidity of these people. I 
                         wish they were capable of sabotaging 
                         a machine.

               Schindler's hand comes up again and Janek recoils, expecting 
               another blow. Schindler manages to hold it.

               A guard escorts the prisoner away. The panel members glance 
               among themselves. Is that it? Schindler faces them and groans 
               in dismay.

               Liepold at his desk, typing again. This time there is no 
               doubt he is composing a letter denouncing Schindler.

               Schindler and Emilie, her arm in his, stand around like 
               unwanted guests at the party. They probably are. Him anyway. 
               The other guests include local politicians who fought and 
               failed to keep his camp out of Brinnlitz.

               Whenever his glance meets one of theirs, they smile tightly.

                         Isn't this nice.

               It's not at all nice. He feels out of place, a feeling he's 
               not accustomed to. Fortunately, a man in uniform, someone 
               Schindler can relate to, approaches cheerfully, his hand 
               outstretched.

               Rasch and Schindler sharing cognac in the privacy of the

               continues, the sounds filtering in.

               Rasch calmly nurses his drink, his eyes revealing nothing of 
               what's going on behind them, except that the statement 
               requires some elaboration.

               Rasch smiles faintly. Yes, he's familiar, as are officials 
               throughout much of Europe, with the gratitude of Oskar 
               Schindler.

<b>               INT. MACHINE SHOP - BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT

               Poldek Pfefferberg holds up a pistol, feels its weight, points 
               it.

                         Careful.

               Pfefferberg smiles, lowers the gun, kneels beside an open 
               crate of weapons: a couple of revolvers and rifles, an old 
               carbine.

<b>               INT. FACTORY - DAY
</b>
               From high above the factory, Stern can be seen among the 
               machines talking with a worker. The man points up and returns 
               to his work.

               Stern stares up, puzzled. He locates a ladder that connects 
               the shop-floor to a series of overhead planks and, with 
               trepidation, climbs.

               He reaches a shaky landing high above the machines, navigates 
               the primitive catwalks with great care, comes to a large 
               water tank near the workshop ceiling.

</b>                         Stern.

               Above the rim of the tank, amid rising steam, Schindler's 
               head appears. Then disappears. Stern climbs a set of rungs 
               on the tank, reaches the top and finds inside, lolling in 
               the steaming water, Schindler and the blonde stenographer 
               from the trial.

</b>                         Excuse me.

               Neither Schindler nor the blonde seems the least bit 
               embarrassed. Only Stern. He tries hard to pretend the girl 
               isn't there, but he just can't.

<b>                                     STERN

</b>                         No, no, what, what is it?

               Schindler floats over closer to him, waits for him to report 
               whatever it is he has come to report, leans closer. Finally, 
               quietly --

</b>                         Do you have any money I don't know 
                         about? Hidden away someplace?

               Schindler thinks long and hard...

</b>                         No.

               Silence except for the gently lapping water. Half-joking --

</b>                         Why, am I broke?

               Stern glances away, doesn't answer, just stares off. And a 
               slight, slight smile, a gambler's philosophical smile upon 
               being purged of his wealth, appears on Schindler's face.

<b>               EXT. RURAL BRINNLITZ - DAY

               In the distance, a lone boxcar, stark against the winter 
               landscape. There are patches of snow on the ground. A cold 
               wind blows through bare trees.

               Tight on Poldek Pfefferberg's eyes behind a welder's mask.

               He turns from his work to the voice, welding torch in his 
               hand.

<b>               EXT. RURAL BRINNLITZ - DAY

               The torch firing at ice as hard as metal, blue flame, white 
               steam. Pfefferberg's eyes behind the mask again, 
               concentrating.

               Around the abandoned boxcar, in the gruesome cold, stand 
               Schindler, Emilie, a doctor, some workers and some SS guards, 
               watching, waiting.

               Pfefferberg steps back. Sledge hammers pound at locks.

               Hands pull at levers. The doors begin to slide.

               Out of darkness, from inside the boxcar as the doors slide 
               open, Schindler's face is revealed, tight. He stares for an 
               interminable moment before walking slowly away.

               Inside the boxcar is a tangle of limbs, a pyramid of corpses, 
               frozen white.

               From a distance, a tableau: the boxcar, the workers and guards 
               and Emilie outside it, Schindler, off to himself several 
               steps away, all of them still as statues.

<b>               EXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - OUTSIDE BRINNLITZ - DAY

               Beyond a country church, among the stone markers of a small 
               cemetery, walk Schindler and a priest.

                         not. As a human being I will not.

               The priest nods; he seems relatively empathic. He offers an 
               alternative --

                         reserved for the burial of suicides. 
                         Maybe I can convince the parish 
                         council to allow them to be buried 
                         there.

</b>                         These aren't suicides.

               The priest knows that. But he also knows that the provisions 
               of Canon Law regarding who can and cannot be buried in 
               consecrated ground are narrow.

               As workers harness horses to carts, others hoist the coffins 
               into them. Schindler is there, watching. He glances up at 
               one of the guard towers, expecting, perhaps, to be felled by 
               a bullet.

               Beyond the wire, Rabbi Levartov leads the horse-drawn carts.

               Around him walk a minyan -- a quorum of ten males necessary 
               for the rite. A few guards lag behind.

<b>               INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - SAME TIME - DAY

               Work continues, but it's apparent in their eyes they are 
               only physically here; in spirit they are all walking alongside 
               the carts, one great moral force.

               The roar of a machine suddenly, inexplicably, dies. Then 
               another. And another. Schindler, standing at the main power 
               panel, pulls the last of the switches, and the factory plunges 
               into absolute silence.

<b>               EXT. CATHOLIC CEMETERY - DAY

               Just beyond the perimeter of the Catholic cemetery, the minyan 
               quickly and quietly recites Kaddish over the dead as their 
               coffins are lowered into individual graves.

               Then, there is only a low breathing of wind.

               Amon Goeth, in civilian clothes, emerges from a car. His 
               eyes, sallow from inadequate sleep, sweep across the fortified 
               compound with envy. It's a nice place Oskar's got here.

               Stern, at a window, stares down at Goeth beside his car.

               Schindler appears beside Stern, glances down. He's lost 
               weight, Goeth. The old suit he wears seems too big for him.

               Alone down there he seems disoriented.

               Workers glance up at a horrible apparition from the pit of 
               their foulest dreams -- Amon Goeth crossing through the 
               factory.

               Schindler, his arm around the killer's shoulder as if he 
               were a long lost brother, leads him across the shop-floor, 
               proudly pointing out to him the huge thundering Hilo machines.

<b>               INT. OFFICES, BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY

               Schindler takes an old suitcase from his office closet, sets 
               it on his desk, snaps it open revealing clothes, Goeth's 
               uniforms, his medals. The ex-Oberstrumfuhrer touches the 
               fabric gently, then glances up gratefully to his friend.

               Beyond the frosted glass of Schindler's office door, Stern 
               can see the wavering forms of the two Nazi Party members 
               sharing cognac and stories.

<b>               INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - DAY

               Warmed by cognac and friendship, Goeth comes through the 
               factory again carrying the suitcase, Schindler at his side, 
               steering him to some degree.

               Goeth's hand comes up to his cheek as if to brush away a 
               bothersome fly. But it isn't a fly. One of the workers has 
               spit on him. He turns in disbelief.

               Silence as his hand drops to his side, to the holster he 
               forgets isn't there. He glances around for SS guards... who 
               aren't there. He looks to Schindler, thoroughly confused, 
               and whispers --

                         factory floor. They make my workers 
                         nervous.

               Goeth stares at him bewildered. Then again at the worker who 
               spit. Then at other workers, the resolve in their eyes.

               They know he has no power here, and sense he has no power 
               anywhere. His own eyes drift to a woman with yarn in her 
               lap, knitting needles in her hands. Is this a dream?

</b>                         I'll discipline him later.

               Schindler good-naturedly throws an arm around Goeth's shoulder 
               and leads him away. The workers watch as the two Germans 
               disappear out the factory doors.

<b>               INT. GUARDS' BARRACKS - EVENING
</b>
               A guard slowly turns the dial of a radio, finding and losing 
               in static several different voices in several languages, 
               none of them lasting more than a moment.

               Depression hangs over the barracks. Most of the guards are 
               straining to hear the news they've been fearing for some 
               time now, some on their bunks just staring, one at a window 
               peering out at the black face of a forest as if expecting, 
               at any moment, to see Russian or American troops appear.

<b>               INT. WORKER'S BARRACKS - SAME TIME - EVENING
</b>
               Another radio. Workers, like the guards, straining to hear.

               The dial finds, faint, mired in static, the idiosyncratic 
               voice of Winston Churchill.

<b>               INT. LIEPOLD'S QUARTERS - SAME TIME - EVENING
</b>
               Schindler on Liepold's doorstep. The two men considering 
               each other across the threshold. Radio static filters out 
               from Liepold's room. The word "Eisenhower" cuts through before 
               the speaker's voice is buried again.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         It's time the guards came into the 
                         factory.

               He turns and walks away.

<b>               INT. BRINNLITZ FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
               All twelve hundred workers and all the guards are gathered 
               for the first time on the factory floor. Tension and 
               uncertainty surround them. It's ominously quiet. Then --

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         The unconditional surrender of Germany 
                         has just been announced. At midnight 
                         tonight the war is over.

               It is not his intention to elicit celebration. Indeed, his 
               words, echoing and fading in the factory, echo the doubts 
               they all feel.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER

                         of looking for survivors of your 
                         families. In many cases you won't 
                         find them. After six long years of 
                         murder, victims are being mourned 
                         throughout the world.

               Not by Untersturmfuhrer Liepold. He stands with his men, 
               dying to lift his rifle and fire.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         We've survived. Some of you have 
                         come up to me and thanked me. Thank 
                         yourselves. Thank your fearless Stern, 
                         and others among you, who, worrying 
                         about you, have faced death every 
                         moment.
                              (glancing away)
                         Thank you.

               He's looking at the guards, thanking them, which thoroughly 
               confuses the workers. Just when they thought they knew where 
               his sentiments lay, he's thanking guards.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         You've shown extraordinary discipline. 
                         You've behaved humanely here. You 
                         should be proud.

               Or is he attempting to adjust reality, to destroy the SS as 
               combatants, to alter the self-image of both the guards and 
               the prisoners? Moving across the SS men's faces, they remain 
               inscrutable. Schindler turns his attention back to the 
               workers, and, not at all like a confession, but rather like 
               simple statements of fact:

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         I'm a member of the Nazi party. I'm 
                         a munitions manufacturer. I'm a 
                         profiteer of slave labor, I'm a 
                         criminal. At midnight, you will be 
                         free and I will be hunted.
                              (pause)
                         I'll remain with you until five 
                         minutes after midnight After which 
                         time, and I hope you'll forgive me, 
                         I have to flee.

               That worries the workers. Whenever he leaves, something 
               terrible always seems to happen.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         In memory of the countless victims 
                         among your people, I ask us to observe 
                         three minutes of silence.

               In the quiet, in the silence, drifting slowly across the 
               faces of the workers -- the elderly, the lame, teenagers, 
               wives beside husbands, children beside their parents, families 
               together -- it becomes clear, if it wasn't before, that both 
               as a prison and a manufacturing enterprise, the Brinnlitz 
               camp has been one long sustained confidence game.

               Schindler has never stood still so long in his life. He does 
               now, though, framed by his giant Hilo machines, silent at 
               the close of the noisiest of wars, his head bowed, mourning 
               the many dead.

               When he finally does look up he sees that he is the last to 
               do so. The faces, few of which he recognizes, are all looking 
               at him. He turns to speak to the guards along the wall again.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         I know you've received orders from 
                         our Commandant -- which he has 
                         received from his superiors -- to 
                         dispose of the population of this 
                         camp.

               Apprehension spreads across the factory like a wave.

               Pfefferberg tightens his grip on the pistol under his coat.

               His ragtag irregulars do the same, the rest of their ersatz 
               "arsenal" concealed behind a machine. To the guards:

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Now would be the time to do it. 
                         They're all here. This is your 
                         opportunity.

               The guards hold their weapons, as they have from the moment 
               they arrived here tonight, at attention, waiting it seems, 
               to be given the official order from their Commander, Liepold, 
               who appears ready to give it.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Or...
                              (he shrugs)
                         ...you could leave. And return to 
                         your families as men instead of 
                         murderers.

               Long, long silence. Finally, one of the guards slowly lowers 
               his rifle, breaks ranks and walks away. Then another. And 
               another. And another. Another.

               When the last is gone, the workers consider Liepold. He 
               appears more an oddity than a threat. He is more an oddity 
               than a threat. And he knows it. He turns and leaves.

<b>               EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT

               A watchtower. Abandoned. The perimeter wire. No sentries.

               The guard barracks. Deserted. The SS is long gone.

<b>               EXT. COURTYARD - BRINNLITZ CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
               Schindler and Emilie emerge from his quarters, each carrying 
               a small suitcase. In the dark, some distance away from his 
               Mercedes, stand all twelve hundred workers. As Schindler and 
               his wife cross the courtyard to the car, Stern and Levartov 
               approach. The rabbi hands him some papers.

<b>                                     LEVARTOV
</b>                         We've written a letter trying to 
                         explain things. In case you're 
                         captured. Every worker has signed 
                         it.

               Schindler sees a list of signatures beginning below the 
               typewritten text and continuing for several pages. He pockets 
               it, this new list of names.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Thank you.

               Stern steps forward and places a ring in Schindler's hand.

               It's a gold band, like a wedding ring. Schindler notices an 
               inscription inside it.

<b>                                     STERN
</b>                         It's Hebrew. It says, 'Whoever saves 
                         one life, saves the world.'

               Schindler slips the ring onto a finger, admires it a moment, 
               nods his thanks, then seems to withdraw.

                         I could've got more out...

               Stern isn't sure he heard right. Schindler steps away from 
               him, from his wife, from the car, from the workers.

               Schindler starts to lose it, the tears coming. Stern, too.

               The look on Schindler's face as his eyes sweep across the 
               faces of the workers is one of apology, begging them to 
               forgive him for not doing more.

               lapel and holds it out to Stern pathetically.

                         could've gotten one more person I 
                         didn't.

               He completely breaks down, weeping convulsively, the emotion 
               he's been holding in for years spilling out, the guilt 
               consuming him.

               From above, from a watchtower, Stern can be seen down below, 
               trying to comfort Schindler. Eventually, they separate, and 
               Schindler and Emilie climb into the Mercedes. It slowly pulls 
               out through the gates of the camp. And drives away.

               A panzer emerges from the treeline well beyond the wire of 
               the camp and just sits there growling like a beast. Suddenly 
               it fires a shell at nothing in particular, at the night -- 
               an exhibition of random spite -- then turns around and rolls 
               back into the forest.

               From a watchtower, a couple of workers, having witnessed the 
               tank's display of impotent might, can make little sense of 
               it. Below, many of the workers mill around the yard, waiting 
               to be liberated. No one seems to know what else to do.

               Some Czech partisans emerge from the forest. They come down

               the hill and casually approach the camp. Reaching the wire,

               Shapes materialize out of the darkness within the camp.

               Several armed and dangerous Jews.

<b>               EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - LATER - NIGHT
</b>
               As the cyclists fill their tanks with gasoline borrowed from 
               the camp, the workers keep their rifles pointed at them. The 
               NCO in charge lines the gas cans neatly back up against the 
               wire.

<b>                                     NCO IN CHARGE
</b>                         Thank you very much.

               He climbs onto his motorcycle. The others climb onto theirs.

               And drive away.

<b>               EXT. BRINNLITZ CAMP - DAWN
</b>
               A lone Russian officer on horseback, tattered coat, rope for 
               reins, emerges from the forest. As he draws nearer, it becomes 
               apparent to the workers assembling on the camp yard, that 
               the horse is a mere pony, the Russian's feet in stirrups 
               nearly touching the ground beneath the animal's skinny 
               abdomen.

               He reaches the camp, climbs easily down from the horse and, 
               in a loud voice, addresses the hundreds of workers standing 
               at the fence:

<b>                                     RUSSIAN
</b>                         You have been liberated by the Soviet 
                         Army.

               This is it? This one man? The workers wait for him to say 
               more. He waits for them to move, to leave, to go home. Finally --

<b>                                     RUSSIAN
</b>                         What's wrong?

               A few of the workers come out from behind the fence to talk 
               with him.

<b>                                     WORKER
</b>                         Have you been in Poland?

<b>                                     RUSSIAN
</b>                         I just came from Poland.

<b>                                     WORKER
</b>                         Are there any Jews left?

               The Russian has to think. Eventually he shrugs, 'no,' not 
               that he saw, and climbs back onto his pony to leave.

<b>                                     WORKER
</b>                         Where should we go?

<b>                                     RUSSIAN
</b>                         I don't know. Don't go east, that's 
                         for sure, they hate you there.
                              (pause)
                         I wouldn't go west either if I were 
                         you.

               He shrugs and gives his little horse a kick in the ribs.

<b>                                     WORKER
</b>                         We could use some food.

               The Russian looks confused, glances off. The quiet hamlet of 
               Brinnlitz sits there against the mountains not half a mile 
               away.

<b>                                     RUSSIAN
</b>                         Isn't that a town over there?

               Of course it is. But the idea that they could simply walk 
               over there is completely foreign to them. The Russian rides 
               away.

<b>               EXT. BRINNLITZ - DAY
</b>
               All twelve hundred of them, a great moving crowd coming 
               forward, crosses the land laying between the camp, behind 
               them, and the town, in front of them.

               Tight on the FACE of one of the MEN.

               Tight on TYPEWRITER KEYS rapping his NAME.

               Tight on A PEN scratching out the words, "METAL POLISHER" on 
               a form.

               Tight on the KEYS typing, "TEACHER." Tight on his FACE in 
               the crowd.

               Tight on the face of a woman in the moving crowd. The keys 
               typing her name. The pen scratching out "LATHE OPERATOR." 
               The keys typing "PHYSICIAN." Tight on her face.

               Tight on a man's face. His name. Pen scratching out 
               "ELECTRICIAN." Keys typing "MUSICIAN." His face.

               A woman's face. Name. Pen scratching out "MACHINIST." Keys 
               typing "MERCHANT." Face.

               "CARPENTER." Face. "SECRETARY." Face. "DRAFTSMAN." Face.

               "PAINTER." Face. "JOURNALIST." Face. "NURSE." Face.

               "JUDGE." Face. Face. Face. Face.

<b>               EXT. FRANKFURT - DUSK (1955)
</b>
               A street of apartment buildings in a working class 
               neighborhood of the city.

<b>               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK
</b>
               The door to a modest apartment opens revealing Oskar 
               Schindler. The elegant clothes are gone but the familiar 
               smile remains.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Hey, how you doing?

               It's Poldek Pfefferberg out in the hall.

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG
</b>                         Good. How's it going?

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Things are great, things are great.

               Things don't look so great. Schindler isn't penniless, but 
               he's not far from it, living alone in the one room behind 
               him.

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG
</b>                         What are you doing?

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll 
                         have a drink.

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG
</b>                         I mean where have you been? Nobody's 
                         seen you around for a while.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                              (puzzled)
                         I've been here. I guess I haven't 
                         been out.

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG
</b>                         I thought maybe you'd like to come 
                         over, have some dinner, some of the 
                         people are coming over.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER
</b>                         Yeah? Yeah, that'd be nice, let me 
                         get my coat.

               Pfefferberg waits out in the hall as Schindler disappears 
               inside for a minute. The legend below appears:

<b>               AMON GOETH WAS ARRESTED AGAIN, WHILE A PATIENT IN AN 
</b><b>               SANITARIUM AT BAD TOLZ. GIVING THE NATIONAL SOCIALIST SALUTE, 
</b><b>               HE WAS HANGED IN CRACOW FOR CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY.
</b>
               Schindler reappears wearing a coat, steps out into the hall, 
               forgets something, turns around and goes back in.

<b>               OSKAR SCHINDLER FAILED AT SEVERAL BUSINESSES, AND MARRIAGE, 
</b><b>               AFTER THE WAR IN 1958, HE WAS DECLARED A RIGHTEOUS PERSON BY 
</b><b>               THE COUNCIL OF THE YAD VASHEM IN JERUSALEM, AND INVITED TO 
</b><b>               PLANT A TREE IN THE AVENUE OF THE RIGHTEOUS. IT GROWS THERE 
</b><b>               STILL.
</b>
               He comes back out with a nice bottle of wine in his hand, 
               and, as he and Pfefferberg disappear down the stairs together --

<b>                                     SCHINDLER'S VOICE
</b>                         Mila's good?

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG'S VOICE
</b>                         She's good.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER'S VOICE
</b>                         Kids are good? Let's stop at a store 
                         on the way so I can buy them 
                         something.

<b>                                     PFEFFERBERG'S VOICE
</b>                         They don't need anything. They just 
                         want to see you.

<b>                                     SCHINDLER'S VOICE
</b>                         Yeah, I know. I'd like to pick up 
                         something for them. It'll only take 
                         a minute.

               Their voices face. Against the empty hallway appears a faint 
               trace of the image of the factory workers, through the wire, 
               walking away from the Brinnlitz camp. And the legend:

<b>               THERE ARE FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND JEWS LEFT ALIVE IN POLAND 
</b><b>               TODAY. THERE ARE MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND DESCENDANTS OF THE
