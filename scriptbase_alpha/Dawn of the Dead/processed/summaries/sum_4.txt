In this sequel of "Night of the Living Dead," it's a few weeks later after the events of "Night."
The situation is getting worse, so two reporters, along with two SWAT team members, decide to steal a helicopter to find a place where they can hide from flesh-eating zombies.
They find a secluded mall and decide to stop there for the night in order to get some sleep.
Then, they decide to stay in the mall for much longer, and they barricade themselves in a small room while periodically going downstairs to get things they need, while defending themselves against the zombies and a biker gang in the meantime.
