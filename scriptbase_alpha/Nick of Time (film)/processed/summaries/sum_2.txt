Gene Watson is an ordinary public accountant returning home from his ex-wife's funeral and is met by Mr Smith and Ms. Jones who kidnap his daughter and give him a gun, six bullets, a name-tag that will give him access to anywhere in a specific hotel, and the itinerary of Governor Grant and is informed that he must kill the Governor in 1 hour and 15 minutes or his daughter will die.
The rest of the movie follows Mr. Watson as he desperately attempts to warn the Governor without the knowledge of the two and finds out that the conspiracy against her reaches all the way to those she trusts most.
