     INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

     JUDGE GOINES turns to the Jury FOREMAN.

                         JUDGE GOINES
               Mister Foreman, have you arrived
               at a verdict?

                         FOREMAN
               We have, your honor.  We find the
               defendant guilty of all the charges.

                  TITLES BEGIN OVER THE SCENE

     ANGLE ON THE DEFENDANT,  BERNIE LAPLANTE

     Forty, rumpled, cheap suit, cheap haircut.  He reacts, turning
     to the jury, indignant.

     His attorney, DONNA O'DAY, rises.  She's twenty-four, looks
     younger.

                         DONNA
               Your honor, may I approach the
               bench?

     As BERNIE fumes, the JUDGE, DONNA and the youthful clean-cut
     PROSECUTOR engage in an earnest, inaudible discussion.

     Frustrated, Bernie is watching them when he notices something
     that distracts him from his anguish.

     Donna's wallet is lying in her open attache case.  The open top
     of the case screens the wallet from the view of the JURY, THE
     JUDGE, COURT REPORTERS, etc.

     Bernie looks around, checking the spectators section.

     No spectators.

                           TITLE CONTINUE

     Bernie gets the wallet to his lap.  In between cautious glances
     toward the bench where the conference continues inaudibly, he
     surreptitiously selects <u>some</u> of the twenties and <u>some</u> of the
     tens from the wallet.

     AT THE BENCH

     The conference breaks up, DONNA heads back toward the defense
     table.

     The wallet still concealed in his lap under the table, BERNIE
     is indignant.

                         BERNIE
               What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What
               is this?

                         DONNA
               I got your bail continued.

                         BERNIE
               Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!

     The JUDGE gavels for order as BERNIE slips DONNA's "lightened"
     wallet back into her attache case unseen.

                         JUDGE GOINES
               Mister LaPlante, I have been
               persuaded in view of your continued
               employment and your lack of prior
               convictions, to continue your bail
               under the same conditions
               heretofore, pending sentencing six
               days from now.  In the meantime you
               will make an appointment with the
               probation officer who will make a
               recommendation to me regarding your
               sentence.  I urge you to use these
               six days to set your personal
               affairs in order in anticipation
               of incarceration.

                     THE TITLES CONCLUDE


     INT.  CORRIDOR/HALL OF JUSTICE - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

     BERNIE and DONNA are hurrying along the crowded corridor outside
     the courtroom.

                         BERNIE
               "Anticipation of incarceration"?

                         DONNA
                    (upset)
               He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.

                         BERNIE
               I know what he means.  I'm not a
               prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm
               a goddamn working man for
               Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my
               income a little with some
               "business deals," maybe summa the
               guys I sell to are crooks, how
               would I know, I'm not an
               investigator.  You can't make it
               on a wage no more, not in this
               country.

                         DONNA
               I think our best course right now
               would be to focus on the Probation
               Officer's report...

                         BERNIE
               He gives a good report and I walk?

                         DONNA
               We can hope.
                    (consulting her notes)
               You still have your job, right?

                         BERNIE
               Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They
               think I got the flu.

                         DONNA
               And a son by your ex-wife?  Joseph.

                         BERNIE
               A son, yeah.  What about him?  Joey.

                         DONNA
               Are you pretty involved in his
               upbringing?

                         BERNIE
               Involved!  Christ!  She attached my
               goddamn paycheck!  Child support.
               Why do you think I can't afford a
               lawyer?
                    (then...)
               You know what I mean.  Why I got
               a court appointed lawyer instead
               of a, uh, more experienced...

                         DONNA
               I understand.  How often do you see
               your son?

                         BERNIE
               Often, uh.

                         DONNA
               How recently?

                         BERNIE
               Uh, his birthday, uh, May.  I
               think.

                         DONNA
               It's November.

                         BERNIE
                    (beat... beat...
                    beat...)
               She don't like me to see him.
               Says I'm a bad influence.

                         DONNA
               I think you should visit your son.
               And try and get your boss to write
               a note about your performance on
               the job.  You need to create the
               impression of a responsible, decent
               citizen with familial
               responsibilities who happened to
               slip up once.

     They have reached the front door.  BERNIE nods, about to exit.

                         DONNA
                    (with difficulty)
               Uh, I know you're having financial
               difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but
               I wonder if... I mean, the money
               I loaned you...

                         BERNIE
               Some of it.  Right here.  I got some
               of it.  I'll get the rest as soon
               as I can.

     BERNIE pulls out the crumpled bills he took from Donna's wallet
     and hands them to her.

                         DONNA
                    (surprised and touched)
               I know things are difficult for you,
               Mister LaPlante.  I don't want to
               take your last dime...

     BERNIE is already reaching for a twenty.

                         BERNIE
               Right.  I better keep some if I'm
               gonna see the kid.  For gas and
               stuff.

     Then, unable to resist the chance, he snatches another.


     EXT.  LION CAGES/ZOO - ANOTHER DAY

     A LION lies glumly in his cage, staring balefully through the
     bars at BERNIE who stares balefully back, contemplating the iron
     bars.  At BERNIE'S side is a ten year old boy, JOEY, whose neat,
     scrubbed appearance is in sharp contrast to BERNIE'S rumpled,
     slightly soiled look.

                         JOEY
               Wow!  Look at that one!

     JOEY is indicating the next cage where a BLACK PANTHER is pacing
     restlessly to and fro.

                         JOEY
               If you were in there, he'd kill you,
               wouldn't he...Dad?

     As Bernie looks at the PANTHER, the muscular beast looks right
     into BERNIE'S eyes with the furious yellow stare as if to say
     "I'm waiting."

                         BERNIE
               Yeah, yeah, something like that.


     INT.  FLUKY'S RESTAURANT - AN HOUR LATER (DAY)

     BERNIE and JOEY facing each other in a booth, eating burgers.

                         BERNIE
               This guy, this "friend" your
               mother's seeing, he's a fireman,
               huh?  He ever... spend the night,
               whatsisname?

                         JOEY
               Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He
               saved a guy's life one time.  In
               a fire.

                         BERNIE
               Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?
                    (a beat, then...)
               Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?

                         JOEY
               "The Nomm"?  What's that?

                         BERNIE
               It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't
               matter.

                         JOEY
               Were you in it?  In the war?

                         BERNIE
               You never saw that picture, huh?

                         JOEY
               What picture?

                         BERNIE
               Me in my uniform.  Used to be on
               the bookcase.


     INT.  MEN'S ROOM/FLUKY'S - TEN MINUTES LATER (DAY)

     Deserted except for BERNIE and JOEY side by side at the urinals.
     BERNIE glances at JOEY.

                         BERNIE
               Whatcha gotta do there, buddy, is
               ya gotta get in close so ya don't
               piss on yer shoes.
               It don't matter <u>now</u> cause you're
               wearin' them sneakers but the time's
               gonna come when you're gonna be
               wearin' good shoes, expensive ones,
               and you don't wanna piss on them,
               you wanna protect 'em.  From piss,
               from tough guys, from everything.

                  -- ALTERNATE VERSION --

                         BERNIE
               What I don't like about public
               restrooms is how you're always
               standing in piss.  It don't matter
               to you, you got those sneakers but
               I'm standing in piss in very
               expensive shoes.  It's a breakdown
               in custodial services.

     JOEY steals a glance at BERNIE, sees him "shake it off" and zip
     up.  JOEY does likewise.

                         JOEY
               Are you gonna take me somewhere next
               weekend?

                         BERNIE
               I'm working on that.  It's just I
               got some business problems and...
               whatsa matter?

     JOEY is heading for one of the stalls.  He reaches underneath
     and pulls out a wallet.

                         JOEY
               Somebody lost a wallet.

     BERNIE is extremely interested, takes the wallet JOEY holds out
     and glances inside.

     Cash.  A couple of fifties.


     INT.  FLUKY'S - SECONDS LATER (DAY)

     BERNIE and JOEY exit the Men's Room and head for the door to
     the parking lot, BERNIE explaining...

                         BERNIE
               You give it to the manager, he
               pockets the dough, throws the wallet
               away.  Most people who work in
               supervisory positions... I'm not
               saying all... are crooks.

     JOEY casts a hasty glance at TEENAGER who's wearing the
     Manager Badge.  <u>The</u> <u>youth</u> <u>could</u> <u>not</u> <u>look</u> <u>more</u> <u>innocent</u> <u>if</u> <u>he</u>
     <u>wore</u> <u>a</u> <u>halo.</u>


     EXT.  PARKING LOT - DAY

     A BAG LADY pushing two shopping carts through the parking lot
     spots BERNIE and JOEY crossing her path...

                         BAG LAOY
               Excuse me, sir, could you spare...?

                         BERNIE
               No way, lady, not a chance.

     BERNIE hurries past her, notices JOEY looking back at the
     miserable woman.

                         BERNIE
               You gotta resist the urge to be nice
               to those people, they're con
               artists, they take advantage of the
               soft heart.  A lot of 'em are
               financially better off than the
               rest of us.

     Arriving at an ancient, battered Toyota, BERNIE searches for
     his keys and then fusses with the lock.

                         BERNIE
               What I'm gonna do on this wallet
               thing is, Monday, day after
               tomorrow, I'm gonna have my
               secretary phone this guy up from
               the name on his driver's license
               Let the guy come and get his wallet
               and make sure you get a reward.
               You deserve a reward.  You want
               one, doncha?  A reward?  Gwan, get
               in.


     INT.  TOYOTA/MOVING/FREEWAY - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)

     BERNIE is at the wheel, the car is gasping, struggling.

                         BERNIE
               Whatcha gotta do, you gotta look
               out for number one.  It sounds
               harsh, but it's a goddamn (excuse
               the vulgarity) jungle out there,
               kid.  That's why you gotta keep a
               low profile!  Right?  A low
               profile!
               It's where you don't give nobody
               nothin' to shoot at, stay outta
               sight, be parta the woodwork, don't
               ever tell 'em your name, they'll
               use it against you.

     JOEY is looking for the right exit sign.  He spots it.

                         JOEY
               Here.  Get off here.

                         BERNIE
                    (a look at Joey)
               Thanks.  Thanks, pal.

     JOEY looks pleased.


     EXT.  EVELYN'S HOUSE/INT. TOYOTA - LATER - DAY

     BERNIE is turning onto a suburban street, checking the houses.

                         BERNIE
               Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying
               this relationship we got going here.
               I been missing out on not knowing
               you better.  Thing is, I got all
               this business stuff...

                         JOEY
               I could go to a movie Thursday
               night.  'Cause we don't have
               school on Friday.

     BERNIE pulls the car up in front of a single story two bedroom
     house.

                         BERNIE
               Here we are.  Yeah, that's a
               possibility.  A movie.  Now you gwan
               in, tell your mother I got you back
               on time.  Point that out to her.
               She was always on my case for stuff
               like that.  She's still like that,
               right?

                         JOEY
                    (a little grin, his
                     first)
               Yeah.
                    (getting out)
               I'll see ya... dad.

     JOEY gets out and runs toward the house.  BERNIE watches him
     go.  Then he pulls out the wallet, thumbs the cash, glances at
     the credit cards.


     INT.  SHADOW LOUNGE - NIGHT

     The bored, fiftyish bartender, CHICK, is watching the TV mounted
     over the bar in this unfashionable, nearly-deserted joint.  He
     looks up when the door opens.

                         CHICK
               Bernie!  Where ya been, Pal?

     Arriving at the bar, BERNIE surveys the dimly lit room, checking
     the booths and tables for customers.  Not many.

                         BERNIE
               Some guys been looking for me,
               Chick?  Spanish kinda guys.

                         CHICK
               Spanish kinda guys!

                         BERNIE
               Business thing.  Gimme a seven and
               seven, willya?

     BERNIE checks his watch, takes a seat, puts a twenty on the bar.

                         CHICK
               What is it, five days now I don't
               see you!

                         BERNIE
               'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is
               why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal
               problems... Nobody was asking for
               me, huh?

     BERNIE looks around nervously, peering into the shadowy booths
     and rear tables as CHICK puts a drink in front of him.

                         CHICK
               Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta
               have a good attorney.

                         BERNIE
               My attorney, she's just outta law
               school, about a couple of years
               older than my kid, for Chrissake.

                         CHICK
               You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?

                         BERNIE
               Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah,
               ten.  Nice kid.

                         CHICK
               You got a ten year old attorney,
               Bernie?

                         BERNIE
               I can't afford no better.  My ex,
               she attached my pay check for child
               support payments.
                    (turning)
               You looking for Bernie LaPlante by
               any chance?

     A MAN who's just entered the lounge shakes his head no and heads
     for a table where he's greeted by the COCKTAIL WAITRESS.

                         CHICK
               I didn't even know you had a kid.

                         BERNIE
                    (thoughtful)
               The thing about kids is, they're
               so... young!  They don't know
               nothin' yet.  When you're a kid,
               you think you're gonna grow up an'
               be a "wonderful person" instead of
               an asshole, like everybody else.

                         CHICK
               We're all assholes, Bernie?

                         BERNIE
                    (ignoring him)
               When I was a kid, I thought I was
               gonna be this fantastic wonderful
               heroic human being.

                         ESPINOSA'S VOICE (O.S)
               You Bernie Planta?

     BERNIE turns.

     Two Latinos are right behind him, low lifes, ESPINOSA and
     VARGAS.

                         BERNIE
               LaPlante.  Bernie LaPlante.  You the
               guys Bunny called, huh?


     INT.  BACK BOOTH/SHADOW LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

     Credit cards are being inspected.  ESPINOSA, seated between
     VARGAS and BERNIE, in a booth in the nearly deserted lounge,
     looks the cards over dubiously.

                         ESPINOSA
               Three hours is old, man.  Very old.

                         BERNIE
               Hey, he might not of reported 'em
               at all yet.  He might not know for
               a couple hours.

                         VARGAS
               You pick his pocket?

                         BERNIE
               Yeah, more or less.  Trust me, these
               are very very fresh.


     EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

     JEFFREY BROADMAN is standing against the granite facade of a
     downtown office building.  Three thousand dollar suit, Hermes
     tie, expensively cut silver grey hair ruffling slightly in the
     breeze.  Charming smile, candid eyes...

                         BROADMAN
               To be honest, I can't make sense
               of it either, Ms. Gayley.
               Things seem to be on the upswing,
               our differences with the SEC have
               been favorably resolved.  In a
               business sense, I believe we've
               "turned the corner..."

     GALE GAYLEY, a TV reporter, is standing close to BROADMAN, a
     microphone in her hand.  She's thirty, attractive, dignified...
     We can hear SIRENS in the distance and, closer, the CRACKLE
     of radios and walkie talkies.

                         GALE
               Mister Broadman, your wife and
               children are on their way here as
               we speak.  Don't you think -- ?

                         BROADMAN
               I feel I've done very well in
               life: good health, wonderful
               family, much wealth.  I guess what
               we're talking about here is a kind
               of despair.  I just have the
               feeling that everything from here
               on is going to be... downhill...
               At a time like this, I think I'm
               entitled, as the saying goes, to
               "look out for number one" and put
               my own needs first.  That pretty
               much concludes what I have to say.
               Thanks for coming out here to let
               me talk to you and your viewers.

     A nice smile as he drops RIGHT OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME!

     ANGLE ON GALE

     Looking down, horrified.

                         GALE
               Oh my god!  Chucky, tilt down.

     Her cameraman, CHUCKY, twenty-five, is already urgently tilting
     his vidpak as WE REVEAL that he and GALE are standing on a ledge
     many stories above the street.

                         GALE
               Did you get it?
                    (then, doubly
                     horrified)
               Jesus, did I say that?

                         CHUCKY
               Yeah, I got it.  Sports training.
               You learn to follow the ball.
                    (looking up at Gale)
               How about you do a wrap-up from
               up here?  I'll pan off that
               skyscraper over there, find you
               here, then reveal the drop.

     GALE looks shaken.

     TV IMAGE (EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING LEDGE - DAY)

     Later, the CAMERA "finds" GALE in mid-sentence standing on the
     ledge, "wearing" her broadcast voice and persona...

                         GALE
                    (into mike)
               Suicide number 137 of this year
               in this city was neither a
               destitute nor a lonely man, but
               a successful executive with a
               loving family and forty million
               dollars in the bank.  If there's
               nameless "despair" in executive
               offices, what can there be sixty
               stories below where the hungry and
               the homeless, the brutalized and
               the addicted, fight their daily
               battle for survival.
                    (beat)
               From a ledge sixty stories above
               the street, I'm Gale Gayley for
               Channel Four News.

     REVEAL: THE TV MONITOR IS IN AN OFFICE


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE/CHANNEL 4 - LATE AFTERNOON

     DEAKINS, fifty, shirtsleeves, News Director, and WALLACE, sixty,
     Station Manager, suit and tie, patrician, are watching the
     monitor while CHUCKY and PARKER, the boyish gofer, hover behind
     them.

                         CHUCKY
               Whadja think of the fall shot,
               Chief?  The guy drops twenty
               stories in perfect focus, center
               frame while I go smoothly from F16
               to F5.6.

                         DEAKINS
               Helluva shot, Chucky, beautiful.
                    (pulling out the video
                     tape)
               Parker, run this down to Frazier,
               tell him we open with it at six,
               eleven and at seven a.m....

     PARKER is already running out the door as Gale enters.

                         GALE
               Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?

                         WALLACE
               Never reach out!

                         GALE
               Hello, Mister Wallace.

                         DEAKINS
                    (to Gale)
               He's right.  It's unprofessional.

                         WALLACE
                    (to Gale)
               If you reach out, you could get
               pulled over yourself.

                         GALE
               What're we talking about?  Reach
               out for what?

                         CHUCKY
               I told them how you were upset we
               didn't save the guy...

                         DEAKINS
               Saving people is not our job.  It's
               as wrong to step in and save someone
               as it would be to push someone off.

                         WALLACE
               You wouldn't push the guy, would
               you?

                         GALE
               I didn't say I thought we should
               have saved him..

                         WALLACE
               You didn't?

                         GALE
               I said I wished it had at least
               occurred to me to consider saving
               him.

                         DEAKINS
               What good would that do?

     GALE sits on Deakins' desk.

                         GALE
               It would make me feel like a human
               being instead of a cynical,
               hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it
               wouldn't be a bad story, would it,
               "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"

                         DEAKINS
               Unprofessional.

                         GALE
               You just can't bear the idea of
               good news.

                         DEAKINS
               You're sitting on your ticket.

     GALE finds an envelope on the desk under her butt.

                         WALLACE
               Ticket!  What's going on?

                         DEAKINS
               She's flying to New York.  She's
               been nominated for a Silver Mike...

                         WALLACE
               A Silver Mike!  You're covering us
               in glory!

                         GALE
               I haven't won it yet.
                    (studying ticket, to
                     Deakins)
               I notice you've got me scheduled
               on a flight back an hour after the
               ceremony.

                         WALLACE
               An hour after...!  Deak, for
               Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a
               night in New York City.  We'll put
               her and her boyfriend up at a good
               hotel...

                         DEAKINS
               She broke up with her boyfriend.
                    (to Gale)
               Listen, babe, we needja back.
               You gotta follow up on the jumper,
               find the human interest in the
               grim, unending tale of woe that
               pours from the wounded heart of
               the heartless metropolis.

                         GALE
               The story behind the story, the
               ugly scandal behind the falling
               millionaire, the dirt, you mean.

                         DEAKINS
               That too.

                         GALE
                    (to Wallace)
               Would the station put me up at a
               good hotel...?

                         WALLACE
                    (a look toward Deakins)
               Absolutely!

     GALE gives DEAKINS a big grin and starts out.

                         DEAKINS
               Okay, hell with it.  Party hearty...
               is that what they say?  I'll figure
               something out.
                    (once she's gone)
               She's just pretending she's a
               person.  She's really a reporter.
               Fifty bucks she's on the first
               flight back.

                         CHUCKY
               You know what I don't get?  I don't
               get why a guy who's gonna jump asks
               to talk to a TV reporter?

                         DEAKINS
               Cause how's he gonna know he's
               jumped if it's not on the six
               o'clock news.


     EXT.  STREET/CITY CIVIC CENTER - AFTERNOON

     HORNS BLARE as a FORD VAN cuts off a CAB and squirms into a
     parking place marked "HANDICAPPED ONLY."

     The side of the van reads GUMLEY'S SUPER CARPET CARE and
     features a cartoon logo and a phone number.

     BERNIE, wearing Gumley overalls, jumps out of the van and
     hurries up the steps to an imposing municipal building.


     INT.  CIVIC BUILDING - TEN MINUTES LATER (AFTERNOON)

     A door reads "PROBATION DEPARTMENT."  MOVE IN ON THE DOOR.


     INT.  OFFICE/PROBATION - DAY

     Bernie is sitting across the desk from the stone-faced, balding
     Probation Officer, PATRICK DUKE.

                         BERNIE
                    (agitated)
               Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I
               ever done time?  I mean I been
               arrested a few times, who hasn't?
               Parking tickets for Chrissake!
               Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever
               been convicted of anything?

                         DUKE
               Mister LaPlante...

                         BERNIE
               Take a look at my employment
               record, you got my employment
               record there, right?  You see any
               unemployment there, any welfare?
               I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me
               alive, the tax people, they got
               taxes on everything, taxes, taxes,
               taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms
               so I can pay your goddamn salary,
               so you can sit there and write
               stuff, guys like me pay your
               wages...

                         DUKE
               Mister LaPlante...

                         BERNIE
               Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot
               anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell
               drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in
               prison.  I'm a family man.

                         DUKE
               Mister LaPlante...

                         BERNIE
               Look, I got this kid.  We got a
               goddamn relationship!  I'm takin'
               him to a movie tonight!  He worships
               me.  If I go down what's this do
               to my son?  I'm his goddamn role
               model for Christ sake!

     DUKE looks up at the "family man's" plaintive look.  Then...
     Bernie ruins it.

                         BERNIE
               Listen, if I coulda afforded an
               experienced attorney, I woulda
               walked.  It was a shitty case,
               very circumstantial.  You gonna
               send me downstate for having an
               inexperienced lawyer?  How you
               gonna feel about the system if you
               do that?

     The brief flash of mercy is gone from DUKE'S eyes, replaced
     with a hard glitter.  BERNIE has just shot himself in the
     foot.


     INT.  BALLROOM /N.Y. HOTEL - DAY

     VIGOROUS APPLAUSE!  GALE has just received the Silver Mike
     Award, a tastefully small, mike-sized replica of a microphone,
     from the MASTER OF CEREMONIES.  Clutching it, she faces the
     applauding AUDIENCE across a podium, speaking into a real
     microphone.

                         GALE
               Thank you, very much.  I'm grateful
               for this.  Since you're all
               colleagues here, you know what kind
               of a team it takes... to put a story
               on a screen.  I don't have to
               explain to you how much the
               cameraman, the editor, the
               assignment editor and the news
               director, to mention a few did to
               get me this award.

     GALE pauses.  She reaches into her purse and pulls out an onion.
     She holds it up.

                         GALE
               This is an onion.
                    (dramatic pause,
                     then...)
               It's a metaphor for a news story.
               Only a few hours ago I was standing
               on a ledge sixty stories above a
               street interviewing a man who
               subsequently jumped to his death.
               Forty million dollars in the bank,
               happily married, good health.  <u>Great</u>
               <u>story</u>!

     The AUDIENCE is attentive, mesmerized as they watch her rip off
     the outer skin of the onion and toss it dramatically aside.

                         GALE
                    (continuing)
               There's gotta be more.  We're pros,
               right?  Some kinda extramarital
               hanky panky, maybe?  Another good
               story!
                    (she peels another layer
                     of onion)
               Maybe the guy's been accused of
               child molesting.  Terrific story!
                    (she peels more off the
                     onion)
               Then it turns out the accusation
               was false.  Wonderful!  More story.

     The AUDIENCE watches, captivated as the onion gets smaller.

                         GALE
                    (continuing)
               Maybe the alleged mistress was
               lying, setting the guy up.
               Sensational story!
                    (the onion is very
                     small)
               We keep going, keep digging, keep
               investigating.  We expose the
               guy's whole life, his family.
               Why?  Because we're pros!
               Because...
                    (she pauses
                     dramatically)
               <u>we're</u> <u>looking</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>truth!</u>

     GALE considers the tiny remains of the onion in her hand.
     Then, she peels it down to nothing and lets it fall.

                         GALE
               But what if, after all our
               digging, after all our painstaking
               investigation, what if <u>it</u> <u>turns</u> <u>out</u>
               <u>there</u> <u>wasn't</u> <u>any</u> <u>truth?</u>  Just 
               stories!  One story after another,
               one layer, then another layer,
               until there's nothing left.  And
               if it's like that, do we have any.
               obligation to stop at any point?
               Or do we just keep going, digging,
               digging, digging, peeling,
               peeling, peeling, until we've
               peeled it all away, until we've
               destroyed what we were
               investigating in the first place?

     ANGLE ON AUDIENCE

     attentive, as GALE pauses dramatically, then...

                         GALE
               I'll bet all of you, like me,
               yearn for just one story that
               isn't about uncovering layer after
               layer of human weakness; a story
               that reveals with each new layer
               of investigation, something finer
               and nobler, something even...
               inspirational.

     GALE gazes soberly across the podium at the AUDIENCE.

     TELEVISION IMAGE (EXT.  SKID ROW STREETS - DAY)

     A BAG LADY addresses the camera, a news interview.

                         BAG LADY/TV
               First rule out here on the streets
               is you gotta watch out for number
               one.  If you go down... break a
               bone or something... you're gone!
               Nobody's gonna pick you up.'

                         WINSTON'S VOICE (O.S)
               Shitty color!  Looka the skin tones.

     REVEAL: THE TV SET IS IN BERNIE'S APARTMENT


     INT.  LIVING ROOM/BERNIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (RAIN)

     WINSTON, fifty and fat, is scowling at the image on the TV
     screen in BERNIE'S spartan and tasteless three room apartment.
     BERNIE grabs the remote from WINSTON'S pudgy hands.

                         BERNIE
               Chrissake!  Homeless people are
               supposed to have shitty skin tones.
               Look!

     BERNIE points the remote at the screen...

     ON THE TV SCREEN

     CLICK!  A gunfight replaces the BAG LADY ON SCREEN, then a
     sitcom, an old movie, MTV, and finally a slick commercial
     featuring a sexy bikinied BLONDE.

     INT.  BERNIE'S APT. - NIGHT

                         BERNIE
               There you go!  Skin tones!  Listen,
               you gotta fish or cut bait.  I
               wouldn't even do this if I didn't
               have these legal problems.  Two
               fifty.  That's it.  I gotta get
               outta here, I gotta take my kid to
               the movies tonight, I'm late.

     WINSTON stares at the lithe thighs ON THE SCREEN as BERNIE
     starts rummaging urgently in his closet.

                         WINSTON
               I'll go two hundred.

     BERNIE has just found his good shoes, notices a carton of brand
     new jackets.

                         BERNIE
               Two hundred!  How about a jacket?
               Wanna buy me a jacket?


     INT.  MAIN CABIN/BOEING 727 IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     The engines drone as we look into the sparsely populated main
     cabin of the "baby Boeing".  Among the many empty seats, a MR.
     FLETCHER reads a magazine while his ten year son RICHIE plays
     a pocket video game.

     LESLIE SUGAR, one of the two Flight Attendants, is serving a
     drink to Mr. Smith, a businessman while FREDDY, the other Flight
     Attendant, is giving a pillow to an ELDERLY WOMAN.

     We DISCOVER GALE, cradling a phone to her ear while she
     awkwardly fishes in her purse and pulls out the Silver Mike
     Award.

                         GALE
               It's very nice actually.
                    (reading the 
                     inscription)
               "For Excellence in the Pursuit of
               Truth."  Uh, listen, I just wanted
               you to know I got a seat back on
               the early flight after all so...
               What?

     Reacting to what she hears on the phone, GALE overturns the
     purse in her lap and the contents -- wallet, comb, lipstick,
     notepad, etc. -- spill on the floor.

                         GALE
               What do you mean you gave it to
               Conklin?  Conklin wasn't on that
               ledge!  Conklin wasn't...


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE/CHANNEL FOUR - NIGHT

     DEAKINS is grinning into his phone, winking at WALLACE who's
     standing beside his desk.

                         DEAKINS
               Gale, you were gonna do the town,
               remember?  Fancy suite at the
               station's expense, see a show, get
               laid maybe.  What was I supposed
               to do?

     Still grinning, he breaks off and listens to Gale's faintly
     audible response while holding out his palm to WALLACE in a
     triumphant "pay me" gesture.  Then he speaks into the phone...

                         DEAKINS
               Okay, okay, you get back tonight,
               doll, and I'll take Conklin off your
               suicide.  Fly carefully... and
               congratulations on the award.

     DEAKINS hangs up and smugly pockets the fifty WALLACE has fished
     from his wallet, chuckling gleefully...

                         DEAKINS
               What'd I tell ya!  They're all like
               that, the good ones.  They're
               junkies for the story.  They can't
               let go.


     INT.  MAIN CABIN/BOEING 727 IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     The eight-year-old, KELLY, seated next to GALE is helping GALE
     pick up the contents of her purse from the floor.

                         GALE
               Thank you.  Very much.

     KELLY beams.  And GALE gives a look to KELLY'S mother SUSAN
     who's seated on the other side of KELLY.

                         SUSAN
               There's another credit card on the
               floor.

     GALE reaches down to pick up her Visa card from the floor.

                         GALE
               Thanks.

     GALE inserts the Visa Card in her wallet with the other cards.


     EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

     Rain comes down in curtains as BERNIE'S Toyota chugs and farts
     through curtains of water.


     INT.  MOVING CAR/CITY STREET - NIGHT

     BERNIE is at the wheel, trying to see through the rain swept
     windshield.  He's talking to himself as he drives...

                         BERNIE
               I know why it's raining.  I coulda
               predicted this.  It's raining
               because my wipers are fucked up.
               If my wipers were okay, the fucking
               sun would be shining right now.
               At night!


     INT.  COCKPIT/727 - NIGHT

     Engines DRONE monotonously.  The Flight Engineer is looking at a
     magazine while the PILOT and CO-PILOT, surrounded by glowing
     instruments, stare into the blackness ahead... until something
     catches the bored PILOT'S eye.  A red light on the control
     panel.  He frowns and looks closer.


     INT./EXT.  BERNIE'S CAR/FREEWAY - NIGHT

     Looking for exit signs, BERNIE can barely see through the sheets
     of rain that his malfunctioning wipers do little to clear.

     Suddenly a sign looms into view and disappears before he can
     read it.

                         BERNIE
               Damn!

     INT.  MAIN CABIN/727 IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     The engines drone.  The cabin is peaceful, most PASSENGERS
     dozing or talking softly as GALE glances up from her magazine,
     sees SUSAN reading while KELLY sleeps peacefully, her head in
     SUSAN'S lap.

     PING!  The electronic tone.  Gale looks up, sees the "Fasten
     Seat Belt" sign illuminated.

     GALE looks toward the dark window.  No sign of any lights below.
     No city.  No airport.  strange.

     The P.A. SYSTEM comes to life and the CAPTAIN'S mellifluous
     VOICE murmurs soothingly...

                         P.A. SYSTEM
               Ladies and Gentlemen, this is your
               Captain.  We're experiencing a high
               reading on one of our indicators.
               Ten to one, it's a malfunction in
               a gauge, but just as a precaution
               I'm going to ask you to fasten your
               seat belts while the Flight
               Attendants run through some safety
               procedures with you.  I apologize
               for the necessity and the
               inconvenience.

     Murmurs in the cabin.  What does this mean?  SUSAN looks a
     question at GALE, puzzled as Flight Attendants LESLIE and FREDDY
     take their positions to demonstrate safety procedures.

                         LESLIE
               First make sure your seat belts are
               fastened securely.  Then brace your
               arms against the seat ahead at you
               like this.  You can use pillows
               or blankets...

                         KELLY
                    (waking up)
               Mommy, what's going on?

                         SUSAN
               Everything's going to be fine,
               honey.

     GALE'S eyes meet SUSAN'S eyes.  Fear.  Brave smile.


     INT./EXT.  BERNIE'S CAR/EXIT/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     Pulling off the freeway, BERNIE peers at the signs that greet
     him as he slows to a stop at the foot of the exit.

     Unable to read them through the windshield he has to open the
     door and stand in the rain.

     Even then, the sign is obscured by torrents of rain.


     INT.  MAIN CABIN/727 IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

     All eyes are on LESLIE as she continues her instructions...

                         LESLIE
               -- when you reach the bottom of the
               chute you should immediately move
               as far away from the plane as
               possible in the event of a fire on
               the aircraft.

     Glancing around, GALE glimpses pale, strained FACES.

     She sees the ELDERLY WOMAN holding the arm of a man, her SON.

     She sees a MRS. BROWN squeezing a MR. BROWN'S hand tightly.

     Looking back down the aisle she sees MR. FLETCHER putting his
     arm around RICHIE'S shoulder, father and son united against
     fate.

     Beside her she sees SUSAN trying to comfort KELLY.

                         LESLIE
               Those of you who can should help
               others who may be unable to move
               quickly.

     GALE is acutely aware that everyone around her is comforting
     someone else.  Only she is alone.


     INT.  TOYOTA/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     Back at the wheel, BERNIE is turning right onto an unlit
     highway, his single headlight stabbing weakly at the storm ahead
     while his useless wipers clatter loudly and the engine chugs...
     farts... misses.

                         BERNIE
               I'm late already!  Don't quit on me
               now, for Chrissake!  This ain't the
               time!

     The engine struggles, continues.

                         BERNIE
               Come on, come on !

     The engine surges to life again... then begins to throb with
     downright vigor.

     BERNIE frowns.  It's getting louder.

     AND LOUDER!  AND LOUDER!  IT'S ROARING.

     BERNIE'S eyes bug with the realization that either he's about
     to take off... OR THAT ISN'T HIS ENGINE THUNDERING, THUNDERING.

     A great shadow blurs in the rain ahead.

     BERNIE brakes hard, skidding, sliding wildly.

     BAWHOOOOOOOOM!  HUGE NOISE.  IMPACT!  GRINDING!

     BERNIE skids to a halt, eyes shut tight to prevent himself from
     dying.

     But he's not dead.  He opens his eyes.  Stares out the
     windshield.

     A blank wall greets him, bouncing back his headlights in a blur
     of rain.

                         BERNIE
               Now what?


     EXT.  HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     BERNIE gets out of his car.  Everything is spooky quiet.

     The tail section of a huge aircraft blocks the road directly
     in front of Bernie's car.  He skidded to a stop two feet short
     of ramming the twenty-five foot high vertical fin.  The rest
     of the craft is sprawled off the low bridge and into the water,
     lost for the most part in the darkness.

     Suddenly, a VOICE calls out... from somewhere forward along the
     fuselage.

                         VOICE
               Hey!  Help!  Somebody!  Help.

     BERNIE frowns.  Helping is not his instinct.  Approaching the
     edge of the bridge, he peers into the darkness.

     The plane is corkscrewed through the bridge at such a freak
     angle that the tail rear doors are wedged shut by the metal
     super-structure, the wing exits are blocked by the up-bent wing
     stubs, and the right forward doors are canted hopelessly toward
     the sky while the left exit is partially jammed in the mud near
     the river bank in three feet of water.

                         VOICE
               Please!  Help us.  We're stuck.
               Hello!  Anybody!

                         BERNIE
               Whatsa problem, pal?


     INT.  MAIN CABIN/727 AT REST - NIGHT

     Engulfed in darkness except for strings of floor lights leading
     to the exits, the cabin is a confusion of GROANS, COUGHS, CRIES
     and the piercing WAIL of a screaming BABY.  The floor lights
     seem to be on the walls, high on one side and low on the other,
     as the cabin is dramatically canted, making movement along
     aisles nearly impossible.

     LESLIE, battered from the impact, her uniform torn, is
     struggling to open the forward emergency exit.  Angled downward,
     the door will only open six inches before being blocked by mud.
     Water pours in around her ankles as she shoves furiously.

                         LESLIE
               Somebody give me a hand.

                         A VOICE
               We're on fire.

                         LESLIE
               Let's stay calm, everybody.
               Everybody, stay calm, please.
               Please stay calm.  Everything will
               be all right if we stay calm.
               Somebody give me a hand with this
               door.

     Her flashlight stabs the darkness, reveals frightened FACES.

     Slumped, motionless forms.

                         LESLIE
               Help the people around you,
               everybody.  Please help each other.

     AAAAAAAAAH!  SCREAMS as the plane suddenly shifts violently from
     the interior movement, canting further.

     ANGLE ON GALE

     Staggering from her seat.  WHAM!  Hand luggage slams into her
     from an overhead rack.  As GALE goes down, a PASSENGER lands
     on top of her catching her arm at an angle, breaking it.  The
     PASSENGER climbs off her and struggles down the slope.

     GALE realizes she can't get up, her leg is wedged in the
     framework of a seat.  PASSENGERS are climbing past her, heading
     forward.

     SUSAN is fighting her way out of her canted seats, clutching
     the terrified KELLY to her.

                         GALE
               I... I can't move.  I'm caught.

     SUSAN glances at her and their eyes meet.  KELLY is screaming.

     SUSAN turns away from GALE and half-carries KELLY toward the
     exit, leaving GALE alone, trapped, in pain and fear.


     EXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT

     BERNIE is climbing cautiously down the undercarriage of the
     bridge toward the water, as OTHER VOICES callout from the
     twisted fuselage.

                         BERNIE
               Hold on there, hold on there.  Just
               a minute.

     BERNIE is awkward and... very careful... climbing down, not
     brave or dashing.  He doesn't notice that, behind him, where
     the plane is corkscrewed through the bridge a BOUQUET OF ORANGE
     FLAMES IS BLOSSOMING IN THE FUSELAGE OF THE JET.


     INT.  MAIN CABIN/727 - NIGHT

     Thick smoke is oozing through the cabin.  PASSENGERS are
     stumbling over each other, clogging the canted aisles while
     OTHERS slump in their seats, immobilized.

                         RICHIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Daddy!  Daddy!  Daddy, wake up!

                         LESLIE'S VOICE
               Keep calm!  Everybody, keep calm.

                         ANOTHER VOICE
               Someone's coming!


     EXT.  RIVER - NIGHT

     Having reached the riverbank, BERNIE is reluctant to step in
     the water.  He hesitates, then he takes off his shoes, looks
     in the darkness for a place to leave them.

                         VOICE
               Help us!  Help, please.

                         BERNIE
               Hold on, buddy.  I got hundred
               dollar shoes here.

     More cries.  BERNIE steps cautiously into the water.  Up to his
     ankles.  Deeper.

     BERNIE wades along the huge fuselage, toward the VOICES,
     stumbling, landing on all fours in the water.

                         BERNIE
               Jesus Christ!

     Struggling to his feet, hands muddy, he blunders toward the
     Emergency Exit and finds it canted into the water, jammed into
     the mud so that it only opens a crack.

     MR. BROWN is wedged in the crack, trying to force the door open
     without success.  Glimpsing BERNIE'S hands in the crack, he
     pleads.

                         MR. BROWN
               Help us, please.  We can't get out.

     BERNIE makes a tentative attempt to open the door.  He has no
     effect whatsoever.

                         MR. BROWN
               Push it!  You gotta push hard.

                         BERNIE
               Whaddaya (grunt) think I'm (grunt)
               doing?

     Reluctantly BERNIE digs his feet into the mud, puts his shoulder
     into the door and shoves with all his might.  Because he has a
     better angle on the door and better purchase, he's actually able
     to move it several inches.

                         MR. BROWN
               Harder.  Push it harder.

     BERNIE leans back into the door again and pushes with all his
     might.  It gives ever so slightly.  Another inch.  MR. BROWN
     is trying to squeeze out.

                         MR. BROWN
               Again!  Harder.  Come on.

                         BERNIE
                    (grunting with effort)
               I'm... pushing... it, buddy.

                         MR. BROWN
               Harder!

                         BERNIE
               I'm... pushing... it... asshole!


     INT.  MAIN CABIN/727 - NIGHT

     PASSENGERS stumble over each other while a flashlight makes
     panicky stabs at the darkness, RICHIE cries out for FLETCHER
     to wake up, the BABY screams.

     Someone's trying to get out the overhead exit, others are
     hammering at an aft exit.

     GALE slumped in her seat, fades in and out of consciousness.
     Above her, across the canted aisle, SUSAN is calling out for
     help... Then, GALE'S eyes flicker with awareness at the sound
     of an urgent shout...

                         VOICE
               THERE'S A GUY OPENING THE DOOR.
               HE'S OPENING IT!

     A sudden shadowy surge of movement in the darkness, PASSENGERS
     urgently scrambling over seats toward the exit.


     EXT.  AIRPLANE/RIVER - NIGHT

     BERNIE gives a great heave and goes down in the river face
     first.

     He's opened the door just wide enough for MR. BROWN to squirm
     through the narrow opening, then pull MRS. BROWN through.

     BERNIE, sputtering, is trying to get to his feet when the BROWNS
     knock him down again in their frantic rush to get as far away
     from the burning plane as they can.

     As BERNIE struggles to his feet yet again, more PASSENGERS are
     oozing out the door.  They brush him aside, splashing toward the
     river bank, while orange flames are flickering wildly now in
     the tail section.


     INT.  MAIN CABIN/727 - NIGHT

     LESLIE is beside the exit, using her flashlight to guide people.
     Her face is bruised and bloody, her uniform torn, but she is
     courage itself...

                         LESLIE
               Once you're outside, immediately
               move as far away from the aircraft
               as you can.  If you see someone who
               needs help...

     Scared PASSENGERS are struggling to get over the seats that are
     close to where the floor ought to be.

                         LESLIE
               Please, everybody, one at a time.
               Please, one at a time.

     Just then the young RICHIE, caught in the surge of PASSENGERS,
     bumps into her.

                         RICHIE
               Please, Miss, my father can't move.
               He can't move.

     LESLIE grabs him and shoves him bodily out the narrow exit as
     she speaks urgently...

                         LESLIE
               We'll try and help him, you wait
               outside.  Get as far away from the
               plane as you can.

     Just then LESLIE sees the bloody PILOT and CO-PILOT staggering
     toward her.

     She helps them out the narrow opening, half pushing them.


     EXT.  RIVERBANK - NIGHT

     <u>BERNIE'S face is smeared with mud!</u>  He staggers out of the water
     in the flicker of firelight and starts searching for his shoes
     on the muddy riverbank.

                         PILOT
               Don't stop!

                         BERNIE
               You gonna bUy me a new pair a shoes,
               pal?

     The sound of approaching SIRENS cuts through the rainy night.


     EXT.  AIRPLANE/RIVER - NIGHT

     RICHIE is outside the plane, struggling in chest deep water.
     He looks back at the plane, sobbing...

                         RICHIE
               Dad!  Dad!

     He doesn't know what to do.


     EXT.  RIVERBANK - NIGHT

     Muttering curses, BERNIE is floundering around on the riverbank
     when a hand clutches at his sleeve.

     BERNIE whirls, his face a mask of mud.  Finds himself facing
     RICHIE.

                         RICHIE
               Sir!  Please, sir.  Sir, my father
               can't move.

     Where?  BERNIE looks around.

                         RICHIE
               He's in there!  He's hurt!

     In the plane?  In there?  BERNIE looks at the plane, reacts...

                         BERNIE
               In there?  Listen, kid, the cops
               are coming... and the firemen.
               They, uh, they got equipment and
               stuff for this kindathing, they're,
               uh, experts.

     The sound of SIRENS, still.  a ways off.  RICHIE clutches at
     BERNIE.

                         RICHIE
               Please, sir!  Please!  It's on fire.
               He can't move.

     BERNIE stares into the desperate face... and suddenly,
     recklessly, BERNIE loses it, forgets he's BERNIE, acts like
     someone else.

                         BERNIE
               Where is he?

                         YOUNG BOY
               Inside!  He's in the plane, he...

                         BERNIE
               I know he's inside.  Which way?
               What's his name?


     INT.  NEAR THE EXIT/MAIN CABIN/727 - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

     Chaos and confusion.  The smoke is thicker, LESLIE is upset...

                         LESLIE
               Sir, you can't go back in.  Sir,
               you're blocking passengers.  Sir,
               no...

     BERNIE, his muddy face unrecognizeable, is pushing his way into
     the plane, shouldering coughing PASSENGERS aside.

     BERNIE finds himself standing in the choking darkness,
     PASSENGERS pushing past him.  Holy smokes!  This is ridiculous!
     What's he doing here?  Thicker smoke, can barely see anything,
     VOICES cry out in pain and fear.  Just then he spots something.

     A flashlight lies on the floor sending a useless knife of light '
     into the smoky darkness.  He grabs for it, drops it urgently.

                         BERNIE
               Jesus Christ!

     The light is in a hand!  He reaches again, snatches the light
     and points it revealing FREDDY, the other Flight Attendant,
     lying semiconscious on the floor, bloody, GROANING.

     BERNIE hesitates.  Then he leans down, still gripping the light
     and half hauls FREDDY toward the nearby exit where LESLIE is
     supervising PASSENGERS.

                         BERNIE
               Hey, somebody, grab him, willya?
               Help this guy, willya, goddamnit!

     A MAN reluctantly turns and, with the help of LESLIE they manage
     to shove FREDDY out the exit.  LESLIE instructs the MAN...

                         LESLIE
               Get him away from the plane, help
               him.

     LESLIE turns back in time to see BERNIE heading back into the
     darkness, struggling around the stream of PASSENGERS.

     For half a second, LESLIE'S face reveals her amazement at seeing
     somebody go <u>back</u> into the the nightmare a second time.  Then
     she's helping the next passenger out... SUSAN and KELLY...

                         SUSAN
               There's (cough cough) a woman back
               there.  She's caught.

                         LESLIE
               Get as far away from the plane as
               you can.

     Urgently LESLIE shoves them through the door.


     INT.  "UP THE SLOPE"/MAIN CABIN/707 - NIGHT

     BERNIE is struggling aft, up the steep slope of the nose-down
     plane, coughing and cursing in the dark, calling out...

                         BERNIE
               MISTER FLETCHER!  HEY, MISTER
               FLETCHER!  MISTER FLETCHER, HEY
               BUDDY, WHERE ARE YA, GODDAMNIT?

     BERNIE pans the flashlight ahead of him.  The blade of light
     only cuts a few feet through the thickening smoke, revealing
     only empty seats.

                         BERNIE
               FLETCHER!  HEY (cough cough) HEY,
               FLETCHER, SPEAK UP, WILL YA?  DON'T
               BE AN ASSHOLE!

     No answer.

     BERNIE pans the light, turns and...

     A SHARP GROAN!

     BERNIE stumbles.  He stepped on someone.

                         BERNIE
               Fletcher?

     Pans the light down.

                         BERNIE
               Shit!

     A woman!  GALE.  Semiconscious, in pain, she opens her eyes.

     GALE P.O.V.:  BERNIE'S MUDDY FACE

     <u>Looking up, all GALE can see is a vague vision of a muddy face</u>
     <u>dimly visible in the spill of the flashlight</u>.

     BACK TO SCENE

                         GALE
               My leg's caught.

     BERNIE points the light toward her leg, overpans the leg, the
     blade of light discovering her purse.  Then he corrects the beam
     back to reveal her leg wedged between two seats.

                         GALE
               Can you... can you get me out of
               here?

     BERNIE pans the light back to the purse again.

                         BERNIE
               Yeah, sure.  I think.

     BERNIE puts down the light and struggles her leg loose while
     GALE groans in pain.  Her head is near the floor lights, her
     eyes open.

     <u>For a moment BERNIE'S face passes through the stationary beam</u>
     <u>of the flashlight and GALE gets a glimpse of a smoky, muddy face</u>
     <u>leaning close to her...AN OBSCURE VISION!</u>

                         BERNIE
               Okay, lady.  You gotta make an
               effort here.  I don't happen to
               be a goddamn bodybuilder.

     BERNIE retrieves the flashlight lying near her purse.  It's out
     of her line of vision, behind her head.  He only hesitates for
     half a second before his hand shoots out for the purse, conceals
     it under his jacket, and gets to his feet.


     INT.  EXIT/AREA/MAIN CABIN/727 - SECONDS LATER (NIGHT)

     LESLIE is helping ANOTHER MAN out the exit.

                         LESLIE
               Get away from the plane quickly.
               It may explode.

     Now she's alone.  Heroically she turns back and probes the smoky
     interior with her flashlight.

     The blade of light is blunted by the smoky darkness.  There's
     nothing.

     LESLIE hesitates.  Should she run, save her own life or...?

     Suddenly BERNIE steps into the beam of her light, emerging from
     the thick smoke hauling GALE over his shoulder, his face
     smudged, unrecognizeable, AN HEROIC VISION SHE'LL REMEMBER!

                         BERNIE
               Gimme a (cough cough) hand, willya,
               honey?


     EXT.  BRIDGE/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     SIRENS scream and lights FLASH as more Emergency Vehicles join
     the ones already parked close to the bridge at a safe distance
     from the burning tail of the plane.  A FIRE CAPTAIN shouts "Move
     that piece-a junk" at three FIREMEN who are already pushing
     BERNIE'S Toyota off the bridge and away from the airplane while
     a confusion of PARAMEDICS and POLICE hurry to the aid of dazed
     PASSENGERS in torn and bloody clothing.

     FIREMEN train hoses on the fiery tail of the plane while the
     FIRE CAPTAIN shouts...

                         FIRE CAPTAIN
               GET 'EM BACK!  GET 'EM BACK!

     ANGLE ON RICHIE

     Staring at the smoking plane in horror when a hand grips his
     shoulder.  Turning he finds himself looking up at the MAN whose
     back we saw LESLIE push out of the plane... FLETCHER!

                         RICHIE
               DAD!  OH, DAD!

                         FLETCHER
               Son!  Thank God!  I couldn't find
               you.  I was terrified... terrified.

     They're hugging.


     INT.  EXIT AREA/727 CABIN - NIGHT

     LESLIE and BERNIE are awkwardly pushing GALE'S limp body out
     the exit to a FIREMAN, DENTON in an asbestos suit just outside.

                         FIREMAN DENTON
                    (to Leslie)
               You too, miss!  <u>Right away!</u>

     LESLIE turns to BERNIE.

                         LESLIE
               I've lost (cough) lost count.  I
               think (cough) everybody's out.

     But BERNIE isn't there!  He's disappeared into the smoke.  As
     she stares in dismay, she hears him yelling...

                         BERNIE'S VOICE
               HEY, FLETCHER!  SPEAK UP, WILL YA?


     INT.  MAIN CABIN/727 - NIGHT

     Coughing and choking BERNIE struggles through the cabin, his
     light nearly useless now.

                         BERNIE'S VOICE
               HEY (cough cough) FLETCHER!

     Nothing!  Darkness.  BERNIE can see orange in the black near
     the tail.  Fire!

     This is crazy!  Time to turn back!  He's turning toward the exit.
     when suddenly...

                         A VOICE
               Here!  Over here!  Help me, please.

     At last!  BERNIE waves the light in the direction of the VOICE
     and stumbles that way through the smoke.

                         BERNIE
               Where the (cough cough) hell are
               ya, buddy?

                         VOICE
               Over here.  My leg's broken (cough
               cough).  I need help.

     BERNIE finds an injured MAN crawling along the floor.

     BERNIE leans down and grips him under the armpits.

                         BERNIE
               Fletcher, right?

     The MAN cries out in pain as BERNIE half drags him over seats.

                         MAN
               Aaaaaaaah!  Smith!

                         BERNIE
               You're not Fletcher?

     BERNIE lets him go.

                         SMITH
               Please help me.  My name's Smith.

     BERNIE looks around with the light.

     Thick smoke.  Flames back toward the tail.

                         BERNIE
               I'm looking for Fletcher!  HEY,
               FLETCHER!

     BERNIE waves the light at the darkness and...it goes out.

                         BERNIE
               Shit!

     BANG!  BANG!  BERNIE bangs the flashlight against a seat.

                         SMITH
               Don't leave me.  Please don't leave
               me.

                         BERNIZ
               Awright, awright.

     Angrily BERNIE grabs him and hauls him urgently toward the exit
     while SMITH cries out in pain.

                         BERNIE
               Don't count yer chickens here,
               Smith.  I can't see shit.


     EXT.  AIRPLANE/RIVER - NIGHT

     A dazzling worklight shining down from the bridge illuminates
     the fuselage and the partially opened exit as TWO FIREMEN in
     asbestos fire suits splash through the water carrying GALE from
     the plane.

     FIREMAN DENTON stands at the narrow exit, too narrow for him
     to enter in his bulky asbestos suit and shouts through his
     helmet.

                         FIREMAN DENToN
               You've gotta come outta there, miss.
               Right now!  This thing's gonna go.

     LESLIE squeezes out of the exit, looks back...

                         LESLIE
               There's another...

                         FIREMAN DENTON
                    (grabbing her)
               RIGHT GODDAMN NOW!  COME ON!

     As LESLIE and FIREMAN DENTON splash the ten yards to the
     riverbank flames eat their way toward the wings where the fuel
     is stored.

     Suddenly BERNIE'S VOICE cuts through the chaos...

                         BERNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               HEY!  GIMME A HAND HERE.  HEY YOU!
               IN THE BUNNY SUIT.

     LESLIE looks back and sees BERNIE awkwardly pulling SMITH out
     of the narrow exit.

     FIREMAN DENTON slogs back to BERNIE.

                         FIREMAN DENTON
               I'll help him, buddy, you run for
               it.

     FIREMAN DENTON tries to grab SMITH but BERNIE won't let go.

                         BERNIE
               I gat this guy, you go get the guy
               who's still in there.

     FIREMAN DENTON is lifting SMITH bodily.

                         FIREMAN DENTON
               Get out of here, pal, she's gonna
               blow.

                         BERNIE
               You're not goin' in?  There's a guy
               in there!  You got a fucking suit.

                         FIREMAN DENTON
               SHE'S GONNA EXPLODE, YOU DUMB SHIT.

     FIREMAN DENTON starts to stagger away from the plane, carrying
     SMITH.

     BERNIE looks back at the plane, sees the fury of flames and
     suddenly he splashes through the water after FIREMAN DENTON.


     EXT.  RIVERBANK - SECONDS LATER (NIGHT)

     FIREMAN DENTON is staggering up the slope carrying SMITH when 
     he glances back.

     He sees BERNIE poking around at the edge of the riverbank.

                         FIREMAN DENTON
               HURRY 'UP, BUDDY!

     In the orange glow of the fire, BERNIE gives a delighted grunt
     as he finds half of what he's looking for... a single shoe.

                         FIREMAN DENTON
               COME ON, YOU STUPID SHIT!

                         BERNIE
               I LOST MY GODDAMN SHOE!

     BERNIE is looking around frantically when...


     EXT.  RIVERBANK - NIGHT

     BOOOOOOOOOOM!  BERNIE is knocked backward by a tremendous
     explosion.  Suddenly he's sitting in the mud, the night around
     him bright with flames.

                         BERNIE
               Holy shit!

     Then he's running, clutching one shoe, no longer worried at all
     about the other...

     BAAAAAAAAAAAAA-DOOOOOOOOOOM!  A SECOND BLAST!  MUCH BIGGER!


     EXT.  ACCIDENT SCENE/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     From the relative safety of the road, CHUCKY's pointing his
     vidpak with the Channel Four logo at the exploding plane.
     Panning the camera from the furious mountain of flames he picks
     up a marvelous image.

                         CHUCKY
                    (excited, under his
                     breath)
               Tight on fire, yes, yes, pulling
               back, flame everywhere, find
               survivors backlit in orange glow,
               yes, yes, yes, awesome, major award,
               cameraman of the year,go Chucky,go,
               baby, how you shoot it.

     A Flight Attendant (LESLIE) in a torn uniform is staggering up
     the slope followed by an heroic FIREMAN (DENTON) carrying a
     Crash Victim (SMITH) on his brave shoulders.  What a shot!


     EXT.  RIVERBANK - NIGHT

     BERNIE stands on the riverbank in the pouring rain and looks
     back at the burning plane.  He shakes his head sadly, imagines
     FLETCHER in the inferno.

                         BERNIE
               Sorry, pal.  Woooo!  What a way to
               go!


     EXT.  ACCIDENT SCENE/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     TWO PARAMEDICS are struggling with GALE who's trying to get off
     the stretcher they're putting into an ambulance.

                         GALE
               I'm okay.  Please, I'm okay, I'm
               a reporter, I...OW!

                         PARAMEDIC
               Lady, you're not okay.

     GALE gets off the stretcher in spite of their efforts and
     staggers a few feet, grabs one of them for support.

                         PARAMEDIC
               Miss, please, you've got a broken
               arm.

                         GALE
               It's my leg.  My leg hurts...
                    (suddenly shouting)
               CHUCKY!  OVER HERE, CHUCKY!  CHUCKY!

     ANGLE ON CHUCKY

     Taping SURVIVORS, when he hears GALE'S voice and looks around
     for her.

     CONKLIN, the reporter with him, spots her first.

                         CONKLIN
               Holy shit!  It's Gayley!

     ANGLE ON THE AMBULANCE

     Where GALE is half on the stretcher as CHUCKY and CONKLIN rush
     up to her.

                         CONKLIN
               Gayley!  You were on the plane?

                         GALE
               This is my story, Conk.  I did the
               research.

                         PARAMEDIC
               Please, she's injured, she's gotta
               go to the hospital...

     CHUCKY is already pointing the vidcam at her, taping as the
     PARAMEDICS shove her onto the stretcher and into the ambulance
     with her talking all the way.

                         GALE
               Get the Flight Attendant, the one
               who manned the door.  Also some guy,
               a passenger, pulled me out. Talk
               to him. Then get down to the
               hospital and I'll do an interview
               and an intro and close.  Make
               sure...

     BANG!  The PARAMEDICS slam the door behind her.

     CONKLIN shakes his head as CHUCKY lowers his camera and the
     ambulance pulls away.

                         CONKLIN
               She's a real piece of work!
               Unbelievable!  "It's 'my story, I
               did the research."

                         CHUCKY
               You're not going to believe the shot
               I got back there.  Major Awards!

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     wearing only one shoe he limps right past CHUCKY and CONKLIN,
     unnoticed in the confusion of FIREMEN, PARAMEDICS, and
     SURVIVORS.

     ANGLE ON RICHIE AND FLETCHER

     Standing between an ambulance and a firetruck, father and son
     are hugging each other warmly.  <u>They</u> <u>don't</u> <u>notice</u> <u>Bernie</u>
     <u>trudging</u> <u>past</u> <u>them</u> <u>and</u> <u>he</u> <u>doesn't</u> <u>notice</u> <u>them</u>.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     reacting with sudden horror at something he sees.

     ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

     The spot where BERNIE left his car.  FIREMEN are spraying
     retardant on the firey fuselage of the plane.  No sign of the
     car!

                         BERNIE
               Christ!  My car!  Where's my car?

     BERNIE moans mournfully and suddenly a STATE POLICE OFFICER
     is at his side.

                         STATE POLICE OFFICER
               Where are you hurt, sir?

                         BERNIE
               Huh?  Hurt?  What?

     BERNIE is urgently concerned with the purse poorly concealed
     under his jacket.

                         STATE POLICE OFFICER
               How about coming over to the
               ambulance, sir, let the medical
               people check you out.

     The STATE POLICE OFFICER has a hand on the arm BERNIE is using
     to keep the purse under his jacket.

                         BERNIE
                    (pulling away)
               Hey, I don't need no ambulance.
               I'm just looking for my car... It
               musta burned up or something.

     The purse is visible though the OFFICER hasn't yet noticed it.
     He's patronizing BERNIE, insisting.

                         STATE POLICE OFFICER
               You weren't in your car, sir, you
               were in an airplane crash.  But
               everything's going to be okay, we'll
               just go see the doctor and...

     Just then MRS. BROWN rushes up and clutches the OFFICER,
     grabbing his arm.

                         MRS. BROWN
               Please, please, my husband's been
               waiting for medical attention...

     As she pulls the OFFICER away, BERNIE hides the purse deeper
     under his coat, breathes a sigh of relief... and notices
     something!

     BERNIE'S POV OF HIS CAR

     Virtually unrecognizable, moved to the side of the bridge,
     buried under a mountain of fire retardant foam.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     Limping up to his car, wiping the foam off the windshield.

                         BERNIE
               This shit has gotta be great for
               the paint job!


     INT.  JOEY'S BEDROOM/EVEYLYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Dark except for the eerie flicker of the TV set.

     JOEY is in bed, surreptitiously watching the TV, turned very
     low.

     BANG!  CRACK!  Gunshots?  Not from the TV, from outside.

     JOEY scrambles out of bed and heads for the window.

     JOEY'S P.O.V.:  EXT.  EVELYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     BERNIE is getting out of his Toyota in the glow of a
     streetlight.  It's still raining.  BERIE is soaking wet,
     wiping off his face.  He trudges toward the house wearing only
     one shoe.


     EXT.  FRONT DOOR/EVELYN'S HOUSE - LATER (NIGHT)

     The door swings open violently, revealing EVELYN standing in
     the doorway looking furious.  She's thirty-five, tough, plain,
     not ugly.

                         EVELYN
               He waited for you three hours!

                         BERNIE
               You are not gonna believe this,
               Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm
               on my way --

                         EVELYN
               I am so tired of your bullshit,
               Bernie.

                         BERNIE
               Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying
               to tell you this incredible --

                         EVELYN
               It's never your fault, Bernie!
               Never ever!  You screwed up my life,
               now you're gonna screw up Joey's
               life, but you're never gonna accept
               responsibility for anyth--

                         BERNIE
               Is he here, your friend.  The
               fireman?

                         EVELYN
               He had an emergency call... a <u>real</u>
               emergency.

                         BERNIE
               Why doncha let me in so we don't
               wake everybody in the
               neighborhood?


     INT.  LIVING ROOM/EVELYN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

     Suburban.  Inexpensive furniture.  EVELYN and BERNIE ranting...

                         BERNIE
               Willya lemme talk for Chrissake?
               I'm trying to tell you what
               happened.  What happened is...

                         EVELYN
               The same thing that always happens!
               You blew it!
               And this time you broke your son's
               heart instead of mine!  He was so
               proud, looking forward to going to
               a movie with his father... and you
               let him down!  Like you let
               everybody down, always!  What did
               you do, take a mudbath?

     ANGLE ON JOEY

     eyes wide, crouched at the top of the staircase in his pyjamas,
     spying on his parents in the living room below.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE AND EVELYN

                         BERNIE
               That's what I'm trying to... to...
               okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk
               to Joey to... to apologize.

                         EVELYN
               He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake
               him and make him crazy, do you
               understand?  He comes home from the
               zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's
               a "war hero" like you... he wants
               to know how many people you
               killed...

                         BERNIE
               "Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn
               fireman?

                         EVELYN
               I had to explain your tendancy to
               "exaggerate", How you were actually
               "in country" all of two weeks and
               how you killed about as many people
               as the other clerk-typists in your
               outfit, no more, no less...

                         BERNIE
               Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him
               I killed anybody...

                         EVELYN
               Maybe not,... but you let him
               believe it!  And then I gotta
               explain about the homeless...

                         BERNIE
               The homeless!

                         EVELYN
               How not all of them own apartment
               complexes, how not all of them play
               the stock market, how not all of
               them rent babies when they're
               panhandling.  He's ten years old,
               Bernie!  Impressionable!

     ANGLE ON JOEY

     Watching from the staircase.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE AND EVELYN

                         BERNIE
               Listen, it's important, Ev, I gotta
               see him, I got my reasons, very
               goddamn important...

                         EVELYN
               Use the phone, Bernie, call him
               tomorrow, he'd like to hear from
               you.  Where's your other shoe?
               Never mind!  I don't want to know.
               Some fantastic adventure, right?
               Something really crazy.

                         BERNIE
               I was giving him some advice is all.
               Preparing him for life.  You don't
               want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's
               tough out there, it's a goddamn
               jungle.

                         EVELYN
                    (firmly, opening the
                     door)
               Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good
               night.


     EXT.  FRONT DOOR/EVELYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     BERNIE steps out and the door slams hard behind him.  He pauses,
     sighs, starts toward his car...


     EXT./INT.  BERNIE'S TOYOTA/PARKED - A MOMENT LATER (NIGHT)

     As BERNIE gets in the car he notices the purse sticking out from
     under the passenger seat where he hid it.  He reaches down,
     takes the purse, rummages in it, pulls out the Silver Mike,
     glances at it, might be worth something, pockets it moves on
     to the wallet, the credit cards, the cash... some hundreds,
     fifties', twenties...


     INT.  LIVING ROOM/EVELYN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

     EVELYN is shutting off the last of the lights and starting up
     the stairs when the doorbell rings.  EVELYN scowls.  She's
     furious.


     EXT.  FRONT DOOR/EVELYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     The door opens and EVELYN stands there scowling.

     BERNIE holds out a twenty dollar bill.

                         BERNIE
               Sorry, Ev, to bother you again.
               This is for Joey, his reward... for
               this wallet he found.  When I, uh ,
               returned it I told the guy he hadda
               give my kid something for finding
               it, for the honesty.  So the kid
               would learn how honestly pays.

     Eyes meet.  She doesn't believe it for a moment and he knows
     it.

                         BERNIE
               Just give it to him, okay, Ev?


     EXT.  HIGHWAY - LATER (NIGHT)

     An AIRHORN BLARES, a truck thunders past BERNIE, who's pushing
     his Toyota to the side of the road, steering one-handed from
     outside.


     EXT.  HIGHWAY - LATER YET (NIGHT)

     A blonde GIRL tosses an empty beer can from the window of a
     speeding car full of laughing TEENAGERS.

     The can clatters to the road beside BERNIE who lowers his
     "hitch-hiking thumb" as the car speeds off leaving him alone.


     EXT.  HEAVY TRAFFIC/FREEWAY - DAWN (HOURS LATER)

     Rush hour!  Bumper to bumper TRAFFIC oozing toward the city.
     We HEAR A VOICE!

                         BUBBER'S VOICE (O.S.)
               You actually went into it?  A
               burning airplane?

                         BERNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               "Into it"!  "Into it", for
               Chrissake!  I was practically living
               in the goddamn thing... every time
               I turned around, some other person
               wants me to save 'em.

     Looking for the VOICES, we MOVE IN on a single lane of crawling
     traffic and finally FOCUS ON a battered, rusted 76 Chevy with
     a crumpled fender, a trunk tied closed and cracked windows...


     INT.  CHEVY/MOVING/FREEWAY - DAWN

     BERNIE is sitting on bare springs and tatters of upholstery in
     the passenger seat, muddy, rumpled, weary...

                         BERNIE
                    (continuing)
               Couldn't see a fucking foot in front
               of me, smoke... then booooom!  It
               explodes!  I could be dead!

     JOHN BUBBER is at the wheel, a shabbily dressed, tired, haunted
     man.  He gives BERNIE a look.  Should he believe?

                         BUBBER
               And you pulled people out?
               You're...  a hero.

                         BERNIE
               Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin'
               to impress this kid, don't ask me
               why.  I was gonna rescue his old
               man, but I couldn't find the poor
               bastard.  He musta blew up.
                    (then...)
               I got the hell outta there.  I
               didn't have the nerve to face the
               kid.

                         BUBBER
                    (thoughtful, serious)
               A lotta people wouldn't have tried.
               It was pretty brave even trying...

                         BERNIE
               Try stupid.

     BUBBER brakes for traffic and a cardboard box from the back seat
     hits BERNIE and cascades crushed cans all over him.

                         BUBBER
               Sorry about that.  Just toss them
               in back.
                    (very serious)
               A lot of people would say that's
               what heroism is... stupidity.  Doing
               something that if you thought about
               it, you wouldn't do it, it's not
               in your...  interest.

     BERNIE indicates the clutter of cans.

                         BERNIE
               You got a drinking problem or what?

                         BUBBER
               I sell them at the recycling center.
               Gives me a little for gas and food.

                         BERNIE
                    (considering the back
                     seat)
               Looks like you live in here, for
               Chrissake!

                         BUBBER
               In bad weather, yeah.  Mostly I camp
               out in the woods.  I thought maybe
               you were down on your luck too when
               I picked you up.

     BUBBER indicates BERNIE'S muddy, torn clothes, stocking foot.

                         BERNIE
               Down on my luck!  Hey, I toldja,
               a goddamn plane fell on me outta
               the sky.  In America, for Chrissake!
               See this shoe!  Hundred dollar pair
               of shoes.  One shoe!

     BUBBER glances at the shoe BERNIE'S waving.

                         BUBBER
               You should give it to someone with
               only one leg.

                         BERNIE
               One leg!  Like the Red Cross or
               something?

                         BUBBER
               I know a guy who only has one leg.

     BERNIE drops the shoe on the floor, shakes his head, disgusted.

                         BERNIE
               Sell it to him.  You get a couple
               bucks, it pays for the ride.
                    (a beat, then...)
               I got a job, nice apartment.  I do
               okay.

                         BUBBER
               They interview you or anything?
               At the plane crash?

                         BERNIE
               Hey, do I look crazy?  I don't go
               for that shit... interviews, media.
               They're manipulators.  "Keep a low
               profile," that's my motto.


     EXT.  FREEWAY - DAWN

     The Chevy inches forward as the traffic moves again, heading
     slowly toward the city.

                         BERNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    (continuing, grandly)
               Besides, I got these legal problems.
               My attorney don't want me giving
               statements to the press.

     Traffic is still crawling.


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

     GALE sits up in bed in spite of an I.V. in one arm and a cast
     on the other.  There's a big bandage across the bridge of her
     nose and her left leg is also heavily bandaged...

                         GALE.
               I don't understand.  You can't <u>find</u>
               him?

     She stares incredulously at her trio of visitors, CONKLIN,
     CHUCKY, and DEAKINS.  DEAKINS, uncomfortable outside his
     office, is awkwardly trying to vase a bouquet of flowers.

                         DEAKINS
               There's a lot of confusion around
               what went on last night, it's not
               clear...

                         GALE
               You said all the passengers were
               accounted for...

                         DEAKINS
               Apparently the guy who pulled you
               out wasn't a passenger...

     A NURSE gracefully relieves DEAKINS of the flowers he's
     destroying and skillfully vases them while GALE questions...

                         GALE
               A paramedic?  A fireman?  He didn't
               have a uniform...

                         CONKLIN
               From what we could get, there's a
               kind of... sort of... "mystery
               guy"...  involved.

                         DEAKINS
               We're piecing together different
               accounts and...

                         GALE
               A "mystery guy!"  "Not a passenger."
               Who?

                         CONKLIN
               We don't know who he is, he...

                         DEAKINS
               He disappeared.

                         GALE
                    (incredulous)
               A non-passenger, non-rescue-worker
               went into a burning plane and pulled
               me out and... <u>disappeared</u>?

     GALE starts to get up, struggling with covers, I.V., etc.

                         CONKLIN
               Not just you.  Apparently this guy
               is the one who opened the emergency
               exit from the outside...

                         DEAKINS
               Everybody! He saved everybody on
               the plane! Because of him, no
               fatalities!  I don't think you're
               supposed to move around like that,
               Gale.  You're attached there...

     GALE is getting out of bed, the I.V. still inserted in her arm.


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER (DAY)

     LESLIE looks directly into the camera as CHUCKY tapes her over
     GALE'S shoulder.

                         LESLIE
               And all of a sudden, this...
               "civilian"...  rushed <u>into</u> the
               plane.  Next thing you know he's
               hauling Freddy... he's the other
               flight attendant... out and then <u>he</u>
               <u>goes back in</u>.
                    (a beat, a tear,
                     then... )
               That's what gave me the courage to
               hang in there even though I knew
               the plane could blow any minute...

                         GALE
               What did he look like?


     INT.  HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER (DAY)

     MR. SMITH is being interviewed in his bed.  He's emotional...

                         MR. SMITH
               It was just this face, all dirty,
               it just appeared.  I really thought
               I was going to die.

                         GALE
               Did he say anything to you?

                         MR. SMITH
               He... asked if I was "Fletcher."


     INT.  OFFICE/CARPET CARE - DAY

     A man named ROBINSON, fifty, sloppy, screams apoplectically...

                         ROBINSON
               ONE WORD!  ONE WORD, LAPLANTE, AND
               YOU'RE FIRED!  GOT THAT?  ONE WORD!

     Exhausted, shoeless BERNIE follows ROBINSON in the cluttered
     Carpet Care Office...

                         BERNIE
               Bill, I...

                         ROBINSON
               DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T
               SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE
               WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"

                         BERNIE
               I...

                         ROBINSON
               YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN
               <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE
               EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE
               HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND
               ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW
               MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I
               KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY.
               I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.

                         BERNIE
               Bill, I got some legal problems and
               I...

                         ROBINSON
               THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE
               FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!

                         BERNIE
               Bill, listen...

                         ROBINSON
               OUT!  I TOLDJA.  JESUS CHRIST, I
               GOT CUSTOMERS WAITING!  AN' YOU WERE
               GONNA GO OUT LIKE THAT?  AN' MEET
               THE PUBLIC IN STOCKING-FUCKING-FEET?

                         BERNIE
               Bill, I got financial problems
               and...

                         ROBINSON
               I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS,
               I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS.
               <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT!
               OUT!  OUT!


     EXT.  CITY STREET - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

     BERNIE is trudging wearily up the busy sidewalk, dirty, tattered
     and shoeless, <u>BERNIE doesn't notice BUBBER staring in the window</u>
     <u>of an electronics store where dozens of television screens show</u>
     <u>the burning fuselage of Flight 104.</u>


     INT.  LIVING ROOM/FLETCHER HOME - DAY

     CHUCKY shoots over GALE'S shoulder as she interviews FLETCHER
     in his living room.

                         GALE
               He was asking for Mr. Fletcher...

                         FLETCHER
               My son and I got separated in the
               confusion and smoke.  The very
               courageous stewardess at the exit
               told me my boy had got out so I got
               out too.  But my son had already
               told this...  man that I was still
               in there.


     EXT.  APARTMENT HOUSE/CITY STREET - DAY

     Disheveled, in stocking feet, BERNIE trudges wearily up the
     front steps of the shabby apartment house where he lives,
     enters.


     INT.  RICHIE'S ROOM/FLETCHER HOME - MINUTES LATER (DAY)

     Posters, youthy icons.  CHUCKY shooting GALE interviewing RICHIE.

                         RICHIE
               I thought my dad was still... still
               in there.  So I asked the man to save
               my father.

                         GALE
               What did the man say, Richie?

                         RICHIE
               He said... uh... he said...
                    (not sure, thinking,
                     then... )
               "I'll save him."  He said, "I'll
               save your father."


     INT.  BERNIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     The door opens and BERNIE enters.  He pulls the contents of
     GALE'S wallet from his pocket and tosses them on a table... the
     plastic windows full of credit cards and cash.  Then he pulls
     off his jacket, ruefully inspecting a tear in the muddy sleeve.
     He's about to toss it on the ratty sofa when he notices it felt
     funny.  He reaches in another pocket and pulls out the Silver
     Mike Award, considers it for a moment.  What's it worth?

     Sitting on the sofa, he leans back... and starts to doze off.

     VIDEO IMAGE/EXT. "EXPLODING" PLANE - NIGHT

     FRAME BY FRAME the image inches forward, sweeping off the fire
     that fills the screen to the riverbank... frame by frame... fire
     ... fire... fire... then faster as the riverbank is darkening
     the frame and then LESLIE and the THIRD FIREMAN sweep into the
     foreground as the camera discovers them... the dramatic shot we
     remember of them coming up the riverbank.

                         GALE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Back.  Go back.  You missed it.

     Zip zip zip the image highspeeds back to the exploding plane.

     Again the screen is filled with fire...

                         GALE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Now.  Go forward again.

     Frame by frame the blossom of fire blooms consuming the plane.

                         GALE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Keep going.


     INT.  EDIT BAY - DAY

     REVEAL:  GALE in an editing bay at Channel Four, peering
     intently at the fiery scene on the video monitor while the young
     tape editor, JOAN, operates the controls.

     CONKLIN, DEAKINS, PARKER, CHUCKY flank GALE.

                         GALE
               There!  Right there.

     ON THE SCREEN (EXT.  AIRPLANE - NIGHT)

     A tiny silhouetted FIGURE appears in the far right corner of
     the frame.  Then, as one more frame clicks off, the FIGURE
     appears near the center of the next frame of the pan.

     The picture freezes there, a startling dramatic image of an
     UNRECOGNIZABLE FIGURE (BERNIE) in silhouette, dwarfed by the
     gigantic explosion.  IT'S AN AWESOME IMAGE.  NO ARTIST OR AD
     MAN COULD DO BETTER... A TINY, ANONYMOUS FIGURE, ALONE, AGAINST
     A GIGANTIC MOUNTAIN OF PURE FIRE.  AND FROM NOW ON IT WILL BE
     REFERRED TO AS "THE IMAGE."

     INT.  EDIT BAY - DAY

                         DEAKINS
               That's him?

                         GALE
               Who else?  We've accounted for
               everyone else.  That's our hero!

     She stares at "The Image."  It's powerful, stirring.

                         CHUCKY
               I didn't see the guy when I shot
               it.  I thought I was getting the
               last survivors when I panned over.

                         DEAKINS
               Any chance we could do some kind
               of electronic enhancement, you
               think?  Get a clear picture,
               identify him?

                         JOAN
                    (peering closely at the
                     screen)
               There's no face really, nothing to
               work with.  Big dots, that's all
               you'll get.

                         GALE
               Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty
               people.  Now he's going to disappear.
               Who is he?


     INT.  BERNIE'S APARTMENT - DAY

     UUUUHHHHOOOOOOOW!  BERNIE snores loudly, asleep on his sofa,
     still in his rumpled, torn clothes.  He SNORES again.

               said.  The next thing I knew, he
               was going back in there, into all

               -- out of the darkness... out of
               the smoke and the fear... came a
               man with no name... no uniform...
               but an abundance of courage.

     The CAMERA ZOOMS IN SLOWLY on GALE and simultaneously DISSOLVES
     SLOWLY TO... "THE IMAGE".  It fills the screen as GALE narrates
     VOICEOVER...

                         GALE'S VOICEOVER/TV
               A man who was thinking not about
               himself but about others, risking
               his own life for ours...
                    (a beat then...)
               He's out there now somewhere...
               and... whoever you are, I, and the
               other survivors of Flight 104, say,
               "Thank you!  God bless!"

     MUSIC SWELLS as the CAMERA ZOOMS IN on "THE IMAGE" emphasizing

     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE - DAY

     Flanked by GALE and CHUCKY, DEAKINS is watching the preceding
     material on the monitor.

                         DEAKINS
               Not bad.  But if you gotta wear a
               cast, you oughtta feature it more
               it's parta the story.
                    (seeing Wallace enter
                     the room)
               Network's taking everything we give
               'em.  They wanta feed off our six
               o'clock whether we find the mystery
               guy or not.  We're very big
               nationally.

                         WALLACE
               It's a wonderful piece.  Emotional.
               I love it.

                         DEAKINS
               We're gonna feature Gale's cast
               more.  The trick is gonna be keeping
               the upper hand on this piece.
               As long as we have Gale and there's
               no mystery guy, we're the center
               of the story.  But if he shows up
               and somebody else gets him first
               or exclusive...

                         WALLACE
               What about a reward for coming
               forward?

     DEAKINS answers a RINGING phone.  GALE frowns, frets.

                         GALE
               There could be problems with
               something like that Mister Wallace.
               What if...?

                         DEAKINS
                    (into phone)
               WHAT?  THEY FOUND WHAT?

     Everybody looks at DEAKINS.


     INT.  LIVING ROOM/EVELYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Ignoring the open schoolbook on the floor in front of him, JOEY
     is sprawled on the floor, eyes on the TV screen.

     ON THE SCREEN:  EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT

     A CLOSE-UP of a muddy shoe WIDENS to REVEAL the shoe nestled
     in GALE'S sling on top of her cast.  She addresses the camera
     from a spot directly in front of the crash site while behind
     her WORKMEN comb the wreckage under bright halogen lights.

                         GALE/VOICEOVER/TV
               A phone check with survivors has
               confirmed that the shoe does not
               belong to any of the crew or
               passengers of Flight 104.  Several
               witnesses recall the mysterious
               man who saved fifty-four people
               referring to his missing shoe.
               The conclusion; the unknown hero,
               know to many as "The Angel of
               Flight 104," wears a size 10B shoe.

                         EVELYN'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Joey!  Dinner!  Now!  Turn that
               thing off.


     INT.  EVELYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     ELLIOT is at the table with EVELYN as JOEY joins them.

                         JOEY
               He lost a shoe!

                         EVELYN
               Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.

                         JOEY
               The "unknown hero."  They found his
               shoe right beside the plane crash.

                         ELLIOT
               Superman, you mean?  Lost a shoe!
               What next?

                         EVELYN
               Elliot!  The man saved hundreds of
               people!

                         ELLIOT
               Fifty-four!  I was there, remember?
               You know why I didn't rush into that
               plane?  Because I'm a trained
               fireman, that's why!  Part of a
               team!  A disciplined team.  We take
               risks all the time, save people.
               But we don't take crazy chances.
               This guy does something really <u>dumb</u>
               and he lucks out.  So the media go
               crazy about his shoe for god's sake!
               What kind of message are they giving
               to youth?

                         EVELYN
                    (indicating Joey)
               What kind of message are <u>you</u> giving
               to youth?  Sneering at someone for
               sticking his neck out.  You sound
               like my ex for heaven's sake...
               Mister Cynicism.

     ELLIOT gets up, shrugs.

                         ELLIOT
               So what can I say?  Give your ex
               credit for being smart enough not
               to do something stupid.  Maybe the
               man's not all bad.  I'm gonna watch
               TV, hoping it's not all this
               "Superman stuff."

     ELLIOT walks over to the TV and turns it on, leaving JOEY and
     EVELYN alone.  JOEY is excited.

                         JOEY
               My father didn't have his shoes on
               when he... when he came here.

                         EVELYN
                    (surprised)
               You were in bed.  Weren't you?

                         JOEY
               I... I saw him out the window.

     EVELYN frowns, hesitates a moment.  Was the kid listening?
     Then...

                         EVELYN
               You think your father would do
               something like that?  Rescue people?
                    (sadly)
               Your father is Bernie LaPlante,
               Joey.  It's against his religion
               to stick his neck out.

               group claimed today that the
               mysterious hero is, in fact, an
               angel who is anticipated in
               scripture.


     INT.  SHADOW LOUNGE - NIGHT

     Washing glasses behind the bar, CHICK is watching the same show
     on the TV over the bar when he turns to see BERNIE enter
     (wearing a brand new pair of cheap running shoes.)

                         CHICK
               Bernie, how'sa kid?

                         BERNIE

               what?  I wouldn't want a problem
               for the establishment, Bern.

                         BERNIE
               You couldn't have a problem, Chick,
               because I personally have got them
               all.  I cornered the whole goddamn
               market.  You wouldn't believe...
               Oh, how ya doin'...?

     ESPINOSA and VARGAS have entered the bar. They have another guy

                         ESPINOSA
               We bring our frenn this time, okay?

     Something about MENDOZA spells trouble. it's almost palpable.
     BERNIE doesn't notice, but CHICK does.  He looks worried.

                         BERNIE
               Excuse me here, Chick, I gotta do
               these guys a little favor.

               How many you got there?  Eight?
               Ten?

     VARGAS slides into the booth before BERNIE can answer.

                         VARGAS
               They offer him a million dollars
               reward.

               those people, man.  Channel Four
               gonna give him a million for an
               interview.

               million bucks coming.  I'm the guy
               who...

                         ESPINOSA
                    (continuing)
               You have the right to the counsel
               of an attorney...

     ANGLE ON CHICK

     Watching BERNIE being hustled out of the bar, handcuffed,
     protesting loudly.

                         BERNIE
               CHICK, CALL MY ATTORNEY!  THIS IS
               BULLSHIT!  ENTRAPMENT!  I GOT A
               MILLION BUCKS COMING, FOR CHRISSAKE!

     MONTAGE: PRINTING PRESSES - DAY

     Newspapers roll off the presses one after another.

     <u>THE TIMES</u> features "The Image" with a headline over the firey
     scene trumpeting "AN ANGEL FOR FLIGHT 104?"

     <u>THE MIRROR</u> is tighter on the image featuring an enlargement of
     the silhouette of Bernie with a headline asking "WHO IS HE?"

     <u>THE HERALD</u> features a full page photo of the single muddy shoe
     with a headline supered over it announcing "SEARCH FOR MR.
     CINDERELLA!"

     and finally <u>THE TRIBUNE</u> screams in massive black letters "ONE
     MILLION DOLLAR REWARD!"


     EXT.  STREET CORNER/CITY - DAY

     A NEWS VENDOR is waving a paper and shouting...

                         NEWS VENDOR
               ONE MILLION DOLLAR REWARD TO THE
               UNANIMOUS HERO!  ONE MILLION BUCKS
               FOR THE "ANGEL" WHO SAVED FIFTY
               PEOPLE AND TOOK OFF!

     A WOMAN walks by with a tee-shirt featuring "The Image."  The
     spectacular picture looks great on the contours of her chest!


     EXT.  TV STATION - DAY

     PARKER, the youthful Channel Four gofer/runner, moves along a
     seemingly endless line of WANNABE HEROES that stretches along
     the sidewalk outside Channel Four and disappears around the
     corner.  He's addressing them at the top of his lungs...

                         PARKER
               PLEASE, IF YOUR FOOT ISN'T A SIZE
               10-B, DON'T REMAIN IN LINE.  WE'RE
               ONLY SEEING SIZE 10-B "HEROES."

     GROANS and CATCALLS from the WANNABES, as we MOVE ALONG the line,
     eavesdropping on various WANNABES...

                         AFRICAN AMERICAN
               Thass a racist perspective, assuming
               that because something heroic was
               done that a white man done it.  A
               man with mud on his face could be
               a man of any color, most likely was,
               which is true in this case cause
               it was me!  With mud all over me.

     Two other WANNABES are squaring off to fight...

                         1ST FIGHTER
               You call me a liar, I'm gonna kick
               your ass.

                         2ND FIGHTER
               Hey, it's not just <u>me</u> sayin' you
               ain't no hero.  Everybody in the
               goddamn line says you ain't the
               hero.

                         ANOTHER WANNABE
               Can you believe this?  Must be more
               than a thousand phonies after my
               reward.

     A WANNABE with mud smeared on his face spots GALE approaching
     the front door of the station, a look of amazement on her face
     at the length of the line.

                         MUD-FACE WANNABE
               HEY, MISS GAYLEY!  HEY, GALE!
               REMEMBER ME?  I'M THE GUY!  I SAVED
               YOUR LIFE!  REMEMBER --

     Rolling her eyes good naturedly, GALE walks briskly up the steps
     to the front door of the station, passing PARKER who's measuring
     a TALL WANNABE'S feet.  The TALL WANNABE calls out to her.

                         TALL WANNABE
               My foot's only eight and a half but
               I wear a ten B for the comfort.
               I swear!
                    (she keeps walking)
               Hey, Miss Gayley, I saved your life!

     Just as GALE is about to enter the TV station, PARKER catches
     up to her.

                         PARKER
               Hey, Miss Gayley, there's a cop
               looking for you.  From Robbery
               Detail, Inspector Dayton.  He wants
               you to call him.

                         GALE
               What about?

                         PARKER
               I didn't ask him.

                         GALE
               Call him back.  Ask him.
                    (indicating the line)
               I'm a little...busy.

     GALE disappears into the TV Station.


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE - DAY

     WALLACE is looking down at the line of WANNABES.


     INT.  COURTROOM - DAY

     JUDGE GOINES is addressing a miserable looking CRIMINAL...

                         JUDGE GOINES
               Bail in this matter will remain
               in the sum of five thousand
               dollars.  Next.

     DISCOVER MENDOZA, ESPINOSA AND VARGAS

     carrying on a whispered discussion with an African American
     detective (DAYTON) in the spectator section (AS THE COURT
     PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE IN THE BACKGROUND).  MENDOZA indicates
     something at the rear of the room to DAYTON who follows his
     look.

     DAYTON'S P.O.V.

     A group of PRISONERS have just been led in the side door from
     a holding cell and a BAILIFF is removing the handcuffs that
     tied the PRISONERS together.  One of the PRISONERS is BERNIE
     LAPLANTE.  DONNA approaches him as the BAILIFF uncuffs him.
     She speaks to him but her words are inaudible to DAYTON.

     ANGLE ON DAYTON

     as he watches BERNIE from a distance, nods affirmatively to
     something MENDOZA whispers in his ear.  <u>We</u> <u>realize</u> <u>we'll</u> <u>be</u>
     <u>seeing</u> <u>DAYTON</u> <u>again</u>...

     ANGLE ON DONNA

     astonished, reacting to BERNIE in a sharp whisper...

                         DONNA
               "The Angel of Flight 104!"  You're
               telling me you're the A...?

                         BERNIE
                    (whispering)
               "Angel!"  I didn't say "angel,"
               that's a little strong.  Listen,
               here's the thing, I gotta get over
               there to the TV station to collect
               my million bucks.

                         DONNA
               Mister LaPlante, I really want to
               help you, but crazy stories are
               only going to make it worse.  The
               D.A. is asking your bail be set
               at twenty-five thousand dollars
               because you were arrested again
               while you were out on bail...

                         BERNIE
               Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All
               you gotta do is get me outta here
               long enough to collect.

                         BAILIFF
               The People versus Bernard LaPlante.

     JUDGE GOINES scowls at the sight of BERNIE moving toward him
     talking already.

                         BERNIE
               Your honor, my attorney here says
               the prosecutor there wants
               twenty-five grand bail...

     DONNA looks horrified, the JUDGE furious...

                         JUDGE
               Mister LaPlante, you will be silent
               unless the court recognizes you...

                         BERNIE
                    (continuing grandly)
               --which is fine by me.  I got no
               problem with that at all.
               In fact, your honor, I'd be proud
               to double it.  Fifty grand!  A tip
               for "the people," your honor, if
               I could just...

     GOINES is banging his gavel angrily, glaring at BERNIE, not
     noticing a SECOND BAILIFF hurry into the courtroom.

                         JUDGE GOINES
               Mister LaPlante, unless you stop
               chattering immediately, I am going
               to ask the Bailiff to...

     JUDGE GOINES breaks off, eyes furious, as he spots BAILIFF CLAY,
     the Court Reporter, DE TAGLIO and the SECOND BAILIFF engaged
     in urgent whispering.

                         JUDGE GOINES
               DAMNIT!  I SAID I WANTED ORDER!

                         CLAY
               Sorry, your honor...

                         SECOND BAILIFF
               We got carried away.

                         DETAGLIO
               They found him.

                         JUDGE GOINES
               Found who?

                         CLAY
               The "Angel of Flight 104".

                         SECOND BAILIFF
               It was on the news!  Just now! He's
               gonna be on Channel Four at noon!

     BERNIE reacts, jaw sagging in disbelief.  The JUDGE sneaks a
     hasty look at his watch.

                         JUDGE GOINES
               We'll sustain bail at twenty-five
               thousand dollars.  That ought to
               keep Mister LaPlante out of trouble
               for a minute or two...

                         DONNA
               But your honor, my client is a
               responsible family man with limited
               resources who...

                         GALE
               But finally you did come forward.
               Why?

     BUBBER looks her right in the eyes, gives a sheepish grin.

                         BUBBER/TV
               The money, Gale.  I wouldn't have
               come forward at all if it wasn't
               for the reward.

                         GALE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Cut right there, right on that look!


     INT.  EDIT BAY - DAY

     REVEAL GALE in an editing room looking over editor JOAN'S
     shoulder as JOAN freezes the image and makes a note.

                         JOAN
               You didn't mention he was cute.

     GALE is staring intently at BUBBER'S modest, humble face frozen
     on the screen.

                         GALE
               He saved my life.

     VIDEO IMAGE (INT.  TV STUDIO)

     The humble, honest face of BUBBER, freeze framed as GALE'S
     VOICE narrates...

                         GALE/TV VOICE OVER
               --were shocked to learn that the
               hero who appeared out of the smoke
               and the fire and pulled them to
               safety was indigent and tragically
               hadn't slept in a bed in more than
               three years.


     INT.  DAY ROOM/JAIL - DAY

     Seeing BUBBER'S honest face on the TV screen in the day room
     enrages BERNIE...

                         BERNIE
               The guy's a fake, for Chrissake!
               He's a goddamn homeless bum.  He
               ain't no here, trust me on this,
               buddy.

     PRISONERS, standing in a group under the TV turn from the screen
     to BERNIE, like "who's this asshole?"  A BIG PRISONER glares
     at BERNIE ominously...

                         BIG PRISONER
               "Trust you"!


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE - DAY

     The office has become command-central.  REPORTERS hurry in and
     out, tearing off faxes, answering the phones, chattering at each
     other, GALE among them.  WALLACE is fretting to DEAKINS...

                         WALLACE
               I thought they'd all go "It's him!
               It's him!" and hug the guy or
               something.

                         DEAKINS
               Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and
               the shoe checks out.

                         WALLACE
               Does this mean I can stop worrying?
               Where'd we put him?

                         DEAKINS
               Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never
               stop worrying.  I figure we'll do
               a sidebar on what it's like to go
               from sleeping in your car and
               collecting cans to sleeping in the
               poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's
               onto something, digging into his
               background.

     PARKER rushes up to GALE...

                         PARKER
               Excuse me, Ms. Gayley.  That guy
               Inspector Dayton... he's recovered
               a bunch of your credit cards and

               Who?

                         PARKER
               Inspector Dayton, the cop from

                         GALE
               Nobody stole my credit cards.  They
               burned up in the crash.  Which

     The CAPTAIN finishes scribbling and seizes the menus.

               Very good, sir.  It's a special
               privilege to serve you.

     BUBBER smiles uneasily as the haughty CAPTAIN glides away.

                         BUBBER
               Uh, er... I...

               All the adulation?  It makes you

                         BUBBER
               Uh, actually... yes... I... should
               never have come forward and
               presented myself as --

     Just then a distinguished MILLIONAIRE on the way to his table
     barks gruffly at BUBBER...

                         MILLIONAIRE
               You're a credit to the goddamn human
               race.  Coulda been me in that plane.
               Or my family.

                         BUBBER
               Uh, thank you.

               ...unworthy of the adoration.  We
               all do.

     A bluehaired MATRON, extravagantly bejeweled, pauses to loom
     over BUBBER on her way out.

                         MATRON
               I'm going to donate a half million
               to charity in your name.  Would

     And then she's gone in a swish of silk, leaving BUBBER stunned.

                         BUBBER
               Is she... serious?  A half a million
               dollars?  In my behalf?

                         GALE
               You're a celebrity, John.  People
               are going to want to please you...
               or use you... or both.

     Bubber hears this, digests it, considers it.  He takes a bite
     of food, thinking.


     EXT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

     As the door to the restaurant opens, BUBBER finds himself
     blinded by winking electronic flashes and sun guns.  A CROWD
     OF FANS and MEDIA engulf him and GALE.  It's overwhelming.  WE
     SEE EAGER FACES and BLINDING FLASHES from BUBBER'S P.O.V. and
     HEAR the CACOPHONY OF QUESTIONS.

     GALE too is adrift in a churning sea of MEDIA and ONLOOKERS.

     POLICE OFFICERS move close to help guide GALE and BUBBER to a
     waiting limo.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER'S P.O.V.

     Again we see the chaos from BUBBER'S P.O.V., A POLICEMAN is
     reaching to help him.  Just then BUBBER glimpses something
     else... beyond the CROWD in the fringes... HOMELESS PEOPLE in
     the shadows, some applauding him, too shy to come forward.  In
     particular, BUBBER'S eyes fall on an ungainly MAN, his own age,
     dressed in rags and carrying a big garbage bag and another net
     sack full of cans.  IT'S A STUNNING IMAGE!  It's as though
     BUBBER is looking at himself!

     The door to the limo is open.  GALE and several POLICEMEN are
     trying to get BUBBER into the limo and out of the clutches of
     the enthusiastic CROWD.

                         GALE
               Come on, John.

     But BUBBER isn't paying attention to her.  He's turning to face
     the eager CROWD, raising his arms.

                         BUBBER
               Hey, hey, uh, take it easy.

     ANGLE ON GALE

     looking alarmed, then amazed.

     The CROWD is still alive and buzzing, but they're respecting
     BUBBER'S space as he accepts an autograph book from a young
     woman, SYLVIA, and speaks shyly.

                         BUBBER
               You, uh, want me to sign this?  Uh,
               what's your name?

                         SYLVIA
                    (weak in the knees,
                     smitten)
               S-sylvia.

                         BUBBER
                    (almost shy)
               Hey, if I sign this, will you do
               me a favor?

     Her COMPANIONS are already teasing her as they thrust pieces of
     paper, magazines at him to sign.

     ANGLE ON GALE

     watching in disbelief.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     signing one after another as he addresses all those close to
     him.

                         BUBBER
               What I'd like is...
                    (addressing the group)
               -- maybe some of the rest of you
               could help Sylvia here -- what I'd
               like is if you'd scrounge up some
               blankets -- used ones, fifty maybe
               -- and take 'em to the folks down
               at the corner of Fifth and Grand.
               Pass 'em out.

     Cameras are rolling, GALE watches, amazed.

                         FAT KID
               Fifth and Grand!

                         SKINNY KID
               He means the homeless people.  The
               bums.

                         BUBBER
               It gets cold down there at night.
               And <u>you'll</u> feel warmer for every
               person you give a blanket to.

     GALE'S knits her brow, trying to reconcile this performance with
     the apparent yokel she had dinner with a short time ago.


     INT.  LIMO/MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

     BUBBER looks back at the CROWD as the limo pulls away.

                         BUBBER
               I'll bet they do it.  I'll bet they
               get some blankets.

     GALE looks at BUBBER, reevaluating him.


     INT.  HOTEL LOBBY - LATER - NIGHT

     As BUBBER and GALE cross the luxurious lobby, again the center
     of attention, a GORGEOUS BLONDE, very leggy, practically
     plasters her plunging neckline against BUBBER.

                         GORGEOUS BLONDE
               Uplifting!  What you did was so
               uplifting!  You're a saint, John
               Bubber!

     BUBBER has trouble untangling his eyes from her tits.

                         BUBBER
               Uh, no.  But I, uh, wonder if you
               could up support... support a
               program to help the needy and...

                         GALE
                    (hackles raised)
               John, I'm sure she could support
               just about anything.
                    (steering him away)
               I think I'll see you to your room.
               A sort of bodyguard.  Make sure no
               harm comes to you.

     GALE ushers the dazed BUBBER toward a bank of elevators and
     prevents others from joining them in the elevator.


     INT.  ELEVATOR - SECONDS LATER

     GALE'S mood changes to amusement as she and BUBBER ascend alone.
     Giggling, she "points" her chest at BUBBER.

                         GALE
               Uh, if you could, just, uh, support,
               uh, a small airfield...

                         BUBBER
                    (embarrassed)
               It's been sometime since, uh, I
               received any, uh, of that kind of,
               uh... attention.  A couple of...
               years.

     GALE stops giggling.  Their eyes meet.  A charged moment.

                         GALE
               Years?
                    (then...)
               There are going to be lots of...
               opportunities.

                         BUBBER
               Gale... you're a very nice person.
               I wouldn't want to hurt you... in
               any way...

     They're struggling against an embrace that seems inevitable...

                         GALE
               I... I know that, John...

                         BUBBER
               You... you think I saved your...
               life.  I can't take advantage....

                         GALE
               You did save my life!  And it's <u>me</u>!
               I'd be taking advantage of <u>you</u>! I'm
               a reporter, John, an experienced
               professional...  I...

     Inevitably they embrace, KISS, can't help themselves.

     BUBBER disengages suddenly, distraught.

                         BUBBER
               I... no... I don't have the right...
               I...

                         GALE
               No, I don't have the right.  You're
               a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!

                         BUBBER
               Uh, right.  A... news story.

     She pushes him out the elevator door.

                         GALE
               I know the truth, John.  I'm flying
               in some guys from your unit in
               Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them
               live on network hookup!

                         BUBBER
                    (stunned)
               Vietnam!

                         GALE
               Goodnight, John.


     INT.  BEDROOM/DRAKE SUITE

     BUBBER wanders into the bedroom of the fabulous suite... in
     a daze.  He stares at BERNIE'S shoes on the floor.  He shakes
     his head as if to clear it.

     TELEVISION SCREEN: INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

     A fortyish black man, TOM WELLER, appears on the screen...

                         TOM/TV
               Next thing I know, I'm in this
               medical unit an' I see the other
               dude, the one who was with me when
               we got jumped, the one who I thought
               was dead.  There he is in the next
               bed.  I says "How'd we get here,
               brother?  We dead or what?"
               He says, "That crazy white brother,
               Johnny Bubber, he come back for us,
               hauled us out."  He shoulda been
               wrote up, got a medal, but it was
               fate.  Wasn't no officers around
               to observe it or nothing.

     TELEVISION SCREEN: INT. TV STUDIO - DAY

     A fortyish redneck type, CHARLIE BACON, is speaking to camera.

                         CHARLIE/TV SCREEN
               The sonofagun goes out in the
               paddies, pulling us outta there,
               one after the other, six guys.  Hey,
               it don't surprise me one bit it was
               Johnny Bubber went into that plane!

                         BERNIE VOICE (O.S.)
               Fifty bucks says the asshole was
               never even in Vietnam.


     INT.  DAY ROOM JAIL - DAY

     BERNIE is furious, glaring at the TV, surrounded by PRISONERS.

                         TOUGH PRISONER #2
               Shut your face, dirt bag... That
               guy's a goddamn hero and you're
               nothin' but a cynical little turd.

     ON THE SCREEN (INT. TV STUDIO - DAY)

     BUBBER is embracing WELLER, CHARLIE and several other VETERANS
     as GALE narrates...

                         GALE/VOICE OVER/TV
               After an emotional reunion, Bubber's
               fellow veterans watched as station
               manager James Wallace presented
               Bubber with a check for one million
               dollars...

     Surrounded by applauding MEDIA TYPES, SPECTATORS and VETERANS,
     BUBBER is accepting the check...

                         GALE/TV
               As Bubber reacted to his sudden
               wealth, word came that the
               Secretary of the Army, responding
               to an urgent resolution from the
               Senate has conferred on John
               Bubber the Medal of Honor.
               This for his actions in Vietnam more
               than 20 years ago, heroism that was
               not acknowledged at the time because
               it was not witnessed or reported
               by a ranking officer.  Later I spoke
               to him about his sudden change in
               circumstances...

     BUBBER appears full screen, head and shoulders, interview
     footage.  He's shy and awkward at first... tentative... then
     gaining confidence as he speaks...

                         BUBBER/TV
               Well, I don't feel... right... about
               all that money, Miss Gayley.  That's
               too much money for one person.  What
               I'm gonna do is donate, uh, most
               of it to different organizations
               like the Homeless Vets and stuff,
               and start up some programs... to
               help people.  See, when you're out
               there in the cold like I was, on
               the streets or sleeping under
               bridges or in your car, the worst
               thing, even worse than the hunger
               and the cold, is the...  feeling...
               that you're just plain...  useless.
               You don't matter to a single soul
               in this world, nobody needs you,
               nobody wants you.

                         BUBBER/TV
               I guess when I... did what I
               did... I was trying to save my
               own life more than anything else.
               Trying to connect myself with
               people again and be... part of the
               whole.  You have to help others
               to do that, you need a role to,
               play... even if it's a very humble
               role, it gives you self worth.


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE

     (NOTE:  Bubber dialogue, additional or as above continues
     throughout scene)

     GALE, her editor, JOAN, DEAKINS, WALLACE, CHUCKY, PARKER, and
     CONKLIN are crowded around the monitor staring at the screen.
     JOAN catches GALE surreptitiously hiding a tear and whispers
     to her...

                         JOAN
               Is he like that in real life?  So
               gorgeous?

                         GALE
               He's pretty... remarkable.

                         JOAN
                    (eyes widening at the
                     thought)
               You didn't... get it on with him?

                         GALE
               Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.

                         JOAN
               Reporters don't have hormones?

                         GALE
               Reporters... have to... rise above
               their hormones.

     ANGLE ON DEAKINS, WALLACE

     reacting to BUBBER on TV.  WALLACE is impressed.

                         WALLACE
               The guy's... a natural.

     DEAKINS rolls his eyes, a cynical, hardened newsman.

     ANGLE ON TV SCREEN (INT.  TV STUDIO - DAY)

                         GALE/TV/VOICE OVER
               I asked John Bubber about the
               Medal of Honor.

                         BUBBER/TV
               As far as the medal goes, well...
               that medal's for something me and
               my buddies did almost twenty years
               ago in Viet Nam.  So if I'm a war
               hero today then I was a war hero
               last week when I was selling cans
               and sleeping in my car... when I
               didn't have a medal.  I don't think
               a medal makes a hero.  You don't
               need machinegun fire or burning
               planes to be... brave.  People do
               heroic acts every day only there's
               nobody around to take their picture
               or decorate them.  Little things
               can be heroic.  Helping someone
               day in and day out, giving up your
               life a little every day instead
               of all at once... to help.
               Maybe... maybe we're all heroes.

               fear... came The Angel of Flight
               104.  John Bubber saved fifty-four
               people.  This is his story and
               theirs.  A drama featuring the
               actual people who actually lived
               those moments of terror.  No
               make-up, no music, no actors.
               This is the <u>real</u> <u>thing</u>.  Thursday
               night.  Channel-Four.  Be there!

     On Screen the Channel Four logo blends exotically with "The
     Image".


     INT.  SUITE/DRAKE HOTEL - DAY

     A dismayed BUBBER dials the telephone.


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER - DAY

     DEAKINS and WALLACE walk, deep in conversation, WALLACE upset.

                         WALLACE
               Upset!  What's he upset about?

                         DEAKINS
               Said he's not an actor.

                         WALLACE
               He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor,
               that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u>
               <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u>
               like a real life hero.  That's the
               <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole
               <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call
               him back?

                         DEAKINS
               She's talking to him now.

                         WALLACE
               We paid him a million dollars.
               You'd think he'd want to cooperate
               a little, help our ratings.

     DEAKINS responds eagerly to GALE entering the office.

                         DEAKINS
               How'd it go?

                         GALE
               He'll do it.
                    (to Wallace)
               You really-should have talked to
               him first.

                         WALLACE
               He might have said no.


     INT.  CORRIDOR/HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

     BERNIE charging through the crowded Waiting Room having just
     been released on bail.  He doesn't actually shove the WOMEN and
     CHILDREN waiting to visit inmates out of the way, but he doesn't
     slow down either as he weaves rapidly among them with DONNA on
     his heels, barely able to keep pace.  He doesn't look back as
     he speaks rapid-fire.  He's really pissed.

                         BERNIE
               Whaddaya mean they didn't reduce
               the bail?  If they didn't reduce
               it, how'dja spring me?

                         DONNA
                    (a deep breath,
                     embarrassed)
               I took a loan on my car and my
               computer.

                         BERNIE
                    (actually stops, faces
                     her)
               You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You
               gave a bondsman ten percent?

                         DONNA
               I was inspired by the hero, how he
               stuck his neck out for others, how
               he took a chance...

                         BERNIE
                    (apoplectic)
               That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a
               guy who's been fired off his job
               <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars?
               A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u>
               <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an
               <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're
               s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!

                         DONNA
                    (fighting tears)
               Well, as you like to point out,
               Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively
               inexperienced.  My naivete may have
               worked to your benefit in this
               instance.

     BERNIE frowns at that, starts walking again.

                         BERNIE
               Well, you're right, I'm glad you
               got me out, I appreciate that.

     BERNIE charges out the door, exiting the building with DONNA
     right behind him.


     EXT.  HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

     Hurrying down the steps, BERNIE barks over his shoulder at
     DONNA.

                         BERNIE
               Listen, now that I owe you
               twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how
               about loaning me twenty for cab
               fare?

                         DONNA
               So you can call me "naive," Mister
               LaPlante.

                         BERNIE
               Hey, you could call me "Bernie,"
               forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.
                    (seeing Donna open her
                     wallet)
               You are naive.

                         DONNA
               I read the probation report.  It's
               not good.  I think you're going...
               going to prison, Mister... Bernie.
               I know that scares you but..

                         BERNIE
               TAXI!  HEY, TAXI!
                    (turning on her)
               Well, at least I'm gonna get my
               goddamn million bucks.
                    (screaming at a cab)
               TAXI FOR CHRISSAKE!

     A cab pulls to the curb and BERNIE jumps in, talking.

                         BERNIE
               I seen on the TV where that
               do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit
               sick kids at three-thirty.
                    (to the Cabbie)
               Children's Hospital, on the double.

                         DONNA
                    (alarmed)
               You mean John Bubber?

     BERNIE speaks out the window of the cab as it pulls away.

                         BERNIE
                    (then, through the
                     window)
               That bozo don't just owe me a
               million bucks for my shoe, he's a
               goddamn <u>menace</u>!  Look what he done
               to you!  He's makin' people <u>insane</u>.
               He's a <u>whacko</u>, he' gotta be stopped.

     Stunned, DONNA watches the cab disappear in traffic with BERNIE
     raving from the open window.


     EXT.  CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - LATER (DAY)

     Limos are parked out front of the hospital and there is a
     gathering of TV vans as BERNIE exits a cab and charges toward
     the entrance of the hospital, a tiny figure dwarfed by the huge
     building.  He disappears inside.


     INT.  CORRIDOR/CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

     We discover BERNIE wandering around, lost.  A NURSE gives him
     a glance in passing and BERNIE suddenly is aware that his
     appearance is unusual.  Disheveled.  Unshaven.  He tries to
     smooth his hair a little as he turns into a doorway.


     INT.  SPECIAL CHILDREN'S WARD/CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

     Stepping through the door BERNIE is immediately horror stricken.

     Rows of beds.  A room full of seriously SICK CHILDREN.  Palsied.
     Eyes out of sync.  Motor disorders, spasms.  Terrifying
     paraphenalia...  tubes, machines, monitors, bags of fluid.  A
     place of sUffering.  To BERNIE it's a vision of a leper colony!

     A SEVEN YEAR OLD spots him, clutches at him with clawlike hands,
     jerky movements.

     BERNIE recoils in horror, backing away.

     A FIVE YEAR OLD, "blinded" by the gauze wrapped around his face
     "looks" toward BERNIE and speaks.

                         "BLIND" CHILD'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Is that him?  Is he here yet, Miss
               Roberts?

     An EIGHT YEAR OLD with a bandaged arm responds, looking at
     BERNIE.

                         EIGHT YEAR OLD
               Naw, it's just some guy.

     A nurse MISS ROBERTS, appears from behind a curtain suddenly
     and restrains the SEVEN YEAR OLD as she addresses BERNIE...

                         MISS ROBERTS
               Excuse me, sir.  Can I help you?

                         BERNIE
               Uh, well I... what I...

     Looks "wrong," acts "wrong."  Looks like a child molester!

                         MISS ROBERTS
               You'll have to leave, ,sir.  This
               ward is off limits.  If you want
               to arrange a visit...

     Just then a couple of CAMERAMEN back through the door shooting.
     It's the head end of an entourage of REPORTERS, CAMERAMEN,
     HOSPITAL PERSONNEL and a couple of SECURITY GUYS that are
     traveling with BUBBER.

     BERNIE is bumped backward by a CAMERAMAN just as he sees BUBBER
     enter surrounded by MEDIA PEOPLE.

     BERNIE'S P.O.V.

     seeing BUBBER <u>unhesitatingly</u> reach out to the grotesque SEVEN
     YEAR OLD and lift him into is arms, eyes shining with warmth,
     smiling genuinely <u>like he likes</u> picking up hideous looking kids.

     ANGLE ON MISS ROBERTS

     tapping one of the SECURITY OFFICERS on the shoulder and
     indicating BERNIE to him.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     remembering why he's here.  It's not going to be as easy as he
     thought.  He starts to move through the entourage looking very
     out of place.

                         BERNIE
               Excuse me, pal.  Uh, couldja lemmee
               through here?  Thanks I...

     THE SECURITY OFFICER is suddenly between BERNIE and his
     destination.

                         SECURITY OFFICER
               You gotta press pass, sir?

                         BERNIE
               Press pass?  Uh, hey, I lost it.
               Listen...

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     holding the SEVEN YEAR OLD.  Smiling broadly, the child radiates
     joy in the warmth of BUBBER'S embrace, his grotesqueness
     miraculously minimized by his mood.

                         BERNIE
                    (O.S., diminishing)
               GETCHER GODDAMN HANDS OFFA ME.  ALL
               I WANNA DO IS TALK TO THE GUY.

     BUBBER and everybody turn toward the sound of the commotion.

     BUBBER'S P.O.V.

     of an unidentified MAN (BERNIE), obscured by the bodies of the
     two SECURITY OFFICERS who are hurriedly hustling him off the
     ward.

                         BERNIE (O.S.)
               HEY, HOLD ON, BUDDY.  THIS IS
               AMERICA FOR CHRISSAKE!  I GOT
               RIGHTS!

     BUBBER

     is frowning when a DOCTOR reassures him...

                         DOCTOR
               All under control.  An unfortunate
               man.  Security will look after him.

     BUBBER nods and turns back to SICK KIDS who seem transfigured
     from BERNIE'S gruesome vision to children radiant with hope.
     Much of their appearance, at least, was attitude, despair.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     A solitary figure.


     INT.  WARD/HOSPITAL - DAY

     A 14 year old ALLEN lies comatose in an intensive care room,
     tubes in his nose, arms, and chest, monitors all around him,his
     arms and legs in casts and traction.

     BUBBER leans over the unconscious boy speaking intensely while a
     DOCTOR hovers next to him and REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN jockey for
     position at the foot of the bed.

                         BUBBER
               Listen, kid, you gotta hang on.
               I know you're scared, we all get
               scared, but that's when you have
               to fight...

                         DOCTOR.
               I'm afraid he can't hear you.  He...

                         BUBBER
               He can hear me...

     As he leans closer to ALLEN, BUBBER puts a hand out without
     turning away from the boy,and waves away CHUCKY who has oozed
     in close with his camera.  This is private.  Understanding, GALE
     puts a hand on the lens and pushes the camera aside.

                         BUBBER
               Listen...
                    (eyes flicking to
                     Allen's I.D. bracelet)
               Allen, you're in the darkness there
               and it's scary.  The doctors are
               working on you but the tough part
               is for you.  You can't quit!

     GALE can't hear what BUBBER is saying as he leans even closer
     to ALLEN and grips the boy's hand.

     CLOSE ON BUBBER AND ALLEN

                         BUBBER
               I know you don't know it, but
               you're a hero.  Sometimes you
               don't know how brave you are...
               and sometimes you don't know...
               you can do something...  until
               you... until you surprise yourself
               and... do it.  But I know you've
               got the stuff, I know it in my
               heart.  I want you to struggle
               kid... for yourself, for all of
               us.
                    (vulnerable)
               For me.  I... I really need you
               to do this for me.  I <u>need</u> you to
               get well, Allen.

     Did an eyelid flicker?  Did the boy hear?

     GALE'S eyes glisten with emotion as BUBBER rises, shaken.


     EXT.  HOSPITAL - DAY

     A CROWD is waiting for BUBBER, MEDIA PERSONNEL among them.

     BERNIE comes up behind a TV CAMERAMAN and taps his shoulder.

                         BERNIE
               Hey, buddy, you're with the media,
               right?  I got a story for you.
               Something fantastic.  That guy
               Bubber, he's a fake, he...

     THE CAMERAMAN is turning to consider BERNIE when there's a
     sudden EXCITEMENT.  The CROWD surges toward the hospital
     entrance.  VOICES cry out "He's coming!  Here he comes!"

     THE CAMERAMAN turns toward the doors leaving BERNIE helpless,
     caught in a surging tide of people.

                         BERNIE
               HEY!  WATCH OUT!  HOLD ON!  FOR
               CHRISSAKE!


     INT.  LOBBY/CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY

     BUBBER and his entourage of DOCTORS, MEDIA PEOPLE and SECURITY
     GUARDS are surging toward the front door of the hospital like
     an excited amoeba.  GALE is close to BUBBER in the crush.

                         GALE
                    (emotional)
               You were... very... inspiring.

                         BUBBER
                    (alarmed)
               A script!  I thought we just walked
               through everything...

                         GALE
               Read it.  It'll be fine.

     They're being swept through the front door of the hospital, the
     whole amoeba.  A CHEER GOES UP.


     EXT.  FRONT STEPS/HOSPITAL - DAY

     BERNIE is being tossed about like a cork in stormy seas.
     Buffeted about by happy ONLOOKERS full of good will, only BERNIE
     is surly, obnoxious.

                         BERNIE
               Quit shovin', lady.  Hey, watch yer
               elbow.  YOU'RE ALL NUTS FOR CRYING
               OUT LOUD!  WHATSA MATTER WITH YOU?

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     being jostled as his BODYGUARDS are shoved back into him,
     CAMERAS push toward his face, HANDS reach out desperately for
     him.  But, in a dramatic contrast to BERNIE, BUBBER thrives on
     the energy, laughing, reaching out to touch the hands that reach
     for him, thriving on the vibe.

                         TEENAGE GIRL
               I LOVE YOU, JOHN BUBBER!

                         BUBBER
               HEY, WE ALL LOVE EACH OTHER, DON'T
               WE?

                         OLD WOMAN ONE
               GOD BLESS YOU, JOHN!  GOD BLESS YOU!

                         BUBBER
               GOD BLESS US ALL!

                         BERNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               YA GODDAMN PHONY!

     BUBBER stiffens imperceptibly.  Dld he hear that right?  Was
     there a discordant note in the cacophony' of VOICES singing his
     praises from every direction?

     BUBBER'S POV

     A sea of shining faces filled with love and admiration surges
     in front of him.  And yet, that VOICE again, a sour note of
     contraction...

                         BERNIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               BUBBER, YA GODDAMN FRAUD!  THAT'S
               MY SHOE AND MY MONEY!

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     Hearing it, looking around urgently, but all he sees are
     ADMIRERS thrusting at him as he's borne, as if on a tide, toward
     his limo.  Nobody else seems to have noticed BERNIE'S VOICE.


     INT.  WAITING LIMO

     As the door slams shut, the cheering is suddenly faint.  BUBBER
     sinks back in the opulent seats while FACES distort themselves
     against the smoked glass, trying to peer into the sanctuary.

     Then, as the limo pulls away, BUBBER hears the VOICE again
     muffled by the thick glass.  He turns, looks out the rear
     window.  He sees the CROWD receding behind him, a confusion of
     SPECTATORS and... is that that hitchhiker (BERNIE) being
     restrained by a COP?

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     Shaken and frowning with concern, he turns away from the scene
     now out of view behind the moving limo.

     Alone in the luxurious leathered sanctuary, he realizes his
     hands are shaking as he reaches for the manila envelope GALE gave;
     him and tears it open.

     He stares at the script titled <u>THE ANGEL OF FLIGHT 104</u>.


     EXT.  CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY

     As the happy CROWD disperses, an enraged BERNIE is facing a COP.

                         BERNIE.
               Don't tell me what I can and can't
               say.  This is America.

                         COP
                    (laughing)
               Hey, suit yourself, buddy.  If it
               makes you feel better to insult a
               man who's worth about a thousand
               of you, go ahead.  Like he says,
               "We're all heroes," pal.  Even you.

                         BERNIE
               Bullshit!  What a lotta bullshit!

                         COP
               Okay, have it your own way: you're
               not a hero.











               [PAGE 92 IS MISSING FROM THE SCRIPT.]













     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     blinking, as the T-shirts magically feature BUBBER again,
     smiling, heroic.  BERNIE wonders if this is hell.


     INT.  SHADOW LOUNGE - NIGHT

     Behind the deserted bar, CHICK looks from the TV set as BERNIE
     enters, weary and bedraggled, the strut gone.  Bernie holds up
     his hands defensively.

                         BERNIE
               Hey, I don't blame you for bein'
               sore.  I know I screwed up gettin'
               busted in here.  You got a right
               to throw me out.

                         CHICK
               I'm not gonna throw you out, Bernie.

     CHICK is fixing a seven and seven.  He puts it on the bar.
     BERNIE hesitates, then steps to the bar, takes a drink.

                         BERNIE
               Thanks, Chick.  I appreciate it.

                         REPORTER/TV (O.S., VOICEOVER)
               The doctors who had believed the
               boy had little or no chance for
               survival, now predict a slow but
               complete recovery.

     CHICK glances up at the TV screen and BERNIE looks too.

     ON THE TV SCREEN (INT. WARD/HOSPITAL - DAY)

     news footage shows young ALLEN in his hospital bed, still
     engulfed in tubes and life support equipment, but conscious now,
     smiling bravely for the CAMERA while a REPORTER narrates.


     INT.  SHADOW LOUNGE - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON CHICK

     eyes on the TV, shaking his head in wonder.

                         CHICK
               Helluva guy, ain't he?  Vietnam,
               plane crash, now miracles.

     BERNIE stares at the screen lost in thought.


     EXT.  VIDEO STUDIO - DUSK

     A sign over the door says "STAGE ONE/CHANNEL 4." Further down,
     on the door itself a sign says "NO ADMITTANCE/ AUTHORIZED
     PERSONNEL ONLY"

     UNIFORMED POLICE linger around the door, surrounded by FANS and
     BUBBER'S limo waits at the curb, his DRIVER lounging by the
     door.

     DAYTON (we saw him earlier in the courtroom), is making his way
     through the knot of ONLOOKERS and MEDIA PERSONNEL gathered
     around the limo and in front of the entrance.

     Approaching as if to enter, he is confronted by one of the
     several UNIFORMED POLICEMEN guarding the doorway.

                         POLICE OFFICER
               Sorry, sir.  Closed to the public..
                    (Dayton is reaching for
                     his fold)
               No media either, sir, they're taping
               a show and... Oh, right.  Sorry
               about that, Inspector.

     DAYTON is flashing his badge fold as the POLICEMAN hastily opens
     the door for him.


     INT.  STAGE ONE - NIGHT

     DAYTON enters the sound stage and sees the mock-up bathed in
     hot light in the middle of the darkened stage, surrounded by
     shadowy cameras and TECHNICIANS.  The SURVIVORS are visible in
     the skeletal plane, rehearsing.

     DAYTON settles in the shadows, out of earShot, watching.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     Approaching GALE who's lying "helplessly" among the seats.  He
     looms over her, his face obscured by "mud" make-up, hesitates.
     She whispers helpfully...

                         GALE
               Now you lean down and free me from
               the seat.  I was caught and...
               that's it.  Good.

     BUBBER bends down, starts to "free" her, a troubled look on his
     face.  <u>He is struggling with something emotionally</u>.

                         GALE
               Now you help me up.  Boy, you
               seem...  taller.  It must be
               psychological...  now that I know
               you saved my life...

                         BUBBER
                    (lifting her)
               Gale!  I can't go through with this!
               It's... it's all wrong!'

                         GALE
               You're doing fine.  You didn't
               actually lift me though.  It was
               more like you supported me.

                         BUBBER
                    (supporting her)
               That's not what I mean...

                         GALE
               There, like that.  Kind of, uh,
               sexy.
                    (with meaning)
               You can support me anytime, John.

                         BUBBER
               Gale...

                         GALE
                    (giggle)
               I just remembered.  You were
               talking about bodybuilding and
               swearing.

                         BUBBER
               Bodybuilding!

     THE DIRECTOR'S VOICE booms over the speaker from the booth.

                         DIRECTOR'S VOICE (O.S.)
               WE DON'T WANT ACTING, AS I SAID.
               BUT WHEN WE DO A TAKE, GUYS, PLEASE
               DON'T LAUGH, OKAY?  IT HAS TO PLAY
               SERIOUS.  IT WAS A VERY SERIOUS
               THING...
                    (a beat, then...)
               UH, ALSO, JOHN, MAYBE YOU COULD LIFT
               HER MORE, SORT OF CARRY HER.  I KNOW
               THAT MAY BE BENDING REALITY JUST
               A TEENSY BIT, BUT IF YOUR
               JOURNALIST'S INTEGRITY CAN HANDLE
               IT, GALE, I THINK IT WOULD "PLAY
               BETTER" ON THE SCREEN.
                    (then, to all of
                     them...)
               OKAY, GANG, LET'S RUN THROUGH IT
               FROM THE TOP ONE MORE TIME, THEN
               WE'LL DO A TAKE.

     ANGLE ON DAYTON

     Watching, impassive.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     Lifting GALE, uncomfortable.

                         BUBBER
               It's not right, Gale...

                         GALE
                    (misunderstanding again)
               It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u>
               better carrying me.  Oh, you mean
               because I wasn't carrying my purse
               at the time.

     GALE has a purse under one arm.

                         GALE
                    (suddenly serious, eye
                     contact)
               You're an inspiration, John.  You're
               making us better human beings.  Less
               cynical.  More open, more giving.
               Do you realize that?

     BUBBER starts to say something again, but the moment for
     confession has passed, they're approaching LESLIE who is
     applauding along with the other SURVIVORS, tears in her eyes.

                         LESLIE
               You leave her here... and you (sob)
               go back in again.

     BUBBER nods and starts grimly back up the slope, trapped in his
     heroic role.


     INT.  SHADOW LOUNGE - NIGHT

     BERNIE is sitting moodily at the bar while CHICK washes glasses
     and the TV DRONES.  BERNIE is wrestling with a thought.  He
     breaks the, silence finally.

                         BERNIE
               What wouldja say if I toldja I ran
               into a burning plane an' saved a
               buncha people, Chick, an' risked
               my goddamnlife?

                         CHICK
               You mean like Bubber?  The hero?

                         BERNIE
               Yeah, like that.  Same thing.

                         CHICK
               Well... I mean... what am I supposed
               to say here, Bern?  Is this a riddle
               or what?

                         BERNIE
               I mean, if I said it, wouldja
               believe me?
                    (then...)
               Ya wouldn't, would ya?

                         CHICK
               It's a character thing, Bernie.
               I mean, you wouldn't do it.  No
               offense.  Me neither.  I mean, a guy
               like Bubber, he's a certain kinda
               guy.  Heroic.  You and me, we're
               not... heroic.  It's not our nature.
               It don't mean we're bad or nothing.
               We're just not so inclined.  What
               about it?

                         BERNIE
               Nothin'.

                         CHICK
               I wouldn't be depressed about it,
               Bern.  A guy don't have to be heroic
               to be a human being.

                         BERNIE
               The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin'
               down.

                         CHICK
               Down.  You mean jail?  For that
               credit card stuff?  For Chrissake,
               Bernie, your lawyer...

                         BERNIE,
               Not jail.  Prison.  And not that
               credit card bullshit, that's
               nothin'.  I got a conviction.
               Sentencing tomorrow.  Some cases
               of paint I got involved with.
               Latex.  I see this parole officer,
               he writes a report to the judge says
               I'm "anti-social."

                         CHICK
               "Anti-social."  Jesus, Bernie.
               How much paint are we talking
               about?

                         BERNIE
                    (grimly)
               A lot.

     INT.  STAGE ONE - NIGHT

     DAYTON unnoticed among the shadows, as the YOUTHFUL DIRECTOR
     addresses the assembled SURVIVORS.  DAYTON focuses on GALE.

                         YOUTHFUL DIRECTOR
               That's a wrap, guys.  I want to
               thank you all.  I think we did
               something very important here this
               evening.

     BUBBER is looking for GALE, spots her fifteen yards away.

     BUBBER'S P.O.V. - A BLACK MAN

     is showing GALE something, a badge fold, saying something to
     her.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     reacting.  A frown.  he starts to move toward them but a MAKE-UP
     ARTIST approaches him insistently...

                         MAKE-UP ARTIST
               Just let me get that gunk off your
               face, Mister Bubber.

                         BUBBER
               Uh, it can wait, I...

     His eyes on GALE and DAYTON, BUBBER is disengaging from the
     MAKE-UP ARTIST when SUSAN suddenly blocks his way, holding up
     a DOLL, a shy KELLY in tow.

                         SUSAN
               Mister Bubber... uh, John... Kelly
               wants you to sign an autograph for
               John Jr.

     BUBBER finds himself facing a JOHN BUBBER DOLL, sees KELLY
     peering up at him hopefully.  What can he do?  He's a patsy.

     ANGLE ON GALE

     as DAYTON speaks to her.

                         DAYTON
               Won't take more than ten minutes.
               Fifteen at the most.  I'll buy you,
               a cuppa coffee down the street.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     Handing the autograph to KELLY and looking toward the spot where
     GALE was.

     BUBBER'S P.O.V. - DAYTON AND GALE

     walking toward the exit.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     calling out, starting after them.

                         BUBBER
               Gale!

     Just then SMITH rushes up to him, blocking his way.

                         SMITH
               I breathe, I see the sun, I thank
               you.  God bless you.  I'm alive
               because of you, every moment of life
               I owe to you.

     BUBBER looks at his grateful face.  What can he say?  He looks
     toward the exit.

     BUBBER'S P.O.V.

     GALE and DAYTON have disappeared.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     eyes full of despair as other grateful PASSENGERS engulf him...


     INT.  COFFEE SHOP - LATER (EVENING)

     Credit Cards are spread out on the formica table top in the
     booth where GALE and DAYTON face each other.

                         GALE
               How... how does this, whatsisname,
               the "sleazebag," <u>say</u> he got my
               cards?

                         DAYTON
               LaPlante?  Ha!  Which version?  This
               bozo has more stories than a
               newspaper.  In one of them, <u>he's</u>
               "the angel of Flight 104!"  <u>He</u> pulls
               you off the plane, saves your purse
               for you, but forgets to return it.
               That's Version 63.  In Version 64,
               he kept it to pay for his "hundred
               dollar shoes." The guy's a bullshit
               artist, he's already got a sentence
               pending for dealing stolen goods.
                    (leaning forward,
                     whispering)
               Listen, I know.  this is pretty off
               the wall... that guy, the hero,
               Bubber...  he was a homeless guy,
               right?  Down on his luck?  He
               couldn't have swiped the wallet,
               could he?  While he was rescuing
               you?  And sold it to this guy
               LaPlante?

                         GALE
                    (raised eyebrows)
               John Bubber risks his life to save
               me and fifty-four other people
               and...  swipes my purse?

                         DAYTON
               Too far-fetched?  I mean, I'm not
               trying to make problems for John
               Bubber, I just want to make sure
               this creep LaPlante does some
               meaningful time.  If we can't figure
               out how he got the cards, it makes
               it more difficult.

                         GALE
               Tell me more about him.


     INT.  LIVING ROOM/EVELYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     JOEY is sprawled on the living room floor, surrounded by
     homework, his eyes on the TV set.

     EVELYN, on the sofa, looks up from her book and catches JOEY
     watching the TV.

                         EVELYN
               Homework.  You're doing homework,
               remember?

     The phone rings and EVELYN gets up and goes for it.

                         EVELYN
                    (to Joey)
               Homework, homework, homework!  No
               homework, no zoo trips, no movies.
                    (into phone)
               Hello.
                    (then, very cold...)
               He's doing his homework.

     JOEY looks up from his homework.


     INT.  PHONE BOOTH/SHADOW LOUNGE - NIGHT

     BERNIE is talking into the phone urgently...

                         BERNIE
               Look, I'm going away, I just wanna
               say goodbye to... never mind where.
               I just wanna say... He can't call
               me back later, my phone's

     INT.  LIVING ROOM/EVELYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     EVELYN covers the mouthpiece and turns to JOEY...

                         EVELYN
               It's your father.  If you don't talk
               to him, he's going to call all
               night.


     INT.  PHONE BOOTH/SHADOW LOUNGE - NIGHT

                         BERNIE
               Hey, Joey, how ya doin', pal, it's
               me.  Your old man.  You get the
               twenty dollars?  What?
                    (listens...)
               Well, she's right on that, Joey,
               that's the best place for it, a
               college fund.  I was gonna tell ya
               that myself.  Look, about how I
               didn't show up the other night I...
               what?
                    (he listens)
               You seen me out the window....
                    (listens)
               One shoe, yeah and the mud...  So
               you thought I mighta been the heroic
               guy, huh?
                    (a beat, then...)
               An' what'd she say when you...?
               "Against my religion," huh?
                    (he struggles, then...
                     decisive)
               Well, you know Joey, this kinda
               stuff, we gotta talk about it some
               time, man to man.  But I gotta go
               off on this -- this damn business
               trip now...  for a while.  So...
               so I won't be seein' you.  What you
               gotta do, you gotta listen to your
               mother, she's smart, very smart,
               knows what's best for you and...
                    (reacting)
               No, no, no, it ain't 'cause I don't
               like you, Christ!  I mean, not
               "Christ," you know... I mean I don't
               <u>wanna</u> go on this business thing,
               I love you Joey, but I <u>gotta</u>!
               That's part of growing older, all
               these goddamn (pardon the
               vulgarity) business things you have
               to do.  Which reminds me, this
               "hero" business... one of the things
               you learn as you get older is that
               life gets very <u>complicated</u>...
               <u>weird</u> actually... people aren't
               exactly like they seem...  nothing
               is...  life gets unbelievable...
               this is normal as you grow older
               and...  huh?  I was talking to Joey.


     INT.  EVELYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

                         EVELYN
               Your son actually wants to spend
               time with you.  If you let him down
               this time after popping back into
               his life...


     INT.  PHONE BOOTH/SHADOW LOUNGE - NIGHT

                         BERNIE
               Ev, you gotta understand, it's
               this...  this goddamn business trip,
               no wait, don't hang up, Ev, just
               a sec, listen, I just wanna say one
               thing, okay?  One thing!
                    (with some effort)
               I know I kinda act like an asshole
               sometimes.  I know that.  I know
               you were a good wife.  I know I
               fucked it up.  I had a good thing
               an' I blew it.  I just want you to
               know I know that, okay?  I gotta
               go now.  Business trip.  It's gonna
               be a while.

     BERNIE hangs up.


     INT.  EVELYN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     EVELYN stares at the phone as though it had changed into a piece
     of fruit before her eyes!  Bernie said that?


     INT.  HALLWAY/APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

     WINSTON (who bought Bernie's TV) has opened his door just a
     crack to address GALE and CHUCKY.  It says "Manager" on the door.

                         WINSTON
               LaPlante!  That asshole!  I don't...
               Hey, is that you, from the tee vee?
               In person?

                         GALE
               We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd
               like to find --

                         WINSTON
               "This is Gale Gayley for Channel
               Four News!"  Incredible.
               Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante!
               He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he
               stole <u>paint</u>?

                         GALE
               We couldn't find his name on the
               buzzer or on the mailbox, but...

     WINSTON pushes past them out the, door and into the corridor.

                         WINSTON
               "Low profile."  That's his big
               motto!  He don't put his name on
               anything.  Come on, we'll go look.

     GALE sees WINSTON trundling down the corridor toward the
     stairwell.


     INT.  STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

     WINSTON waddles up the stairs with GALE and CHUCKY on his heels.

                         GALE
               Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let
               him know --

                         WINSTON
               Half the time he don't answer even
               if he's home.  Know why?  'Cause
               he don't want no bill collectors
               to find him.  I don't mean to be
               judgmental, but he's a scumbag.
               He don't have no friends.  Who's
               gonna like a creep like LaPlante?
               I was doin' him a favor on the TV
               outta kindness, and he screwed me.
               You know what color skin you get
               on my set, Miss Gayley?  Purple!
               That's what color skin you got on
               the tee vee LaPlante sells me!

     During the climb, GALE'S BEEPER goes off.  She shuts it off.


     INT.  UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR/APT. BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

     BANG!  BANG!  BANG!  WINSTON pounds on the door to 5A while GALE
     and CHUCKY hover behind him anxiously.

                         WINSTON
               Bernard!  Bernard!  Hey, LaPlante,
               open the door.  Television
               Interview!  Fame and fortune.  Open
               up, Bernard.

     WINSTON pulls a ring of keys from his belt and unlocks the door.

                         WINSTON
               Hope the silly bastard didn't kill
               himself.  He's all upset about this
               sentence he got.  He's going to
               prison.
                    (to Chucky)
               That a camera you're carrying?  If
               he killed himself, you could take
               pictures.


     INT.  BERNIE'S APARTMENT

     WINSTON, GALE and CHUCKY enter the tiny charmless living room.
     As WINSTON disappears into the bedroom; GALE glances around,
     notices something.

     A cheap commercial photo of BERNIE with JOEY at the zoo.

     Studying it, she considers BERNIE'S face.

     WINSTON re-enters from the bedroom.

                         WINSTON
               No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too
               often you guys get pictures of a
               body even before the cops get there.
               Exclusive!

                         GALE
               I wonder if you'd mind if we waited
               for him here, Mister Winston...

     Surprised, CHUCKY gives her a sharp look, like "what's up?"

                         WINSTON
               What's he gonna do, sue?  You
               people, you're the media.


     WINSTON exits, closing the door behind him.

                         CHUCKY
               We're gonna wait here?  The guy
               could be hours.

                         GALE
               Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling
               this guy is important somehow.

                         CHUCKY
               Hey, listen, great that you're a
               career-fiend, I got a wife and
               family, I...

                         GALE
               You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!

     GALE has flopped down on BERNIE'S ratty sofa.

                         CHUCKY
               What's the matter?

                         GALE
               This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The
               springs... are... the springs...
               what...?

     GALE is digging behind her on the sofa.  She pulls out The
     silver Mike Award and stares at it, dumbfounded.

                         CHUCKY
               What is it?

                         GALE
                    (stunned)
               The...Silver...Mike...Award!

                         CHUCKY
               This guy LaPlante won an award?

                         GALE
                    (staring at the
                     inscription)
               "For Excellence in the Pursuit of
               Truth."

                         CHUCKY
                    (amazed)
               LaPlante!

                         BERNIE
               Who the hell are you?  What's goin'
               on here?

     BERNIE is standing in the doorway, scowling at CHUCKY.  But
     before the astonished CHUCKY can respond, GALE turns, revealing
     her face.

                         BERNIE
               You!

                         GALE
               Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard
               LaPlante, sir?  What is your
               relationship with John Bubber?

                         BERNIE
                    (indicating chucky)
               Turn that thing off.

                         GALE
                    (holding up the Silver
                     Mike)
               How did you acquire this, Mister
               LaPlante?

                         BERNIE
               How do ya think I got it, for
               Chrissake?
                    (to Chucky, indicating
                     the vidpak)
               Hey, put that thing down.  This is
               my goddamn apartment, you can't
               just...

                         GALE
               What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante?
               What are you forcing John Bubber
               to do?  What are you -- ?

     The door bursts open and WINSTON rushes in hysterically.

                         WINSTON
               HE'S GONNA JUMP!  BUBBER'S GONNA
               JUMP!  IT'S ON CHANNEL THIRTEEN!

                         CHUCKY
               Thirteen!

     TV IMAGE  (EXT. DRAKE HOTEL - P.O.V. OF LEDGE - NIGHT)

     Weirdly distorted colors.  A shaky long lens shot (news camera)
     reveals a bright green BUBBER standing on a ledge fifteen
     stories up while a REPORTER narrates urgently...

                         CHANNEL 13 REPORTER (V.O.)
               -- say that they cannot rig a net
               below him because they are afraid
               it will trigger his decision to
               jump.  Bubber has said repeatedly
               he will only talk with Gale Gayley
               a local television reporter.

                         GALE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Oh my God!

     REVEAL:  INT.  WINSTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     Where GALE, flanked by BERNIE, CHUCKY, and WINSTON, is staring
     in horror at the lurid color image on the TV BERNIE sold to
     WINSTON.

                    (continuing)
               So far, attempts to reach Ms. Gayley
               have not succeeded.


     INT.  WINSTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON GALE

                         GALE
                    (to Winston)
               Your phone!  Quick.

     As WINSTON shows her the phone, BERNIE scowls at the TV.

                         BERNIE
               He's green for Chrissake!

     As GALE punches digits on the phone, WINSTON turns back to
     BERNIE.

                         WINSTON
               No shit!  You took advantage of me,
               LaPlante.  It's a piece of shit.

                         BERNIE
               You gotta tune it, ya bozo.  You
               gotta adjust it.

     BERNIE is adjusting the television color.

                         CHANNEL 13 REPORTER/TV
               Meanwhile, as you can see, a crowd
               has gathered here at the hotel, many
               of them in tears, pleading aloud
               with John Bubber not to jump.


     INT.  WINSTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON GALE

     speaking urgently and privately into the phone.

                         GALE
               For God's sake, tell him I'm on my
               way.
                    (she slams down the
                     phone)
               Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort
               is gonna pick us up en route.  You
               too, LaPlante.

                         BERNIE
               Me!

                         GALE
               If you're not in the car in ten
               seconds, I'll have the cops pick
               you up.

                         BERNIE
               The cops!  What kinda bullshit is
               this?  Is this America or -- ?

                         GALE
                    (urgent, inspiration)
               Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty
               bucks.  How much have you got,
               Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your
               money.

     GALE shoves cash into BERNIE'S hands as CHUCKY obediently
     reaches for his wallet.

                         GALE
               Come on!  Let's go!  John's in
               danger.

     Confused, BERNIE looks at the cash, then follows them out the
     door.

                         BERNIE
                    (pocketing the cash)
               Christ, you media people think you
               can just buy people.  Cheap.


     EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

     SIRENS SCREAM.  An escort of POLICE MOTORCYCLES precedes the
     speeding Channel Four van through the dark streets.


     INT.  SPEEDING CHANNEL 4 VAN - NIGHT

     CHUCKY is at the wheel of the van, GALE beside him.  BERNIE sits
     back in the confusion of equipment and monitors that show the
     news coverage of Bubber on the ledge.  BERNIE is addressing GALE
     indignantly, trying to be heard over the SCREAMING of the
     SIRENS.

                         BERNIE
               My fault!  My fault!  This nut case
               goes out on a ledge and it's my
               fault?

                         GALE
               If anything happens to John BUbber,
               Mister LaPlante I'm going to see
               you prosecuted to the full extent
               of the law.

                         BERNIE
               What, is everybody in love with
               this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What
               about...?

                         GALE
               Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John
               Bubber.  The whole country, in fact.
               And they're not going to be happy
               if he jumps to his death because
               he was harassed by a lousy little
               money-grubbing low-life fence...

                         BERNIE
               "Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him
               when he's riding in his limo?  The
               guy's a thief, he took my...

                         GALE
                    (erupting)
               He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic
               moment of weakness.  That's not the
               same thing as a lifetime of petty
               crime...

                         BERNIE
                    (stung)
               Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm
               not perfect but I don't get this
               at all, your attitude.  I saved
               your...

                         GALE
                    (interrupting)
               A lifetime of petty crime climaxed
               by your sleaziest accomplishment
               yet...  blackmailing a national
               hero...

                         BERNIE
               -- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What?
               Blackmailing...?

                         GALE
               You think I haven't figured it out?
               Just because the cops aren't on to
               you yet doesn't mean you're home
               free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've
               seen your kind before, the
               underbelly of crime.

                         BERNIE
               Underbelly!

                         GALE
               In all that smoke and fire, John
               had a moment of weakness.  He'd been
               down and out, destitute, living in
               his car.  It was just an impulse,
               stealing my purse.

     BERNIE looks thunderstruck.  CHUCKY too.

                         CHUCKY
               Swiped your purse!  While he was
               saving you?  You gotta be kidding!

                         GALE
                    (a triumphant 190k at
                     Bernie)
               And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the
               fence, who's now trying to blackmail
               poor John.

     BERNIE is too stunned to speak.

                         CHUCKY
               He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all
               those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?

                         GALE
                    (emotional)
               Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky.
               He was acting out of a deep
               instinctive decency, not out of some
               ego thing.  He didn't expect the
               media to lionize him.  He didn't
               expect a million dollar reward.
               He saved fifty-four people because
               something inside him, some
               fundamental love for his fellow man,
               made him rush into that plane when
               "good sense" told him otherwise.
               He was willing to settle for some
               credit cards he sold to LaPlante....
                    (to Bernie)
               For how much, LaPlante?  A couple
               of bucks?  Did you give him enough
               for a decent meal?

     BERNIE, who's been listening to the description of his own deeds
     with slack-jawed amazement, is too taken aback to answer.

     The van zips past dark city streets populated by DERELICTS and
     HOMELESS PEOPLE as GALE continues her emotional outpouring.

                         GALE
               All this is off the record, Chucky,
               because if John Bubber lives, Mister
               LaPlante is going to give him his
               assurance that there will be no more
               "misbehavior" on his part.  What's
               more he's going to apologize.

                         BERNIE
               I'm going to apologize to Bubber?

                         GALE
               I could deny I had those credit
               cards on the plane with me,
               LaPlante...

                         BERNIE
                    (amazed)
               Lie, you mean...

                         GALE
               Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but
               I could tell the story the way I
               did just now, so that people could
               understand that John is even more
               of a hero, and that you...
               you're the lowest thing that ever
               crawled.  Your name will be
               synonymous with cynical opportunism
               and blackmail.  You won't get a
               cent.

                         BERNIE
                    (alarmed)
               I got a kid, you know.  I'm a
               person, for Chrissake.

                         GALE
               Well, for your child's sake, show
               some decency then, rise above your
               sleazy instincts.
                    (a sob)
               You may have already killed him!


     EXT.  DRAKE HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

     POLICE buck the tide of the excited CROWD, making a wedge to
     get GALE, CHUCKY, and BERNIE to the hotel entrance.  A COP grabs
     BERNIE, thinking him a spectator.

                         GALE
               No!  He's with us, Officer.

     REPORTERS, on the fringe of the crowd, address their cameras.

                         CHANNEL 8/CHANNEL 13/CONKLIN
               Police are escorting Reporter Gale
               Gayley to the fifteenth floor where
               she will be able to talk to Bubber.


     EXT.  DRAKE HOTEL - CROWD'S POV OF BUBBER ON LEDGE - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     A tiny figure on a narrow ledge fifteen floors up.


     INT.  SUITE/DRAKE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

     GALE rushes into the suite now jammed with POLICE, FIREMEN, and
     DIGNITARIES and heads straight for the open window, dragging
     BERNIE with her.  CHUCKY follows, Vidcam raised.

     At the window she encounters the POLICE CHIEF and a PRIEST.

                         POLICE CHIEF
               He'll only talk to you, Ms Gayley.
               Just lean out and we'll hold you
               from behind.


     EXT.  LEDGE/FIFTEENTH STORY/DRAKE HOTEL - NIGHT

     Alone on the ledge twenty feet from the open window, BUBBER is
     looking down at the CROWD below.  They're chanting...


     EXT.  LEDGE - BUBBER'S P.O.V. OF CROWD - NIGHT

                         CROWD
               NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!  NO!


     EXT.  LEDGE - DRAKE HOTEL - NIGHT

                         GALE
               John!  Don't do it!  Everything's
               okay.

     BUBBER has tears in his eyes.  He turns at the sound of GALE'S
     voice and sees her leaning out the window, calling to him.

     Pulling an envelope from his pocket, BUBBER moves a couple of
     steps toward GALE and bends down to place the envelope on the
     ledge.

                         BUBBER
               Gale!  This is for you.  I want you
               to know I never meant to hurt you.
               This will explain everything.

                         GALE
               John, I know all about it.

                         BUBBER
                    (horrified)
               You do?

     Straightening up, he... LOSES HIS BALANCE!

                         CROWD
               NNNOOOOOOOOOOOO!

                         GALE
               It's all right, John!  It's nothing!
               A little mistake.  Everybody will
               understand!

                         BUBBER
               "A little mistake"!

                         GALE
               No, John, you're too hard on
               yourself.  I've got the creep here,
               the guy who's...

     GALE breaks off as BERNIE suddenly shoulders his way to the
     window...

                         BERNIE
               Hold on!  Hold on!  Lemme talk to
               him for Chrissake!


     INT.  SUITE/DRAKE

     BERNIE pushes past the astonished GALE and scrambles awkwardly
     out onto' the ledge, kicking back at the FIREMEN who grab at his
     ankles until...

     ANGLE ON FIREMEN

     exchanging a look, the FIREMEN realize their efforts are more
     likely to knock BERNIE off than save him.


     EXT.  LEDGE/HOTEL

     BUBBER stares in amazement as BERNIE emerges onto the ledge on
     all fours, yelling toward him.

                         BERNIE
               Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk
               to you, buddy.

                         BUBBER
               LaPlante!

                         BERNIE
               Come on, John, don't be an asshole.
               I don't like heights.

     Hastily, BUBBER backs further from the window (and the envelope
     lying on the ledge).

                         BUBBER
               Listen, LaPlante, I'm really sorry.
               It's all in my letter to Ga... uh,
               Miss Gayley.  I was all wrong.


     INT.  SUITE/DRAKE - NIGHT

     CHUCKY is wedged beside GALE in the window, pointing his vidpak
     at BERNIE'S ass.  Suddenly BERNIE sees BUBBER looking past him
     at the cameras and, turning awkwardly, he snaps at GALE...

                         BERNIE
               Turn that thing off!  You want him
               to jump?

     GALE and the OTHERS step back from the window hastily.


     EXT.  LEDGE/DRAKE - NIGHT

     BERNIE turns back to BUBBER.

                         BERNIE
               I just wanna talk with you for a
               minute.  Then you can jump.  You
               can jump twice for all I care.

                         BUBBER
               Talk from there.  You can talk from
               there.

                         BERNIE
               In private.  They got cameras and
               alla that crap in there.
               Microphones.


     INT.  HOTEL SUITE/DRAKE - NIGHT

     Rather than leaning out the window, GALE and OTHERS in the suite
     are following the drama on the TV monitor.

     GALE'S P.O.V.: TV IMAGE (EXT. LEDGE - FROM BELOW - NIGHT)

     CONKLIN narrates while the SHAKY CAMERA FOCUSES on BERNIE and
     BUBBER who are continuing to argue on the ledge, BERNIE
     motioning for BUBBER to come closer, BUBBER resisting.

                         CONKLIN/TV (V.O.)
               It looks like someone is out on the
               ledge with John Bubber.  We can only
               presume this is a rescue specialist
               of some kind from the police or fire
               department.
                    (excited)
               He... he's moving toward Bubber,
               crawling.  He does not appear to
               have a safety rope tied to him and,
               as we've explained, the fire
               department has been unable to rig
               a net.


     INT.  SUITE/DRAKE - NIGHT

     BACK TO GALE

     Ironically, she's "seeing the events" happening fifteen feet
     from her on a monitor showing...

     ON THE TV SCREEN (EXT. HOTEL - P.O.V. OF LEDGE - NIGHT)

     a camera angle fifteen stories below, a SHAKY ZOOM attempting
     to isolate BERNIE on the ledge.


     INT.  SUITE/DRAKE - NIGHT

     Her face shows surprise at BERNIE'S courage.  Did she misjudge?

     EXT.  LEDGE/HOTEL

     Inching forward, BERNIE is just reaching the letter BUBBER left
     on the ledge.

                         BUBBER
                    (indicating the letter)
               That's for Ga... Ms. Gayley.

                         BERNIE
               What am I, a goddamn postman?  I'm
               way the fuck up here, I'm scared
               a heights, and you want me to
               deliver a letter?  Put a stamp on
               it for Chrissake!

                         BUBBER
               That's close enough.  It's a
               confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm
               sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe,
               you said you didn't want, publicity
               because of your legal problems.

                         BERNIE
               I don't recall saying I didn't want
               a million bucks...

                         BUBBER
               I never really thought they'd go
               for it.  And then... you didn't come
               forward, they investigated my war
               record...  I kept expecting you to
               show up and expose me...

                         BERNIE
               I was in the can, for Chrissake.

                         BUBBER
               The bathroom!  For two days?

                         BERNIE
               Jail!  Listen, Bubber...
                    (looks down, fifteen
                     stories)
               This is crazy.  We could fall off
               of here.

                         BUBBER
               You should go in.  You're risking
               your life again...

                         BERNIE
                    (sweating, trembling)
               I'm beginning to... be aware of
               that, John.  Listen, I'm not gonna
               do nothing heroic here, you can
               trust me on that, buddy.  Whaddaya
               say we just sit down for a while.
               I don't have no tricks, I'm not that
               smart.  You could, like, rest up for
               the jump.

     BUBBER considers the situation, relaxes, lowers himself till
     he's sitting beside BERNIE.  Then he helps BERNIE off his knees
     into a sitting position so they're sitting side by side on the
     ledge.  BUBBER shakes his head sadly.

                         BUBBER
               What have I done?  I was dirt poor
               and useless... but I was honest.

                         BERNIE
               Lighten up, John.  You think <u>you</u>
               got problems for Chrissake?

     BERNIE wipes the sweat from his forehead, <u>unaware</u> <u>that</u> <u>he's</u>
     <u>smearing</u> <u>his</u> <u>face</u> <u>with</u> <u>black</u> <u>soot</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>ledge</u>.


     EXT.  DRAKE HOTEL

     In front of the hotel in the midst of the confusion of emergency
     vehicles, POLICE, and ONLOOKERS, a cherry-picker has arrived
     and a TV CAMERAMAN from Channel 4 is riding in the rising
     pulpit.

     TELEVISION IMAGE (EXT. DRAKE HOTEL P.O.V. - NIGHT)

     A shaky long lens shot from fifteen stories below shows BERNIE
     sitting beside BUBBER on the ledge while the REPORTER narrates
     urgently...

               -- still don't know why John BUbber,
               hero to the nation, stepped out onto
               the ledge fifteen stories above
               the street more than an hour ago.


     INT.  JOEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     JOEY, wearing pajamas and headphones, is staring breathlessly
     at the TV from the bed in his darkened bedroom.

     ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN (EXT. DRAKE FRONT STEPS - NIGHT)

                         CONKLIN/TV (V.O.)
                    (continuing)
               But we now have the identity of the
               man who has been talking to him for
               the last fifteen minutes at great
               personal risk.  He has been
               identified as Bernard LaPlante,
               former employee of Gumley's Carpet
               Care.


     INT.  JOEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON JOEY

     JOEY'S jaw sags and he sits up in bed as the REPORTER continues
     on the TV.

     ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN (EXT. LEDGE FROM BELOW - NIGHT)

     the lens ZOOMS TIGHTER, and therefore SHAKIER, offering a jerky
     image in which BUBBER and BERNIE are semi-identifiable as they
     sit on the ledge.

                         CONKLIN/TV (V.O.)
               There is speculation that LaPlante
               is an old friend of Bubber's,
               perhaps a war buddy.


     INT.  JOEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     JOEY has already sprinted out of the room, leaving the TV
     playing to his empty bedroom.

                         JOEY'S VOICE (O.S.)
               MOM!  MOM!  IT'S MY FATHER!  MOM!


     INT.  DRAKE/PRESIDENTIAL SUITE

     GALE is giving way at the window to CHUCKY who's leaning out
     to try and get a shot.  Jammed in by the CROWD, her view
     blocked, she glimpses a TV monitor nearby.

     GALE'S POV - TV MONITOR/VIDEO IMAGE (EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT)

     The SHAKY CLOSE-UP of BERNIE'S face, <u>smeared</u> <u>with</u> <u>soot</u>, fills
     the screen.  The angle is <u>very</u> <u>reminiscent</u> of the glimpse GALE
     got of BERNIE in the crashed plane!


     EXT.  DRAKE HOTEL - NIGHT

     An arc light is switched on, lighting up BERNIE'S face.


     INT.  DRAKE SUITE - NIGHT

     BACK TO GALE,

     stunned.  Just then CHUCKY taps her on his way out of the room.

                         CHUCKY
               I'm gonna grab the high ground, get
               a hot overhead angle.


     EXT.  LEDGE/FIFTEENTH FLOOR/DRAKE HOTEL - NIGHT

     Spotlights illuminate BERNIE and BUBBER as they sit on the ledge
     and converse, like a couple of guys on a park bench somewhere,
     oblivious to the CROWD below.

                         BUBBER
                    (flabbergasted)
               You stole her purse!  While you were
               saving her?

                         BERNIE
               What's the big deal?  You decided
               to pretend you were me.  A little
               moment of weakness, right?  So I
               sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet
               of clay too, bUddy.

                         BUBBER
               And she thinks you're blackmailing
               me?

                         BERNIE
               Right.

     BUBBER actually sees humor in this, but BERNIE is thinking...

                         BERNIE
               Which don't sound like such a bad
               goddamn idea, John.

                         BUBBER
               Huh?  Whadda you mean?

                         BERNIE
               Well, we gotta work this thing out,
               John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm
               halfway to doing serious time in
               the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck
               on you she don't want it to come
               out you stole her purse because it
               might break the heart of millions.
                    (indicating the chanting
                     crowd below)
               Looka those maniacs, willya?  They
               love you, for Chrissake!

                         BUBBER
               I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante,
               but I can't face people... the looks
               in their eyes... after the trust
               they gave me!

                         BERNIE
               Great!  You make this big goddamn
               mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful!
               Listen, John, I was there at the
               hospital today, I seen you with
               those little bastards (pardon my
               vulgarity).

                         BUBBER
               It was you!  I thought I heard...

                         BERNIE
               I'm not saying I hate sick people
               or anything but I hate being <u>around</u>
               them if you know what I mean.  There
               <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to
               <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited
               on him.

                         BUBBER
                    (stunned)
               Allen?  He... he's okay?

     BUBBBR is visibly affected by the news about ALLEN but BERNIE
     doesn't notice, rattles on...

                         BERNIE
               See what I mean?  You remember his
               <u>name</u> for Chrissake!  I mean, I
               remember my <u>own</u> kid's name... but
               I'm always forgetting his birthday.
               Plus when they stick cameras in your
               face and ask all these stupid
               questions, you <u>smile</u> at them.  You
               got a kinda...  a kinda... "gift,"
               there, John, if ya know what I mean.
               People wanna be saved by you.  Even
               <u>me</u>!  If I was gonna be saved I
               wouldn't wanna see Bernie LaPlante
               comin' outta the goddamn smoke an'
               darkness an' fear an' stuff.  I'd
               wanna see <u>John</u> <u>God</u> <u>Damn</u> <u>Bubber!</u>

     BUBBER is moved... but still has doubts.

                         BUBBER
               You got those people out of the
               plane, LaPlante, not me.

                         BERNIE
               You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you
               wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust
               me on that, that's the kinda guy
               you are.  For a guy like me, it's
               a momentary loss of sanity.  I
               wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen,
               I'm no hero, John.  I just want some
               dough and maybe a little favor.
               How much didja spend already on all
               that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't
               spend it <u>all</u> didja?

                         BUBBER
               Well, I donated a lot to different
               causes, uh... La...

                         BERNIE
               Bernie.  Call me Bernie.

                         BUBBER
               --but there's a lot of it still
               left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.

     BERNIE'S eyes glitter with interest.


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE/TV STATION

     Several monitors show a variety of coverage of the drama on the
     ledge on their screens while, nearby, WALLACE hovers anxiously
     over DEAKINS' shoulder as DEAKINS rants into the phone...

                         DEAKINS
               Whaddaya mean what do I wanna know?
               I wanna know everything.  Who's this
               screwball LaPlante for Pete's sake,
               what the hell's he doing out there,
               auditioning for the priesthood?
               You're supposed to be on top of
               this, Gale, don't...
                    (he stops, listens,
                     explodes)
               "Quit!"  You can't quit!  It's
               unprofessional!

                         WALLACE
                    (alarmed)
               Quit?  She wants to quit?

                         DEAKINS
                    (ignoring Wallace)
               Listen, Gale, I know you're
               emotionally involved.  Don't be
               emotionally involved, be
               professional.
                    (listens, then...)
               No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten,
               cynical hard-ass, you just think
               you are.  You are a goddamn cream
               puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!

     DEAKINS hangs up the phone angrily and faces WALLACE...

                         WALLACE
               She wants to quit?

                         DEAKINS
               She can't quit.


     INT.  JOEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     EVELYN is staring dumbfounded at the TV screen, the volume full
     now, no longer coming through the headphones.

                         EVELYN
               My God!  It... it <u>is</u> him!

                         JOEY
               Wh-why's he... why's he up there,
               mom?

     EVELYN looks pale and stricken.  Instead of answering, she makes
     a decision...

                         EVELYN
               Where's your coat?  Get your coat!


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE - NIGHT

     DEAKINS and WALLACE are watching a CHANNEL EIGHT REPORTER on
     one of the monitors.

     TV IMAGE (EXT.  DRAKE HOTEL - NIGHT)

                         CHANNEL 8 REPORTER/TV
               -- just learned that LaPlante is
               a convicted felon due to be
               sentenced tomorrow for trafficking
               in stolen goods.  According to our
               sources, LaPlante knowingly
               purchased twelve cases of stolen
               latex paint which he subsequently
               sold to...


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON DEAKINS AND WALLACE

                         DEAKINS
               Gale shoulda aired that bit first,
               she's the one who found this clown
               LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight
               get a beat on us.

                         WALLACE
                    (worried)
               Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u>
               got something to hide?  What if he's
               the wrong guy, not really the
               hero...?

                         DEAKINS
               Helluva story!

                         WALLACE
                    (suddenly firm)
               No, Deak, not a great story.  We
               backed this guy, he's our boy!  We
               gave him a vote of confidence, we
               gave him a million dollars.

     DEAKINS is chastened.  He "gets it."  Just then, excitement from
     the Channel Four monitor.

                         DEAKINS
               Now what?

                         CONKLIN'S VOICE/TV
                    (excited)
               Something's going on, Bubber is
               communicating something.  Both men
               are...


     EXT.  DRAKE HOTEL - NIGHT

     Excitement in the CROWD, looking up, yelling.  Something's
     happening.  CONKLIN is speaking into his mike even as the surge
     of the CROWD engulfs him...

                         CONKLIN
               -- still sitting on the ledge but
               Bubber is motioning to someone in
               the window, he seems to be calling
               out to them and now... now he's
               holding up two fingers.  He's
               signalling something, holding up
               two fingers.


     EXT.  HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     A Ford station wagon speeds toward the city.


     INT.  MOVING FORD/HIGHWAY - NIGHT

     EVELYN is at the wheel, JOEY beside her, the RADIO on...

                         EVELYN
               If I gave you the impression I hated
               him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate
               the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish
               and self-centered and cynical...

                         JOEY
               What's "cynical"?

                         EVELYN
               It's when you say, "Everybody else
               cheats why shouldn't I?"
                    (emotional)
               But I don't -- I don't <u>hate</u> -- him.
               I... loved him once, Joey.  Very
               much.  I just got... tired.  Maybe
               it wasn't all his fault.  He...
               What's happening?  Oh, my God...

     EVELYN is reacting to the live radio broadcast, a sudden urgency
     in the REPORTER'S VOICE, CROWD SOUNDS...

                         RADIO
               -- FIREMEN LEANING OUT THE WINDOW!
               THEY HAVE WHAT APPEAR TO BE LONG
               POLES AND THEY'RE REACHING THE POLES
               TOWARD THE TWO MEN ON THE LEDGE,
               JOHN BUBBER AND HIS COMPANION,
               BERNARD LAPLANTE!

                         EVELYN
               What's happening?  What are they
               doing...?

                         RADIO
                    (continuing)
               LAPLANTE AND BUBBER ARE REACHING
               FOR THE POLES!  THERE'S SOMETHING
               AT THE TIP OF THE POLES.  THEY'RE
               TAKING SOMETHING FROM THE POLES!
               IT LOOKS LIKE -- IT LOOKS LIKE...
               I THINK IT'S...  WAIT A MINUTE, I
               HAVE A REPORT HERE...

     EVELYN and JOEY are breathless, mesmerized, waiting to hear...

                         RADIO
               COFFEE!  IT'S COFFEE!  WE'RE TOLD
               THAT BUBBER AND LAPLANTE ASKED FOR
               TWO CUPS OF COFFEE.

                         EVELYN
                    (relief)
               Coffee!  Just like your father to
               request something totally
               inappropriate.  Thousands of people
               watching and he wants a cup of
               coffee.
                    (remembering)
               I remember when you were in the
               hospital, when you had the
               appendicitis, your father stayed
               all night by your bed... and he
               hates hospitals, always thinks he's
               going to catch something... and then
               that time when your Uncle Howard
               got hurt... It seems like your
               father is at his best in a crisis...
               when things go really wrong or
               there's some kind of emergency, your
               father forgets to be Bernie LaPlante
               and acts sort of like... a human
               being.

     There are tears in her eyes as she drives.  The RADIO continues.

                         RADIO
               We've learned that the devices the
               firemen used to "deliver" the
               coffee... I described them as
               "poles"... are, in fact, oversized
               tongs used by the hotel staff to
               change difficult-to-reach
               lightbulbs...


     EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT

     BERNIE and BUBBER are distant figures sitting on a ledge as if
     it was a park bench, sipping coffee and visibly negotiating as
     in a pantomime.


     EXT.  LEDGE/HOTEL

     Closer now, we can hear BERNIE and BUBBER wrapping up the deal.

                         BERNIE
               You got it?  Four year scholarship
               to a top college, plus Medical
               School or Law School or whatever
               Joey wants; pay off the $2,500 to
               my attorney, plus pay her fee in
               full, plus my annual consulting
               fee...

                         BUBBER
               And give a deposition to the jUdge.

                         BERNIE
                    (sudden thought)
               Listen, John, you better double my
               attorney's fee.  She's very
               inexperienced, but she done a great
               job for me. And give her your
               autograph.  She thinks you're some
               kinda holy man.

                         BUBBER
               On the deposition for the jUdge,
               Bernie... I mean there's no way
               I can promise anything.  I can't
               tell him what we're up to...

                         BERNIE
               You'll tell him I talked you out
               of jumping, right?  Just keep me
               outta prison.

                         BUBBER
               I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.

                         BERNIE
               That's good enough for me.  You
               better take that "letter" there and
               get rid of it.

     BERNIE indicates the envelope on the ledge and BUBBER slides
     the envelope into his pocket surreptitiously.

     BERNIE and BUBBER are shaking hands.  Then they start to get
     cautiously to their feet.


     INT.  DRAKE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     GALE is watching the action on a TV monitor, trying to figure
     out what's going on.

     GALE'S P.O.V./TV MONITOR  (EXT. LEDGE - NIGHT)

     BERNIE and BUBBER are shaking hands.  Then they start to get
     cautiously to their feet.


     EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT

     The CROWD reacts to the action on the ledge while TV REPORTERS
     including CONKLIN chatter into their mikes...

                         REPORTERS
               They're getting to their feet.
               They're standing up!


     EXT.  LEDGE - NIGHT

     BERNIE is on his feet, unsteady, terrified of the drop.

     BUBBER, much more graceful, not as wobbly, is speaking to him.

                         BUBBER
               After what I did, how do you know
               I'll come through?  How do you know
               you can trust me?

     Shakily, BERNIE indicates the CROWD far below...

                         BERNIE
               Cause, bottom line, John, I ain't
               no different than all those dumb
               assholes down there.  We all trust
               you for Chrissake!  We...

     ANGLE ON THE DROP/BERNIE'S P.O.V.

     Straight down, fifteen floors.  A CROWD of "ants."  Firetrucks,
     Police cars, TV vans.


     EXT.  LEDGE - NIGHT

     Suddenly BERNIE starts shaking like a leaf, trying to smear his
     body against the side of the building as he inches along the
     narrow ledge toward the window with BUBBER right behind him.

                         BERNIE
               Th-this was really dumb, coming out
               here.


     EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT

     As the CROWD looks up breathlessly, WE DISCOVER EVELYN pulling
     JOEY through the CROWD toward the hotel steps, their eyes on
     BERNIE and BUBBER.


     EXT.  ROOF - NIGHT

     CHUCKY is cautiously moving under the neon sign on the roof,
     first on all fours, then on his belly, moving toward the edge.


     EXT.  LEDGE - NIGHT

     BUBBER is steering BERNIE toward the window.

                         BUBBER
               Slow and easy, Bernie.

     BERNIE takes a cautious step.  BUBBER tries to distract BERNIE
     from the drop by talking to him.

                         BUBBER
               What made you do it, Bernie?  Go
               in the plane?

     Another cautious step.

                         BERNIE
               I dunno.  It was... an impulse.
               Me, wearing my good shoes.

                         BUBBER
               Same with me, pretending I was you.
               An impulse.  Why not?  I had this
               shoe.

                         BERNIE
               There was this kid there saying,
               "Go in there and save my father,
               mister." And I'm thinking about my
               boy Joey and this goddamn fireman
               my wife's seeing. It was like I was
               supposed to save myself.

                         BUBBER
               Yeah, and with me it was like I was
               supposed to pretend the shoe was
               mine.

                         BERNIE
               So now you gotta wear it, you poor
               bastard.  Everyday you gotta be
               everybody's hero.  People watching
               you all the time.  Waiting for you
               to make...  a slip.  Slip up.

     BERNIE glances down to indicate the CROWD and... takes a
     misstep.


     EXT.  DRAKE FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

     A single audible gasp from the CROWD below as BERNIE, fifteen
     stories up, staggers.


     EXT.  LEDGE - NIGHT

     BERNIE struggles to regain his balance.

     BUBBER reaches out to help him.

                         BUBBER
               Easy does it, partner.  It's gonna
               be fine.

     BUBBER'S hand remains on BERNIE'S shoulder.

     ANGLE ON GALE

     Watching from the window, holding her breath.  <u>Is it possible</u>
     <u>he's going to push BERNIE?  What an opportunity!</u>

     GALE'S P.O.V.:

     BUBBER'S hand on BERNIE'S shoulder.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     Sweating, pushing his foot cautiously forward.

                         BUBBER'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Don't look down.  Keep your eyes...

     BERNIE looks down!

     BERNIE'S P.O.V. (EXT. P.O.V. OF CROWD - NIGHT)

     AHHHHHHHHHH!  He sees the tiny PEOPLE below and he <u>STARTS TO</u>
     <u>FALL</u>.


     EXT.  LEDGE - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     Wobbling unsteadily, arms flailing, falling.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     His eyes!  He's looking down.

     BUBBER'S P.O.V.:

     He sees BERNIE clutching the ledge with one hand, looking up
     at him with pleading eyes as he dangles fifteen stories above
     the ground.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE'S HAND

     It's slipping!  He can't hold!

     ANGLE ON BUBBER'S EYES!

     staring at BERNIE'S hand.  It must occur to him that life would
     be better without BERNIE.

     ANGLE ON GALE

     watching from the window, terrified.


     EXT.  DRAKE HOTEL - NIGHT

     EVELYN and JOEY are looking up, love and fear in their eyes.

                         EVELYN
               Oh my God!  Bernie!

                         JOEY
               Dad!


     EXT.  LEDGE - NIGHT

     A FIREMAN is leaning out the window, reaching for BUBBER.

                         FIREMAN
               Get in here, buddy.  You can't help
               him.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE'S HAND

     Slipping.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     BUBBER is looking into BERNIE'S eyes as BERNIE'S hand slips.

     ANGLE ON THE FIREMAN

     Leaning out the window, holding a rescue noose toward BUBBER.

                         FIREMAN
               Don't reach out.  He'll pull you
               over!

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     BUBBER ignores the FIREMAN, his hand reaching out toward
     BERNIE.

     CLOSE UP: HAND

     reaching out to grab BERNIE.


     INT.  DEAKINS OFFICE - NIGHT

     WALLACE screams at the TV set.

                         WALLACE
               NO!  NEVER REACH OUT!


     EXT.  LEDGE - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON GALE

     reacting, head out the window...

     ANGLE ON FIREMAN

     Reaching a NOOSE-DEVICE toward BUBBER.

                         FIREMAN
               Grab this!  Now!  Save yourself,
               you can't help him, he'll pull you
               over!


     EXT.  HOTEL - NIGHT

     The CROWD reacts.


     EXT.  LEDGE - NIGHT

     BUBBER is sitting, bracing himself.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     His hand slipping, his eyes full of fear.

     ANGLE ON GALE

     reacting.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE'S HAND

     losing his grip... when BUBBER'S HAND suddenly grabs his wrist.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     Looking up into BUBBER'S eyes.  Their eyes lock.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     Holding BERNIE with great effort.

     ANGLE ON THE FIREMAN

     rescue noose in hand, crawling out the window.

                         FIREMAN
               I'm gonna put this line around you.

                         BUBBER
                    (straining, indicates
                     BERNIE)
               Put...the...line...on...him.

     BUBBER leans back against the building, struggling to keep
     BERNIE from plummeting fifteen stories.

                         FIREMAN
               You can't hold him, he's gonna pull
               you off.

                         BUBBER
               If he doesn't make it... I...
               don't...  make it.  Got it?

                         FIREMAN
                    (impressed)
               Yessir!  I got it!  Loud and clear!


     EXT.  ROOF/DRAKE - NIGHT

     CHUCKY has bellied out on the roof under the big neon sign and
     he's pointing his camera straight down at the drama below while
     he mutters under his breath...

                         CHUCKY
                    (his narrator voice)
               Zooming in tighter yet, he captures
               the stark drama at great personal
               risk.
                    (humbly responding to
                     an imaginary
                     interviewer)
               "Was I afraid?  Well, you don't
               think about yourself at moments like
               that.  You think about the f-stop,
               you think about focus, you think
               about the 11 o'clock news, everybody
               counting on you."

     INT.  WINSTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     The television set shows the drama in garish otherworldly colors
     as WINSTON mutters...

               LaPlante, you crazy bastard!


     INT.  DONNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

     A stunned DONNA is in bed with her BOYFRIEND, stares at the TV.

     EXT.  LEDGE/HOTEL - NIGHT

     TWO FIREMEN have almost secured a rope around BERNIE while
     BUBBER continues to hang on to BERNIE, speaking to him through
     gritted teeth.

                         BUBBER
               Looking... good, partner.  Hang in
               there.

                         BERNIE
                    (eye contact)
               Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.


     INT.  LIVING ROOM/DRAKE SUITE - LATER (NIGHT)

     The suite is jammed with MEDIA PERSONNEL, many standing on
     sofas, tables, and chairs, all of them (and their cameras)
     focussed on JOHN BUBBER who's standing behind a bank of mikes
     making a "statement" that sounds sincere (perhaps because it
     is halting, awkward, painful...)

                         BUBBER
               It was a moment of terrible
               weakness.  I was feeling... I guess
               you'd call it "overwhelmed" by all
               the pressures and... the
               expectations of... fame...
               celebrity.  I just didn't feel...
               adequate... to everybody's image
               of me... so... I took my despair
               out on that ledge with the intention
               of...  jumping...

     ANGLES ON REPORTERS, CAMERAMEN

     a collective reaction, breathless silence.

     ANGLE ON GALE

     jammed among REPORTERS near the bedroom door, her eyes on
     BUBBER, frowning...

                         BUBBER
                    (continuing)
               In doing that I endangered the lives
               of hardworking policemen and firemen
               who attempted to rescue me, not to
               mention the life of my dear friend,
               Bernard LaPlante...

     BUBBER pauses and the room erupts in a chorus of REPORTERS'
     VOICES...

                         REPORTERS
               Who is Bernard LaPlante?  Did you
               know that LaPlante is a convicted
               criminal?  What is your relationship
               with Bernard LaPlante...?

     ANGLE ON GALE

     glancing at the bedroom door guarded by a UNIFORMED COP.

     ANGLE ON BUBBER

     taking a deep breath, answering...

                         BUBBER
               Bernard LaPlante is a close friend
               who came to me in a time of need...
               at considerable risk to himself.


     INT.  BEDROOM/DRAKE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

     BUBBER is continuing on the TV set in the bedroom while BERNIE,
     all alone in the huge bedroom, stares at the TV.

     ON THE TV (INT. SUITE/HOTEL - NIGHT)

                         BUBBER/TV
                    (continuing)
               I guess Bernie's made some
               mistakes.  I know I've made plenty
               myself.  In fact I don't know
               anyone who hasn't.  I think Bernie
               wants to be a private person and I
               I'm going to respect that.


     INT.  BEDROOM/DRAKE SUITE - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     glances idly at the TV remote control... and pockets it almost
     automatically, still watching TV.

     ON THE TV (INT. SUITE/HOTEL - NIGHT)

     REPORTERS erupt again in a CACOPHONY of QUESTIONS.

                         REPORTERS/TV
               What'd he say to you?  What'd you
               talk about?

                         BUBBER/TV
               Well, what he said to me was
               private.  But he gave me
               confidence in myself.  He told me
               I had a special opportunity, the
               chance to do some good in the
               world.


     INT.  BEDROOM/DRAKE SUITE - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON BERNIE

     He raises his eyebrows.  I said that?  On impulse, he pulls
     the remote from his pocket to return it.  He's setting it down
     when he turns suddenly to find he's not alone.

                         BERNIE
               Hey!  How'd you get in?  Nobody's
               supposed to come in here!

     GALE has just entered the room.  Did she see his action?

                         GALE
               I snuck in.

                         BERNIE
               You media people, you think you can
               just go anywhere you want, spy on
               people.

                         GALE
               Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh,
               Bernie... Who... are... you?

                         BERNIE
               Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're
               the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm
               what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The
               sleazebag something or other, the
               blackmailer, the...

                         GALE
                    (very intense)
               Was it you?  In the plane?  Who
               saved my life?

                         BERNIE
                    (rattled)
               Me?  Listen, I don't give no
               interviews.  That was John Bubber.
               You wanna ask me questions, you
               could talk to my attorney, Miss
               O'Day.

                         GALE
                    (imploring)
               Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I...
               just for a few moments... I want
               to be a human being, not a reporter.
               I'm somebody who was going to die
               in a burning plane and I looked up,
               and some man came out of the smoke,
               his face smeared with mud, and soot
               and... and he... saved my... life.
               Off the record.  Was it you?  Why
               would you deny it if it was?
               Because you took my purse?  Why?

     BERNIE looks at GALE.  She looks very human, very real, the
     reporter's veneer completely gone!  He hesitates.  How can he
     not tell the truth at a moment like this?  He takes a deep
     breath...

                         BERNIE
               Lady, do I look dumb enough to run
               into a burning plane and save a
               bunch of strangers?  I ain't the
               type.

     GALE stares at him.  BERNIE tries to hold her look, daring her
     to doubt him.  But he can't.  His eyes "run."  He's not a good
     liar this time.  But just then CONKLIN'S VOICE on the TV saying
     Evelyn's name distracts BERNIE.

     ANGLE ON TV SCREEN (INT. LOBBY/HOTEL - NIGHT)

     CONKLIN is hovering over EVELYN and JOEY who are standing in
     a pool of TV lights while a CROWD presses close around them...

                         CONKLIN/TV
               -- standing here in the lobby of
               the hotel with Evelyn LaPlante who
               says she is the wife of the
               mysterious Bernie LaPlante who was
               rescued from a fifteenth story
               ledge twenty minutes ago by John
               Bubber.


     INT.  BEDROOM/DRAKE SUITE - NIGHT

     ANGLE ON BERNIE AND GALE

                         BERNIE
               Oh shit!  Ev!  Joey!  For Chrissake!

     ANGLE ON TV SCREEN (INT. LOBBY/HOTEL - NIGHT)

                         CONKLIN/TV
                    (continuing)
               Mrs. LaPlante just told me that
               Bernard LaPLante spoke to her
               earlier today about "going away on
               a long trip" and wanting to say
               "goodbye" to his ten-year-old son,
               Joey.

                         EVELYN/TV
               I didn't know Bernie'd try and jump
               off a building.  I didn't
               understand.  I just thought he was
               up to his old... I mean, I didn't
               even know...

     BACK TO SCENE (INT. BEDROOM/HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT)

                         BERNIE
               TV!  Christ Almighty!  You cannot
               believe one word on TV!  Not one
               goddamn word!

     ANGLE ON TV SCREEN (INT. LOBBY/HOTEL - NIGHT)

                         CONKLIN/TV
               What kind of man is your ex-husband
               Mrs. LaPlante?

                         EVELYN/TV
                    (bursting into sobs)
               Bernie LaPlante is a wonderful
               decent human being.  Deep down.
               You just have to know him...

     ANGLE ON BERNIE (INT. BEDROOM/SUITE - NIGHT)

                         BERNIE
               It's all bullshit!  I swear to God!

     ANGLE ON TV SCREEN (INT. LOBBY/HOTEL - NIGHT)

                         CONKLIN/TV
               I guess you love your father too,
               Joey?

     ANGLE ON BERNIE (INT. BEDROOM/SUITE - NIGHT)

                         BERNIE
               LEAVE MY BOY ALONE, YOU ASSHOLE!

     ANGLE ON TV SCREEN (INT. LOBBY/HOTEL - NIGHT)

                         JOEY
               Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me
               to the zoo.

     ANGLE ON BERNIE (INT. BEDROOM/SUITE - NIGHT)

                         BERNIE
                    (big love)
               JOEY!

     ANGLE ON TV SCREEN (INT. LOBBY/HOTEL - NIGHT)

                         CONKLIN/TV
               How did you feel, Joey, seeing your
               father up there on that ledge?

                         JOEY/TV
               I was scared but... but... but...

                         CONKLIN/TV
               But what, son?

                         JOEY/TV
               But I knew John Bubber would save
               him!


     INT.  HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

     Chaos.  BUBBER is trying to get to the bedroom door, the news
     conference over, but he's being mobbed by MEDIA PERSONNEL who
     are SCREAMING questions, scrambling over furniture, blocking
     his path, jamming CAMERAS and MIKES in his face...

                         VOICES
               Were you afraid?  Look this way,
               John.  John, over here.  Mister
               Bubber, do you believe in God?

     BUBBER is struggling toward the bedroom door when he HEARS a
     VOICE cutting through the other VOICES.

                         GALE'S VOICE (O.S.)
               Mister Bubber!  Mister Bubber!
               JOHN!

     BUBBER turns, sees GALE through a "forest" of heads.  Their
     eyes meet, she shouts a question.

                         GALE
               John Bubber... how does a person
               know when he's a hero... and when
               he's not.

     Their eyes are locked, as if they're the only two in this very
     crowded room.  A private question in a public place.  The room
     becomes quiet as everyone realizes BUBBER is going to respond.
     BUBBER speaks soberly, directly to GALE.

                         BUBBER
               Well, like.  I said, Miss... uh,
               Gale, I think we're all heroes.
               If you catch us at the right
               moment.  We all have something
               noble and decent in us trying to
               get out... and we all have moments
               of weakness.

     GALE'S eyes are locked with his as he continues...


     INT.  DEAKINS' OFFICE - NIGHT

     DEAKINS and WALLACE are watching BUBBER continue on their
     monitor.

     ANGLE ON TV SCREEN (INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT)

     BUBBER continues to CAMERA, GALE off screen.

                         BUBBER
               It's the media that notices one
               moment and one person and not
               another.  I'm just another human
               being like the next person, full
               of frailty with some courage and
               decency mixed in.

     ANGLE ON DEAKINS  (INT. DEAKINS OFFICE - NIGHT)

                         DEAKINS
               What a crock of shit!  Have you
               ever heard more bullshit and
               drivel from somebody who wasn't
               President?

                         WALLACE
               It's not unthinkable.

                         DEAKINS
               What?

                         WALLACE
               The Presidency.  The public loves
               him.

                         DEAKINS
               For ten more minutes they love
               him, Wally.  I'm sick of him and
               I'm always about ten minutes ahead
               of the public.


     INT.  MONKEY CAGE/ZOO - DAY

     A "public" of MONKEYS clap hands, applauding a MONKEY who's
     making a "speech."


     EXT.  MONKEY CAGE/ZOO - DAY

     BERNIE and JOEY appear, passing in front of the monkey cage,
     deep in conversation...

                         BERNIE
               You remember where I said how I
               was gonna explain about life,
               buddy?  Well, the thing about life
               is...  it gets weird.  See people
               are always gonna be talking to you
               about "truth." Everybody always
               knows what the truth is, like it
               was toilet paper or something and
               they got a supply in the closet.
               But what you learn as you get older
               is, there ain't no truth.
               All there is is bullshit (pardon
               my vulgarity here).  Layers of it.
               One layer of bullshit on top of
               another.  So what you do in life,
               like when you get older, is you pick
               the layer of bullshit you prefer
               and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to
               speak.  You got that?

                         JOEY
                    (totally confounded)
               Uh, no.

                         BERNIE
               Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated.
               Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow,
               what I'm gonna tell you here is in
               strict confidence, okay?  It don't
               go no further.  What happened is,
               you remember that night I was gonna
               take you to the movies an' it was
               raining like a sonofabitch,
               (there's gonna be some
               vulgarities)..?

     BERNIE puts an affectionate arm around JOEY'S shoulder as we
     NOTICE that BERNIE is wearing brand new shiny shoes very much
     like his former good shoes, but different colors.  As he and
     JOEY walk off, BERNIE still talking, JOEY puts an arm around
     his father and an audience of MONKEYS fills the foreground.
     MONKEYS.

                         THE END
