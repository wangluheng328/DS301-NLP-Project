In the Old West, an amnesiac stranger awakes in the middle of the desert wounded in the belly with a bracelet in one of his wrists.
He is attacked by thieves but defeats them.
He rides a horse and heads to a former mining town, where the local preacher treats him.
Then he sees the youth Percy Dolarhyde, who is the son of the powerful farmer Woodrow Dolarhyde, bullying with the bar owner Doc and the other locals.
When Percy provokes the stranger, he reacts and beats up on Percy.
The local Sheriff John Taggart arrests Percy and he finds that the stranger is the wanted Jake Lonergan.
The sheriff returns to the bar with his deputies to arrest Jake, but he subdues the men.
However he is hit on his back by the mysterious Ella Swenson and he faints.
Jake is arrested and when Sheriff Taggart is ready to take Jake and Percy in a coach to deliver to a Federal Marshall, Woodrow arrives with his men ready to protect his son.
But they are attacked by spacecrafts that abducts several dwellers, including Percy, Doc's wife and the sheriff.
Woodrow organizes a posse to seek out the kidnapped people in a dangerous journey against an advanced race of aliens.
Meanwhile Jake Lonergan has glimpses of his past life and they learn that someone among them may help them in the fight.
