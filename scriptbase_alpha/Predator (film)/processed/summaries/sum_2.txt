Dutch's team of commandos go off to find hostages.
On the way they find skinned bodies with looks of terror on their faces.
They find the terrorists camp and kill them all.
But thats only the beginning of the bad things.
The commandos are picked off one by one by an invisible enemy and die horrible deaths until only Dutch is left...
