</b>
         The infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars.
         As we slowly DESCEND through the varied shades of blue
         of the Earth's atmosphere, we HEAR the first strains of
         a haunting, Central American FLUTE, joined by a swelling
         background of JUNGLE SOUNDS.  We descend further,
         through a lush JUNGLE CANOPY, backlit by a setting sun.

<b>                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
</b>


<b>   2     EXT. JUNGLE COASTLINE - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)               2
</b>
         Through a collage of shimmering HEAT-WAVES, a dark,
         OTHER-WORLDLY OBJECT drops INTO VIEW, backlit by the
         fiery, ORANGE-RED sphere of a setting tropical SUN,
         heading slowly towards us, floating, as if suspended by
         the rising heat of the jungle.

         Continuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves
         into a MILITARY ASSAULT HELICOPTER, its rotors strobing
         in the fading sunlight.  Drawing closer, the SOUND of
         powerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes
         dominant, overpowering.

         Guided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper
         looms hard INTO VIEW, pitching forward and settling to
         the ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation



<b>   2-A   INT. COMMAND POST - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)                   2-A  *
</b>
         Where a MAN wearing a military UNIFORM watches through
         the large open windows the helicopter as it continues
         to approach.  Before the skids have even touched down he
         SEES the first of the MEN, dressed in CIVILIAN CLOTHES
         but carrying full COMBAT GEAR, alight gracefully from
         the chopper, double-timing in close order to one side,
         the orders SHOUTED by one man lost in the ROAR of the
         chopper.

         The man turns away from the window, to a FIGURE, hidden     *
         in the shadows.

<b>                                 MAN                                 *   
</b>                  He's here.

         He turns back, lowering a BAMBOO SHADE, obscuring the       *   
         window.
<b>   
</b><b>------------------------------------------------------------------------
</b><b>                                                                2
</b>


<b>   2-B   EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT                            2-B  *
</b>
         On adjoining PADS, two other HELICOPTERS are VISIBLE; in
         the b.g. can be SEEN several concrete and THATCHWORK
         BUILDINGS, a secret command post disguised as a COASTAL
<b>         FISHING VILLAGE.
</b>
         The post in a flurry of activity, AMERICAN ADVISORS
         shouting directions to dozens of LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS
         who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to
         load EQUIPMENT into the other choppers.

         Inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against  *
         the bulkhead, as if asleep.  He stirs, sits up, lighting    *
         up a CIGAR.  With fatigue showing in his motion, he leans   *
         forward, descending to the ground.                          *

         A JEEP pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the    *
         front seat, tossing his GEAR into the rear.  With a         *
         lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post.          *

         In the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep
         approaches.  Reaching the command post the man alights
         from the jeep, heading towards the two men.

         Into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the
         door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER, the team leader, 38, an
         intelligent and intense man.  He informally salutes,
         GENERAL H.L. PHILIPS, 55, hardened, close-cropped graying
         hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a
         member of an elite commando unit in the U.S. Army.  He
         clasps Schaefer warmly on the shoulder.

<b>                                 PHILIPS
</b>                         (with affection)
                  You're looking well, Dutch.

<b>                                 SCHAEFER
</b>                  It's been a long time, General.

         They walk up the stairs, entering the palapa, leaving
         the other man on guard.



<b>   3     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                      3
</b>
         Large, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof.
         Behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked
         lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of
         compact FIELD RADIO EQUIPMENT, MAPS and AERIAL
         PHOTOGRAPHS.  Otherwise the rooms are primitive and
         stand out in stark contrast to this high-tech invasion.

         Philips and Schaefer enter the room.

</b>                         (growing serious)
                  We've got a real problem here,
                  something right up your alley.

         They cross to the center of the room to a folding table,
         covered with a large TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP of the Central
         American highland jungle.  Philips leans over the table,
         circling a set of COORDINATES and a MARK on the open
         map.

<b>                                 PHILIPS
</b>                  Eighteen hours ago I was
                  informed that one of our
                  choppers, transporting three
                  presidential cabinet members
                  from this charming little
                  country, was shot down...
                         (point to
                         the circled
                         area)
                  ...The pilots radioed from the
                  ground that they were all
                  alive.  Their position was
                  fixed by the transponder
                  beacon onboard the chopper.
                         (points)
                  Here.

         Schaefer studies the map.  He looks up at Philips.

<b>                                 SCHAEFER
</b>                  That's over the border,
                  General.

<b>                                 PHILIPS
</b>                         (dead serious)
                  That's the problem.  Apparently
                  they strayed off course.
                         (pause)
                  We're certain they've been
                  captured by the guerrillas.

         Schaefer looks up, puffing lightly on the cigar.

                  there's not much hope.  We

                  mounted tonight.  That doesn't

         Another puff on the cigar.

         Schaefer turns, SEEING the outline of a figure standing
         in the doorway of the communications room, holding a
         sheaf of PAPERS.

         Wearing pressed fatigues, DILLON, mid-thirties, black,
         walks into the room.

         Although as rugged looking as the others, his bearing
         and grooming indicate he's been away from the business
         of soldiering for sometime.  His quick intelligent eyes
         reveal his current profession.

         Illuminated by the eerie red glow of NIGHT LIGHTS, are
         SEVEN MEN, dressed in jungle camouflage, soft hats and
         camouflage face-makeup.  They wear no identity badges
         or insignias.  The man are checking their WEAPONS,
         making last minute adjustments to their GEAR.

         The compartment reverberates with the NOISE of the
         THUMPING ROTORS and the ROAR of air from the open
         doors.

         BLAIN, weapons and ordinance specialist, a frightening
         bull of a man, a 240 pound killer, removes from his
         shirtpocket a think PLUG OF TOBACCO.  He looks across
         at:

         smile, he knows what's coming.

         Holding the plug between his teeth Blain yanks free
         from his shoulder scabbard a wicked, ten inch COMBAT
         KNIFE.  Placing the razor sharp blade next to his lips
         he slices through the plug as if it were butter.  He
         chews throughtfully.

         Seated by the open doorway is RAMIREZ, a slight,
         angular man, an East L.A. streetwise Chicano.

         Adding a final piece of camouflage TAPE to his pack
         HARNESS, he looks up and smiles, faking a throw and
         the bulleting the tape to:

         HAWKINS, the radioman and medic, Irish, street-tough,

         stoic, a man of quiet strength and simplicity,

         Dillon seems comfortable with the men, showing Ramirez
         a battered CIGARETTE LIGHTER from a famed commando
         unit from the past.

         But his ingratiating demeanor is not impressing Mac, who
         regards Dillon with the cold suspicion reserved for an
         outsider.  Mac looks up at Blain, his eyes narrowing.

         Blain's massive jaws roll as he masticates the chew.
         He pauses, eyes moving downward, spotting his target.

         He hocks a thick, vile stream of TOBACCO JUICE directly
         between Dillon's legs and onto the floor, a gelatinous
         skein lacing across the toe of one boot.  Dillon looks
         up, his face goes cold and menacing.

         Dillon turns back to Ramirez, ignoring Mac and Blain,
         who continues to stare at him.  Mac looks across at
         Blain, wide grins breaking across their huge faces.
         Cradled in Blain's arms, as if it were a part of his
         body, is a large, CANVAS-COVERED BUNDLE.  Blain looks
         down at his bundle, almost affectionately.

         The PILOT's VOICE breaks in over Schaefer's headset.

         Looking up, Schaefer gives a hand signal to the nearest

         Ramirez and Blain pick up heavy, METAL CONICAL DEVICES,

         A light shower passes through the trees.  The sky
         clears, REVEALING a lush and exotic foliage.  Birds
         are beginning to SING but otherwise, all is SILENT.

         The dense growth seems impenetrable, but from a solid
         wall of undergrowth, a HAND appears and signals in a
         downward motion.

         As if by magic, the assault team materializes, quietly,
         cautiously.  Schaefer makes another gesture and the team
         moves forward in perfect harmony in POINT-LOCK step,
         taking their cue from Ramirez, the pointman.  Schaefer,
         highly focused and alert to every sound and movement,
         follows Ramirez, as if organically connected.

         an even denser growth of jungle, at times moving by
         instinct, as they are often visually separated.  At one
         point, Schaefer checks his COMPASS, flashing some hand
         signals to Ramirez, indicating a new direction.  Ramirez
         nods and moves on, Schaefer signaling to the rest of the

         Blain, in a defensive position, sweeps the jungle slowly
         with his MP-5.  He steps back and turns, checking,
         revealing in the b.g. the WRECKAGE OF A U.S. ARMY UH-1H
         HELICOPTER, hanging upside down, twenty feet above the
         ground, entangled in vines in the heavy capony, badly
         damaged, rotors bent, its tail section blown away.

         Ramirez moves cautiously, searching for trip wires,
         using his knife to check the edges of the seats and
         door frames.  Grimly he glances at the TWO BODIES
         slumped over the controls and then exits, snapping
         into and rappelling down the rope to the ground.

         He joins Schaefer standing in the f.g.  They look
         up, watching as Dillon moves through the cockpit,
         searching through pockets and compartments.  Schaefer
         turns his back to the helicopter.

         As the assault team passes below, a BUTTERFLY lands on
         what appears to be the BARK of a TREE.  It fans its wings
         and flies on.

         The impression of the butterfly remains in PERFECT
         RELIEF, as is imprinted on the bark.  The image fades,
         REVEALING for an instant a gridwork of TINY SCALES on
         the bark.

         The bark moves!  Changing colors, like a chameleon,
         REVEALING for an instant the form of something alive
         as it flows into the leaves, once again becoming
         indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage.

         TWO EYES, faintly flowing yellow, appear in the
         foliage.  They blink, disappearing, and then become
         VISIBLE again.

         Billy passes by and halts, removing his KNIFE.  With

         severing it.  A thin stream of WATER emerges which
         he drinks.

         Suddenly he stops, letting the water drip to the

         M-203 shotgun to bear, listening intently.  Something
         seems wrong.  He brings his eyes upward and stares,
         hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside.

         As his eyes strain to penetrate the dense, intertwined

         HEARING a faint RUSTLING SOUND he looks up, SEEING a
         curtain of MOSS several feet away.  He takes a cautious
         step forward, extending his weapon.  He reaches
         forward with his free hand, touching the moss.

         Behind the curtain a slight shifting of DARK FORMS
         occurs.  He pauses and then with a sudden movement,
         sweeps the moss aside...

         A BLACK EXPLOSION of FLUTTERING WINGS as carrion-eating
         BIRDS rush past Billy's body.

         Billy's face seizes into a mask of horror, his
         expression descending into a state of complete,
         primitive shock, his eyes staring transfixed, inches
         away from the leering death-grin of a HUMAN FACE,
         upside down, completely stripped of skin.

         Reeling, his body numbed by the sight before him,
         he stumbles backwards and stops.

         Vines threaded through their achilles tendons, the
         BODIES OF THREE MEN, skinned and gutted, hang
         suspended in the think, suffocating air, BUZZING
         with insects.

         Billy turns away, revulsed as Ramirez moves quietly
         INTO VIEW, Schaefer directly behind him.  Ramirez
         stares at the bodies, now seen to be in the first
         stages of deterioration, strips of flesh torn away
         by the birds and other scavengers.  In an almost
         childlike manner, he crosses himself.

         Schaefer moves into the clearing, kneeling beside
         a bloody pile of CLOTHING and ENTRAILS.  He examines
         the clothing and then rises, holding a DOG TAG on
         a broken chain.  He reads the tag, his face growing
         hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag,
         recognizing the name.

         Schaefer's eyes move from the bloody dog tag to
         the bodies.

         Mac moves forward, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.
         The blade flashes, cutting the vine as the first
         body THUDS to the ground.  He bends over, picking up
         other DOG TAGS.

         Schaefer turns to Dillon.

         Mac appears suddenly, materializing out of the
         undergrowth, pausing cautiously, his senses alert,
         intense, almost nervous.  He moves on, his huge body
         barely making a sound as he weaves through the heavy
         undergrowth.

         Dillon appears.  As he moves on, he crosses over a
         fallen TREE.  Stepping down, his foot breaks through
         a rotten portion, a CHUCK of the log breaking free
         and rolling down the hill.

         Dillon at once goes into a defensive position,
         listening.  The jungle is SILENT.  He stands and
         starts to move forward.  Suddenly Mac appears
         within inches of Dillon's face.  Mac's face is
         menacing, angry.

         Dillon's eyes are wide and fixed, staring back in
         cold hatred at Mac, controlling his rage...he knows
         the rules.

         Not waiting for a response, Mac turns and vanished
         into the jungle.  Seething with anger Dillon
         focuses on a still moving LEAF and STEM, indicating
         Mac's exit point.  He moves on.

         Crouches under heavy foliage, waiting.  He is
         joined by Mac.  They glance briefly at each other,
         scanning in opposite directions for movement and
         sounds.  They speak in whispers.

         each other.  Two men who have seen it all,
         through a dozen no-win situations, and have lived
         to tell about it.

         Mac advances a few meters and signals slowly.

         The assault team moving up the hill, barely
         visible in the heavy foliage, the team moves
         cautiously into defensive positions.  Holding.
         A moment later they continue up the hill,
         crawling.

         On their stomachs, Schaefer and Ramirez clear
         the edge of the knoll, SEEING below a GUERRILLA
         VILLAGE, a huge, spreading PALAPA covering
         implacements dug into a hillside, descending
         to a winding stream bed below.  30 MEN, dressed
         in a mixture of jungle fatigues and civilian
         clothes, armed with AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES move
         about the camp.  A heavy MACHINE GUN emplacement
         guards the entrance to the camp.  TWO MEN sit
         in the camouflaged emplacement.

         sweeping the camp with BINOCULARS, SEES a
         GUARD above the camp.  One of the man picks up
         a hand-held ROCKET LAUNCHER, placing it beside
         a bandolier of ROCKETS and a RADIO SET and
         CONSULS taken from the U.S. surveillance
         helicopter as if preparing to take them away.

         Schaefer puts down the glasses, looking at
         Ramirez who nods in acknowledgment.  A sudden
         MUFFLED CRY brings Schaefer's attention to one
         end of the camp, where a heavily thatched DOOR
         covers and opening to the PALAPA.  A GUARD
         stands at the door.

         The door flies open as a HOSTAGE, shirtless,
         hands tied behind his back, staggers through
         the door as if kicked from behind.

         The man falls to the ground, feebly trying to regain
         his footing.  Although difficult to see from Schaefer's
         vantage point, the man's battered face and welt-covered
         back indicate he has been severely tortured.

         Emerging from the palapa, a GUERRILLA LEADER,
         moustached and wearing a SIDEARM, approaches the
         beaten man, kicking him viciously in the stomach,
         rolling him to his side.

         Kneeling beside the man he withdraws an AUTOMATIC from
         his holster and cocks the hammer.  Grabbing the man by
         the hair he jams the muzzle into the man's ear and with
         a violent twist, pulls the trigger.

         The guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back
         to the palapa, still holding the pistol, closing the
         door behind him.

         grim-faced at having witnesses the murder, lowers him
         glasses, a look of cold determination on his face.
         Quickly he and Ramirez ease down the escarpment,

         Schaefer makes a circling motion with his thumb

         his COMBAT KNIFE, placing it between his teeth.

         They move through the underbrush in tandem, like
         two bug cats, stalking.  Mac freezes, the sweat
         pouring from his face, holds up his hand as Blain
         stops.

         Belly crawls silently through the tall grass just
         outside and above the main entrance to the camp.  He
         stops, studying the ancient, rusted skeleton of a
         TRUCK parked on a level spot above the camp, its
         engine quietly IDLING.  The truck is jacked and
         blocked up, one rear wheel attached to a belt-drive
         leading to a PUMP, drawing water from a river nearby.
         In the open cab of the truck a GUARD is on duty,

         He hears something to his side.  Turning to investigate,

         Before him are two FRAGMENTATION GRENADES.  He looks

         We HEAR the horrific, deformed CRIES and SCREAMS

         at the entrance way to the main palapa, a Guerrilla
         stands in the doorway, giving COVER FIRE to his comrades
         as they fall back inside.

         Jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa, Billy
         drops directly in front of the Guerrilla.

         From the side, unseen by Billy, another Guerrilla           *
         thrusts out with a knife, Billy ducking backwards, the
         tip of the knife SLASHING his face.  With a lightning
         move, Billy whips his arm up and around the Guerrilla,
         locking his elbow, breaking the joint.

         Still holding the man he FIRES, blowing the other
         Guerrilla off his feet with the SHOTGUN portion of his
         weapon.  He looks at the Guerrilla out of the corner of

         Meanwhile, Blain is crouched next to a tree, providing      *

         Nearby, Mac charges from the jungle on a dead run,
         diving over a fallen tree as machine gun FIRE rakes the

         For the first time, Schaefer studies the interior of
         the cavernous palapa, SEEING the enormous stockpile
         of WEAPONS, EQUIPMENT and SUPPLIES stacked along the
         walls, obviously a major military stronghold hidden
         deep within the mountains.  Mac hustles up to Schaefer,
         a look of urgency on his face.

                  of it.  Something big was
                  about to happen here.

         Schaefer looks at Mac a moment, a flush of anger
         beginning to show.

         Schaefer goes back into the room, looking down at the
         unconscious guerrilla, racking a round into the
         chamber, reloading his weapon.

         He kneels, staring into the FACE of a WOMAN, ANNA,
         dark, late twenties.  Despite her blood and
         dirt-smeared face, she is beautiful.

         up her PISTOL, ejecting the clip.  He stands, beginning
         to shuffle through the PAPERS scattered about the room.
         Staring at one he looks up, the pieces falling together.

         Ramirez, at a crouch, runs through the jungle,
         following the obvious signs of the Guerrilla's
         retreat.  He emerges from the trees into an opening,
         leading to a sheer rock cliff, towering fifty feet
         above the ground.  Scanning the wall, he SEES
         movement and quickly takes cover, as automatic
         FIRE rips up the ground before him.

         Two Guerrillas scramble up through the chimney,
         assisted by a ROPE, which with withdraw as they
         reach the top.  Ramirez takes out one man, the
         other taking cover, returning fire.

         Blain joins Ramirez, behind cover at the foot of
         the cliff.  As they take cover, Ramirez notices
         the wound on Blain's shoulder.

         The smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered
         by withering FIRE.  They duck down as a grenade
         EXPLODES nearby.  Ramirez quickly replaces the 40MM
         rounds into the SIX-SHOOTER.

         Ramirez immediately rolls into the line of fire,
         BLASTING six RAPID-FIRE shots on a HIGH-ARC trajectory
         towards the rocks.  Blain reacts.

         Blain dives against the protective cover of the
         rock wall, covering his head.  Ramirez casually
         hops across, squatting next to Blain.  They make
         eye-contact.

         Before Blain can answer, Ramirez puts his fingers

         The entire hillside EXPLODES, blowing the Guerrillas
         into the air, a torrent of vegetation and earth
         raining down the cliff, obscuring Blain and Ramirez.

                  prisoners, Dillon.

         Dillon grabs the handset from Hawkin's radio, shoving it
         at Schaefer.

         Schaefer looks at the handset.  Then at Dillon, he knows
         Dillon's won.

         He starts to walk away but stops, turning back, pointing
         a finger at Dillon.

         Schaefer and Billy are kneeling on the ground near the
         trailhead, studying a MAP.  In the b.g., the team, hidden,
         covers the hillside approaches to the camp, nervous and
         wary, weapons ready.

                  Except for this valley.

         Billy shakes his head, following the CONTOUR LINES of
         the rugged terrain.

<b>                                 BILLY

                  then down, here, at this canyon,

         Schaefer turns to Ramirez, kneeling close by.

         He turns and looks at Dillon, Anna as his side, her
         forehead bandaged, her hands bound in front of her.
         He turns back to the others.

         as he goes.

         She spits at him, turning forward with a twist of
         her head.

         Dillon picks up his back, shouldering it.  As they
         move on, Mac calls out to him.

<b>                                 MAC

         Dillon turns and approaches, warily, holding
         the girl.

         MAc unsheathes his knife.  He gives Dillon a cold
         look and turns him by the shoulders.  Crawling
         across the PACK on Dillon's back is a huge SCORPION.

         Mac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his
         blade, holding it before the wincing Dillon.  Anna
         smirks, nodding to the writhing, stinging insect.

         Mac flings the scorpion to the ground, crushing it
         with his boot.  He looks up at Dillon, walks away.
         Dillon follows, pulling Anna behind him.

         Billy, guarding the rear, glances furtively around
         the clearing.  He moves a step forward and stops,
         freezing.

         Slowly he turns back, his eyes riveted upon the
         treeline above the camp.  His eyes strain, his
         senses registering a fear he cannot name or see.

         Something is out there, in the trees, waiting,
         watching.

         Billy turns and walks into the jungle, pausing
         one last time to look behind him before he too
         disappears from sight.

         The jungle GROWS SILENT.

         LOOKING DOWN from his vantage point TO the treeline
         below, terraces like stepping stones, FOCUSING ON
         a TREE, fifty feet away.

         The Observer utters a LOW TRILL and springs outward
         into space, hurtling downward towards his landing
         point, the canopy of the trees approaching in a
         staccato rush of green.

         The SOUNDS of the FOREST are again altered and
         enhanced with an electric, STATIC-LIKE quality as
         the Observer descends fluidly through the trees
         and to the ground.

         He enters the camp, surveying the terrible
         destruction and carnage.  He SEES the dead
         Guerrillas, the dissipating heat from their bodies
         leaving them pale and GHOST-LIKE, as if fading
         light about to extinguish.  He sees their weapons,
         the cold hard steel of the barrels registering
         ICE BLUE in his vision.

         As it appears, pulsing in a pale magenta heat, low
         to the ground, holding his weapon.  He lays down
         the weapon, picking up the SCORPION, turning it
         slowly in his fingers, examining it.  It looks like
         an exotic flower, its color fading from sight,
         turning to BLACK.

         A low SOUND is uttered, something vaguely familiar
         about it:  A NEARLY HUMAN VOICE, a distorted
         imitation of Mac.

<b>                                 HUNTER

         Again the phrase is uttered, improving, closer to
         Mac's inflection and accent.

         The last effort is a chilling simulation of Mac's

         He turns and focuses on the area where the team
         left camp.

         He crouches and springs to the lower branches of a
         tree, grasping them with his clawed, three-fingered
         hands, pulling himself up and through the branches
         with astounding speed and simian-like dexterity; his
         spurred prehensile feet, grasping and thrusting him
         to a vantage point, fifty feet above the ground.

         As he moves on, the jungle grows suddenly QUIET, as
         if aware, sensing that the HUNTER is now stalking, no
         longer observing!!!

         The twilight world of a PREHISTORIC FOREST, filled
         with gigantic plants and towering trees, overgrown
         with vines and creepers.

         The team, with Billy at point, walk alongside a
         wandering STREAM BED, weirdly illuminated by SHAFTS
         OF LIGHT, streaming through openings in the trees,
         as if from spotlights, a hundred feet above.

         It is midday, hot and humid, the air BUZZING with the
         sounds of insects, the CRYING of birds and monkeys.
         The men are moving fast and quiet, straining to see
         into the dense jungle, aware of every sound, sweating,
         quietly slapping at biting insects.

         Lies across their path.  As the man climb over a
         rotten section, Mac stops to assist Blain with his

         Blain nods and pauses to rest, looking around him
         as Mac withdraws a small silver POCKET FLASK.  He
         takes a nip, passing the flask to Blain who also
         takes a sip.

         Suddenly the BARREL of an MP-5 is thrust into her face.

         on her, the look in his eyes indicating he'd hove no

         She moves on.  Ramirez gives him a cold look as Dillon

         up with Anna, turning her sharply by the chin.

         Billy, in the lead, picks his way along the riverbank,
         his concentration rapt, aboriginal.  His face a
         trancelike mask of expectation.

         Blain, cradling the heavy Mini-gun as if it were a
         toy, swings the weapon relentlessly across his field
         of view.  He pauses to adjust the hanging, belted
         loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack
         magazine.  An INSECT lands on his face and is trapped
         in the grease paint near his lips.  He draws the
         hapless bug into his mouth with his tongue and quietly
         spits it out, his concentration unbroken.

         Mac follows, holding the M-60 high across his chest.

         Schaefer, bent, cautious, his feet moving aside the
         dry leaves on the ground, heel to toe and on foot
         edges.  He glances around, checking the team's
         position and progress.

         Hawkins follows, his mouth open, breathing deeply,
         exhausted, the radio a 60 pound demon.

         Anna, struggling to climb a section of the stream
         bank, slips on some loose dirt.  Unable to assist

         Dillon prods her with his rifle, forcing her to

         and the team freezes in position.  An eerie SILENCE,
         like a slowly falling curtain, descends over the
         jungle until even the BUZZING and CLICKING of insects
         have CEASED.

         Sensing an ambush, move quietly into the foliage.
         Dillon moves into the undergrowth, dragging Anna
         with him.  He slings his MP-5 over his shoulder,
         withdrawing his KNIFE.  Grasping Anna by her shirt
         collar and pushing her to the ground he holds the
         weapon near her throat.  Dillon signals to Ramirez          *
         who approaches.  Dillon hands Ramirez the knife.

         Before Ramirez can respond, Dillon slips into the
         undergrowth.  Ramirez holds the knife on Anna,
         cautiously scanning around him for movement.

         Unseen by Ramirez, Anna's outstretched hands slowly
         tighten around a stout ROOT-BURL, lying loose on the
         ground.

         He remains frozen and transfixed, staring into the
         treeline.  Something is moving, fluid, silently and
         downward, into the forest.  Billy remains rooted to
         the spot, lost in concentration.

         Schaefer signals for Mac to cover him and then moves low
         and quiet towards Billy.  Dillon appears, looking to
         Mac for an explanation.  Mac ignores him, concentrating
         on the jungle.  Dillon looks forward at...

         Billy, his eyes riveted to the capony above, as he
         unconsciously reaches to his throat, grasping a LEATHER
         POUCH, secured to his neck by a thong.  He fingers the

         high into the trees, puzzled and frightened.  He's
         lost sense of the Hunter's presence.  He lowers his
         vision, looking towards the Hunter, now on the ground,

         Sensing the danger has passed, Ramirez releases his
         grip on Anna.  As they start to rise, Ramirez sheaths
         his knife and unslings his MP-5.  Anna still stares
         hard into the jungle.

         Suddenly, without even looking, Anna with the trained
         reflexes of an experienced fighter swings the BURL with
         all her might, catching Ramirez hard on the side of the
         head, just above the eye, opening a wicked gash.
         Spinning around she knees him brutally in the groin.
         As Ramirez goes down, doubled over in pain, Anna turns,
         scrambling up the embankment, running for the jungle.

         Ramirez CRIES out.

         Anna, although bound, is light and fit and runs fast,
         hurdling fallen logs and branches, charging through the
         undergrowth.  SHe has a good start.

         Hawkins, hampered by the radio and weapon but in

         dense foliage, SEEING the fleeing Anna.  He watches

         faster, the green of the jungle rushing by in a blur.

         taking advantage of any hesitation Anna makes,
         struggling with the dense jungle.

         Anna hits a small clearing, an alleyway through

         her to the ground.  In a second he's on her, his
         weapon ready.  She struggles to her feet, fighting,
         gasping for breath.  Hawkins holds the MP-5 on her,
         looking at her, almost pleading.  He doesn't want
         to shoot her, but he will if he has to.

         approaches, angry, wary, but the girl is so stunned.
         He SEES the trail of BLOOD and CRUSHED GRASSES leading
         into the jungle.  He gives a LOW WHISTLE and then moves
         on, the rest of the team assuming defensive positions
         around the clearing.

         blood-covered weapon, and then, a few yards later,
         the radio.  Ramirez cautiously parts the brush before

         Schaefer, looking at Hawkins' bloodstained equipment
         lying at Anna's feet, looks up.

         They move out.  Schaefer moves into the jungle,
         searching.  He crouches at the base of a huge
         MAHOGANY TREE, covered with vines, studying the
         jungle.  He moves away from the tree and into the
         forest, looking for signs on the ground.

         Where he was sitting, a DROP OF BLOOD falls.  Another
         drop falls, dripping from a leaf and above that, from
         another leaf.  Above that, high in the top of the
         tree, SUSPENDED from vines from his ankles, is
         HAWKINS' BODY, his chest a gaping wound.

         He hands there as if he were an animal, field dressed.

         Crouched in the undergrowth.  There is a movement in
         the brush before him.  He wipes the sweat from his
         eyes and clicks his safety on the Mini-gun to fire.

         The SOUND is growing closer.  Blain levels the weapon.
         A smile crosses his face.

         The movement in the brush is GROWING LOUDER.  Blain's

         Suddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves,
         startling Blain.  He relaxes momentarily as he
         watches the animal scurrying from sight.  He
         stands...

         He starts to turn, the Mini-gun held low, ready to
         fire...

         ...from out of the jungle, 75 feet away, the Hunter's
         WEAPON streaks toward him like a missile.  He SCREAMS
         as it enters his back, erupting from his chest in an

         He HEARS a RUSTLING in the bushes.  A wet SUCKING SOUND.
         Mac charges into the clearing.  In the instant before
         the Hunter disappears into the forest, Mac SEES a vision
         so brief and fantastic that it seems like a
         hallucination.

         The Hunter's EYES flare momentarily from the green
         before they vanish.

         Mac sees his friend, lying on the ground, his chest
         open, the powerful man, dead.

         expending it in one LONG BURST.

         forward, grabbing the Mini-gun.  As he stands, the

         He opens FIRE and the foliage before him EXPLODES with

         More FIRING.  Mac, his weapon expended, continues
         to thrust the Mini-gun forward, still squeezing the
         trigger.

         Suddenly, as quickly as it started, THE FIRING STOPS.
         The men move catlike into the jungle, reloading,
         searching, their nerves taut, stretched to the limit,
         ready to fire again at any second.

         Mac is frozen, eyes wide, unblinking, his breath

         growing look of wariness.  The others, setting up the
         RADIO, show no response.

         The Hunter's foot steps on the upper leg of the corpse,
         the PREHENSILE SPUR digging deep, pinioning the body
         to the ground.  The Hunter's HAND extends, his
         FINGERS puncturing the skin at the base of the spine,
         gripping the vertebrae.

         With otherworldly strength the arm pulls, the entire
         SPINAL COLUMN ripping free from the body, a sickly
         SNAPPING and POPPING of cartilage separating from bone
         and tissue.

         bone, looking at his with eyes which have seen on an
         instinctual level what the others have so far only begun

         CLOSE ON an oval CHAMBER made of an otherworldly looking
         metal with a strange copperlike patina, its interior
         bathed in INTENSE BLUE LIGHT.  In the chamber is
         Hawkins' SKULL CAP and SPINAL COLUMN still attached.

         The light field suddenly changes as all connective
         tissue, flesh and blood and drawn away from the bony
         structures with incredible force, disintegrating as they
         rush toward the sides of the chamber.

         The light changes in frequency to a dull glow as the
         Hunter's hands remove the GLAZED, POLISHED trophy from
         the chamber.  He turns, carefully placing it upon a
         GLOWING SURFACE.  He touches the trophy gently, feeling
         its texture, as a man might touch the hide of a big cat.
         He pulls his hand away and instantly an opaque FORCE
         FIELD covers the trophies.

         A FORCE FIELD that permeates the jungle, becoming one
         with the trees and foliage.  The Hunter walks down a

         jungle.  As the Hunter reaches the doorway he changes

         The mist has thickened, the night alive with a million
         JUNGLE SOUNDS.  The team members sleep uneasily, if at
         all.

         Mac, although weary, stares hard into the night,
         waiting, each small sound a potential enemy.  A LULL
         spreads over the jungle, animals and insects QUIETING.
         Mac tightens his grip on the Mini-gun.

         Billy awakens, peering into the night.  Nothing.

         Suddenly, a metallic CLICK, a POP, the SOUND of a
         warning flare rocketing into the canopy.  A moment later
         a brilliant FLASH as the flare burns, illuminating the
         camp.

         An echoing eerie SCREAM fills the night as a DARK SHAPE
         in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards Mac.

         Mac spins, hauling the heavy gun around, just as
         something crashes into his upper body, driving the huge
         man into the foxhole.

         A desperate battle for life ensues, illuminated with
         the strobing light of the descending flare.  Mac's
         enraged SHOUTS and ROARS mingled with horrific SCREAMS
         fill the night.

         Mac's razor-edged KNIFE slashes in the light; BLOOD
         spatters his face as he attacks fiercely.

         Schaefer and Ramirez rush at a crouching run towards
         the foxhole, their weapons ready.

         A tremendous climatic SCREAM from the foxhole AND THEN,
         SILENCE.  Schaefer and Ramirez approach, cautiously.
         Mac stands, his face and clothes drenched in blood,
         some of it his, his breath coming in rapid gasps.  He
         looks at Schaefer, whispering hoarsely.

         As the flare breaks through the canopy, dying out in
         great flickering bursts, the man stare down into the
         foxhole.  A huge, jungle BOAR lies mutilated in a pool
         of blood, still quivering in the final throes of death.

         The flare dies out.

         Mac, shaking from adrenalin, breathing heavily, looks
         down at the dying animal.

         Schaefer shines his TEKNA-LIGHT onto the boar, playing
         the light along its massive hulk, its razor edges tusks
         gleaming in the light.  Ramirez appears by his side,
         looking down at the huge carcass.

         Nearby, unnoticed by the men, Anna stoops, her hands
         still bound, picking up an MP-5 from the ground.  She
         turns, looking for an avenue of escape, running for
         the jungle.

         But the forest looks foreboding and sinister.  She
         stops, staring at the jungle, the moonlight reflected
         off leaves like a thousand eyes.  For a brief second
         she imagines she can see the Hunter's eyes, crashing
         towards her, the shifting patterns of light and dark
         making the jungle seem to strobe, like it is about to
         rush in at her.  She freezes, paralyzed by fear, by her
         memories of the attack.

         She drops the MP-5 to the ground.

         Back at the foxhole, Schaefer and Ramirez help the
         still shaken Mac from the hole.  Schaefer looks at
         Mac, at the huge gash across his chest.

         They all turn, ready to move and then stop.  Coming
         forth from the shadows Anna appears, still frightened,
         seeking the security of the soldiers.

         From the darkness nearby, Billy's VOICE in a hoarse
<b>         WHISPER.
</b>
<b>                                 BILLY

         Schaefer turns, apprehensive, something in Billy's
         voice...

         He walks over to Billy, standing with a FLASHLIGHT
         pointing to the ground.  They see Blain's BODY BAG
         slashed open, covered in blood.  Ramirez appears.

<b>                                 BILLY

         Anna appears between Schaefer and Ramirez, staring down
         at the empty, blood-soaked body bag.  She looks up, into
         Schaefer's eyes.

         A patchy GROUND FOG covers the area.  Anna, in her
         foxhole, awakens, LISTENING to the rising SOUNDS of
         the jungle.  MONKEYS begin to forage, their noisy
         CHATTERING and SCREECHING filling the air.

         A BIRD flutters back to its nest; a CHAMELEON emerges
         onto a leaf, directly above Anna's head.

         Anna carefully extends her arm, allowing the lizard
         to crawl onto her, watching, fascinated as it changes
         colors.  She carefully places the chameleon back on the
         leaf, which changes color again, becoming nearly
         invisible.

         Near the empty PONCHO, Schaefer, Billy and Ramirez
         are examining the ground and the trip wire to the

         Anna at the base of the rocks scans the jungle with
         binoculars watching the tree line.  Mac moves past her,
         uncoiling a trip wire linking up four CLAYMORE mines
         hidden at various points with leaves and foliage.  In
         a tree at the edge of the clearing, Billy tosses an
         uncoiling roll of wire to Ramirez who attaches it to
         a GRENADE, wedged it the crouch of a tree.

         Wires attached to GRENADES and CLAYMORE MINES lead off
         through the underbrush and trees leaving a long, unmined
         corridor leading from the camp and into the jungle.

         Morning passes.  Fog lifts as the sun creeps into the jungle.
         Insects swarm and are fed upon by BIRDS and other predators.

         At the entranceway to the rock outcropping, the net and trigger

         SLOW RACK TO Schaefer's face.  Ashen.  HOLD.  Suddenly an
         EERIE SILENCE moves over the jungle:

         He whips his face forward.  The silence is SHATTERED by a
         bird flapping from the brush.

         Schaefer sits back and scratches his head, frustrated and a
         little chagrined.

                  What'll you try next -- cheese?

         Schaefer glares at him.  Turns to go --

         He stands and begins to move low to the ground toward the
         waiting snare.

         Behind him, sighting down their well-hidden gun barrels, the
         others scan the jungle, alert for the slightest sound or
         movement, covering him.

         Schaefer reaches the trap, carefully skirting the trigger
         hidden beneath the leaves.  He reaches the end of the corridor,
         moving out into the jungle.  He moves further away from the
         others, the silence crushing down on him.  He stops and waits,
         sweat pouring down his face, his finger tightening on the
         trigger of his M-203, eyes scanning the jungle.

         He turns his back on the jungle, waiting.  Nothing.  He moves
         back towards the corridor, reaching the net, again waiting,
         listening, sensing.  Nothing.  He turns around, looking at the
         jungle one last time, his face measuring defeat and then, with
         carefully, measured strides, he walks back to the camp.

         Schaefer looks at Billy who shakes his head in puzzlement.
         Nearby, Dillon starts to rise.

         Suddenly, behind Schaefer at the end of the corridor,
         with a resounding SWISH and SNAP, the NET explodes off
         the floor of the jungle in a hail of leaves and sticks,
         rocketing upward into the treetops.

         Schaefer spins, the others leaping to their feet as
         they SEE the net as it tears into the treetops, a
         large struggling bulge trapped within as a long,
         unearthly TRILLING SCREAM ECHOES through the jungle.

         Schaefer and the others charge from the rocks towards
         the jungle and the bobbing net, their weapons ready.
         Anna remains behind, watching terrified from the rocks.

         They arrive under the net, raising their weapons to
         fire...but before they can fire the entire net
         EXPLODES into a flurry of leaves, twigs, vines, dirt
         and a FLASH of PULSATING CRIMSON.

         As the Hunter leaps from the net his WEAPON activates,
         his arm slashing out, severing a THICK LIMB of the
         spreading tree capony, entangled in vines.

         The limb CRASHES down from the trees, Schaefer, Dillon,
         Billy and Mac Diving for safety.  But Ramirez, following
         the Hunter's leap, SEES too late the pendular movement
         of the severed limb and is struck a THUDDING blow in
         the ribs, which lifts him off his feet, hurling him
         backwards like a rag doll, his shirt torn open,
         exposing a BLOODY WOUND.

         As Anna runs to Ramirez's side the others, still
         stunned, look upward, frozen in shock SEEING:  THE
         HUNTER, clinging to a side of a tree, flushed bright
         crimson.

         Dillis is dumbfounded, like the others, rooted to the
         ground staring upward.

         The Hunter utters an unearthly SNARL and HISS from his
         open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes
         and he vanishes from sight...a rapid, furtive movement
         through the trees.

         Mac OPENS FIRE with the M-60, the others joining in,
         shredding the foliage, but they know the creature is
         gone.

         With a SHOUT, Mac races into the jungle, in pursuit
         of the Hunter.

         after Mac.  Schaefer watches him leave.  He breaks and
         goes to Ramirez, attended by Anna and Billy, who is now
         sitting up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath.

         Moving through the underbrush HEARS a slight RUSTLING
         in the foliage.  Mac?  He strains to locate the source
         of the movement.

         He HEARS A SOUND, too faint at first it identify.  He
         listens.  Silence.  He hears is again, the SOUND of
         a VOICE, barely audible.  A VERY QUIET WHISPER.

         The vine is alive!  Before he can move, the Hunter's

         Hunter resumes his stalk, timing his movements
         perfectly with those of Dillon.

                  Mac...Mac.

         He moves closer to the rocks, eyes probing.  Through a
         gap in the rocks he SEES Mac's face, staring up at him,
         eyes frozen wide in death.

         Dillon spins hard.  He stares at the solid wall of
         undergrowth.  He looks from one side of the corridor
         to the other.  Something it out there.  Where?

         Something in the vines has caught his attention.  He
         stares hard at a section of moss.

         SCREAMS, his arm instantly severed halfway between
         his shoulder and elbow.  The weapon drops to the
         ground, the forearm still attached, still FIRING.

         With his left hand he FIRES the second weapon
         SHOUTING INSANELY as swings it towards the blurred
         image of his unseen attacker, hitting nothing.

         The Hunter reloads his WEAPON which turns INVISIBLE

         weapon appears from below, cutting into Dillon's

         and Ramirez cross the log, moving onto the other side.
         Billy, still at the foot of the log, providing cover,
         turns to face the jungle.

         He lifts his head towards the trees, feeling the
         onrushing presence of the Hunter.  He shrugs off the
         radio letting it fall, smashing into the rocks
         below.

         He casts away his weapon.  Staring forward he reaches
         into his cargo pocket, withdrawing a small
         GREASE-PAINT TIN.  Covering his finger in BLACK
         PAINT he applies dark slashes under his eyes and
         again, vertically down his cheeks.  Taking another
         dap of paint he makes a SYMBOL on his bare skin, over
         his heart.

         He drops the tin, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE.  Holding
         the knife he grasps the MEDICINE BAG around his neck,
         yanking it free with a quick snap.  He wraps the
         leather thong around his hand and knife, binding the
         weapon and bag together.

         Staring outward, as if in a trance, he begins a low

         Ramirez against some rocks, reaching for his weapon.
         They HEAR Billy's echoing SCREAM.  Instantly their
         weapons are raised, cocked and ready.

         Schaefer sweeps Anna behind him as Ramirez struggles
         to his feet.  Together they back up, covering the
         ridgeline over which they've just come.

         Suddenly, from one side, near Ramirez, the Hunter
         bursts from the jungle, Ramirez, seeing the Hunter,
         spins raising his weapons to fire...

         Ramirez SEES the Hunter's onrushing face, still in
         camouflage, a montage of organic textures and colors,
         his yellow eyes burning.

         Whipping the MP-5 is the direction of the Hunter
         he is hurled backwards from the impact of the Hunter's
         weapon, his neck gushing BLOOD, the MP-5 flying
         through the air, landing in front of Anna.  She moves
         for the weapon...

         The Hunter, with unearthly speed, turns towards
         Anna, as Schaefer starts to spin, SEEING the Hunter
         about to strike as Anna dives for the weapon.
         Schaefer lunges kicking the MP-5 out of Anna's reach.

         Schaefer spins and FIRES, bullets THUDDING into the
         ground, the barrel arcing towards the Hunter as Anna
         stumbles to her feet running into the jungle.

         In a blur the Hunter spins back, hurling his weapon at
         Schaefer which slices through the wooden stock of the
         rifle, SPARKS FLYING as it severs the trigger guard
         and steel breech.

         The M-203 flies out of Schaefer's hands as the Hunter's
         weapon cuts deeply into his left shoulder, laying open
         the flesh.

         The M-203 hits the ground, where it lies broken in half,
         useless.

         Schaefer hits the ground and is rolling, up and running
         for his life, the Hunter charging after him.

         with terror.

         Behind him he can hear the Hunter in pursuit, closing.

         Schaefer spins to look behind him, a wild desperate
         look on his face; he turns back, ducks an overhanging
         limb and lunges on.

         With a sickening IMPACT, he hits the branches of the
         first trees lining the canyon and falls, a hundred feet,
         through one canopy after another, desperately grabbing
         for limbs and branched to break his fall.

         He hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees,
         impacting crosschest on a large BRANCH, knocking his
         wind out.

         Semi-conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides
         off, fingers digging into the bark, falling another ten
         feet into the swiftly moving river.

         Weighted down by his boots and clothing, Schaefer
         struggles to stay afloat.  Gasping for air he ducks

         fills his lungs and dives again, releasing the other
         boot.  He surfaces, strips off his shirt and pants and
         begins to swim towards shore, stroking with one arm.

         As he nears the edge of the precipice from which
         Schaefer has fallen.  The Hunter in close pursuit does
         not hesitate but LAUNCHES himself off the cliff in
         a spectacular LEAP, streaking downward towards the tops
         of the trees that grow out from the canyon wall.

         The Hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree,
         the branches and leaves rushing past in a KALEIDOSCOPIC

         The Hunter bounds off of one branch after another,
         moving through the trees as an expert skier might
         negotiate a series of downhill gates.

         The Hunter leaps free of one tree, bounds across twenty
         feet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree,
         affording a good view of the river below.  From his
         vantage point, looking down at the windening, slowing

         There is no sign of Schaefer.  Precious seconds pass.
         Slowly, looking like a drowned rat, he surfaces, taking
         a feeble breath.  He is nearly finished, his energy
         sapped.  But the water is calm and a few strokes are
         enough to carry him near the shore.  His feet hit
         bottom.

         He tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick
         MUD SLURRY at the river bank.  With his last ounce of
         strength, he crawls, panting and gasping into a
         sheltered mud OVERHANG, collapsing beside the exposed
         ROOT-SYSTEM OF A DEAD TREE, his body completely covered
         in thick, gray MUD.

         Nearly unconscious, he raises his head and looks to the
         opposite side of the river, scanning the bank.  There is
         no sign of the Hunter.  He collapses in relief.  He's
         escaped.

         Suddenly, the Hunter impacts the water, throwing up a
         huge SPLASH.  He stands up in the waist deep water.  As
         the water streams off of his body, the chameleon effect
         rapidly changes, struggling to match the shifting color
         patterns of the shimmering water.

         His glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where
         Schaefer lies helplessly trapped.

         The Hunter surges forward, relentlessly closing in on
         this prey.

         He can clearly see the EXPOSED ROOT-SYSTEM, but because
         of the heavy mud blocking Schaefer's body heat, Schaefer
         registers in the Hunter's vision as merely an indistinct
         lump of clay, unrecognizable to the Hunter as a human
         being.

         He scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources.

         Detecting none he moves on sounding a questioning TRILL

         disbelieving that he's still alive, opens one eye,
         SEEING the Hunter's feet move away, his prehensile

         Schaefer GASPS as his eyes bolt open in fear.  As if
         the Hunter were still attacking, Schaefer rolls to his
         feet and runs, slogging through the THICK MUD, stumbling,
         lunging forward, gasping for breath.

         Schaefer spins and staggers backwards into a shallow
         POOL, scuttling, crablike into the chest deep water.
         Schaefer backs into the moss-covered wall by the
         waterfall, looking for movement, regaining his senses.

         As the water settles, he looks down, SEEING the image
         of himself, reflected in the pool; his hair and face
         covered in THICK CLAY.  He stares, mesmerized at the
         image.

         He lifts his arm from the water, his fingers wiping the
         MUD from his face, exposing a PATCH of SKIN.  He studies
         the mud in his hand and then looks at the image of
         himself in the water, SEEING the exposed skin.  HE
         stares at it, a wave of realization rushing through
         his mind.  He places the mud back on his face, again
         looking at his image.

         He looks up, out into the failing light, at the treeline
         of the deepening forest, realizing that fate has given
         him a fighting chance.  Slowly a look of vengeance and
         hatred crosses over his face.

         Using his MACHETE he carves MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS from a
         fire block into a pile of KINDLING.  He removes a match
         from the hollow handle of the machete, also containing
         a coil of PIANO WIRE, GREEN TAPE and MEDICAL SUPPLIES.
         He lights the shavings which burn with a brilliant white
         light.  Schaefer shelters the fire with a banana leaf
         until the flame dies down.  He feeds the fire with more
         kindling, fanning it with a leaf.

         He bends the bow and attaches a long piece of PIANO
         WIRE to one end, carefully wrapping it for strength,
         using strips of green tape to cover the sides of the
         wire where the nock of the arrow will fit.

         He attaches split quilled FEATHERS with fishing line to
         an ARROW,  its tip fashioned into a series of barbs,
         rubbing them to a polished hardness against a smooth
         stone.  When finished he places the arrow on the ground
         next to three other identical arrows.

         Schaefer is pounding a peeled root between two stones.
         He pauses to drool saliva into the pulpy mass.  He
         scrapes the milky substance onto a BANANA LEAF, mixing
         it with a sticky SAP, holding it over the coals until
         the mixture steams.

         Schaefer coats the arrow tips with the sticky poison,
         holding them over the coals until the sap bubbles and
         smokes.  He spins the arrows in his hands, blowing on
         the tips to cool and harden the mixture.

         Using the tip of his machete, he pries open the casing
         of one of the 40MM grenades, discarding the warhead.  He
         dumps the PROPELLANT POWDER from the shell onto a leaf,
         mixing that with a mound of MAGNESIUM SHAVINGS.

         He opens the narrow, tight roll of GAUZE taken from the
         first aid kit of the machete handle, fluffing it into a
         large, loose BUNDLE, the size of a baseball.  He pours
         the powder-mixture into the gauze, mixing it into the
         fabric.

         He transfers the ball of explosive ladened gauze to a
         pliable DRY LEAF, closing it into a bundle, binding it
         at the top with a long strand of jungle-grass.

         He twists the remaining gauze around a MATCH, leaving
         the head exposed, forming a self-striking FUSE.

         He coats the fuse with SAP and then thickly covers it
         with more powder from the 40MM grenade.  He pokes the
         fuse down into the leaf.  Taking a long strand of JUNGLE
         GRASS he makes a large loop, tying it onto the grenade,
         slipping the loop and grenade over his head.

         Finally, using several sections of BAMBOO of differing
         diameters, he fashions a crude, anti-personnel
         SPEAR-BOMB, a BANG-STICK like weapon, using the
         sharpened TONGUE from his belt buckle for a FIRING PIN
         and a 40MM GRENADE from his belt pouch as an explosive

         Schaefer appears, he has covered him entire body with a
         variety of CLAYS and OCHERS, creating a mottled, EARTHEN

         Holding his weapons in one hand, he moves up the canyon,
         ascending into a rising boulder field.

         Where the river flows into a series of falls and pools,
         surrounded by massive boulders and table top rocks,
         their crevices jammed with large amounts of DRIFTWOOD
         swept down at high water from the forests above.

         On a flattened section of rock, Schaefer drags a large
         section of BRANCHES INTO VIEW, adding it to a growing
         mound of FIREWOOD.  He kneels, tending to a pile of
         DRIES GRASS, LEAVES and other tinder.  Using the last of
         his precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, gently
         coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE,
         flames starting to lick upward through the dry wood.

         He stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze.  He
         turns, facing the canyon rim, raising his weapons in one
         hand.  From the depths of his soul, a SOUND emerges;
         primitive and visceral, as if from an animal in pain.

         He throws back his head and SHOUTS.

         Responding with a low HISS, he turns back, raising in
         one hand his weapon, in the other a U-shaped SHARPENING
         DEVICE.  As he passes the weapon through the device, it
         FLASHES into life, a deep, HARMONIC HUM emitted as the
         blade grows with energy, growing hotter, hotter and
         HOTTER with each stroke.  He draws the blade now WHITE-HOT

         illuminating his alien face.

         weapon.

         pauses before the opening of the passageway.  All is
         silent.  He hesitates to enter.  Listeneing.  He starts
         to move and then hears a NEW VOICE:

                  Dillon, over here...

         Schaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's
         voice, backs quickly into the space between a boulder
         and the high rock wall of the ampitheater.

         His feet moving quietly over the rock, the shadow-light
         deepening with the dying fire above, closing in.

         Bow drawn, trapped against the rock, HEARING the sound
         of the Hunter approaching from the left, now the
         right, is helpless, not knowing where to fire, the
         Hunter's deadly strike only an instant away.

         Still holding the bang-stick in his bow hand, he
         carefully releases the draw on the string, reaching
         to his neck for the FLASH-GRENADE.  With painstaking
         care he removes the grenade from his neck.

         Focusing on the rocks before him and the still
         approaching SOUND, he reaches down with the grenade,
         gripping with his fingertips the matchhead fuse,
         placing it against the rocks at his side.

         With a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws
         the grenade, snatching up the bang-stick with his
         good hand.

         The matchhead SPUTTERS as the grenade flies through the
         air, an instant later a blinding, WHITE FLASH of light
         illuminates the ampitheater...

         In that instant Schaefer SEES above him and to his left,
         the HUNTER, poised on top of a rock, his weapon raised,
         about to strike!  Momentarily blinded by the flash of
         light, the Hunter's head recoils to the side.

         Darkness swallows the image of the Hunter, but in that
         second, Schaefer seizes his advantage, hurling the
         bang-stick spear.

         It smashes into the boulder at the Hunter's feet.  The
         Hunter leaps as the grenade DETONATES, shrapnel tearing
         into his body.

         With a terrifying SCREAM of pain and anger, the Hunter
         clutches frantically at the WOUNDS in his neck and
         chest.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM OF RAGE and the
         Hunter is gone.

         Cascades over the rocks, fed by a small stream running
         through the ravine.  A pile of BOULDERS breaks the
         falls, filling the area with an everconstant MIST.

         Schaefer appears, holding the bow and arrow, following
         the LUMINOUS BLOOD TRAIL of the Hunter over the rock.

         Moving behind the falls, Schaefer's body is briefly
         soaked by the water, the hardened and CAMOUFLAGE
         beginning to dissolve, running off his body.  He

         His bow down, Schaefer follows the blood trail across
         the rock, edging alongside a huge vertical boulder.
         The blood trail stops.

         He takes another step forward, past a darkened ALCOVE...

         Schaefer spins, SEEING in the alcove the SURPRISED
         Hunter whirl and spring towards him...

         Schaefer in a bound closes the distance, savagely
         kicking the Hunter's arm.  The WEAPON flies from the
         Hunter's hand CLATTERING to the rock.

         Before he can recover, Schaefer follows with a karate
         kick to the chest, hurling the Hunter to the ground,
         his back exposed.

         In a flash, Schaefer is standing over the Hunter, the
         bow drawn, poised, the blood from his open wound
         dripping onto the Hunter's back.

         The Hunter slowly rolls onto his back, REVEALING his
         face, his eyes bleached white in shock from the loss of
         blood.  The Hunter's body, rippled out of control,
         trying desperately to orientate itself to the
         environment.

         from his exposed skin, blood oozing from the shoulder
         wound, his eyes like black sockets in his almost
         skull-like face.  Seen from this perspective, Schaefer
         is a frightening, horrible visage.

         shudders, GASPING hungrily for air, strugging to speak.
         From his throat, Schaefer HEARS the feeble, distorted
         efforts of the Hunter, at first garbled,
         incomprehensible and then, slowly, chillingly, taking
         on the timbre and quality of his OWN VOICE.

         The Hunter's strength seems to fade even more...

         Then, suddenly, with the last of his diminishing
         strength, he lashes out with one arm, activating the
         lethal, razor sharp SPURS on his wrists.

         The Hunter's coiled leg kicks upward with incredible
         force, his terrible spur ripping into Schaefer's thigh,
         hurling Schaefer into the air, flipping him over,
         sending him crashing to his back into the shallow pool
         of water, momentarily losing his bow.  He flounders
         desperately in the water, searching for the bow.  He
         finds it just as...

         The Hunter rises slowly to his feet, GASPING desperately
         for breath.  He inhales deeply, hungrily, gaining
         strength with each breath.

         Schaefer looks from the pool to SEE the Hunter, raising
         his weapon to throw.

         In one totally instinctual movement, Schaefer draws
         back on the arrow to its very tip and fires.

         The arrow, with a deadly THUD, penetrates deeply into
         the Hunter's neck.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM of RAGE
         as the Hunter clutches his throat, dropping his weapon.
         An instant later and the Hunter is gone.

         canyon, Schaefer holding the Hunter's weapon, pauses
         several times, finding more traces of the Hunter's
         blood, the deep WOUND in his thigh flowing heavily.

         Too weak to move through the trees, the Hunter has
         left a SWATH of trampled grasses, broken twigs and
         branches in his headlong retreat from Schaefer:  the

         shock.  The glow of light from the ENERGY FIELD
         reflecting off the spreading apron of BLOOD flowing
         from his wound.

         With trembling hands he grasps the arrow and breaks

         pain.

         incredibly dense vegetation, ripping aside the heavy
         growth, plunging onward.

         Before him, covering a narrow passageway, is a huge
         SPIDER WEB, intricate, four feet across.  Schaefer
         starts to sweep aside the web.  With a sharp intake
         of breath, he halts, inches from the wed.  Something
         is wrong.

         Examining the web closer he sees not silken threads
         but a hard and shiny network of HAIR-FINE WIRE: A TRAP.

         He backs up, picking up a hefty branch from the ground.
         He swings the branch with a mighty heave, clenching
         his teeth in pain.  The branch sails end over end
         into the web impacting the strands.  A metallic SNAP
         is HEARD; a high-pitches WHINE and the log is violently
         severed, the pieces flying in opposite directions with
         great speed.

         through the foliage.

         Schaefer starts after him but then stops, dumbfounded
         by the incredible images that crash in on him:
         TRANSLUCENT HUMAN SKINS stretched over frames, the hair
         of the attached scalps moving lightly in the wind;
         SKINNED BODIES, some lying on the ground, others hung
         from the trees, like Hopper and his men were.

         He turns back, SEEING the Hunter as he passes through
         the shimmering distortion of a FORCEFIELD enveloping
         the forest.  Within the force field he SEES the vague,
         nearly transparent OUTLINE of the Hunter's ship.

         He approaches it, wide-eyed, his senses reeling with
         astonishment and rage.

         From within the force field, a PASSAGE WAY of BLUE LIGHT
         appears, the Hunter's form backlit as he ascends the
         RAMP to his spacecraft.

<b> 233     EXT. HUNTER'S CAMP - DAY                             133
</b>
         The jungle has been completely transformed.  No longer
         lush and verdant, the area is clear-cut, two feet
         above the ground, covered in FINE WHITE, smoldering
         ASH.  Amongst the shattered stumps, debris from the
         ship, bright as magnesium flares, burns with exotic
         colors.

         If the f.g., Schaefer, a living dead-man, streaked
         with the alien ash, rises up from a shallow depression,
         staring dumbstruck at the site.

         Breaking in low over the treetops, the HELICOPTERS
         flare up into position, one preparing to land.

         As the chopper descends, the crew, standing in the
         door way, stare transfixed at the devastation, their
         eyes trying to penetrate the dense white smoke.

         As the helicopter slowly descends, its propwash creating
         a raging storm, Schaefer materializes from the SWIRLING
         SMOKE AND ASH, his features taking form as he
         approaches, his naked body covered in mud, blood and
         ash.

</b>
         As the chopper, emerging from the vortex, settles
         towards the ground where the spacecraft once stood.
         Through the distorted veil, the helicopter, bristling
         with WEAPONS, VISORED and HELMETED MEN, now covered
         with WHITE ASH, looks like a landing spacecraft.

         The door gunner swings the M-60 into firing position,
         pointing it at Schaefer.  He racks the bolt, loading
         a round.

         The crewmen look tense, frightened.

         Anna, standing next to the door gunner, stares at the
         strange creature before her, narrowing her eyes,
         uncertain.  Is there something familiar about the
         figure?



<b> 236     SCHAEFER                                             236
</b>
         stands in the clearing, staring at the helicopter and
         the array of weapons pointed at him.  He looks dazed,
         like a man making contact with members of an alien
         race, for the first time.



<b> 237     THE HELICOPTER                                       237
</b>
         hovers low to the ground, the tension inside building
         as Schaefer approaches.

         More weapons swing into position.  Fingers tighten on
         triggers.  Suddenly Anna recognizes the figure.
         Realizing the danger she holds up her hands, shouting

         Flash overhead, heading across the trackless jungle,
         their rotors THUMPING like heavy machine gun fire.

         Schaefer, a blanket over his shoulders, still in the
         remains of his mud camouflage, his body laced with
         deep cuts; his chest and shoulder caked with dried
         blood, is seated on a bench in the cargo hold.

         Near the cockpit are General Philips, an ARMY MEDIC,
         two MACHINE GUNNERS.  They look at Schaefer in awe.

         The Medic, holding an open FIELD KIT, a syringe and
         bandages, turns to Philips.

<b>                                 MEDIC
</b>                         (shaking his head)
                  Looks like he's been through
                  hell...can't believe he's
                  still alive.  What the hell
                  went on down there?

<b>                                 PHILIPS
</b>                  If it hadn't been for her, he'd
                  be dead now.  That story she
                  told us...I still can't believe
                  it.

         He looks at Anna, her eyes meeting his, as if asking
         for an explanation.  She looks at him a moment before
         turning back to Schaefer, staring at him as if he were
         risen from the dead.

         She looks into Schaefer's face, Schaefer returning her
         look, recognition passing between them.  Anna extends
         her hand.  Schaefer slowly reaches out, touching her
         fingers, then clasping her hand.

         Schaefer turns his eyes to stare out the open door,
         beyond the passing jungle below, out to the heavens.

         He turns back, looking at Anna, a faint smile crossing
         his face...they made it.
