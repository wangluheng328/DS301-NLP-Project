Scientist Will Rodman works for a major pharmaceutical firm trying to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease.
The most recent version of his experimental drug seems to have worked on a chimp.
Unfortunately, the chimp goes berserk on the same day as a presentation to investors and the animal is put down.
Only after the incident does Will realize that the chimp had given birth and had been acting wildly to protect her newborn.
He takes the animal, which he's named Caesar, home as a pet and soon realize it is extremely intelligent, no doubt the effects of the drug on his mother while he was in utero.
When Will is forced to put the animal in a secure lock up after it attacks a neighbor, Caesar leads an animal revolt against his human captors and mankind.
