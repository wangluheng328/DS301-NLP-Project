Homeless and penniless Depression victims Stanley and Oliver beg food from an elderly woman.
While eating lunch in her kitchen, they overhear her begging the landlord not to foreclose her mortgage because her money has been stolen.
Vowing to help the old woman, the boys auction off their rattletrap car, but the drunken purchaser accidentally puts his wallet in Stanley's pocket.
Oliver later finds it and exposes his friend as the thief to the old lady, who then explains that what they had overheard was nothing but a rehersal for her Community Players little theater group.
