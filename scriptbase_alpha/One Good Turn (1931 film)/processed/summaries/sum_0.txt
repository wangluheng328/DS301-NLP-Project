Stan and Ollie are down on their luck and beg at an old lady's house for food.
While they are eating they overhear a villainous landlord (Finlayson) threatening to evict her if she does not pay the mortgage.
Not realizing that they are hearing a rehearsal for a play, the boys decide to auction their car to help.
In the confusion surrounding the auction, Stan finds himself in possession of a fat wallet and Ollie accuses him of stealing the old lady's money.
When the truth is revealed, Stan exacts painful retribution.
