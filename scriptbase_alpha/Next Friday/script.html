<title>"Next Friday" -- by Ice Cube</title>


<pre>




<b>       EXT. FRONT LAWN - OVERHEAD SHOT - NIGHT
</b>
       DEBO is laid out on the grass.

<b>                           CRAIG (V.O.)
</b>                 In the movies, when you beat up the
                 neighborhood bully; you suppose to live
                 happily ever after.  But around here;
                 that's when all the drama begins...

       Blue and red police lights flash over Debo's body.  Two
       sheriffs walk INTO OUR FRAME and stand over Debo.  They flash
       their lights on him.

                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)
                 Last Friday; I got fired for the first
                 time.  I got high for the first time.  I
                 got shot at for the first time and I
                 kicked Debo's ass for the first time...

       They get him to his feet; but he stumbles and falls in the
       bushes like a knocked out prize fighter.  The sheriffs laugh
       at him.

       Debo looks dazed and confused.  The sheriffs help him out the
       bushes and start to cuff him.

                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)
                 I was the man that night; and Debo ended
                 up going to jail for a couple of years.
                 But he told Ezal he was getting out next
                 Friday.  He said, when he see me, he was
                 gonna smoke me on the spot...

       They walk him OUT OF FRAME...

<b>                                                     FADE TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>                                                        OVER BLACK:
</b>
                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)
                 And today is next Friday...

<b>       SOUNDTRACK!
</b>
       "New Line Cinema presents, etc., etc...

<b>       FADE IN:
</b>
<b>       EXT. LOS ANGELES - EARLY MORNING
</b>
       OPENING CREDITS.  It's early Friday morning and the sun peeks
       over the LA skyline.  As the city starts to awake and the
       credits continue to roll;
       we see SEVERAL SHOTS of the real people who make up Los
       Angeles.  It seems that they all move to the same beat.

<b>       EXT. L.A. COUNTY JAIL - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Debo is released from the Twin Towers County Jail.  Still in
       his orange jumpsuit, he walks right past us and down the
       street.  Everybody clears his path.

       SOUNDTRACK still PUMPIN'.

       Debo crosses the street passing an old man dancing and
       directing traffic.  Debo stops, the man starts to dance in
       front of him.  He stares for a second, then he's on his way.

       Still walking tall and hard, he trips over a crack in the
       sidewalk (losing cool points).

       Three little black girls in plaid uniforms practice the
       latest dance steps on their way to school.  Debo is walking
       towards them.  They scream and take off in the other
       direction.  He smiles.  Briefly.

       Still walking; he stops at a corner.  A SA boy waits to cross
       with his low-rider bike.  A Metrolink train passes.  After it
       goes by; we see Debo riding off on the boy's bike.  He's on
       the ground holding his eye.

       Debo continues to ride through the city.

       He turns a corner or two and comes to a stop at Craig's
       house.

<b>       EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Mr. Jones' dog catcher's truck sits in front of the house.

       A CHIHUAHUA (like the Taco Bell dog) takes a dump on the
       lawn.  It starts to BARK at Debo.  He looks down at the dog
       and kicks him in the street.  The DOG YIPES!

       Debo focuses his attention on Craig's house.

<b>       INT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       The hallway is clear and quiet, until MR. JONES (Craig's
       father), storms out of the bedroom.  He struggles to put on
       his dog catcher's uniform.  He stops at the bathroom door and
       knocks hard.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Craig!  Craig!  Off yo' ass and on yo'
                 feet; this ain't the time to beat your
                 meat!

       Mr. Jones laughs at himself.

<b>                           CRAIG (O.S.)
</b>                 I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta
                 hit the high-way!

       Mr. Jones continues on his way; dancing to the beat.

<b>       INT. BATHROOM - CLOSE-UP ON HIGH TIMES MAGAZINE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Hands crack open a $20 sack of bud onto the magazine.  A pack
       of Zigzags fall INTO FRAME.  Papers are ripped from the
       package.

<b>       CLOSE UP ON CRAIG JONES
</b>
       the doctor of this delicate operation.

<b>                           CRAIG (V.O.)
</b>                 Soon as my pops found out what Debo said
                 to Ezal, he wanted me to move with my
                 uncle and little cousin in Rancho
                 Cucamonga.  Til' things calm down, or
                 Debo went back to prison.  Whichever
                 comes first.

       He's sitting on the toilet (dressed: not using it) putting
       the finishing touches on his masterpiece.  He licks, rolls
       and slides the 'J into the fifth pocket on his Levi jeans.

                           CRAIG (cont'd) (V.O.)
                 I feel like the biggest punk around here.
                 I wiped Debo's ass.  He should be the one
                 moving.

       He exits.

<b>       EXT. JONES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       The front door opens.  Mr. Jones walks out the door, yelling
       back into the house.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Craig!  Let's go!  I don't wanna hit that
                 traffic.

       He steps off the porch backwards and into "fresh Chihuahua
       shit."  He slips and falls on the grass.

                           MR. JONES (cont'd)
                 I be got damn.

       Mr. Jones gets up.  He brushes the grass off his uniform.  He
       looks clean, but when he turns around dog shit is smashed all
       over his back and butt.

                           MR. JONES (cont'd)
                 Craig!  Craig!

       Craig emerges from the house with his bags in hand.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                     (irritated)
                 Here I come!

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                     (still mad)
                 Well bring yo' ass on...

       Craig slams the door and starts towards the truck.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What's the matter?

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!

       Mr. Jones gets in the truck.  Craig jumps in.  They back out
       and pull off.

<b>       INT. DOG TRUCK - MOVING - CLOSE-UP ON CRAIG - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       He's daydreaming about Smokey.

<b>                           CRAIG (V.O.)
</b>                 I didn't wanna leave my neighborhood at
                 all.  Especially my homeboy Smokey.  But
                 he went to rehab last week.  I know I'mma
                 miss him...

       Out of nowhere, Debo jumps in front of the truck.  Mr. Jones
       slams on the BRAKES.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 Craig!  Get out the car, boy!  This the
                 rematch!

       Debo reaches for his shank.  Craig turns to Mr. Jones!

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Daddy, punch it!

       Mr. Jones floors it and hits Debo.  He falls over the hood,
       off the car and in the street.  The yellow truck speeds off.

       Debo jumps up staggering with scrapes and bruises.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 You know I'mma find you!  You can run ya'
                 can't hide!

<b>       BACK IN CAR - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Craig screams out the window.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 You fake ass Suge Knight!

       Mr. Jones is a bit shaken up.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 That nigga worst than them damn pit
                 bulldogs or something!  That's why moving
                 wit'cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin Day-Day is
                 the best thing for you right now.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                     (with attitude)
                 Ya'll making me look like a punk.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 It ain't about being a punk, son.  It's
                 about this...

       Craig smells something in the air.

                           MR. JONES (cont'd)
                 My great, great grand daddy on my Momma
                 side; had a saying... 'See a fool --
                 leave a fool.'  Somebody else a get him.
                 Plus, I don't want that fool shooting at
                 my house trying to hit yo' ass.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What's that smell?

       Mr. Jones sniffs.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Must be your upper lip, 'cause I don't
                 smell nothing.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                     (holding his nose)
                 I do.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 What it smell like?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.

       Mr. Jones grabs the air freshener from under the seat.  He
       starts to spray too much.  Craig's window won't roll down.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 What's wrong with the window?

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 I gotta get'em fixed.  They don't roll
                 down.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 All damn.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Just hold your breath.

<b>       EXT. CITY OF RANCHO CUCAMONGA - MORNING
</b>
       They exit the freeway and pass a sign that reads, "Rancho
       Cucamonga" (the city away from the city).

<b>       EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Welcome to the suburbs.  Where the "Smiley Happy People" live
       in peace and quiet.

       The neighborhood is full of green lawns and nice two story
       track homes as far as the eye can see.  The yellow truck
       drives through the streets and pulls up to a cul-de-sac.  Mr.
       Jones BLOWS the HORN.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Nice neighborhood, huh?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 It's alright.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass
                 brother hits the lotto his first time
                 playing.  I still can't figure that one
                 out.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Why they got to have the loudest house on
                 the block!

       Uncle Elroy's house is royal blue with gold trim.  All the
       other houses are painted in earth tones.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Ah, son, don't be no hater.  You know
                 your uncle ain't got no taste.  Just
                 don't let him rub off on you.

       Craig grabs his bags.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 You coming in?

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna
                 hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me,
                 Craig.  It's gonna be different living
                 over here.  Don't let your uncle and your
                 cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Hey, Pops, I'm grown.  Can't nobody get
                 me in trouble no more.

       As craig gets out;  the front door flies open.  It's DAY-DAY
       (22), Craig's crazy younger cousin.  He yells back into the
       house.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Daddy, Craig is here.

       Day-Day walks out to the car and gives Craig a pound.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What's crackin'?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 You.  Hi, Uncle Willie.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Hey, Day-Day.  Where's yo' big head
                 father?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 There he is.

       Just then, UNCLE ELROY (42) hits the door.  Dressed in boxers
       and a T-shirt.  This is Mr. Jones' (very loud) little
       brother.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass-
                 whippin'?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Naw, it ain't like that.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 If you see that boy again, bite off his
                 ear off like Mike Tyson.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Alright, I'll remember that.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 You know me?  I would've shot his big
                 ass.
                     (peeking into the ear)
                 Hey, Willie, how's it going?  Still
                 steppin' in dog shit every day?

       Uncle Elroy laughs.  Mr. Jones isn't amused.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Make sure you look after my son out here.
                 Don't get him involved with none of your
                 bullshit, Roy.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He
                 in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho
                 Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you
                 just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't
                 that right, nephew?

       Uncle Elroy hugs Craig by the arm.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Craig, remember what I told you.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I'll remember.

       Mr. Jones pulls off.  Uncle Elroy yells out to him.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Send Betty my love.
                     (to Craig)
                 Boy you looking good.
                     (grabbing his bags)
                 I'mma take these in the house for you,
                 man... and when you finish with this cat,
                 come inside.  I got something to show
                 you.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Thanks, Unc.

       Uncle Elroy starts towards to the house.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 You know it's been over a year since we
                 kicked it last?  Up at the family
                 reunion.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I know, that's when Uncle Elroy cussed
                 out everybody, and threw up in Aunt
                 Faye's backseat.

       Day-Day laughs.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out
                 everybody.  Damn that was fun.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I know, we had a good time.  But ever
                 since you guys moved out here, it seems
                 like we've lost touch.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 I know; this a long way from Watts.  But
                 what I like about living out here is that
                 you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens,
                 no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace
                 and quiet.  Listen.

       They do.  It is quiet, except for a few BIRDS SINGING.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 Shit sound good, huh?

       Just then, a maroon Cadillac low-rider on Daytons rolls up
       the block.  It's the Jokers: JOKER (28), LI'L JOKER (21) and
       BABY JOKER (15).  They pull into their driveway.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 Aw damn.

       In SLOW MOTION: One by one they get out the car.  They have a
       dog with them named "Cheeco."  As they get to the front door
       they all look over at Craig and Day-Day.

       Day-Day looks away, while Craig keeps his eye on them.  They
       disappear inside.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Who is that?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l
                 Joker, he just got out of Youth
                 Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got
                 out of Juvenile Hall.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 They ever let you hit the switches on
                 that Cadillac?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially
                 that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little
                 ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something
                 better than a Cadillac.

       They walk over to his black BMW 325i on chrome rims.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 This you?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                     (proud)
                 Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin'
                 somethin' I picked up.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Must be nice.  I wish we won the lottery.
                 Come up on a million dollars like ya'll.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying
                 off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end
                 up with a million.  We bought this house
                 and I spent the rest on this.  It's the
                 bomb, huh?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 This my baby.  I feel like a new nigga in
                 this car.  I get mo' phone numbers
                 rollin' this, than I ever did on the bus.

<b>                           MISS HO KYM (O.S.)
</b>                 Hi, Day-Day!

       They turn to spot MISS HO KYM (67), the old Korean lady who
       lives next door.  She's sitting on her porch nursing a cup of
       coffee.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                     (speaking louder and slower)
                 Hi, Mulan.

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 Fuck you, Day-Day.  Who's ya boy?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 This my cousin, Craig.  He just moved out
                 here from L.A.  Craig, this is Miss Ho.

       Day-Day smiles at Craig.

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 My name is Miss Ho Kym.  Day-Day just
                 trying to be a smart ass.  Nice to meet
                 you, Craig.  Are you 'bout it, 'bout it?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Excuse me?

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it --
                 rowdy, rowdy?

       Craig can't believe his ears.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Yeah, I'm 'bout it.

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day,
                 something is going down with those
                 Mexicans across the street?  I've been
                 seeing a lot of activity.

       They all look over at the Joker's house.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What kind of activity?

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 Strange activity.  I think they running
                 drugs off Tijuana.  Day-Day don't believe
                 me.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

<b>                           MISS HO KYM

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 I don't have time, Miss Ho, I'll see you
                 later.

       Day-Day and Craig start to walk back to the house.

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 See you later, Day-Day.  Come by after

<b>                           CRAIG

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 Peace out, Craig.

<b>       INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Day-Day and Craig enter the house.  They still have the
       furniture from the projects.  Craig looks around.  He spots
       at a few hanging pictures.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Man, this a cool house.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

                 Thanks, I just wish my mother had a
                 chance to see it.

       Mother's picture: she looks like Day-Day with a wig on.
       She's smiling and holding the winning lotto ticket.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 But when she found out we won the money,
                 she had a heart attack.  You know the
                 story.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Yeah.

       A sad moment.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

<b>                           CRAIG

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Pinky's Records and Disc in the shopping
                 center.  I'mma talk to my boss and see if
                 he got a little position for you.  'Cause
                 you been unemployed for a long time now,
                 Craig.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Thanks for reminding me.

       Day-Day exits.  Craig is left to look around, until something
       outside catches his eye.

<b>       EXT. HOUSE
</b>
       It's D'WANA (20), Day-Day's six-month pregnant girlfriend.
       She's walking on the right side of his BMW.  With one hand
       she waves at Craig...with the other hand she's keying Day-
       Day's car with the skills of a retarded first-grader.

<b>       INT. HOUSE
</b>
       Craig waves back, but something ain't right.  Uncle Elroy
       steps in with SUGA (39), his nymphomaniac girlfriend.  She's
       wearing a sexy nightie that's a size too small.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Craig, I want you to meet my old lady,

<b>                           SUGA
</b>                 Oooh, ba-by!

       She gives Craig a big, juicy hug and kiss, grabbing his ass
       in the process.

                           SUGA (cont'd)
                     (hugging and grabbing)
                 You even cuter than your baby pictures.

<b>                           CRAIG

<b>                           CRAIG

       Suga walks out.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Man, that girl's gonna kill me one day.
                 Viagra ain't working.  My back keep going
                 out... she don't never get enough.  But
                 check this out.  I got to lay some ground
                 rules.
                     (gets closer to Craig)
                 Your my family and I love you.  You're
                 welcome to anything you want in my home.
                 But I don't wanna catch you in the
                 refrigerator or in my Suga bowl... you
                 feel me knocking?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Yeah.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Well, let me in.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's
                 car?

       He looks.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Oh, that's D'Wana.  His ex.
                     (yelling upstairs)
                 Day-Day, the crazy bitch is back!

       Day-Day runs down the stairs to get a look.  He's holding a
       piece of paper.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Aw, naw.

       He runs out the door.

<b>       EXT. HOUSE
</b>
       D'Wana continues her job.  Day-Day storms over, waving the
       paper.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Girl, you supposed to be 1000 feet from
                 my house.  What you doing over here?

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 What it look like I'm doing?  You can't
                 quit me, I'm pregnant!

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 That ain't my baby!

       Day-Day spots the damage.  He loses it.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                     (in disbelief)
                 Oh, my God!  What you doing?!

       Now he's a madman.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 Bitch!  You keyed my car!  I'mma kill
                 you!

       Day-Day charges D'Wana.  She has her pepper spray ready.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 I got your bitch right here.

       D'Wana sprays his face orange.  He stops in his tracks; grabs
       his eyes and screams like a woman.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Awwwww....
                     (staggering)
                 Awwwww....

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 I expect you to return all phone calls
                 and take me to lunch today.  I'll be back
                 out here on my break.  Nobody quits me.

       D'Wana runs to her car.  She speeds off.  Uncle Elroy goes
       for the water hose.  Craig grabs Day-Day.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 I can't see!  I can't see!  Daddy!

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Lay down, Day-Day.  Stop moving.

       Craig puts him on the grass.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper-
                 sprayed me!

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I know, be still.

       Before he can say another word, Uncle Elroy nearly drowns him
       with the water hose.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Boy, you got you a little fatal
                 attraction, huh?  I had two or three of
                 them in my day.

       Day-Day is drowning.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                 Craig, I hope you know how to deal with
                 women better than this fool.

       Craig moves the hose.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 That's too much water.

       Now Day-Day is blind and choking.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Help him to his feet.  Let's get him to
                 the bathroom.

       They get him up and into the house.

<b>       INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       They rush Day-Day into the shower.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                     (confused)
                 Hold on.  What you doing?

       Uncle Elroy turns on the cold water.  Day-Day screams.  He
       tries to get out.  They push him back in.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for
                 about 20 minutes.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 20 minutes?

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Yeah, 20 minutes.  Trust me.  I've been
                 pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.

       Uncle Elroy slams the door.  Day-Day stands in the shower
       fully dressed and soaking wet.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                 Let me show you my back yard.  You know
                 it's bigger than y'all back yard.

       They exit, leaving Day-Day in the shower.

<b>       EXT. ELROY'S BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Uncle Elroy and Craig start to walk around the back yard.  In
       the B.G., we NOTICE giant weed plants everywhere.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Yeah, you gotta have a little money to
                 live out here, Craig.  I never thought
                 I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the
                 suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check,
                 I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars
                 cash on this house.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 You paid cash?

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me
                 with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for
                 suckas.  They got my daddy like that for
                 a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only
                 house on the block that's paid for.
                 That's why I'm the king around here.

       They walk over to the pool.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                 You like that pool?

       It's half-full with dirty water.  An upside-down lawn chair
       floats in it.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 It's cool, but where's the water?

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Don't need water.  We didn't have no pool
                 in the projects...so none of us swim.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Y'all never use it?

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Never...
                     (humping the air)
                 But me and Suga can get real nasty in
                 that Jacuzzi, though.

       The Jacuzzi water has a purple condom floating in it.  Uncle
       Elroy reaches over and picks it out.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                     (shaking the water off the
                      condom)
                 You welcome get in it anytime you want
                 to.  Shit, you my brother's son.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Good.

<b>       EXT. CRACK HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
       A run-down crack house sits alone in the middle of the block.
       It looks deserted with chipped paint, overgrown grass and
       security bars everywhere.  Inside we can hear a FIGHT in
       progress.

<b>                           CRACK DEALER (O.S.)
</b>                 Ezal, I'm sick of you coming around here
                 wit no money.

       Suddenly the door flies open and Ezal comes flying out on his
       ass.

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 I be damned.

       He gets up and brushes himself off.  He heads back into the
       crack house.

                           EZAL (cont'd)
                 Now look here, man.  I'mma preferred
                 customer and I can take my credit card
                 somewhere else.

       SMACK!  SMACK!  SMACK!  Ezal is roughed up some more and
       flies through the picture window.  GLASS rains down.

                           EZAL (cont'd)
                 Oh, my neck, oh, my back.  Man, I quit!
                 I'm retired!  Officially!  Life shouldn't
                 be this hard for a crackhead!

       Ezal lays there in pain.  Out of nowhere, a bicycle comes
       INTO FRAME.  Ezal looks up at the rider.  It's Debo.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 Where did Craig move to?

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 I don't know, Debo.

       Debo rolls on top of him with the front tire.  Ezal is
       smashed and in more pain.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 What you say?

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                     (hurting)
                 He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his
                 cousin Day-Day.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 Rancho Cucamonga?

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 Yeah.

       Debo thinks about it.

                           EZAL (cont'd)
                 I can't breathe.

       He rolls off of Ezal.  Relief.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 Get on.

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on
                 that.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 Get on!

       Ezal hops on the handlebars quick.  They start to ride off.

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 Just don't go over the curb.

       Debo rides over the curb and into the street.  The journey
       begins.

                           EZAL (cont'd)
                 Watch my balls!

<b>       INT. DAY-DAY'S ROOM - MORNING
</b>
       Day-Day's room is junky.  Clothes are everywhere.  He's
       putting on his Pinky's Records and Disc T-shirt.  Craig comes
       in.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 You straight?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still
                 orange to you?

       Day-Day's face looks sunburned.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Just a little.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 I can't taste nothing.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What's the matter with your girlfriend?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana
                 three months ago.  She had a little pudge
                 in her stomach but I didn't pay it no
                 attention.  Come to find out, she six
                 months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago
                 and she's been harassing me ever since.
                 She don't care about the restraining
                 order or nothing.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Restraining order?  Where the hell you
                 meet this girl?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 I went back to Watts to sell my old car
                 and met her on the way.  Worst day of my
                 life.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Damn, you got a stalker.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 That ain't the worst part.  Her little
                 sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets
                 real physical.  But I got a restraining
                 order on her, too.

<b>                           CRAIG

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                     (very serious)
                 You don't know Baby D.

       He looks at his watch.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 I gotta get to Pinky's before I get fired
                 like you.

       Day-Day exits.  Craig is close behind.

<b>       EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       As they walk out the front door, someone catches Craig's eye.
       It's KARLA (23), the Joker brothers' fine sister.  She's
       leaning against the lowrider, looking into her purse.  She
       waves at them.

<b>                           KARLA

       Craig and Day-Day are mesmerized.

<b>                           BOTH
</b>                     (waving back)
<b>                 HEY!

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 That's the sister.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Yo know what?  I'm starting to like
                 Rancho Cucamonga.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the
                 same thing.  But it can't happen.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Why?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Because, it's been a little tension
                 between us ever since they got out the
                 joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm
                 just trying to keep the peace.  We moved
                 out here to get away from that shit.

       Day-Day walks over to his Beamer.  Craig follows.

<b>       CLOSE-UP
</b>
       Big scratch on the side of Day-Day's car.

                 It ain't that bad, is it?

       Craig is still looking at Karla.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 Craig!  It ain't that bad, is it?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Yeah, it's bad.  And that scratch make it
                 ugly.

       Day-Day is starting to get mad.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 It's long and crooked...make you not

</b>                 Alright, alright... I see what you
                 talking about.

       Karla looks at her watch and starts to walk up the street.
       This is Craig's chance.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Hold up, Day-Day.

       He trots after her.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Let it go.

       Karla is still walking.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Hey!  Hey!

       She stops and waits for him.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 I'm Day-Day's cousin, Craig.  What's your
                 name?

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 Karla.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty
                 good together.  Where you going?

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 To the Cucamonga shopping center.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Oh yeah, why you walking?

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 My brothers won't give me a ride.

       Day-Day is about to have a heart attack.  He's looking back
       and forth between Craig and Karla, and the Joker's house
       where somebody is looking out the window.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

                 Just get the number and come on.  Just
                 get the number and come on.

       Back at the "Love Connection," Craig has Karla smiling.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 You want us to give you a ride?

<b>                           KARLA

</b>                 What you mean, you don't know?  Just wait
                 here.

       Craig starts to trot over towards Day-Day.  Day-Day is
       frantically waving Craig to hurry.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 What are you worried about?

       Day-Day's eyes get as big as golf balls.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Cheeco!

       Craig turns to see the pit bull "Cheeco" running right after
       him.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 Cheeco, no!

       Craig runs right towards Day-Day's BMW.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Oh shit, jump!

       They both jump on top of Day-Day's BMW with CHEECO coming up
       fast.  He's BARKING viciously.

<b>       ACROSS STREET
</b>
       Joker, Li'l Joker and Baby Joker are across the street
       laughing.  Karla is embarrassed.

<b>       ON BMW
</b>
       Craig is breathing hard but he's calm, but Day-Day is
       terrified.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 Hey, Joker!  Stop playing, man!  Call the
                 dog back!

       They continue to laugh.  Craig pulls his belt off.  He swings
       it and hits Cheeco in the middle of his forehead with the
       buckle.  The DOG CRIES and runs back across the street.

       The Jokers aren't laughing anymore.  Joker stares at Craig.
       Craig stares back.  You can feel the tension.  Joker kicks
       the dog.

<b>                           JOKER
</b>                 Get yo dumb ass in the back.

       CHEECO HOLLERS.  Craig and Day-Day get off the top of the
<b>       BMW.
</b>
<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Look at my roof.

       Big dents in the roof of his BMW.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 Man, why you do that?  I told you not to
                 talk to that girl.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Why not?  She was cool with it.

       Day-Day gets into the car.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 So.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What you mean, so?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and
                 start a feud, you can always go back to
                 home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember
                 that.

       He slams the door, starts the car and backs up.  Leaving
       Craig standing there.  He sees Karla walking away.  He looks
       over at the Jokers.  They're still staring hard.  Craig just
       looks away and walks into the house.

<b>       INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Craig steps into the house.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Nephew, you got perfect timing...

       Uncle Elroy is sitting on the couch.  He has a Phillies'
       Blunt (cigar) in one hand, a razor blade in the other.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                 We about to start a little puff, puff
                 give in this mothafucka.  Are you down?

       Suga is sippin' on a glass of wine.  She moves over, making
       room in the middle.

<b>                           SUGA
</b>                     (patting the couch)
                 Come on, Craig.  Sit down right here.

       Craig does.  Suga moves closer, boxing him in nice and tight.
       Uncle Elroy licks the cigar.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 I know you smoke weed, right?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Why you say that?

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 'Cause your lips is getting black.

       Uncle Elroy takes the razor and starts to cut the cigar the
       long way.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                 All I smoke is blunts.  Them fuckin'
                 Zigzags don't do nothing for me.

       Uncle Elroy scrapes the cigar shavings into a nearby trash
       can (that's overflowing with cigar shavings already).  Suga
       presses against Craig.

<b>                           SUGA
</b>                 Would you like a glass of wine, baby?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 No thank you. It's too early.

       Uncle Elroy stuffs the open cigar full of weed.  He's
       concentrating.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Boy, I can roll a blunt better than them
                 bitches in Havana.  I know Willie don't
                 let'cha smoke in the house, but I'm ya
                 uncle.  I don't care how high you get in
                 my house.  Long as you let me hit it...

       He licks and rolls.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                 Look at that.

       It's perfect.

<b>                           SUGA
</b>                 Fire it up, Roy.

       Uncle Elroy grabs the lighter.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Now I'mma show you the real "Puff Daddy."

       He lights the blunt.  Craig's watching, so is Suga.  Uncle
       Elroy holds the smoke in for a very long time.  Maybe too
       long...'cause his eyes start to bulge, and he starts to toke
       (cough with your mouth closed).  And toke.  And toke.  And
       toke.  It looks like he's about to bust when he lets out a
       big puff of smoke.  Then he starts to cough, and cough, and
       cough out of control.

       Craig and Suga are amazed at this display.  Uncle Elroy falls
       to the floor on his hands and knees.  Still coughing.  He
       falls on his back and passes the blunt to Craig.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                     (still coughing)
                 It's the Bombay.

       Craig takes the blunt and puts it up to his lips.  He hits
       it, holds it in and looks at Suga.  Suddenly, his eyes bulge
       out and he starts to toke, and toke, and toke, and toke.  He
       starts to cough out of control and he falls next to Uncle
       Elroy who's still coughing.  Craig passes the blunt to Suga,
       who looks at it for a moment and then looks directly INTO the
       CAMERA.  (As if to say, "Shiiiiiiiiiiiit.").

<b>       INT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - 15 MINUTES LATER
</b>
       All three are passed out on the couch.  Uncle Elroy is
       snoring with a little slobber hanging.  Craig's knocked out
       with his mouth open.  Suga's head is not secure and she's
       starting to bob.  She bobs so hard that her head falls in
       Craig's lap.  He wakes up and looks down.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Suga.

       He looks over at Uncle Elroy who's looking over at him.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Negro, what the hell you doing to my

<b>                           CRAIG

                 I don't know!

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Suga!

<b>                           SUGA
</b>                     (face in lap)
                 Huh?

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 What you doing to my nephew?

<b>                           SUGA
</b>                     (lifting her head)
                 Ah, baby...I thought this was you.
                     (to Craig)
                 Craig, what are you doing to me?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I don't know, I think I passed out or
                 something.  I don't remember.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I
                 knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out
                 on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make
                 'em like they used to, baby.

       Uncle Elroy staggers to his feet.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                 Come on, woman.  I'm faded and feeling X-
                 rated.  It's Mr. Nasty time.

<b>                           SUGA

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY

                     (grabbing his back)
                 But take it easy on me, girl.

<b>                           SUGA
</b>                 Craig, you ain't the only lightweight
                 around here.

       Suga takes Elroy's hand.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Make yourself at home.

       They both stumble upstairs leaving Craig all alone.  It's too
       quiet now.  He grabs the remote and TURNS ON the TV.  Flicks
       a few channels.  He picks up the blunt and the lighter.

<b>       ON TV

       A public service announcement from King/Drew Rehab Center.

                 It's too hard to stop everything all at

                 but not drank.  And other days you can
                 drank, but not smoke.  And if you're
                 really making progress, the nurses will
                 get fucked up wit you.  Helping you kick

                 man!

<b>       BACK ON COUCH
</b>
       Craig is high.  He's looking at the TV with a slight smile on
       his face.  It seems like the walls are shaking.  He looks
       over at Suga's glass and her wine is vibrating, like Jurassic
       Park.  Plaster falls from the ceiling.  He listens, it's
       Uncle Elroy and Suga making love.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY (O.S.)
</b>                 Oh, baby, right there.  Right

                 Bite it!  Yeah, mothafucka -- yeah, come
                 on, baby, get busy...

       His eavesdropping is interrupted by a loud KNOCK on the door.
       Craig is so comfortable, he doesn't want to move.  The
       KNOCKING gets LOUDER.

<b>                           DELIVERY GUY (O.S.)

       Craig gets up slowly and starts to clean the area.  The

                 hot out here.

       Craig stops what he's doing and swings the door open.

<b>       ON PORCH

       The DELIVERY GUY, a thirtysomething asshole with tight shorts
       and a buzz cut, is looking into the house.

                 Remember what happen to O.J... what team

                 certified mail delivery.

       He hands Craig a letter.

       Craig signs.

       He laughs and walks off singing the "Good Times" jingle.

                           DELIVERY GUY (cont'd)
                 '...temporary layoffs?  Good

                 shit!

       Cheeco starts to chase him down the street.  Craig looks at
       the notice.  "DELINQUENT! YOUR HOUSE WILL BE SEIZED AND
<b>       AUCTIONED -- TOMORROW AT 9AM  PAY TODAY!"
</b>
<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Oh damn.

       He SLAMS the DOOR.  We FOLLOW Craig upstairs TO Uncle Elroy's
       room.  He knocks softly.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 Uncle Elroy?

       No answer.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 Uncle Elroy, you got a tax notice.

       Still no answer.  He turns the knob.  It's open.

<b>       INT. UNCLE ELROY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Craig steps into Uncle Elroy's freak palace.  Black lights,
       candles, velvet posters - the works.  There's even a leather
       fuck swing hanging from the ceiling.  Uncle Elroy and Suga
       are asleep in a leopard-skin waterbed.  Craig is amazed.  He
       slowly walks over to the bed.  Uncle Elroy is calling the
       hogs.  Snoring.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                     (whispering)
                 Uncle Elroy...Uncle Elroy?

       He's about to shake him when Uncle Elroy lets out a big
       grunt.  It startles Craig.  He looks over at Suga.  She's
       completely under the covers.  Uncle Elroy rolls over on his
       stomach, then he rolls on his back again.  Craig shakes him.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 Uncle Elroy, wake up.  You got a letter
                 today.

       No response.  Craig tries again.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 Unc.

       Uncle Elroy jumps up like a hibernating grizzly.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY

                 Come on here, Suga...

       He goes after Craig, who has to fight him off.

                           UNCLE ELROY (cont'd)
                 I like it rough now.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Naw, naw!  Unc, wake up!  It's me!  Wake
                 up!

       Uncle Elroy grabs him in a bear hug and slams him on the bed.

       Craig finds himself caught between Suga and Uncle Elroy, but
       now everything is totally still and quiet.  Uncle Elroy
       starts to snore again.  He's asleep.  The coast is clear now.
       Craig tries to make his escape.  He crawls over Suga to get
       away.  She grabs him and starts to kiss him.

<b>                           SUGA
</b>                     (half asleep)
                 Ohhh, baby!

       Craig breaks away and tries to hurry out the room.  On his
       exit, he hangs himself on the "fuck swing" and hits the floor
       with a thud.  He scrambles to his feet, then he's out of
       there.  Uncle Elroy and Suga lay asleep as if nothing ever
       happened.

<b>       IN HALLWAY
</b>
       Craig tries to gain his composure.  He gets an idea.

       Debo keeps riding.

                 Debo!  Debo!  Now you stuck on stupid.

       He finally stops at a pay phone.  Ezal jumps off and grabs
       his ass.

                           EZAL (cont'd)
                 My God...gotta walk it out, walk it out.
                 Man, it's gonna take us a week to ride

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 What urgent message?

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 That ain't gonna work.

       Debo slaps him in the back of the head.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 Just do it.

<b>                           EZAL

       Smack!  Debo slaps him again.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 It's on the outside of the building, now

       Ezal picks up the phone.  He starts to dial.

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 Hello...Yeah, I got an urgent message for

       Debo slaps him again.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 William.

                 quick.  Don't try to call.

       Ezal hangs up the phone.

                 Man, you better stop hittin' on me for I

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 Let's go.

       Debo and Ezal run across the street to the dog truck.  Debo
       opens the back and lets all the dogs out.  They run for it.

                           DEBO (cont'd)
                 After I get in, close the door.

       Debo is a hard fit.  Ezal stuffs him in there.

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 You too big.

<b>                           DEBO
</b>                 Keep pushing.

       Finally he's in.  Ezal gets in and slams the door shut.  Just
       then, Mr. Jones comes running out the joint with a sandwich
       in hand.

<b>                           MR. JONES

       Everything is pink inside this mom and pop record store.  The

       with bags.

       Day-Day is scanning inventory.  A bud-head by the name of
       ROACH is on top of the counter with his skateboard.

<b>                           ROACH

       He tries to jump off the counter and land perfectly on his
       board.  Wrong!  Off the board and on his ass.

                 I thought that was it.

       An unhappy CUSTOMER walks in holding a CD without the cover.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 Craig, go out there and tell 'em I'm
                 gone.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I ain't trying to get in it.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 You already in.

       The knocking gets louder.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 No I'm not.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 I'll do it.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 No.  You can't handle a girl like D'Wana.
                 It's got to be Craig.

<b>       AT FRONT DOOR
</b>
       They observe the "Yes We're Open" sign.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 That white boy said he was in there.

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 Day-Day, don't make me break this window!

       Craig is peeking out.  He hesitates.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Watch out for Baby'D.

       Craig walks out the back.  He steps over the door.  Unlocks
       it, and cracks it open.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Day-Day ain't here.

       They don't believe him.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 Who are you?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I'm his cousin.

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 You suppose to work here now or
                 something?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Yeah, I work here now.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 We didn't come here for Day-Day.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Yes you did.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 No we didn't.  We came to buy a CD.

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 Now move.

       Baby'D kicks the door.  Craig has no choice but to let 'em
       in.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was
                 here?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I don't know... I think he went out the
                 back.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 Can I look for myself?

       Suddenly Roach is pushed into the front area.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Hey, ladies.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 Where's Day-Day?

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 I don't know, he must've left.

       D'Wana looks at Baby'D.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I thought ya'll wanted to buy a CD?

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 I do... can you help me find the jazz
                 section?

       Craig looks at Roach for directions.  He nods over towards
       the front of the store.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Right this way.  You know damn well you
                 don't listen to no jazz.

       Baby'D checks out Craig as he leads the way.  D'Wana looks
       around.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 If Day-Day comes back, tell him I came by
                 and need to see him.  Lamaze classes are
                 Wednesday.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Will do.

       D'Wana starts to walk towards Craig and Baby'D.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 Come on, 'D, let's go.

       But first she doubles back towards the storage room.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Where you going?

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta
                 pee.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Yeah.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 Thank you.

       As she's walking in the back, Roach realizes his mistake.

</b>
<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Shit.

       Day-Day makes a run for it.  She spots him ducking out the
       back door.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 He's in there!

<b>       INSIDE STORE
</b>
       Baby'D knocks Craig out of the way.

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 Where is he?

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 He ran out the door.

       Baby'D gives chase with D'Wana, Craig and Roach close behind.

<b>       EXT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Day-Day runs around the side of Pinky's Records store.  He
       stops to see if anyone is coming.  It's Baby'D with the three
       others trailing.  Baby'D is chasing Day-Day all through the
       parking lot.  Craig, D'Wana and Roach stop to watch.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Haul ass, dude.  Don't stop.

       ...and he is.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 You better stop running from that girl.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Fuuuuuuck -- U!

       He runs back towards his BMW.  The chase continues around his
       car.  Baby'D is starting to tire.

                           DAY-DAY (cont'd)
                 I'mma shoot yo' big ass.

       D'Wana watches from a distance.  Craig and Roach are close.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                     (smiling)
                 She moves well for a big girl.

       Just then, out of nowhere, Karla appears behind them carrying
       a couple of bags.  She taps Craig on his shoulder.  He turns
       around.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 Hello, remember me?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Hell yeah, I remember you.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 I'm sorry for what my brother did this
                 morning.  They're assholes.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize
                 for your brothers.  They're big boys.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 I just wanted to give you this.

       She hands him a card with her number on it.

                           KARLA (cont'd)
                 If my brothers wasn't so over-protective,
                 I'd have you call the house.  But for now
                 just page me when you get a chance.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Most definitely.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 Better sooner than later.

       She picks up her shopping bags and walks away.  Over at the
       chase: Baby'D is winded.  She bends over trying to catch her
       breath.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Baby'D, you're not going to catch me as
                 usual.  So what can we do to end it this
                 time?  What you want?  Another Big Pun
                 CD?  'Cause I gotta get back to work.

       Baby'D looks over at Craig.

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 Okay, I know what I want this time.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Anything you need.

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 That's it?

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 Just tell him to come over here and talk
                 to me.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 And I can go free?

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 Go, fo' I change my mind.

       Day-Day carefully walks back over towards the store.  D'Wana
       pouts and walks towards Baby'D.  (If looks could kill.)

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Great moves, Day-Day.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What happen?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 We worked out a deal.  All you gotta do
                 is go over there and talk to Baby'D.

       Craig looks over at Baby'D.  She's waiting.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What you mean talk to her?

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                     (still smiling)
                 You know what he mean, dude.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I'm gone.

       Craig turns and sprints into the store.  Baby'D looks
       concerned.  Day-Day grabs Roach and they run into the store.

<b>                           BABY'D
</b>                 I'mma get you, Day-Day!  You gotta come

       D'Wana hands her a brick.

<b>                           D'WANA
</b>                 I told you.

       Baby'D screams and throws the brick through Day-Day's

       Day-Day is devastated.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Thanks a lot, Craig.

<b>                           CRAIG

       Day-Day starts to walk into the back storage area.

                           ROACH (cont'd)
                 Shouldn't we straighten up out here
                 before Pinky gets back?

       Day-Day is like a zombie now.  He doesn't answer, just keeps
       walking.

<b>                           CRAIG

       No answer.  Craig looks at Roach.  They follow.

       Day-Day sits with the notice in hand.

                 I know how you feeling.  And if I had my

                 No lungs.  All I got is this.

       Roach pulls out a big, smashed brownie with green shit in it.

<b>                           CRAIG

       Day-Day shakes his head.  Craig reaches into his fifth
       pocket.

       Roach snatches it.

</b>                 You better open up a window or something
                 before the smell gets out.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 I got an idea.

       He hands the joint to Craig.  Gets up and closes the door.
       Then he grabs the vacuum out of the corner.

                           ROACH (cont'd)
                 This is a little theory of mine... it
                 should work.

       He plugs in the VACUUM and TURNS it ON.  He puts the nozzle
       in Day-Day's face.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Blow.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 That ain't gonna work.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Fuck yeah.

       Day-Day hits the 'J and blows into the nozzle.  It quickly
       sucks up the smoke.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                     (passing the 'J)
                 It works.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Still gonna smell it.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 No way.  Watch this.

       Roach hits the joint harder than anyone else.  Smoke starts
       to come out of his ears.  Craig and Day-Day get a kick out of
       that.

<b>       EXT. PINKY'S RECORDS AND DISC - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       A pink limo pulls to a stop.  The chauffeur gets out wearing
       his suit just a little too tight.  He opens the door and a
       pair of pink boots hit the pavement.  The CAMERA PANS UP TO
       PINKY (35), the asshole owner.

<b>                           PINKY
</b>                 Look, man, you hittin' them goddamn
                 corners too fast.  Slow down.  I almost
                 spilled my Hennessy on this 300 dollar
                 suit.

       He walks over to the door.  He thinks it's open.  It's not.

                           PINKY (cont'd)
                 I be damn.

       He shakes the door.  It's locked.  He looks inside.  No one's
       at the counter.  Cassettes all over the floor.  Pinky looks
       around making sure no one sneaks up on him.  He reaches under
       his shirt and pulls out a Glock 9mm.  Sticks his key in the
       door and steps in.

       A big cloud of smoke rolls out of his mouth and he falls and
       hits the deck.

                           ROACH (cont'd)
                 My spleen.

       Craig and Day-Day laugh at Roach.  The VACUUM is still GOING
       but the room is very smoky.  Craig jumps in.

<b>                           CRAIG

                 This vacuum don't work.  Where's the

</b>                 I thought the vacuum would work.

<b>       IN HALLWAY
</b>
       Craig makes a left and grabs the knob.  He feels something
       pressing on the back of his head (gun).

<b>                           PINKY
</b>                     (whispering)
                 Don't move or I'll blow your head smooth
                 off.

       Craig throws his hands up.

                           PINKY (cont'd)
                 Now back up slowly... and don't say a
                 word.

       He obeys.  Pinky backs Craig into the store.

                           PINKY (cont'd)
                 Get on the floor.

       Craig gets down.

                           PINKY (cont'd)
                 Little mothafucka trying to rob me.
                 I'mma show you how I do 'em.

                 not playing!

       Pinky starts to pat down Craig's pockets.

                           PINKY (cont'd)
                 You ain't got no gun, but where's the
                 weed at?  I smell it.

       Craig says nothing.

                           PINKY (cont'd)
                 I'mma tie you ass up!

       Pinky backs up and steps on Roach's skateboard.  The gun goes
       flying and so does he.  Pinky falls on his ass.  The 9mm
       lands in front of Craig.  There's a big scramble for the gun.

       Day-Day gives Roach the evil-eye.

                 out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky
                 gets here.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Maybe you can ask him to loan you the

</b>                 I know.

<b>       BACK INSIDE STORE
</b>
       Pinky and Craig are still scrambling for the gun.  The store
       looks like a tornado hit it.  Twice.  Craig comes up with the
       pistol.  Pinky jumps on the ground.

<b>                           PINKY
</b>                 Don't kill me.

       Craig is exhausted.  He stands over Pinky with the gun.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass

       Just then, Day-Day and Roach come from the back.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

<b>                           PINKY

       He looks up at Craig.

                           PINKY (cont'd)
                 And you...you lucky.  I was just about to
                 get in yo' ass.  Now give me my pistol
                 back and get the hell out my store.

       Craig looks at Day-Day.  Day-Day looks back at him.  Nobody's
       high now.

</b>                 In a strange way, I feel responsible for

       Uncle Elroy opens his bedroom door wearing a S&amp;M mask and

       The dog truck exits the freeway.  He pulls into a gas station
       by the freeway.  He stops near the restrooms and jumps out,
       air freshner in hand.  When he gets to the door, it's locked.

       He attempts to jump off the porch with his board and lands
       dead on his ass once again.  His board continues to roll.

       His board continues to roll into the street.  At this same
       time, Joker's low-rider rolls by and breaks his board in two.
       Roach runs to pick up the pieces.

<b>                           ROACH

       The Joker Bros. back their low-rider into the driveway.  They
       have no sympathy.  Cheeco (the pitbull) is in the back yard.
       He's happy to see them.

       They stroll into the house with three Mexican girls with
       them.  Joker spots our trio looking.

       They disappear into the house.

       Craig has a twinkle in his eyes and Roach walks over, pissed.

       Craig is looking over at the Joker's house.  Baby Joker walks
       out the front door.  He walks over to the rider and POPS the

</b>
<b>                           CRAIG

       Baby Joker pulls out a chrome hydraulic pump.  He carries it
       towards the house.  Cheeco starts to hump his leg.

<b>                           BABY JOKER
</b>                 Get down.

       Baby Joker drops the pump, something falls out.  (We can't
       see what it is.)  Baby Joker quickly puts it back.

<b>       INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT
</b>
       The private party is starting to heat up.  Big Joker sits on
       the couch with a PRETTY YOUNG GIRL on his lap.  He's smoking
       on a perfectly rolled cone joint.  Li'l Joker dances with the
       other girlfriend, as an OLD SCHOOL JAM PLAYS in the B.G.  The
       other senorita is pouring herself a drink.

       Karla walks into the room.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 I thought you were taking me to see Mama?

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 When?  After you get all drunk and
                 loaded?

<b>                           JOKER
</b>                 Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass

                 scaring our company.

       Karla storms out the room.  Baby Joker walks in carrying the
       chrome pump.

                           JOKER (cont'd)
                 Get up.

       The Pretty Girl moves off Joker's lap.

                           JOKER (cont'd)
                 Take it in the room.

       Baby Joker carries the pump in the bedroom.  Joker is close
       behind.  He SLAMS the DOOR.  The Girl dancing with Li'l Joker
       gets too nosy.

<b>                           GIRL #1

<b>                           GIRL #1

<b>       EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Craig, Day-Day and Roach are sneaking across the street
       towards Joker's house.  Craig looks calm.  Day-Day looks
       nervous.  Roach eats on a piece of baloney.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 This ain't gonna work.  I'm going back.

       Day-Day tries to turn around.  Craig grabs him.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 It's about to work, just come on.

</b>                     (about to bite baloney)
                 What about the dog?

       Craig slaps the baloney out of his hand.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 That's what the baloney's for!

       All three kneel down next to a parked car.  Day-Day looks
       sick.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What's the B-G's?

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                     (holding his stomach)
                 The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels
                 like I'mma shit on myself.

<b>                           ROACH

</b>                 Butterflies, my ass.  I'm about to go

       Craig grabs Day-Day again.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Look, Day-Day.  If we don't go over there

                 night you got a home.  Now trust me.

       Day-Day realizes that Craig is right. He takes a deep breath.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 Now all we gotta do is find out where the
                 little one put that pump.  Take it and
                 see what's in it.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 You make it sound so easy.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're
                 not expecting it.
                 Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco.
                 Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a
                 good look.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Well get along with this one.
                     (pushing Roach)
                 Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't
                 let that mutt out of your sight.

<b>                           ROACH

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Cheeco.

       Roach crawls away on his hands and knees.

<b>       EXT. JOKER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
       Roach sneaks past Joker's lowrider.  He slowly approaches the
       fence.  No sign of Cheeco.  Roach opens the pack of baloney
       and pulls out a slice.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                     (nervous whisper)
                 Here, Cheeco.  Chee-co, here boy.  That's
                 a good boy.

       It's pitch-black behind the fence, still no Cheeco.

<b>       PARKED CAR - SAME TIME
</b>
       Craig makes a move.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Come on, he should have'em by now.

       Day-Day follows.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Hurry up.  He didn't have that much
                 baloney.

       They sneak up to the side of the house.  The MUSIC is
       BLEEDING THROUGH the walls.

<b>       INSIDE HOUSE
</b>
       Li'l Joker is dancing with all 3 girls.  They're all getting
       high and feeling good.  One girl has come out of her blouse.
       The others start to follow her lead.

<b>                           LI'L JOKER

                 I'mma get greedy.

<b>       BACK OUTSIDE
</b>
       Craig and Day-Day are peeking through the window.  Craig
       moves on.  Day-Day is still watching.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

                 Look at those tig-ole-bitties

       Craig snatches him from the window.  They walk over to the
       fence.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 You go first.

</b>                 I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little

       Day-Day gets ready to fight.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 What?

       Craig jumps like he's going to hit him.  Day-Day jumps back
       and almost falls.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 I hope to God that dog is happy.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Me too.

<b>       ROACH
</b>
       ...is having no luck.  Cheeco is nowhere to be found.  Roach
       starts to sing.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 My baloney has a first name.  It's C-h-e-
                 e-c-o.

       We hear a MEAN GROWL out of the darkness.  Roach continues.

                           ROACH (cont'd)
                 My baloney has a second name it just like
                 the first Cheeco.

       GROWLING gets LOWDER.

                           ROACH (cont'd)
                 Ooooohhhh I love to eat it everyday if
                 you ask me what I'll say.

       We can hear TINY FOOTSTEPS RUNNING at Roach.

                           ROACH (cont'd)
                 Cheeco's got to be the dumbest fuckin'
                 mutt in the whole wide U.S.A.

       CHEECO is running at Roach full speed.  He jumps on the fence
       and starts to BARK with everything he's got.  Roach drops the
       baloney.

<b>       CRAIG AND DAY-DAY
</b>
       ...hear the DOG BARKING and freeze in their tracks.  Day-Day
       tries to run.  Craig grabs him, again.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Wait.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

                 Wait for what?

       A LOT of BARKING.  Nothing coming.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 He's still over by Roach.

<b>       ROACH
</b>
       ...picks up the baloney and stuffs the whole pack into his
       mouth.  CHEECO is SILENCED.  Roach is relieved.

<b>       INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       The chrome pump is open and filled with money.  Baby Joker's
       pulling out the money while Joker sits on the bed counting
       it.  They stop when they hear CHEECO BARKING.

<b>                           BABY JOKER

<b>                           JOKER
</b>                 No, keep working.

       In the mirror behind Joker, we see a stick slide through the
       curtain.  The curtain cracks just enough to see Craig's eye
       looking in.

       Just then, Li'l Joker bursts through the door with his shirt
       off and two half-naked girls on his arms.

<b>                           LI'L JOKER

<b>                           LI'L JOKER
</b>                 Not until you come party with us, man.

       Baby Joker looks at the girls, then at Joker.

<b>                           JOKER
</b>                 Alright, put it in that drawer.

       Joker hands Baby Joker the money.  He puts it away.  They
       start to exit the room.

<b>       OUTSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Craig is still looking.  Day-Day is scared shitless.  He's
       looking for Cheeco.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

<b>                           CRAIG

       Craig climbs in the window.  Day-Day holds his stomach.

<b>                           DAY-DAY

<b>       ROACH
</b>
       ... his meat supply is almost gone.  He tries to think fast.
       Cheeco starts to look for more meat.  Roach grabs the smashed
       brownie out of his pocket and throws it to Cheeco.  He
       swallows it in one big gulp.  He's looking for more.  There
       is no more.  Roach smiles.  CHEECO GROWLS.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Good boy.  Nice dog.

       CHEECO'S STILL GROWLING.  Suddenly Cheeco falls back on his
       butt and lets out a slight moan.

<b>       CHEECO'S POV
</b>
       Cheeco is looking up at Roach.  He's seeing double, even
       triple.  Cheeco lays down.  It looks like he's faded.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 No lungs, baby.  No lungs.

<b>       INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Craig is in.  The bedroom door is cracked.  Craig walks over
       and shuts the door gently.  He locks it.  Then he creeps over
       to the dresser.  He pulls out the pump and sets it on the
       bed.  He opens it, revealing all the bundled-up money packed
       in.  He starts to stuff it in his pockets.

<b>       OUTSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

       Day-Day is trying to keep his composure.

<b>       INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       The SA brothers are having a good time.  Joker is getting
       nasty with one of the Girls.  He pulls her by the hand.

<b>                           GIRL #2

       Joker picks her up and carries her to the bedroom.  She
       screams.  He laughs.  He goes for the door.  It's locked.

                           JOKER (cont'd)
                 Who locked this door?

       Everybody looks confused.

                 Who locked this fuckin' door?!

       Joker starts to kick the door.

<b>       INSIDE JOKER'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Craig hurries to put the pump back.  He's about to go for the
       window when: BANG!  There's a KICK on the door.  All Craig
       can do is go for another door on the other side of the room.
       BANG!  The door flies open and Craig is out there just in
       time.

<b>                           JOKER

       Joker walks in and hits the lights.  He throws the girl on
       the bed.

<b>                           GIRL #2

<b>       INT. JOKER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Baby Joker has his back turned when we see Craig sprint
       behind him and up the stairs.  Baby Joker turns around.  He
       thinks he saw something.  He slowly starts to walk up the
       stairs.

<b>                           LI'L JOKER
</b>                 Karla!

<b>       INT. KARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Karla is in her room working out.  Craig runs in.  He's
       shocked to see her.  She doesn't see him, but he's frozen.
       Then she turns around and he startles her.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 What are you doing?

       Think fast, Craig.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Huh?

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 What are you doing here?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I

                 ain't scared of yo' punk ass
                 brothers...and you wouldn't have be
                 scared of 'em neither if you had a man

<b>                           KARLA

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Yes I did.  Excuse me.

       Her door flies open.  Smashing Craig behind it.  It's Li'l
       Joker.

<b>                           LI'L JOKER

       Craig looks nervous.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 Nobody.

<b>                           LI'L JOKER
</b>                 I heard a voice.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 No you didn't.  Get out my room.  Go back

       Karla pushes Li'l Joker out.

       She does.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Oh shit.

       Day-Day takes off.  He hops the fence in record speed.

<b>       CHEECO
</b>
       ...is laying on his back looking through the fence.  He's
       calm and cool now.

<b>       OTHER SIDE
</b>
       Roach is on his back looking through the fence.  He hits a
       joint and blows the smoke into Cheeco's face.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 ...like I was saying.  A guy like me, and

                 We need to be in Maui renting jet ski to
                 fat funks in flower shirts.  You feel me,
<b>                 C?
</b>
       Cheeco is passed out.  Day-Day sneaks around the corner.  He
       whispers.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Roach...Roach, come on.

<b>                           ROACH

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 He's inside the house?

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Why did he go in the house?

<b>                           DAY-DAY

                 He's probably getting tied up now.

<b>       INT. KARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Craig is sweating.  Karla is standing in front of him.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 You did all this for me?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Most of it.  I just hate to see you in

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be
                 peaceful before they got out.  Took over
                 the house and caused my mother's nervous
                 breakdown.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Why didn't she put'em out?

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 Easier said than done.  We saved up to

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I'm sorry to hear that.

       Craig walks over to the window.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 Can I get out this way?

       Karla walks up behind him, looking very sexy.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 I thought you came up here to see me.

       Craig turns around.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I did.  Is that door locked?

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 It's locked.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Make sure.

       Karla turns around to check the door.

<b>                           KARLA
</b>                 You so nervous, I already locked this
                 door.

       Craig drops a thick roll of money into her purse.  She shakes
       the knob.

                           KARLA (cont'd)
                 See.  All locked.

       She walks over to him.  They're face-to-face.

                 What's your hurry?

<b>                           CRAIG

                 So what?  Let's make'em wait.

       Craig looks AT the CAMERA.

<b>                           CRAIG

       Day-Day and Roach are at Joker's front door.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 You wanna knock?

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Go for it.

       Day-Day knocks real soft.  Too soft.

                           ROACH (cont'd)
                 No one's gonna hear that.  The music's

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 This is a knock.

       Roach starts to kick on the door with his foot.  It's very
       loud.

<b>       INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Joker storms in with the AK.  Li'l Joker is in the corner
       with his girl, and Baby Joker is on the floor.  Joker TURNS
<b>       DOWN THE STEREO.

<b>                           BABY JOKER
</b>                 Hear what?

       The KNOCKING continues.  Li'l Joker and Baby Joker push the
       girls aside and jump up.  Li'l Joker grabs a big knife.  Baby
       Joker grabs a 9mm.  Joker looks at the girls.

<b>                           JOKER

       They won't.  The brothers run to the door.

<b>       OUTSIDE
</b>
       Roach is still kicking.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 What's wrong with you, fool.  Stop
                 kicking their door.  They might think we
                 the police.

       The front door swings open and before we know it.  Day-Day's
       got an AK pointed in his face, and Roach is looking at a 9
       close up.

<b>                           JOKER
</b>                 What the fuck you want?

       Day-Day's tongue doesn't work.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup

</b>                 Hold on.  A man, you broke my fuckin'
                 board and I don't appreciate it.

       Immediately Day-Day and Roach are snatched inside the house,
       and the door is SLAMMED.

<b>       EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Mr. Jones' dog truck pulls to a stop.  He gets out and runs
       to the house.  He KNOCKS.  Uncle Elroy answers.  Suga is
       looking over his shoulder.

<b>                           MR. JONES

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Okay.

       Craig climbs out the window.  He loses his footing and free
       falls into some bushes.

<b>                           KARLA

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.

       He runs past a sleeping Cheeco and hops the fence.  Free at
       last.  He's about to run back across the street when he sees
       the dog truck.

                           CRAIG (cont'd)
                 What is he doing here?

       Craig ducks back.

</b>                 No way, Jose.  This one is mine.

       Ezal picks up the gun and hands it to Debo.

                           DEBO (cont'd)
                 Hi, Craig, remember me?

       Craig knows he can't fight a gun.  Everybody is helpless.  We
       can hear SIRENS getting CLOSER and CLOSER.  Suddenly, out of
       nowhere...

<b>       CHEECO!
</b>
       The pitbull is back!  And he's mad as hell.  He runs through
       everybody and jumps on Debo, knocking the gun from his hand.
       Craig and Day-Day jump on Debo.  Roach WHISTLES, and Cheeco
       stops his attack on Debo.

       Cheeco runs over to Roach and jumps in his arms.  Roach's
       being licked to death by the pitbull.

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 He's a boy, dude.

<b>       EXT. JOKER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Out front, three sheriff cars swoop into the driveway.  The
       cops jump out, guns drawn.

<b>       EXT. JOKER'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Debo and Ezal are tied up next to the Jokers.

<b>                           EZAL
</b>                 Mr. Jones, we was just playin'.  He made
                 me do it.

       Mr. Jones don't wanna hear it.  Craig runs into the house.
       Uncle, Day-Day, Roach and Cheeco look at the five on the
       ground...it's over, or is it?

<b>                           SHERIFF #3
</b>                 Freeze, Sheriff's Department!

       The SHERIFFS are on our heroes, guns drawn.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY

<b>       EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Red and Blue lights flash through the neighborhood.  Everyone
       is out their door looking at the action.  The suburbs is
       starting to look like the ghetto for real.

       Uncle Elroy is bent over.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Sorry, my ass.

       Suga and Miss Ho Kym come running.

<b>                           SUGA

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY

<b>                           SUGA

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY

<b>                           SUGA

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY

       Everyone is sad.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Don't worry, bro, you, Suga, Day-Day and

                 'Til you get back on yo' feet.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Thanks, Roach, but I can't accept that.
                 We're moving back to Watts where it's

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Where's Craig?

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 I don't know.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 That boy just don't never learn.

<b>       EXT. JOKER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Craig steps out of Joker's front door carrying the chrome
       hydraulic pump.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 I love Fridays.

       He walks past the cops and crosses the street.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 There he go.

<b>                           MR. JONES

<b>                           DAY-DAY
</b>                 Property taxes, and a new candy-apple
                 paint job.

       They greet Craig and all start to walk towards the house.

<b>       INT. UNCLE ELROY'S STREET - NIGHT
</b>
       The "Jefferson's" theme song, "Movin' On Up," PLAYS on the
       TV.  Uncle Elroy is face down on the floor looking at the TV.
       Miss Ho Kym walks on his back with her shoes off.  He moans
       in pleasure.  Mr. Jones eats chicken wings.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Jump up and down on him.

<b>                           MISS HO KYM

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Don't listen to him.  How much we got?

       Suga is at the table counting money.  She takes a few
       hundreds for herself.

<b>                           SUGA
</b>                 We got forty-seven thousand, three

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 That's a whole lot of scrilla.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 It's gonna feel good to pay my taxes.

       Craig is tending to his wounds.

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 You're welcome, Unc.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 You didn't do nothing.

       Roach and Cheeco are about to leave.  He has a handful of
       money.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Hey, guys, I'm outta here.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Smokin' what?

<b>                           CRAIG
</b>                 Nothing.

<b>                           ROACH
</b>                 Later, Mr. Jones.  Bye, Suga.

<b>                           ALL
</b>                 Bye, Roach.

       Roach is gone.  Day-Day shuts the door.  Miss Ho Kym is
       finished.  She steps off of Uncle Elroy.

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 All done.  Stand up.

       Uncle Elroy gets up.  He's better.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Hey, that George Jefferson shit works.
                 Thanks, Miss Kym.

       Uncle Elroy walks over to the table and grabs a stack of
       hundred-dollar bills.  He hands it to Miss Ho Kym.

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                 I can't accept.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 You better take this money.

       She takes the money.

<b>                           MISS HO KYM
</b>                     (in Korean)

<b>                           SUGA

       Uncle Elroy helps Miss Ho Kym out the door.

<b>                           MR. JONES
</b>                 Well, we better hit the road, too.
                 Craig, get your stuff.

<b>                           UNCLE ELROY
</b>                 Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.

       Suga hugs Craig.

<b>                           CRAIG

       They're out the door.

<b>       EXT. UNCLE ELROY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       As we PULL BACK, all is well inside and outside Uncle Elroy's
       house.  The suburbs are back to normal.  They get in the car.
       Craig looks over at the Joker's house.

<b>       ANGLE ON JOKER'S HOUSE
</b>
       Karla pulls up in the low-rider.  They lock eyes and she
       blows him a kiss.  He gives her a wink.  They pull off.  She
       goes in the house.

<b>                           CRAIG (V.O.)
</b>                 Well, all's well that ends well.  Another
                 Friday gone.  Another problem solved.
                 It's a trip to know that things can get
                 crazy in the suburbs, too.  I can't wait
                 to get back home...to the peace and quiet
                 streets of South Central.

       D'Wana's car pulls INTO FRAME.  She stops in front of Uncle
       Elroy's house.  Baby'D jumps out with a brick.  She throws it
       through the back window of Day-Day's BMW.  She jumps back in
       and they're gone...

<b>                                                           THE END.
