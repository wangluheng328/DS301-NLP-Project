Hell is about to be unleashed again.
Reporter Joey Summerskill ('Terri Farrell') slowly begins to learn about the mysterious puzzle box, the unbearable pain opening it can bring, and Pinhead ('Doug Bradley'), the Black Pope of Hell, after viewing a young teenage club-goer get ripped apart by the box's chains in an ER room.
She tracks the box and a young woman named Terri ('Paula Marshall') down to a famous club called the Boiler Room, owned by the spoiled playboy J.P. (Kevin Bernhardt), who feeds Pinhead, trapped in a marble pillar, blood from club members so he can escape from his prison.
As time runs out, Joey must think of a way to bring Pinhead and his newly-created Cenobites back to the realm of Pinhead's human self or succumb to an eternity of pain and suffering.
