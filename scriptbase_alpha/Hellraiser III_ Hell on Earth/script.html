</b><b>          EXT.   DERELICT STREET   TWILIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          Night is falling in a forgotten part of the city.
<b>          
</b>          The street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead.
          Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate this
          dark and derelict street.
<b>          
</b>          Once the hub of an industrial area, now the buildings are
          abandoned, the sidewalks choked with litter and debris.  Stores
          are boarded-up, windows are glassless, walls are graffitied.
<b>          
</b>          At various points, several BUMS warm their hands at trash-can
          fires.
<b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON TWO BUMS
</b><b>          
</b>           - as their eyes move, following something moving down the
          street.  Heard OFF is the sound of a smooth and powerful
          engine.
<b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON STREET
</b><b>          
</b>          Down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an
          incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover. A rich kid is
          going shopping.
<b>          
</b>          The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only
          open store on the block.
<b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON STORE
</b><b>          
</b>          A dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the
          store is still trading.  Its windows are grimy, its door
          defaced.  Above the door - barely legible through the accrued
          dirt of city years - a sign; CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES AND CURIOS.
<b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON CAR
</b><b>          
</b>          The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an
          expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out.
<b>          
</b>          JP is 24, rich, handsome, and spoiled. His hair is slick with
          designer-grease, his slim frame is wrapped in a $600 leather
          jacket.
<b>          
</b>          For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous
          glances up and down the ruined street.  He shows no anxiety at
          being in this twilight part of town.  Cocooned in the
          confidence of wealth, he's never felt threatened in his life.
          Satisfied he's in the right place, he walks confidently through
          the doorway.
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>                                                                      2
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT.   CARDUCCI'S ANTIQUES   NIGHT
</b><b>          
</b>          The store itself looks like an antique - old wood panelling and
          shelving, Victorian display cases, and faded wallpaper.  It is
          grimy, dusty, and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended.
<b>          
</b>          It is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow
          onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through.
<b>          
</b>          The stock is a strange surreal mix.  Discarded items from 50's
          America (Norge fridges, toasters, Frankie Lymon albums) share
          space with older items; framed pictures, Victorian automata,
          wax dolls, and (a specialty of the store?) items of punishment;
          stocks, iron boots, chastity belts, whips. Could that really
          be an Electric Chair glimpsed in the shadowed back of the room?
<b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON JP
</b><b>          
</b>          He wanders through the merchandise, casting appraising glances
          at some items.  Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing at
          the dust and grime they leave on his fingers.  But his manner
          suggests he is looking for something specific.
<b>          
</b>          Near the room's center is an old hoarding from the dead days of
          vaudeville and travelling shows.  It is tall and broad and is
          leaning against something behind it.
<b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON HOARDING
</b><b>          
</b>           - which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of
          hyperbolic come-ons to long-dead punters:
<b>          
</b><b>          YOU WILL BE AMAZED! THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE! FREAKS OF NATURE!
</b><b>          AN EDUCATIONAL SHOW FOR ALL THE FAMILY PRESENTED UNDER THE
</b><b>          AUSPICES OF PROFESSOR EMMANUEL BOCKLIN, TRAGEDIAN AND
</b><b>          MENAGERIST.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON JP
</b><b>          
</b>           - as he moves the hoarding aside.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     JP
</b>                        Wow ...
<b>          
</b>          REVEALED is a six-foot tall black rectangular pillar, covered
          in beautifully detailed 3-D carvings all in the same matt-black
          finish as the pillar itself.  The pillar is extremely bizarre,
          as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a Totem
          Pole for jaded modern tastes.  The carvings are of dead rats,
          copulating skeletons,  filigree-patterned boxes, and faces.
<b>          
</b>          One of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to JP
          - is the ossified visage of PINHEAD, the demon from the first
          two HELLRAISER pictures.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                      3
</b><b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON JP
</b><b>          
</b>           - as he leans in to study this face, already fascinated by its
          calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom.
<b>          
</b>          A voice OFF startles him.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     BUM
</b>                        You want it?
<b>          
</b>          JP whirls round in shock.  A BUM is standing close to him.
<b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON BUM
</b><b>          
</b>          He has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard.
          His eyes are a piercing, excited blue.  Otherwise he is
          indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside –
          ragged, tatty clothes, features blackened with grime.
<b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON JP
</b><b>          
</b>           - as he glances round the store and past the bum to the door
          beyond; has this character just wandered in from the street?
<b>          
</b><b>                                     JP
</b>                        Is it yours?
<b>          
</b><b>          ANGLE ON BOTH
</b><b>          
</b>          The Bum smiles, shaking his head knowingly.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     BUM
</b>                        No.  Not mine.  Yours.
<b>          
</b>          JP nods, still a little uncertain.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     JP
</b>                        How much do you want for it?
<b>          
</b><b>                                     BUM
</b>                        Whatever you think its worth.
<b>          
</b>          JP digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of
          cash.  Without counting or checking, he proffers it.
<b>          
</b>          The Bum's hand flies out and siezes JP's, pressing the money
          between their palms, making the exchange into a handclasp.
<b>          
</b>          In the background, OUT OF FOCUS, is Pinhead's face on the
          pillar.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     BUM (OFF)

          His body is arched tight in shock, eyes and mouth wide open.
<b>          
</b>          He's wired up to an ECG and the MONITOR shows a heartbeat that
          should be measured on the Richter scale.

</b>          The chains - all still connected to his face and his body – are
          rigid and tight, being pulled straight up into the air as if
          tugged taut by invisible hands.

</b>          The pillar has been mounted upside down, so that it looks even

          Joey's obsession with "getting the whole story" seems to be
          true of her personal life as well as her professional.

          club's owner and the man we saw buy the pillar -  walks into
          the main room of the club from his private room at the back.

</b>          JP walks out into the shadowed darkness of his small kingdom.
          He describes a circle around the dance floor, throwing glances
          at his odd sculptures, and finally walks into the center of the
          room to stand before the pride of his collection, the pillar.

          still mounted upside down.

          of blood - already larger than possibility would allow.  Then

          seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar.

          follow some pre-gouged pattern, running down the pillar tracing
          the blackened organic contours of the carvings.
<b>          
</b>          They all culminate at the point of Pinhead's chin - and then
          separate again, running over his frozen black face along the
          carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features.
<b>          
</b>          When every canal line on the demon's face is filled neatly with
          blood, a BLUE LIGHT seems to glow from within the pillar
          through Pinhead's face, giving it temporarily the blue tone he
          had enjoyed in (un)life.

<b>

          sits motionless in an old rusty deck chair next to a small
          Jerry-built pigeon coop.  Its door is open and it is empty.
<b>          
</b>          The boy is some distance from the girls but his solitude, his
          stillness, and the empty coop beside him lend the scene an
          atmosphere of sadness and loss.

</b>                        I don't know his name ...  I saw the
                        whole story.  A wounded bird was on his
                        roof.  I could hear its cries from here.
                        He went straight to it.  I couldn't've.
                        I'd be frozen between pity and fear.
                        But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly
                        to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it.
                        Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday
                        he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the
                        pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn.
                        Learn that there was one more thing he
                        had to do to make the rescue complete.
                        And one day, just as afternoon became
                        evening, he leaned over, opened the
                        cage, and walked away.  Didn't look
                        back.  But he heard the sound of its
                        wings.

<b>          
</b>          Terri's dismissive summary seems justified.  All Joey sees are
          obscure and meaningless case-notes and paperwork.  Each item is
          letter-headed THE CHANNARD INSTITUTE.
<b>          
</b>          Joey's hand reaches a large envelope.  Scrawled in hand across
          it is the phrase DR. CHANNARD - PERSONAL PAPERS.  Joey draws
          the contents out and begins to sift through them.
<b>          
</b>          The first item is a dusty, black-and-white photograph of an
          officer in English Army uniform, circa 1920.  Joey blows the
          dust from the photo.

</b>          The next photo is that of a beautiful young woman.  Joey flips
          it over.  Gummed on the back is a type-written slip that says

          and then FADES as something strange begins to happen.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by
          an invisible wind.  It is drawn up so that it forms an
          impossible spiral in the air.  Spinning like a miniature
          hurricane, it hovers over the box.  The sunlight seems to grow
          brighter.  Is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or
          is the box itself glowing and shining?

</b>          Joey gasps.
<b>          
</b>          The miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears
          inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it.
<b>          
</b>          As if on cue, the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud
          as the last particle of dust disappears into the box.
<b>          
</b>          Joey, mouth open in shock, lets the folder drop from her hand.
          The sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts
          Terri, who walks back round from the other shelf unit.

</b><b>          
</b>          Sitting alone at a bar stool - though surrounded by tightly-
          packed customers - is SANDY, a very pretty teenage girl.  She
          is the same basic type as Terri; blonde, frail, young.  Too
          young, in fact, to be legally in a club like this.
<b>          
</b>          Sandy stares at her empty glass - and stares at it wistfully
          enough to suggest she doesn't have the money to get it
          refilled.  She is trying to keep up a cool impassive face but
          her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          Sitting at the opposite end of the bar, his eye-line confirming
          he is looking at Sandy, is JP Monroe.
<b>          
</b>          The bar-stool beside JP is occupied by a TEENAGE BOY who has
          his back to the bar and is talking to a GROUP of his FRIENDS.
<b>          
</b>          JP has a speculative, predatory look on his face.  Without
          shifting his gaze, he raises his hand and within seconds the
          BARMAN is leaning over to hear his request.
<b>          
</b>          CLOSE on Sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her.  Laid
          alongside the glass is a beautiful long-stemmed red rose.
<b>          
</b>          Sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in delight
          at the rose.  She raises her eyes and looks across the bar.
<b>          
</b>          JP returns the smile.
<b>          
</b>          He turns to the Boy beside him and murmurs something unheard.
<b>          
</b>          The boy glances round, as if ready to argue with whoever is
          speaking to him.  On recognizing JP, however, he vacates the
          seat without an argument and stands to join his friends.
<b>          
</b>          JP looks back across the bar at Sandy and gestures at the empty
          stool beside him, an attractive welcoming smile on his face.

          way across to sit beside JP.

<b>

          to Pinhead's face.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead continues to watch the love-making until it comes to a

          around his body.  At the foot of the tree his biker friends

          face, stifling her scream.
<b>          
</b>          JP flattened against the far wall, watches in horror as Sandy,
          held tight against the pillar, suffers a horrible death:
<b>          
</b>          Sandy's life-force is sucked from her.  Drawn into the pillar.
          Into Pinhead.
<b>          
</b>          It is a matter of seconds only but, in those few seconds -
<b>          
</b>          Her body begins to collapse in on itself, turning grey and
          lifeless.  It is made worse by the fact that until the very end
          Sandy keeps struggling, writhing in the grasp of the monster.
<b>          
</b>          The wind keeps blowing through the room.
<b>          
</b>          Finally, a dry lifeless husk, she is dropped to the floor.

          different, more rounded.  It looks more organic, as if shifting
          its raw material into new alignments, new configurations.  The
          pillar seems to be in a process of becoming.  And the obvious
          suggestion is that what it is becoming is Pinhead.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead's head, arms, and torso now protrude from the pillar.
          They are not completely free and - now that the "eating" of
          Sandy is concluded - seem incapable of independent movement but
          there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before.
<b>          
</b>          Even though the blue light has faded, Pinhead's face is
          noticeably different.  It is blue-tinged and more fleshy in
          appearance.  Capable of movement.  And speech.

</b><b>          
</b>          This room too is empty.
<b>          
</b>          The music is louder and the soft warm pulse of the orange light
          is more distinct, bathing the walls and the furniture.

</b><b>          VARIOUS ANGLES - JOEY'S POV
</b><b>          
</b>           - as Joey tries to locate the source of the music and the
          light;
<b>          
</b>          The sofa.
<b>          
</b>          The bookshelfs.
<b>          
</b>          The TV - with the still and inactive Box.
<b>          
</b>          The closed drapes over the big picture window.

</b>          Finally -

</b><b>          ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR
</b><b>          
</b>          Both the music and the light seem to be centered on the closet
          door across the room.  They're both coming from behind it.
<b>          
</b>          Joey approaches the closet, still tense, still careful.  She
          opens the closet door and looks in.
<b>                                                                      67
</b><b>          
</b>          The closet is where Joey has stored her past.  But she's stored
          it neatly.
<b>          
</b>          Boxed and piled on shelves are old magazines, old greetings
          cards, old photographs, old soft-toys, college diplomas,
          clippings from small-town newspapers ("Death of a Local Hero:
          Tommy Summerskill lost in Vietnam", "Joanne Summerskill Class
          Valedictorian: looks to career in Media") etc etc.
<b>          
</b>          Also in there, stuffed away at the top of the closet, is an old
          radio - a big old wood-and-wire-grille valve driven beauty from
          which the lilting music is coming.
<b>          
</b>          At some stage in its life, part of its casing was smashed away
          and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes.
<b>          
</b>          It's an old mains-powered model and its mains cord dangles off
          the shelf of the closet.  This radio isn't plugged into
          anything except the paranormal.
<b>          
</b>          CLOSE on Joey; staring at this broadcast from the beyond.

</b>                        How .... ?
<b>          
</b>          Joey reaches up and brings the radio down from the shelf and
          out into the main room.  She sets it down on the coffee table
          in front of the sofa.
<b>          
</b><b>          DIFFERENT ANGLE
</b><b>          
</b>          Formal, classical framing from a low angle - Joey and radio in
          foreground, big picture window and its closed drapes in the
          background.
<b>          
</b>          Joey kneels up in front of the table.
<b>          
</b>          She stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped
          fascination with which we have seen characters in the previous
          HELLRAISER movies stare at the Box.
<b>          
</b>          Her fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle.
          She plays with the dial, moving through various "stations".
<b>          
</b>          Joey's face is open with expectation as she moves through them,
          as if she is waiting for clues.  Or instructions.
<b>          
</b>          The music gives way to various VOICES;
<b>          
</b>          An Indian voice giving some kind of commentary.  The English
          words "BBC" and "World Service" are heard amidst the punjabi.
<b>          
</b>          (Joey turns the dial)
<b>          
</b>          A tired sad English voice;

<b>          
</b>          Another burst of music, this time more raucous and syncopated.
          A ragtime tune from the birth of Jazz.
<b>          
</b>          (Joey turns the dial)
<b>          
</b>          Dead Air.  An ominous pause.  And Elliott's voice.

</b>                        Joey.  Look out your window.
<b>          
</b>          Joey shrinks back in nervous shock at this direct address.
<b>          
</b>          The radio goes dead.  The tubes stop glowing.  The room is now
          a dimly-lit place of shadow and suspense.
<b>          
</b>          Joey glances back over her shoulder at her closed drapes and
          then at the silent radio.
<b>          
</b>          She stands up slowly and crosses to the drapes.  The camera
          rises and TRACKS in as she walks, framing those drapes like
          curtains in a theater.
<b>          
</b>          With one strong gesture, Joey sweeps the drapes open.  And
          gasps.
<b>          
</b>          Instead of neighboring roof-tops and a view of the city, Joey
          is looking directly into the interior of a Quonset hut.
<b>          
</b>          It is the image from her TV set though full-size, full-color,
          and apparently real.
<b>          
</b>          At the far end, Elliott sits cross-legged on the floor.  In
          front of him on the floor is the puzzle box.
<b>          
</b>          Elsewhere in the hut; A camp-bed on which lie a gun-belt and an
          Officer's peaked cap.  And an old-fashioned radio - the same
          radio that is still in Joey's room.

<b>          
</b>          CLOSER on the elements in the hut, as we (and Joey) realize
          that everything in there is frozen in time.  There is no
          movement, no sound.
<b>          
</b>          Wonderingly (but carefully) Joey stretches her arm out before
          her.  When her arm reaches the threshold of the Quonset hut, it
          disappears into the space once occupied by window glass.
<b>          
</b>          She pulls her arm back sharply with an intake of breath.  Maybe
          she even takes a half-step backward.

<b>          
</b>          But she can.
<b>          
</b>          She summons her courage, steps over the sill, and walks into

          walks into the Hut, still bewilderment by the sights around
          her.
<b>          
</b>          Still the image does not move.  Everything is very real, very
          present.  But frozen.
<b>          
</b>          Joey approaches the immobile Elliott and looks from him to the
          box and back again.

          face and body language betray her awed nervousness at the

</b>          At the far end of the Quonset Hut, behind Elliott, a door has
          creaked open an inch or two.

                        Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And
                        if we mourned, we mourned in silence.
                        Thousands drank themselves to death.
                        Others went further.  I went further.  I
                        thought I was a lost soul.  But, until
                        this frozen moment, I didn't even know
                        what the phrase meant.

</b>          Well, that's enough of a direct threat for any officer of the
          law.  Both cops fire their guns.  Once.  Twice.  Three times.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead keeps walking.  He spits out the bullets that his body
          has absorbed.

</b>          They empty their guns - useless - and then they turn and run
          down the alley.  And then stop short.  There is a sudden wall
          of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world
          simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet.
<b>          
</b>          The cops turn, terrified, to look back.  Instinctively, they
          spread apart - each walking near to opposite walls.
<b>          
</b>          The younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape.  He glances
          up as if he might be able to jump up to safety.  No.  Too high.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead's head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command.
<b>          
</b>          Suddenly, the Fire escape ladder zooms downward with impossible
          speed and force.
<b>          
</b>          The Younger Cop doesn't even have time to scream.  The ladder
          smashes right through his body, impaling him.

</b>          His corpse stands there twitching and shuddering, wrapped
          around the ladder.

<b>          
</b>          The Elder Cop's body starts to move involuntarily.  His
          movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying to
          fight what his body is trying to do.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead's head moves through various positions.  His face is
          calm, showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but
          only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with new-
          found skills.

</b>          The Elder Copts shaking puppet-like hands draw his handcuffs
          from his belt.

</b>          His eyes show terror.  Everything else is beyond his control.
<b>          
</b>          He raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them open.
<b>          
</b>          His mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes.
<b>          
</b>          The fear in his eyes increases.
<b>          
</b>          He moves the open cuff over his tongue.  He's making panicked
          moaning noises as if trying to scream.
<b>          
</b>          SLAM!  He drives the cuff closed right through his tongue!
<b>          
</b>          And SCREAMS (as best he can).
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead looks beyond the Cop to the wall of blackness and makes
          another commanding gesture with his head.
<b>          
</b>          A Chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the
          other cuff.
<b>          
</b>          The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the
          darkness, hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him along
          the alley into the blackness.
<b>          
</b>          The Cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped
          into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead.

</b>          On the very front pew a PRIEST sits, head bent low in prayer.

</b>          The Priest is a young man.  Probably a good man.  We're not

</b>          A shadow seems to pass over the Priest's bowed head.
<b>          
</b>          At first, it seems he hasn't noticed.  Then he looks up, a
          little puzzled.  He looks to his right, his left, then shifts
          in the pew to look back along the central aisle.
<b>          
</b>          There are rows and rows of empty pews and, in the distance, the

</b>          It gets worse.  Pinhead, staring at the Priest all the while,
          reaches his hand to the back of his head and begins to extract
          one of the pins from his skull.
<b>          
</b>          The pin is horribly long and, sickeningly, the last few inches
          aren't metal at all but some kind of infernal worm - dark,
          slimy, and befanged.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly
          burrows through his flesh pulling its pin-tail behind it.  He
          repeats the operation with the other palm.
<b>          
</b>          He turns his palms out to show the Priest in a blasphemous
          parody of Christ's stigmata.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          The Priest reaches him.  Pinhead's hand is on his throat
          instantly, squeezing silence from him.
<b>

<b>          
</b>          The choking Priest kicks and struggles as Pinhead forces him to
          his knees before him.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead towers over the Priest.  He smiles.
<b>          
</b>          With his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh from
          the decorative wounds on his chest.  He holds the bloody piece
          of meat up.

                        Happy are they who come to my supper.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead shoves the disgusting lump of blue and bloody flesh
          into the Priest's aghast mouth.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead flings the priest away from him.
<b>

</b><b>          
</b>          The Priest lands heavily on the floor.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead walks forward, smashing the altar aside.
<b>          
</b>          All the candles flicker as if an unheard wind is blowing
          through the Church.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead walks up the aisle toward the semi-conscious Priest.

</b><b>          
</b>          Joey closes her door and switches on the light.  The mood is
          suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town.  It's
          very still, very slow, very quiet.
<b>          
</b>          Perhaps it's too quiet:  Joey moves into the room slowly,
          clutching the Box in her hands and glancing round.  Her manner
          makes the mood suddenly creepy.  Is the monster already in the
          house?
<b>          
</b>          Very slowly, very carefully, Joey begins to move round her
          apartment.  Hardly breathing, making no sudden movements, she
          checks her doors.  The kitchen ... empty.  The bedroom ...
          empty.  The bathroom ... empty.
<b>          
</b>          Joey stands back in the center of her main room, facing out to
          her big picture window.  Slowly, she lets out a big breath and
          then draws an equally slow one in.  Maybe it's alright ...
          maybe the monster isn't here ... maybe ...
<b>          
</b>          Magically, eerily, slowly, the Box begins to rise from Joey's
          hand.  Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the air.

          nervously, Joey tilts her head up and back, her eyes rising up
          in their sockets.
<b>          
</b>          The camera tilts low ... low ... lower ... taking in a wider
          view of the room and its ceiling and the ascending Box ...

<b>          
</b>          Like a spider or a lizard, Pinhead is flat against the ceiling,

          to stand facing Joey.  The Box lands in one of his outstretched

          closes his powerful hand on it, apparently crushing it.
<b>          
</b>          He flings the remnants from him and they land on Joey's floor -

</b>          Pinhead closes.
<b>          
</b>          She bites her lip, goes for it: in a literal and metaphorical
          leap of faith she runs headlong at the window and jumps at it.

</b>          The window shatters.
<b>

          officer   (and, at the far end of the room, Joey).

</b><b>          
</b>          Pinhead is framed in the doorway.
<b>          
</b>          Behind him, instead of her kitchen, is the black space of Hell
          - like the Torture Rooms in HELLRAISER and HELLBOUND, it is
          full of shadowy pillars and chains.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     PINHEAD
</b>                        Oh, no kiss of welcome after 70 years?
<b>          
</b>          Joey backs away, shaking her head in shocked denial.
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead moves forward, very leisurely.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     PINHEAD
</b>                        This will be so good, Joey.  You loved
                        him, didn't you?  I can feel him inside,
                        weeping for you.  He can watch through
                        the centuries as we discover the things
                        that make you whimper.
<b>          
</b>          Joey's mood breaks and she turns and rushes for her front door.
<b>          
</b>          She reaches it, throws it open ... and screams.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                      91
</b><b>          
</b>          JP Monroe is in the doorway - but he's only just recognizable.
          He's now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned, scarred, mutilated, and
          decorated with metal and leather.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     PINHEAD
</b>                        You never met, did you?  This was JP
                        Monroe.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     JP CENOBITE
</b>                        Have you seen what they did to me?  Have
                        you seen what they did?  You interfering
                        little whore!
<b>          
</b>          The JP Cenobite moves into the room.
<b>          
</b>          Joey, now near hysteria, rushes across the room again to the
          one remaining door - her bedroom.
<b>          
</b>          She throws that one open ...
<b>          
</b>          And Terri, the new FEMALE CENOBITE, walks out at her.  She has
          the open Box in her hand and several cigarette protruding from
          different holes in her cheek and face.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     JOEY
</b>                        Terri?  Oh no!  NO!!  TERRI!!
<b>          
</b><b>                                     TERRI CENOBITE
</b>                        Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You
                        think you're going to live forever?
<b>          
</b>          Pinhead and JP are advancing across the room toward Joey and
          Terri.  Joey only has seconds to act ...
<b>          
</b><b>                                     JOEY
</b>                        Wanna light, you bitch?!
<b>          
</b>          Joey pulls her father's Zippo from her pocket and sparks it up
          as she swings it through the air close to Terri's face.
<b>          
</b>          A huge FLAME shoots out of the Zippo (as in the earlier scene)
          and scours across Terri's face.
<b>          
</b>          Terri howls in terror, throws her hands to her face ... and the
          Box flies from her hands.
<b>          
</b>          Joey catches it, spins it, closes it!
<b>          
</b>          An arc of BLUE LIGHT zaps across to Terri and she's gone ...
<b>          
</b>          Still in one movement, swinging on her heels, Joey twists the
          box again ...
<b>          
</b>          And another Arc of LIGHT zaps JP away ...
<b>          
</b><b>                                                                      92
</b><b>          
</b>          Joey completes her turn.  She's facing Pinhead.  She holds the
          Box before her like a weapon ... and she's got the monster in
          her sights ...
<b>          
</b><b>                                     PINHEAD
</b>                        Wait!
<b>          
</b>          His hands are raised palms out.  He's stopped advancing.
<b>          
</b>          Joey holds the Box ready, breathing heavy, waiting ...
<b>          
</b><b>                                     PINHEAD
</b>                        You can send me back.  But why?  I can
                        help you, Joey.  I can give you what you
                        want.
<b>          
</b><b>                                     JOEY
</b>                        You'll never know what I want ...
<b>          
</b>          (Despite what she's said, we see Joey's face register every
          word of Pinhead's reply, every nuance, every promise ... )
<b>          
</b><b>                                     PINHEAD
</b>                        Respect.  Power.  You and I can put your
                        name on the World's lips, your face on
                        it's screens ...
<b>          
</b>          Camera TRACKS closer to the Box in Joey's hands as Pinhead
          speaks.  Closer and closer until it's side fills the screen.
<b>          
</b><b>          CROSS-FADE
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT.  MS. SUMMERSKILL'S OFFICE   DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          CLOSE on the face of the Box, still filling the screen.
<b>          
</b>          SLOW PULL BACK to reveal that the Box is mounted on a plinth
          within a glass bell-jar.
<b>          
</b>          PULL BACK continues.  The bell-jar stands on a tall thin wooden
          sculpture stand.
<b>          
</b>          PULL BACK continues.  The stand is next to a large impressive
          desk in an even larger even more impressive office.
<b>          
</b>          And seated behind the desk is ... well, we can't really call
          her Joey - she's far too impressive for that ... is Ms. Joanne
          Summerskill.
<b>          
</b>          Her hair is different.  Her make-up is different.  Her clothes
          are different.  Everything about this woman speaks of power and
          sophistication.
