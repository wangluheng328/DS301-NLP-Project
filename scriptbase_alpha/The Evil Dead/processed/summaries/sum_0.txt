Five friends go up to a cabin in the woods, where they find unspeakable evil lurking in the forest.
They find a tome called the "Necronomicon", Book of the Dead, and the taped translation of the text.
Once the tape is played, the evil is released.
One by one, the teens are possessed.
With only one remaining, it is up to him to survive the night and battle the evil dead.
