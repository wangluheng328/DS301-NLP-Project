</b>
<b>INT. WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
CAMERA (STEADICAM) holds on a man in a suit, sitting behind
a desk, on the phone: BARRY EGAN (Adam Sandler)

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            ...yes I'm still on hold...

<b>                         OPERATOR
</b>            And what was this?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I'm looking at your advertisement
            for the airline promotion and
            giveaway?

<b>                         OPERATOR
</b>            This is "Fly With Us?"

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            It's hard to understand because it
            says in addition to but I can't
            exactly understand in addition to
            what because there's actually
            nothing to add it too...

<b>                         OPERATOR
</b>            I think that's a type-o then, that
            would be a mistake.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten
            purchases of any of your Healthy
            Choice products equals five hundred
            miles and then with the coupon the
            same purchases would value one
            thousand miles --

<b>                         OPERATOR
</b>            That's it.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Do you realize that the monetary
            value of this promotion and the
            prize is potentially worth more
            than the purchases?

<b>                         OPERATOR
</b>            I don't know...I mean: I don't know.

<b>OC DISTANT SOUND OF A CAR SKIDDING TO A STOP, SOME VAGUE,
</b>DISTANT SCREAMING IS HEARD...THEN SILENCE. Barry hears this,
gets distracted, then back to the phone call;

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Can I call you back if I have any
            further questions...? Can I get
            your extension?

<b>                         OPERATOR
</b>            It's extension 215 if you want to
            try me back.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Ok. Thank you.

He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. It's
fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc. Products
seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key
chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc)

He lifts a LOADING DOOR and LIGHT POURS INSIDE, WASHES OUT
THE FRAME....he's silhouette....CAMERA follows him
out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks
down towards the street.....

...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway,
shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto
mechanic....distant SOUND of a car SPEEDING and SKIDDING....

....hold, then:

....a JEEP CHEROKEE comes FLIPPING into FRAME, far off at
the mouth of the alley, on the street. The JEEP ends up
landing RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD....

.....Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle
for a moment....then it drives off....then:

A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the
alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens
and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is
placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away.....

....a moment or two later another NON-DESCRIPT CAR flies
past very fast....

BEAT. Barry squints, looks at the small HARMONIUM sitting
alone in the middle of the street.

He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside
his warehouse.

<b>INT. BARRY'S WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT
</b>
Barry on the phone again;

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            ....I'm not exactly sure what that
            means...

<b>                         VOICE
</b>            If they break or something. What is
            it, plastic?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            It's a plastic, yeah.

<b>                         VOICE
</b>            Right. Alright, lemme call you
            first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run
            the numbers, see what's what and
            I'll give you a call back --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Did you have my home phone number?

<b>                         VOICE
</b>            For what?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            If you wanted to call me back I
            could...

<b>                         VOICE
</b>            I'm fine, I have your work number.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Ok...because of the time difference
            if you needed to call me early?

<b>                         VOICE
</b>            It's fine. I can just get you at
            your office.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Ok.

<b>                         VOICE
</b>            Ok, bye, bye.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Bye.

He hangs up the phone and walks outside, CAMERA follows him
again, out to the alley, over his shoulder......he looks
down the length of the alley at the Harmonium. HOLD, THEN:

A small FORD ESCORT pulls into the driveway, around the
Harmonium, parks......a young woman named LENA LEONARD
(Emily Watson) exits the car and starts to walk down the
length of the alley towards him.....CAMERA stays over his
shoulder and turns into a profile 2-shot;

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            No.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            They're not open yet?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            They don't get opened until eight.

BEAT. Barry gently steps back and out of the FRAME.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Is it ok if I leave my car you think?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I don't know.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            I thought they opened at seven.
                   (beat)
            If I left my car would it be ok?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I don't know.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Do you know them.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Not very well.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Can I ask you, can I trust to leave
            my keys with you and give them to
            you so that when they get here you
            could give them to them?
<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Ok.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            You think it's ok where I left it,
            right there?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I think that'll be fine.

Lena hands him her keys, he steps back into FRAME, THEN:

<b>                         LENA
</b>            There's a piano in the street.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Yeah.

<b>BEAT.
</b>
<b>                         LENA
</b>            Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank
            you for your help.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Thank you.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Maybe I'll see you later, when I
            pick up my car?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Ok.

She walks away....he starts back inside the warehouse,
hesitates, watches her go.....right before she reaches the
end of the alley, she glances back quickly, over her
shoulder....he dodges inside real quick.....

HOLD THE EMPTY FRAME......then he steps back out.....looks
off at the Harmonium.....and the empty street.....he looks
around some more....then he makes the long walk down the
street.

<b>ON THE STREET.
</b>Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around,
both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards
his business.....

He brings it into his office and places it on his desk. He
tries a few keys....pressing down...there's no sound.

He presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and
a small note is made.....BEAT....he does it again....and
holds the note.....

<b>                                            CUT TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
Barry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his
office. He places it on the desk and hits a key: no sound.

Barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows. He pumps
the bellow, reaches up, presses a note, and another...then
stands up into CU. and presses the 5 note
melody......SUDDENLY: THE SOUND OF THE POD BAY DOOR SLIDING....

....Barry spins around, scared shitless, sees: LANCE, who
enters the warehouse, Barry rushes out to greet him;

<b>                         LANCE
</b>            Hey, good morning, Barry.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Hey...Lance....can I.....

<b>                         LANCE

CAMERA pushes in slow as Barry and Lance talk to TWO
CUSTOMERS about the plungers which are on display in front
of them. They speak all over each other doing shop talk, etc;

<b>                         CUSTOMER

and walks back to the customers and says:

BEAT. He closes its small cover, does something on his desk
and then:

His face gets bright red, he holds back tears, opens his
mouth and has a serious but small burst of overwhelming
emotion and then it's over.

<b>INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
</b>
<b>CU. BIRTHDAY CARD.
</b>Barry's hands reaches in and picks a birthday card.

<b>ANGLE, WIDER, THAT MOMENT.
</b>Barry grabs the card and starts to push his cart....but he
pushes it straight into a SIX YEAR OLD KID who's pushing a
cart around....they slam into each other....

Barry apologizes....the KID just takes off....Barry's cart
now has a slightly damaged wheel that wobbles like crazy....

<b>ANGLE, FROZEN FOOD AISLE.
</b>CAMERA tracks left to right with Barry as he heads for the
Healthy Choice Frozen Dinner. He grabs one.

<b>CU. BARRY. LOW ANGLE.
</b>He looks at box.

<b>BARRY'S POV - THE BOX
</b>Slow zoom in. The sticker reads: "Fly Away With Us! The More
You Buy The More You Earn."

<b>ANGLE, SOUP SECTION.
</b>CAMERA tracks along right to left with Barry as he moves
towards some SOUP. He grabs one, inspects it.....then puts
it back.

<b>CU. SOUP CAN.
</b>It's put back on the shelf: TILT down to price: 79 cents.

Barry turns his cart around and SMACKS right into someone
else again, screwing up another wheel on his cart.

<b>ANGLE, BARRY.
</b>CAMERA, tracks alongside him, left to right as he comes
across: PUDDING. The price: 4/$1.00.

MED. BARRY in the middle of the aisle.
He reacts......smiles...holds....thinks....looks around,
then starts to load up on the pudding.

<b>ANGLE, BARRY.
</b>He pushes TWO SHOPPING CARTS FULL OF PUDDING over to the
STORE MANAGER who's on his knees, stacking milk.....Barry
kneels down, CAMERA PUSHES INTO A CU. as he speaks sotto;

<b>                         MANAGER
</b>            Hello.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Hello, sir. My name is Barry Egan

<b>INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens slowly and Barry peers his head around and
into the house very cautiously, CAMERA PUSHES IN and PANS
slightly LEFT to reveal: THE KITCHEN.

Barry's SEVEN SISTERS are all there, preparing dinner and
talking away....they turn and see him;

<b>                         SUSAN
</b>            There he is! Do you remember when
            we used to call you gay and you'd
            get all mad?

<b>                         KATHLEEN
</b>            -- we were calling you gay and you
            got so mad that you threw a hammer
            through the sliding glass door --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I don't really remember that.

<b>                         KATHLEEN
</b>            Yes you do. We were calling you Gay
            Boy and you got so mad....

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Yes, yes, right.

<b>                         SUSAN
</b>            We're trying to remember why you
            had the hammer in the first place?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            ...um.....

<b>                         KATHLEEN
</b>            The hammer that you threw....why
            did you have it?

<b>                         SUSAN

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I remember, yes.....

<b>                         SUSAN
</b>            Why did you have it?

Another sister, RHONDA, enters from behind, Barry jumps, says:

<b>                         RHONDA
</b>            He was building a ramp for the dog.

<b>                         KATHLEEN
</b>            He was making a ramp for the dog!
            That's right!

<b>                         SUSAN
</b>            That's right....ramp for the
            dog..... And you just threw the
            hammer.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>                   (to Rhonda)
            Happy Birthday, Rhonda.

<b>                         RHONDA
</b>            Thank you. Thank you so much, Barry.

She gives him a very quick hug and kiss and sets the cake
next to a bigger, cooler looking cake.

Mia approaches holding a baby.....Barry tries to say hello
to the baby, but Mia slowly turns the baby out of Barry's
grasp....making herself the center of his attention;

<b>KITCHEN/DINING ROOM, THAT MOMENT
</b>
Barry gets slightly turned around trying to reach the
baby...and ends up in a doorway that leads to the dining
room, revealing himself to: ELIZABETH, KAREN, NICOLE AND
ANNA. There are also: THREE BROTHER IN LAW'S (WALTER, LARRY

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Hello everyone.

KAREN steps up and greets him;

<b>                         KAREN
</b>            Did you think that we'd all be

<b>                         KAREN
</b>            Well it's just not true. We
            wouldn't be looking at you -- why
            are you wearing this suit? Did you
            say hello to your brother in law's?

<b>                         STEVE/LARRY

<b>                         KAREN

            good, good. Ok. Come on, we're
            gonna eat now.....let's go.....

Barry shakes hands and hello's with the brother in law's.
He's left alone for a moment with Walter and Elizabeth;

<b>                         WALTER
</b>            How you doin' Barry?

<b>                         BARRY

<b>                         ELIZABETH

<b>                         BARRY

<b>                         WALTER
</b>            Maybe you said that because you're
            hungry.....

Walter moves to help everyone...they're moving to set the
table......

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON BARRY AND ELIZABETH alone for a beat:

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>            You're lucky. She couldn't come
            anyway --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>            She couldn't come I said. Are you
            nervous?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            No.

<b>                         ELIZABETH

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I'm not, I'm very happy.

RHONDA passes;

<b>                         RHONDA
</b>            Come on homo-boy, we're eating now.

Elizabeth leaves, HOLD ON BARRY.

<b>CAMERA PUSHES IN TOWARDS EVERYONE SETTING THE

chatting a bit about "Barry gay boy," and "the girl that was
gonna be here that Barry wouldn't allow."

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry is standing in front of the floor to
ceiling sliding glass doors.....in an INSTANT, he TURNS AND
<b>THROWS HIS FIST STRAIGHT THROUGH THREE OF THEM, THEY

It's later and WALTER and BARRY walk down a small hall and

Barry goes into his office and looks at the Harmonium. BEAT.
He presses some keys, makes a little more noise with it. (a
quarter of some sort of melody starts here...)

<b>ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.

throws it away.

<b>ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
</b>Barry paces around a little bit.....CAMERA stays inside and
watches him as he walks outside for a moment, looks
around....he sees something outside, hesitates, then dodges
back inside the warehouse --

-- once inside, he takes a horrendous, hurtful fall over
something....He stands up quick;

<b>                         BARRY

            gonna hurt someone. It already did
            hurt someone: It hurt me, so please
            let's move that.

He backs away, then steps OUT OF FRAME...a moment later
ELIZABETH (his sister) and LENA (from the opening) enter the
warehouse, walking towards Barry;

become her POV.

looks up, sees Elizabeth and Lena walking towards him and

</b>            I don't know. Can you hang on a
            second?

CAMERA follows Barry as he walks back to his little office,
picks up the phone;

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Hello?

<b>                         SEXY VOICE
</b>            We got disconnected before....

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            No. No. We got disconnect --

            number -- ?

<b>                         SEXY VOICE
</b>            See the thing is I could make it
            really easy on you -- I already
            have your credit card number, your
            information, address and stuff.
            This is so awkward asking like
            this, I'm sorry --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            This makes me very uncomfortable.

<b>                         SEXY VOICE

            to your girlfriend?

<b>                         BARRY

</b>            -- you said you did.

<b>                         BARRY

<b>                         SEXY VOICE

<b>                         BARRY

<b>                         SEXY VOICE

            you really even would want to go
            out with him, someone like him, I

ANGLE, BARRY on the phone

<b>                         SEXY VOICE
</b>            ....this is your mistake....

Elizabeth comes walking into his office, starts whispering
to him as he's on the phone;

<b>                         ELIZABETH

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>            It's not cool?

<b>                         BARRY

<b>                         ELIZABETH

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I feel really on the spot now.

<b>                         ELIZABETH

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I don't do that. I don't - things
            like that.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>            You don't do anything, why are you

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I'm not being scared, you're just

</b>            I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I
            do this just to rag you?

            something from my car, go away so
            you don't feel pressure. Can I ask
            you a serious question:

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            What?

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>            Did you ask Walter to get you a
            shrink?
                   (beat)
            Barry, did you ask Walter to get
            you a shrink? What's wrong with you?
            Are you ok?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I didn't ask him that. He's lying.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>            You're being weird again, see. Come
            on. Please don't be weird.

<b>ANGLE, BARRY AND ELIZABETH, MOMENTS LATER
</b>They walk out and as they do, Lena comes back in with her
keys in her hand, Elizabeth keeps walking past;

</b>            I gotta grab something from my car....

<b>                         LENA

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>                   (over her shoulder)
            Yeah, no, I have to get something
            from my car, I said.

Barry and Lena about to be alone as Lance walks up;

<b>                         LANCE

            about that, Lance, ok?

He walks away, Lena turns to him;

<b>                         LENA
</b>            I'm sorry I couldn't come to your
            sister's birthday party last night,
            Elizabeth had invited me and I

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            It's fine. It was fun, though.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            It must be weird for you to have so

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            No. Not at all. It's nice.

<b>                         WORKER (OC)

Barry turns instantly and walks away....he turns back as he
walks....TWO SHOT - track left with him....

<b>                         BARRY
</b>                   (turns back)
            One second, sorry.

<b>IN THE OFFICE, THAT MOMENT
</b>He picks up the phone.

<b>                         SEXY VOICE
</b>            Hang up again and see the trouble
            it's gonna make.

Barry instantly hangs up the phone, turns around and walks
back to Lena;

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Business is good, you're busy?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Yeah, not really.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            I saw a picture of you.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Yes.
<b>                         LENA
</b>            Elizabeth has a picture of you
            guys -- your sisters and you, it's
            a lot of family, it must be nice.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            Do you have brothers or sisters?

<b>                         LENA
</b>            No. I'm the exact opposite --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            That must be nice. That must be
            really, really, really great.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            It's terrible, no.

No response from Barry. (cut to reverse 2-shot as they look)

<b>                         LENA
</b>            What do you do with all this pudding?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            That's not mine it's one of the
            guys that works here. That
            pudding's not mine.

BEAT. In the b.g., two WORKERS are dealing with getting a
large crate on top of a large stack of crates, they're using
a fork lift....in an instant the large CRATE tumbles to the
ground and SMASHES....Barry attempts to not notice this;

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Oh My God.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            It's ok. That's ok. How long have
            you worked with Elizabeth?

The workers start calling out and apologizing for this to
Barry, who keeps looking straight ahead to Lena;

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Six months, maybe five, five or six
            months...do you wanna check that?

<b>                         BARRY

<b>                         WORKERS/LANCE

<b>                         BARRY
</b>                   (back to Lena)
            So you do what she does, the same
            work, the same job?

<b>                         LENA
</b>            I do, but I do field consultations
            mainly too which is cool because I
            get to travel. I travel. A lot of
            the time. I'm going to Hawaii on
            Friday.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            That's great -- Hawaii. I was
            thinking about going there.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Really?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            I was, yeah, I was thinking about
            going there for business --

<b>                         LENA
</b>            -- well, if you're gonna go --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            -- I'm probably not gonna go though.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            -- oh that's too bad, it's so great
            over there and if you were there we
            could say hello to each other or
            something --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            -- yeah that would be great, if I
            was gonna go but I'm not exactly
            sure, I have so much goin on
            here -- A lot depends on this thing
            I might do here and if that happens
            I can't go and if it doesn't happen
            then I probably will, but I doubt it.

There's another LOUD CRASH as they try to reposition the box
that's fallen, giving way to something else that FALLS. In
other words, to correct the mistake they've already made,
they have to sacrifice another CRATE that CRASHES. She
looks, Barry just flinches, tries to stay looking straight
ahead; CAMERA (HAND HELD) with Elizabeth, comes walking back
in.....says to Barry:

<b>                         ELIZABETH

Lena and Elizabeth leave. CAMERA leads them as they walk;
Sound starts to drop out, we see Barry and the boys cleaning
up the boxes in the back....move into a CU on Lena....Music
Cue. Score. treated piano, small rhythm/melodic(notes of
harmonium so far)/gentle.

Lena gets into her car. Elizabeth keeps walking. She waits
until Elizabeth is out of sight at the mouth of the driveway
and then she gets back out of her car and walks straight
back into the warehouse.

They do a small search for a piece of paper, get it all
written down and sorted out and then -- as they do this
there is even more CRASHING AND SMASHING in the b.g., by the
boys -- Barry and Lena settle up and say so long.

They enter into an upstairs office area. It has a couple
desks and off to the side, in a small, partitioned off room
is The Phone Sex Area; a GIRL on the phone. (We hear bits of
her call, e.g. "Me? I'm in Florida. Laying on my bed.")

There are posters for Ashes to Ashes, filing cabinets,
posters of CARS, lots of various small business items like
order forms and pamphlets, etc. Dean collects a piece of
paper and hands it to David/Nate/Jim;

            doesn't make sense if you think
            about it in a fair deal like sense.
            Ok? It's business. Seriously. One
            hundred dollars for two days work
            is a lot more than your family is
            making sitting around your house.
            I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now.
            Just stop.

He hands him a set of KEYS and goes through the info;

            asked him for seven fifty when she
            was on the phone with him, so --
            just call me when you get there.

            go there and check it out. It's a
            '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says
            is fine, but I need to figure out
            why he's only asking 23 for it. So
            take a look, the whole thing, call
            me about that, if it seems alright
            then I'll head down there and check

            I've been looking around a lot
            lately at promotional giveaways,
            cross promotional work by some
            companies. Do you remember all that
            pudding?

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Yeah.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            So that pudding was bought, I
            bought that pudding because of a
            pretty interesting promotion that's
            sponsored by Healthy Choice and
            American Airlines. It's designed to
            encourage airline travel and
            obviously designed to encourage
            buying Healthy Choice products.
            They make frozen meals, deli meats,
            pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice
            creams, this sort of thing.....

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Yeah?

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            ....I'm sorry....I lost my
            thoughts, what I was saying....

<b>                         LENA
</b>            You were talking about the
            promotion --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            -- the promotion says: buy any 10
            Healthy Choice products and get 500
            miles of airline travel or 1,000
            for purchases made with a special
            coupon. So in the supermarket, you
            notice their products, first you
            notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken
            Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty
            good deal....but then I noticed
            they had soup at 89 cents a
            can.....and you start to do the
            math and you start to notice that
            it's a really amazing deal because
            I stumbled across the pudding at 25
            cents a cup. Now the crucial thing
            is the bar codes on the label.
            That's those little bar codes, you
            know? The universal product codes?

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Yeah.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            That's what's used to redeem the
            mileage, so in noticing the
            pudding, each cup had an individual
            bar code -- in other words: Two
            dollars and fifty cents for ten
            cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add
            in the coupon: it's one thousand.
            You see?

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Yeah.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            You see?

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Yeah, no, I see --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            You see if you spent $3,000 dollars
            on pudding you could earn over one
            million frequent flyer miles.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            That's insane. That is really,
            really crazy. That's just crazy if
            you spend three thousand dollars on
            pudding.

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            ....yeah....

<b>                         LENA

<b>                         LENA

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            No I didn't say that.

<b>                         LENA
</b>            I thought you said you bought all
            that pudding --

<b>                         BARRY
</b>            My friend Carlos is doing it who
            works with me. It's his. It's his
            pudding, he's doing it. It's not
            mine. He's crazy. I told him not to
            do it. He's the one who's insane.
            He only spent about one hundred
            dollars so far though --

<b>                         LENA
</b>            Your sister was telling me a pretty
            funny story about you, when you
            guys were kids and you were
            building a ramp for your dog and
            you threw a hammer through a window?
            Is that right? You threw a hammer
            through a sliding glass door?

Barry starts to WELL WITH TEARS, which he hides very
quickly, holds a hand up to his face as if he's touching his
nose, and then he smiles;

</b>            I don't remember that, she might be
            lying. I have to go the bathroom.

Barry walks in and goes a little crazy. He's mad at himself
and he HITS a stall....it seems loose already and falls
straight to the floor.

This makes him go crazier and he continues to BEAT and KICK
the shit out of the bathroom/stall.

HOLD. He collects himself and then he hesitates, looks
around, tries to collect the bathroom but it's in ruins, he
exits....

He looks to Lena, excuses himself.

<b>ANGLE, OFF TO THE SIDE.
</b>The Manager and Barry step away, in a quiet section of the

<b>                         MANAGER

Barry takes out some money and hands it over.

Lena is getting a bandage applied to her head by an intern.
It's very calm and she's very matter-of-fact as it happens.
