<title>“DAYS OF HEAVEN” by Terry Malick REVISED: 6/2/76</title>


<p></p><p></p><p id="act">DAYS OF HEAVEN"
</p><p></p><p id="act">by Terry Malick
</p><p></p><p id="act">REVISED: 6/2/76
</p><p></p><p id="act">SETTING
The story is set in Texas just before the First World War.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAST OF CHARACTERS
BILL:  A young man from Chicago following the harvest.
ABBY:  The beautiful young woman he loves.
CHUCK:  The owner of a vast wheat ranch ("bonanza") in the Texas Panhandle.
URSULA:  Abby's younger sister, a reckless child of14.
BENSON:  The bonanza foreman, an enemy of the newcomers.
MISS CARTER:  Chief domestic at the Belvedere, Chuck's home.
McLEAN:  Chuck's accountant.
GEORGE:  A young pilot who interests Ursula. 
A PREACHER, A DOCTOR, AN ORGANIST, VARIOUS HARVEST HANDS, LAWMEN, VAUDEVILLIANS, etc.
</p><p></p><p id="act">"Troops of nomads swept over the country at harvest time like a visitation of locusts, reckless young fellows, handsome, profane, licentious, given to drink, powerful but inconstant workmen, quarrelsome and difficult to manage at all times. They came in the season when work was plenty and wages high. They dressed well, in their own peculiar fashion, and made much of their freedom to come and go."
</p><p></p><p id="act">"They told of the city, and sinister and poisonous jungles all cities seemed in their stories. They were scarred with battles. They came from the far-away and unknown, and passed on to the north, mysterious as the flight of locusts, leaving the people of Sun Prairie quite as ignorant of their real names and characters as upon the first day of their coming."						Hamlin Garland, Boy Life on the Prairie (1899) 
</p><p></p><p id="act">DAYS OF HEAVEN
</p><p></p><p id="slug">1	INT. CHICAGO MILL - SERIES OF ANGLES
</p><p></p><p id="act">WORKERS in a dark Chicago mill pound molten iron out in flaming sheets. The year is 1916.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">2	EXT. MILL
</p><p></p><p id="act">BILL, a handsome young man from the slums, and his brother
STEVE sit outside on their lunch break talking with an
older man named BLACKIE. By the look of his flashy clothes
Blackie is not a worker.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BLACKIE
</p><p id="dia">Listen, if I ever seen a tit, this here's a tit. You understand? Candy. My kid sister could do this one. Pure fucking candy'd melt in your hand. Don't take brains. Just a set of rocks. I told you this already.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">STEVE
</p><p id="dia">Blackie, you told me it was going to snow in the winter, I'd go out and bet against it. You know?
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Bill)
</p><p id="dia">There is nothing, nothing in the world, dumber than a dumb guinea.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BLACKIE
</p><p id="dia">Okay, all right, fine. Why should I be doing favors for a guy that isn't doing me any favors? I must be losing my grip.
</p><p id="spkdir">(pause)
</p><p id="dia">I got to give it to you, though. Couple of guys look like you just rolled in on a wagonload of chickens. You ever get laid?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">STEVE
</p><p id="dia">Sure.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BLACKIE
</p><p id="dia">Without a lot of talk, I mean? 'Cause I'm beginning to understand these guys, go down the hotel, pick something up for a couple of bucks. It's clean, and you know what you're in for.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">3	EXT. ALLEY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Sam the Collector's GANG swaggers around in the alley behind a textile plant. ONE of them has filed his teeth down to points and stuck diamonds in between them. ANOTHER wears big suspenders.
Sam and Bill appear to know one another.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SAM
</p><p id="dia">Hey, Billy, you made a mistake. You made somebody mad. Nothing personal, okay? It's just gotta be done. You made a mistake. Happens in the best of families.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I paid you everything I have. Search me. The rest he gets next week.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SAM
</p><p id="dia">Listen, what happens if I don't do this? I gotta leave town?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I could do something, you know. You guys wanta do something to me, I know who to tell about it. You guys ought to think about that. 
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SAM
</p><p id="dia">You maybe already did something. Maybe that's why you're here, on account of you already done something.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I haven't done anything.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SAM
</p><p id="dia">Then you're all right, Billy.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RAZOR TEETH
</p><p id="dia">You got nothing to worry about.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SAM
</p><p id="dia">Cut it out, Billy, all right? You know what can happen to a guy that doesn't wanta do what people tell him? You know. So don't give us a lot of trouble. You're liable to get everybody all pissed off.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Sam, a busy man, checks his watch.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">4	NEW ANGLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill puts his hand on the ground. Sam drops a keg of roofing nails on it and, his work done, leaves with his gang. Bill sobs with pain.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">5	EXT. LOT BEYOND MILL
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill and Steve drag a safe by a rope through a vacant lot beyond the mill. Blackie walks behind.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BLACKIE
</p><p id="dia">You know what I'm doing with my end? Buy a boat. Get that? I had a boat. I had a nice apartment, I had a boat. Margie don't like that. We got to have a house. "I can't afford no house," I said. She says, "Sell the boat." I didn't want to sell my boat. I didn't want to buy the house. I sell the boat, I buy the house. Nine years we had the house, eight of them she's after me, we should get another boat. I give up.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">STEVE
</p><p id="dia">Same as always, I do all the work, you gripe about it.
Suddenly FOUR POLICEMEN surprise them from ambush. Bill lets go of the rope and starts to run. Steve does not give up immediately, however, and they shoot him down. Bill picks up Steve's gun and fires back. Three of the Policemen go chasing after Blackie, whom they soon bring to heel. The FOURTH stays behind taking potshots at Bill while he attends to Steve.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">6	TIGHT ON STEVE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Steve, badly wounded, is about to die.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">STEVE
</p><p id="dia">Run. Get out of here.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="spkdir">(weeping)
</p><p id="dia">I love you so much. Why didn't  you run. Don't die.
Steve dies. Bullets kick up dust around him. He takes off running. One of the bullets has caught him in the shoulder.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">7	INT. SEWER
</p><p></p><p id="act">ABBY, a beautiful woman in her late twenties, attends to Bill's wounds in a big vaulted sewer. Her sister URSULA, a reckless girl of14, stands watch.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="spkdir">(weeping)
</p><p id="dia">They shot the shit out of him. My brother. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Hold still, or I can't do anything.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I love you, Abby. You're so good to me. Remember how much fun we had, on the roof...
</p><p></p><p id="slug">8	EXT. ROOF - MATTE SHOT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill and Abby flirt on the root of a tenement, happily in love. The city stretches out behind them.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">9	INT. BED - QUICK CUT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abby lies shivering with fever.  Bill spoons hot soup into her mouth. Ursula rolls paper flowers for extra change.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL (o.s.)
</p><p id="spkdir">(continuing)
</p><p id="dia">... even when you were sick and I was in the mill.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">10	INT. MILL - QUICK CUT (VARIOUS ANGLES OF OTHER WORKERS)
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill works in the glow of a blast furnace. He does not seem quite in place with the rest of the workers. A pencil moustache lends a desired gentlemanliness to his appearance. He looks fallen on hard times, without ever having known any better--like Chaplin, an immigrant lost in the heartless city, with dim hopes for a better way of life.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL (o.s.)
</p><p id="dia">I won't let you go back in the mill. People die in there. I'm a man, and I can look out for you.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">11	EXT. SIDING OUTSIDE MILL
</p><p></p><p id="act">Along a railroad spur outside the mill, Abby and Ursula glean bits of coal that have fallen from the tenders.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL (o.s.)
</p><p id="dia">We're going west. Things gotta be better out there.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">12	EXT. TENEMENT
</p><p></p><p id="act">A POLICEMAN, looking for Bill, roughs Abby up behind the tenement where they live. Suddenly Bill runs out from a doorway and slams him over the head with a clay pitcher full of water.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">POLICEMAN
</p><p id="dia">What'd you do?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill shrugs, then hits him again, knocking him unconscious, when he reaches for a gun. Abby calls Ursula and they take off running, Bill stopping only to collect some of their laundry off a clothesline.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">13	EXT. FREIGHT YARDS
</p><p></p><p id="act">They hop a freight train.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">14	CREDITS (OVER EXISTING PHOTOS)
</p><p></p><p id="act">The CREDITS run over black and white photos of the Chicago they are leaving behind. Pigs roam the gutters. Street urchins smoke cigar butts under a stairway. A blind man hawks stale bread. Dirty children play around a dripping hydrant. Laundry hangs out to dry on tenement fire escapes. Police look for a thief under a bridge. Irish gangs stare at the camera, curious how they will look. The CREDITS end.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">15	EXT. MOVING TRAIN
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abby and Bill sit atop a train racing through the wheat country of the Texas Panhandle.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I like the sunshine.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Everybody does.
They laugh. She is dressed in men's clothes, her hair tucked up under a cap. They are sharing a bottle of wine.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I never wanted to fall in love with you.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Nobody asked you to.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He draws her toward him. She pulls away.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">What's the matter? A while ago you said I was irresistible. I still am.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">That was then.
</p><p></p><p id="act">She pushes her nose up against his chest and sniffs around.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">You playing mousie again?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">I love how nice and hard your shoulders are. And your hair is light. You're not a soft, greasy guy that puts bay rum on every night.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I love it when you've been drinking.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">You're not greasy, Bill. You have any idea what that means?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Kind of.
</p><p></p><p id="act">They share the boxcar with a crowd of other HARVEST HANDS. Ursula is among them, also dressed like a man. Bill gestures out at the landscape.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Look at all that space. Oweee! We should've done this a long time ago. It's just us and the road now, Abby.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">We're all still together, though. That's all I care about.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">16	EXT. JERKWATER
</p><p></p><p id="act">The train slows down to take on water. The hands jump off. Each carries his "bindle"-- a blanket and a few personal effects wrapped in canvas. TOUGHS with ax handles are on hand to greet them.
The harvesters speak a Babel of tongues, from German to Uzbek to Swedish. Only English is rare. Some retain odd bits of their national costumes, they are pathetic figures, lonely and dignified and so far from home. Others, in split shoes and sockless feet, are tramps. Most are honest workers, though, here to escape the summer heat in the factories of the East. They dress inappropriately for farm work, in the latest fashions.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Elbow room! Oweee! Give me a chance and I'm going to dance!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill struts around with a Napoleonic air, in a white Panama hat and gaiters, taking in the vista. Under his arm he carries a sword cane with a pearl handle. It pleases him, in this small way, to set himself apart from the rest of toiling humanity. He wants it known that he was born to greater things.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">17	NEW ANGLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill comes upon a BIG MAN whose face is covered with blood.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Good, very good. Where you from,  mister?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG MAN
</p><p id="dia">Cleveland.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Like to see the other guy.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill helps him to his feet and dusts him off. A TOUGH walks up.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">TOUGH
</p><p id="dia">You doing this shit?
</p><p id="spkdir">(pause)
</p><p id="dia">Then keep it moving.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

</p><p></p><p id="act">Benson's wagons roll across the plains toward the Razumihin, a "bonanza" or wheat ranch of spectacular dimensions, its name spelled out in whitewashed rocks on the side of a hill.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">21	EXT. BONANZA GATES (NEAR SIGN)

Bill looks at Abby and raises his eyebrows.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">22	EXT. BELVEDERE
</p><p></p><p id="act">At the center of the bonanza, amid a tawny sea of grain, stands a gay Victorian house, three stories tall. Where most farm houses stand more sensibly on low ground, protected from the elements, "The Belvedere" occupies the highest ridge around, commanding the view and esteem of all.
Filigrees of gingerbread adorn the eaves. Cottonwood saplings, six feet high, have recently been planted in the front. Peacocks fuss about the yard. There is a lawn swing and a flagpole, used like a ship's mast for signaling distant parts of the bonanza. A wind generator supplies electric power.
A white picket fence surrounds the house, though its purpose is unclear; where the prairie leaves off and the yard begins is impossible to tell.
Bison drift over the hills like boats on the ocean. Bill shouts at the nearest one.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The sun peers over the horizon. The wheat makes a sound like a waterfall. It stretches for as far as the eye can see. A PREACHER has come out, in a cassock and surplice, to offer prayers of thanksgiving.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">PREACHER
</p><p id="dia">"... that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord swore unto your fathers to give them, as the days of' heaven upon the earth."
The harvesters spit and rub their hands as they wait for the dew to burn off. They have slept in their coats. The dawn has a raw edge, even in summer.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">30	TIGHT ON WHEAT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Chuck looks to see if the wheat is ready to harvest. He shakes the heads; they make a sound like paper. He snaps off a handful, rolls them between his palms, blows away the chaff and pinches the kernels that remain to make sure they have grown properly hard.
Tiny sounds are magnified in the early morning stillness:
grasshoppers snapping through the air, a cough, a distant hawk.
He pops the kernels into his mouth, chews them up, and rolls the wad around in his mouth. Satisfied, he spits it out and gives a nod. The Preacher begins a prayer of thanksgiving. Two ACOLYTES flank him, one with a smoking censer, the other with a crucifix.
All repeat the "Amen." Benson makes a tugging signal with his arm. A Case tractor--forty tons of iron, steam-driven, as big and as powerful as a locomotive--blasts its whistle. This is the moment they have been waiting all year for.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">31	OTHER FIELDS - SERIES OF ANGLES
</p><p></p><p id="act">A SIGNALMAN with two hand flags passes the message on from the crest of a nearby hill. In the far-flung fields of the bonanza other tractors answer as other crews set to work.
Abby and Bill join in, Bill reaping the wheat with a mowing machine called a binder, Abby propping the bound sheaves together to make bunches or "shocks."
A cloud of chaff rises over the field, melting the sun down to a cold red bulb.
Abby is well turned out, in a boater and string tie, as though she were planning any moment to leave for a picnic.
Bill, too, dresses with an eye to flashy fashion: Tight dark trousers, a silk handkerchief stuck in the back pocket with a copy of the Police Gazette, low-top calfskin boots with high heels and pointed toes, a shirt with ruffled cuffs, and a big signet ring. While at work he wears a white smock over all this to keep the chaff off. It gives him the air more of a researcher than a worker.
The harvesters itch madly as the chaff gets into their clothes. The shocks, full of briars, cut their hands; smut and rust make the cuts sting like fire. Nobody talks. From time to time they raise a chant.
Ursula, plucking chickens by the cookhouse--a shack on wheels-- steals a key chain from an unwatched coat.
Benson follows the reapers around the field in a buggy. He keeps their hours, chides loafers, checks the horses, etc. The harvesters are city people. Few of them are trained to farming. Most--Abby and Bill are no exception--have contempt for it and anybody dull enough to practice it. Tight control is therefore exercised to see that the machines are not damaged. 
Where the others loaf whenever Benson's back is turned, Bill works like a demon, as a point of pride.

</p><p id="dia">They must be having trouble over there, though.
Abby, passing by, lifts her hat to wipe her face. As she does her hair falls out of the crown. Women are rare in the harvest fields. One so beautiful is unprecedented.

Benson consults the large clock strapped to the back of his buggy, then fires a smoke pistol in the air.
Their faces black with chaff, the hands fall out in silence. They shuffle across the field toward the cookhouse, keeping their feet close to the ground to avoid being spiked by the stubble.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">34	EXT. COOKHOUSE - STUBBLE FIELD IN B.G.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The COOKS, Orientals in homburgs, serve from planks thrown across sawhorses. The hands cuff and push each other around as they wash up. The water, brought up fresh in wagons from the wells, makes them gasp. An ice wagon and a fire truck are parked nearby.
Most sit on the ground to eat, under awnings or beach umbrellas dotted around the field like toadstools. The Belvedere is visible miles away on the horizon.
Bill is carrying Abby's lunch to her when a loutish DUTCH MAN makes a crack.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DUTCHMAN
</p><p id="dia">Your sister keep you warm at night?
Bill throws a plate of stew at him and they are quickly in a fight. No fists are used, just food. The others pull them apart. Bill storms away, flicking mashed potatoes off his shirt.

He seems a little surprised when she does not reject this idea out of hand. Perhaps he fears that if she ever did go back, he might never see her again.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">What's the matter?
She begins to cry. He takes her in his arms.

Iany moment and sweep the crops flat, or a dry wind shrivel them up.Animals--snakes and gophers, rabbits and foxes--dart through the field into the deep of the wheat, not realizing their sanctuary is growing ever smaller as the reapers make their rounds. The moment will come when they will every one be killed with rakes and flails.
The wheat changes colors in the wind, like velvet. As the sun drops toward the horizon a dew sets, making the straw hard to cut. Benson fires his pistol. A vine of smoke sinks lazily through the sky. As the workers move off, the fields grow vast and inhospitable.
Oil wells can be seen here and there amid the grain.

Bill works on the straw pile at the back of the machine, in a soft rain of chaff, spreading it out with a pitchfork. 
Ursula helps stoke the tractor with coal and water. When nothing is required of her she sneaks off to burrow in the straw. 
Gingerbread on the eaves of the tractors gives them a Victorian appearance. Tall flags mark their position in the field.
Abby moves quickly, without a moment's rest, sewing up the

My problem has always been not having the education. I bullshitted
my way into school. They gave me a test. It was ridiculous. I got in fights. Ended up paying for a window. They threw me out. Don't blame them either. Still, I wanted to make something of myself. I mean, guys look at
you across a desk, you know what they're thinking. So I went in
the mill. Couldn't wait to get in there. Begin at seven, got to have a smile on your face. Didn't work out, though. No matter what you do, sometimes
things just don't go right. It gets to you after a while. It gives you that feeling,  "Oh hell, what's the use?"

</p><p id="dia">My dad told me, forget what the people around you are doing. You got enough to worry about without considering what somebody else does. Otherwise you get fouled up. He used to say (tapping his temple)
"All you got is this." Only one day you wake up, find you're not the smartest guy in the world, never going to come up with the big score. I really believed when I was growing up that somehow I would. I worked like a bastard in that mill. I felt all right about it, though. I felt that somewhere along the line somebody would see I had that special gleam. "Hey, you, come over here." So then I'd go.

Bill closes his eyes as he feels the soft fur of the rabbit. Ursula looks around to make sure Chuck is gone, then wings a roll at Bill. It bounces off his forehead. He retaliates with a pat of butter.

grand, admires him for it.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

</p><p id="dia">I have a headache. I probably should've worn a hat.
Abby rolls her eyes at this improvisation. No sooner does Chuck turn his back than Bill's hand darts out to touch her breast. He snatches it away a moment before Chuck turns back.
Together they walk into the living room.

Bill catches Abby's eyes. He frowns at the idea of being cooped up with this Mormon all winter.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

Chuck looks at him blankly. None of these reasons seems to carry
much weight for him. Bill turns to Abby.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK (o.s.)
</p><p id="dia">One spoonful.
Bill walks around absentmindedly, inspecting Chuck's things, stealing whatever catches his fancy. A book, a paperweight, a bell--things he does not really want and has no use for. His conscience is clear, however; the sacrifices they are making excuse these little sins.
As Chuck walks in, Bill has pocketed a candlestick.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY

Chuck shrugs. Bill gives Abby a cold look and goes outside.

Chuck, who of course has seen the same things and more, raises a hand to silence him.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BENSON
</p><p id="dia">Don't believe me, then. You shouldn't. But why not check it out, sir? Hire a detective in Chicago. It won't cost much. What's there to lose?
Chuck's brow darkens as Benson goes on. For a moment we glimpse the anger that would be unleashed if ever he woke up. Somewhere he already knows the truth but refuses to acknowledge it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">You're talking about my wife.
And so Chuck, too, becomes an accomplice in the scheme.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BENSON

She holds a hairbrush out for him to see. He looks it over and  gives it back without comment. He finds a stain on the tabletop.

</p><p id="dia">Somebody's been staining this fake inlay with a water glass. Actually I don't blame them.
He walks around trying out more of Chuck's appurtenances. Abby, caught up, models a shawl before an imaginary mirror. She blows a kiss at herself.

Abby puts on her wedding bracelet and admires it. Bill softens at the sight of her beauty, properly adorned.

He holds out the tip of his little finger. They laugh, as though they suddenly felt the absurdity of all this make-believe.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

She touches his face sympathetically, as though to say that she knows the pain this was causing him.

Little by little the newcomers have done the house over from the austere structure that it was. Living room furniture has been moved out onto the front lawn and there arranged as though by a child. Goats sleep on the divan. Archery targets hang from the side of the house. The porch is covered with a striped awning, bird cages and twirls of bunting.

Suddenly he worries this might discourage Chuck from going.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

He offers a taste of the talk Chuck is like to provoke on the street corners.

</p><p id="dia">"Hey, hey, hey. Who's this here, fresh out of the African Jungle,
moving down the sidewalk with a whowhowho, taking ten feet at a step
and making all the virgins run for cover? Why, it's Big Rhino, the

Bill steps back and sees, as though for the first time, how imposing Chuck really is.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">You are big, aren't you? Sunny Jim! You must've had a real moose
for an old lady.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY

But Chuck holds none of this against him. He knows it comes from respect.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

</p><p id="dia">What a sorry outfit! Bunch of old ladies. You better stay behind.

But when the time comes, I'm out of here. Hit the road, Toad!
Ursula passes the sandwiches around until there is just
one left, Miss Carter's. While the others are talking,
she scoops up a handful of dirt and pours it into the middle.
Bill, lighting a cigarette, notices Chuck's hand on Abby's.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Ever seen a match burn twice?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK

Bill blows out the match and touches Chuck's hand with
the hot ember, causing him to yank it away.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">That's old.
Chuck starts to cough. Bill looks at Abby, then whips the handkerchief out of his pocket and puts it over his nose, as though to keep from getting Chuck's germs.
Miss Carter's face goes blank as she bites into her sandwich.
She jumps up and rushes back into the house. Chuck frowns.
Bill glares at Ursula, then turns to Chuck and, referring to the dead prairie grass which runs through the front yard right up to the house, continues:
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">You ever thought of putting in some fescue here? Some fescue grass?
Of course, it might not take in this soil.
Chuck stands up and winds a stole, a long religious scarf, around his neck.

She is cold to discourage false expectations in him--and because she feels that she at least owes Bill this. Chuck, however, assumes the fault must be his own. His naivete about women, and the world in general, protects
the conspirators--and protects him, too, for he glimpses enough of the truth not to want to know any more.

Abby and Bill hold hands. Chuck by now is accustomed to such displays. They seem, however, to make Abby increasingly uncomfortable.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">175	MOVING TRAIN - THEIR POVS
</p><p></p><p id="act">The train bursts past at twenty yards, its great light rolling like a lunatic eye. Bill's heart pounds with excitement. Chuck holds Abby by the waist. Ursula waves a handkerchief... They cannot make out anything specific in the windows, but there is the sense of people going more important places, getting on with the serious business of their lives - while out here they stagnate.
Dimly visible, on the back platform of the caboose, a MAN in a frock coat salutes them with his cane.
The train has quickly vanished into the declining sun. Everything is quiet again. Ursula rushes up the grade to collect some pennies she laid on the tracks.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Did you see him wave?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK

</p><p id="dia">I saw!  He had a hat on.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

They walk back to the buggy. Ursula holds up a dead snake she found on the tracks.

vinegar.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">That was the President, shortie. Wake up.
Bill watches Chuck help Abby into the buggy. She is laughing about something or other. His hand lingers for a moment on hers. She does not brush it aside, as once she might have, but to Bill's dismay, presses
it against her breast. Chuck seems to have breathed a hope into her that he, Bill, was never able to.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">176	EXT. FIELDS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abby and Ursula race across the fields trying to fly a kite. Ursula rides a tiny Shetland pony. Just as the wind lifts the kite away, they run into Bill.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY

She touches his cheek. He brushes her hand away.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY

Some buffalo appear on the crest of the next hill. Abby looks at them. They do not seem quite part of this world but mythical, like minotaurs.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">I forgot. Anyway it doesn't matter. What are you doing, always trying

Bill paces around, disgusted with himself and the whole situation.

</p><p id="spkdir">(pause) 
</p><p id="dia">You and him. Why do I have to spell it out? I thought it would be all

They stare at each other in silence for a moment.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">I think so. Why?
Bill shrugs. Chuck welcomes this opportunity to speak of his wife. He considers Bill a good friend, in fact the only person with whom he can talk about delicate matters.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">I want to get her something nice for Christmas.
Bill, who means to kill Chuck the first chance he gets, forgets this intention for a moment to give him advice.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="spkdir">(thoughtfully)
</p><p id="dia">She likes to draw. Maybe some paints. Nothing too expensive--

</p><p id="dia">I know. You told me.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Actually, I didn't, but I could have. The point I'm making is you've got
to understand how they operate. Get them thinking you can take it or
leave it, you're usually okay.
Suddenly the dogs stop rigid, on point. At Chuck's hiss they sink into the  grass.
Bill looks at Chuck's exposed back. Nobody would know. It could be made to seem like a hunting accident. He cocks the hammer of his shotgun. His heart pounds wildly. Chuck talks in a low voice to the dogs.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK (o.s.)
</p><p id="dia">All right, put them up, girl.
The dogs rise and inch toward the birds, as slowly as the minute hand of a clock. All at once the quail explode out of hiding. Bill jumps at the noise. Chuck fires twice. Two birds fall. The retriever notes where. Chuck turns around.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">Why aren't you shooting? I left you those two on the left.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">They caught me off guard.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">You have to keep your gun up.
Chuck walks ahead. The music builds a mood of tension. Bill takes a practice shot into the ground. Bill looks around. There is nobody in sight. He turns the sights on Chuck's back. It would be simple enough.
Though only twenty feet away, he closes the gap, to make sure he does not miss.
Chuck whistles the scattered birds back to their covey. "Pheo! Pheo!" Soon, faint and far away, comes a reply-the sweet, pathetic whistle of the quail lost in a forest of grass. The mother bird utters a low "all is well."
One by one, near and far, the note is taken up, and they begin to return.
Bill holds his breath. His finger moves inside the trigger guard. He only has to squeeze a fraction of an inch. Three more birds shoot out of the grass. Chuck fires. At first we think Bill has, but he cannot stoop this low. He does not have the heart. Disgusted, he throws his gun on the ground. Both barrels go off. Chuck snaps around, startled and concerned. Bill is
shaking like a leaf.

</p><p id="dia">What's the matter? What are you so upset about?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

Chuck shows Bill his knife. Bill reads a name off the handle.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

He gets up, his nostrils flaring with anger. Chuck thinks this indignance is on his behalf.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK

Bill throws down the pheasant he was plucking.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK

He would like Chuck to know the truth but does not want theresponsibility for revealing it. He must find out by accident.

The troupe is putting on a show to earn its supper. ONE of them stands behind the viewers -- Abby and Bill, Chuck and Ursula -- cranking a carbide projector by hand. A silent movie appears on the screen, full of extraordinary pratfalls, disappearances and other tricks of the early
cinema. Chuck has never seen anything remotely like this.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK (o.s.)
</p><p id="dia">How'd they do that? Where'd he go? There must be a wire. Etc.
He steps forward to inspect the screen, actually just a sheet hung along a clothesline, to see whether the image is coming from behind. Bill and Abby sit rapt as children, nostalgic for Chicago.

city ways. They are bored with her, all except the
youngest, GEORGE, a young pilot in a white scarf.

</p><p id="dia">We never hear a thing out here. It's like being on a boat in the
middle of a lake. You see things going on, but way far away, with no voices.

George puts his hand on hers. She snatches it away.
<b>GEORGE
</b>What's the matter? Aren't I your
type or something?
The Doubletalker pokes his fork into a pudding. A balloon, concealed beneath the surface, explodes to general delight. Down the table Abby and Bill chat with the Leader.

In their gaiety he carelessly puts a hand on Abby's leg.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The next morning Chuck looks down out his bedroom window.
The troupe is packing to leave. Still troubled, he walks to the bed and and stands over Abby.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">What's going on, Abby?
She does not respond. He yanks the sheet off. She is wearing a nightgown. She looks up and frowns. This is the first time she has ever seen him this way.

Abby jumps out of bed and assumes the offensive. She has no other choice.

She puts on a robe and walks out. Her last argument has worked best. Chuck never imagined he was in step with the times.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">191	EXT. BELVEDERE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abby slips out the front door. She looks around to make sure that Chuck is not watching her, then heads off to find Bill. The vaudevillians gorge themselves on last night's leftovers, steal flowers from the flower beds,
etc. ONE sits off by himself, playing a French horn.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">192	EXT. DORM

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Look what I traded off those clowns. For a bushel of corn!
She draws him by the arm behind a wall. She is trembling with fear.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Chuck is suspicious.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Chickie you mean? So what?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Really. This is the first time he's ever been like this. I'm scared.
All this flatters Chuck in a way Bill does not like.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">What for? Why're you so worried what he thinks?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">He could kill us. I want to live a long time, okay? I just got
started and I like it.
Bill shrugs, as though to say he can handle whatever Chuck can dish out and a little more.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">You might take a little responsibility here. You got us into all this.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Did I? Well, it never would've come up if you hadn't led him on.
Led Chickie on!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Is that the best you can do? Knowing you it probably is.
You've made a mess of our lives, okay. Don't pretend it was my
fault.
Bill combs his hair to calm himself down.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Why's this guy still hanging on like a goddamn snapping turtle?
Because of you. Boy, this was a great idea. Right up there

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Keep your voice down.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I heard what you said.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Then why'd you ask? Oh, how did I ever get mixed up with you?
Abby, in terror of Chuck's finding out, cannot understand why Bill seems to care so little.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">You've gone sweet on him. You have, haven't you?
Abby hesitates. Bill throws his knife away.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">I admire him. He's a good man.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Broad shoulders. I know. Very high morals. Why can't he talk
faster? It's like waiting for a hen to lay an egg.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">You wouldn't understand, though. He's not like you. You don't
know how people feel. You only think of yourself.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

out, tell me, will you? I'd appreciate it.
</p><p id="spkdir">(pause)
</p><p id="dia">Lord, but you do come on! You talking like this, used to play
around right under his nose. Somebody I met in a bar, remember?
Or maybe you walked in, thought it was a church. Well, I've had
it.I'm clearing out. You understand?
They look at each other for a moment.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Go ahead.
This is not what he expected to hear. But now his pride requires that he face the truth and not back down.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Okay.
He looks at her for a moment. He cannot be dealt with this way. He turns and walks off.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill stands on the ground below the master bedroom. Chuck leans out the window above him. Peacocks roost on the balcony, beneath the telescope. The vaudevillians are loading up their planes. Abby watches from the porch.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I'm going away for a while. They're giving me a lift.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">What for?
He shrugs.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I'm wearing one of your shirts. Let me take it off for you.

</p><p id="dia">Never mind.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I got my own. Just wasn't any clean today.
Bill takes off the shirt, drapes it over a post and walks off, hurt and angry, but with a sad dignity.
Chuck is not entirely sorry to see him go, nor is Abby; she knows that he is getting out just in time. One more episode like last night's and the fuse would hit the powder.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The vaudevillians are ready to take off. Bill boards the plane which George is piloting, wondering if today's break with Abby is real or just in anger, a necessary gesture. With him he carries his only possessions, a bindle and his trick rabbit. Abby, Chuck and Ursula look on.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">What's eating him?
Abby shrugs and walks down to Ursula.

</p><p></p><p id="act">They inspect a cave with a kerosene lantern. Blocks of ice, covered with burlap and sawdust, cool shelves of preserves.
Abby drops a stone into a dark pit. Two seconds pass before it hits the bottom.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Probably that's the first noise down there for thousands of years.
She speaks as though she had done it a favor. He puts his hand on hers. She presses it against her chest.

They round a corner and come upon an underground waterfall. It flows out of darkness back into darkness.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">202	INT. FORGE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill, meanwhile, stands in a line of panting, sweating IMMIGRANTS.
On their shoulders they carry the huge barrel of a cannon. With a grunt they drive it into the fiery mouth of a forge.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">203	EXT. CITY STREET
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill stands on the corner of a big city street, stamping his feet against the cold. He tries to catch a pigeon with some bread crumbs under a box propped up by a stick, but just as he pulls the string to drop the trap it darts
out of the way.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">204	BILL AND YOUNG GIRL

</p><p></p><p id="act">Enthralled, Abby surveys the wonders of Babylon and
Nineveh in a book about the Near East.
Ursula sits with a world globe, taking a geography lesson from a traveling TUTOR. No doubt this was Abby's idea.
Abby copies from a small plaster model of a Roman bust. She wants painfully to improve herself.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">208	EXT. BELVEDERE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abby, Ursula and Chuck are on a walk outside the Belvedere. The snow is gone. Abby's hands are stuffed in a chinchilla muff.
All at once they hear a distant noise like the whoops of an Indian war party. It seems mysteriously to come from every hilltop. Abby turns to Chuck with a puzzled look.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK

A PANHANDLER approaches them with a hard-luck story.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FRIEND
</p><p id="dia">Okay, here's a quarter, but give me some entertainment, okay?
Not this old song and dance.
While the Panhandler performs, Bill looks around.
Two POLICEMEN have appeared in the entryway talking with the LANDLADY. Bill edges out the back door and down the steps, as though they might be after him.
He walks briskly down the alley without looking back.

Into this dissolves an image of Abby writing in her diary.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">211	EXT. FIELD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Chuck swings a barometer round and round, checking the weather. Two Case tractors pitch across a field like boats on a rolling sea. Long plumes of smoke wind off behind them. Each tows a fourteen-gang plow. A third
tractor follows, putting in the seed.
Ursula chases a flock of blackbirds off with a big rattle.
Every acre of ground for as far as the eye can see is under cultivation.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY (o.s.)

His fingers strike the keys.

The camera holds and holds on the fields until in their vacant depths, we begin to sense the presence of a deep malevolence, still biding its time but growing every minute.
Seagulls--like strange emissaries from another world--glide back and forth over the fields in search of grasshoppers.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Bill!
She rushes up and embraces him, but her warmth just seems a tease to Bill. She is different. She looks different. The tutors and tailors Chuck has brought in over the winter have given her more polish. Her hair is nicely
coiffed. Where she used to dress in cotton shirtwaists, she wears crinolines now.

He feels humiliated at not having a stronger excuse. But he loves her. He aches with love. He hoped their last fight was just another storm in the romance. Evidently it was more.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY

At a shriek from Ursula, Bill turns around. She runs into his arms, and covers him with kisses.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">I've missed you! I thought about you every day. You should've written. Did Abby show you what she got?
Abby scowls at Ursula. With no choice but to show him, she opens the top button of her blouse and draws out a diamond necklace.

They are silent for a moment. Bill senses that nobody except Ursula is really glad to see him back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">How's Blackie?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Still hasn't wised up. Know what I mean? He asked how you were
doing, though.
</p><p id="spkdir">(pause)
</p><p id="dia">I told him. Ran into Sam, too. He'd been in a fight.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Oh yeah?
Bill can see that her interest is only polite. He knows that he should turn around and leave, but he cannot. The sight of him with his confidence gone is painful to behold.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">His nose was like this.
He pushes his nose to one side. Ursula and Abby laugh.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">228	EXT. STOCK POND
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill plants willow slips in the soft earth by the stock pond. Ursula orders a dog around.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">Look at this dog mind me. Sit! You've got to say it like hitting a nail.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Has she asked you anything about me?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">No.
Ursula flirts with him, running the shoots along his back.
She waits to see what he will do. He gets up and after a short chase catches her. He holds her at arm's length for a moment, then kisses her.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">What'd you do that for?
Bill wonders himself. To get revenge on Abby? He touches her breast.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">Don't.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Why not?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">Cause there's nothing there.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I can be the judge of that.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA

He kisses her neck.

</p><p id="dia">What do I have to say to convince you? You tell me, I'll say it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">What makes you think I would?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Nothing.
She giggles and kisses him back. But guilt has caught up with him. He cannot go ahead.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">What's the matter?
No reply.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA 
</p><p id="dia">Maybe it would be wrong.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">229	BILL'S POV - OUTSIDE THE BELVEDERE - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Chuck and Abby sit in their cozy living room playing Parcheesi. The sound of their voices is muffled. The camera draws back to reveal Bill outside the window, watching.
She is comfortable with Chuck now. Apparently, he has lost his place in her heart. He wants to rush in and drag her away.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">230	EXT. BEDROOM WINDOW - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Later that night he stands under the bedroom window and wonders at the meaning of the shadows that flicker across the ceiling. After a moment he withdraws into the darkness.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">231	EXT. SMALL PRAIRIE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill has brought Abby into a nearby town to make some purchases. Dressed in a chauffeur's gown and goggles, he sits against the fender of the Overland watching her move from store to store. Ursula is with her.
The TOWNSPEOPLE all speak German. Their peasant costumes are freely mixed with Western dress. The signs are old German script. Two MEN carry a huge bulb through the street, to put atop a church.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">232	OVERLAND AUTO
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abby walks up with Ursula.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">Listen, I'm going to stay and go back with the laundry wagon.
Abby looks at Bill, then nods okay. Ursula runs off. Bill opens the door, and she gets in.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">233	EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE TOWN (DUCK LAKE)
</p><p></p><p id="act">They are stopped on the road a hundred yards outside the town.
Abby smokes as Bill checks the radiator. Something in his behavior leads us to suspect he may have staged this stop.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">How you been doing?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Me? Fine.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">We don't talk so much these days.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">I know.
She knows what he wants. She cannot give it anymore.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I said a lot of stupid things before I went off.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="spkdir">(politely)
</p><p id="dia">I forgot about it already.
Bill, trying his best to make peace with her, cannot help seeing that she would like to keep things as they are--and not because she harbors any grudge.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">You've forgiven me?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">There was nothing to forgive.
He holds a bottle of liquor out to her.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">What're you worried about?
She takes a swig. He laughs. She laughs back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">So how'm I doing with you?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Fine.
He takes her hand and holds it like a trapped bird.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">What's happened?
She shrugs, disengaging her hand to brush aside her hair. She is painfully aware of his suffering but doesn't have the heart to tell him how it all is.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I probably ought to leave. I will.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Already? You just got here.
She hasn't really contradicted him. He leans forward as though to kiss her. She lets him. She wishes that she could give herself to him, but she doesn't know what is right. Then, a sudden impulse of panic, she gets up and backs away.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Where you going?
He reaches out to catch her. She breaks away and starts to run. He walks quickly after her, cutting off any escape toward the town.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Why'd you have to come back?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I'm not going to hurt you. I only want to talk with you.
She stops and hides her face in her hands. He gently pulls them away.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I didn't come back to make trouble for you. I guess we were fooling
each other to think it could last. I mean, What was I offering youanyhow? A ride to the bottom. Looking at you now, in the right  clothes and everything, I see how crazy I was and--well, I understand. It's okay. I sort of cut my own throat, actually.
Her eyes close and her legs give in. Bill lets her go and backs off a step in surprise. She sinks to the ground, as though in a trance.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">234	TIGHT ON BILL
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill, taken by surprise, goes up and kneels down beside her. He looks to see that she is okay. He picks a fox-tail out of her hair. Her dress has worked up toward her knees. He pulls it back down. He wants to caress 
her face but hesitates.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">How'd we let it happen, Abby? We were so happy once. Why didn't we starve? I love you so much. What have1 done? You're so beautiful. What have I done?
He touches his lips for a fraction of a second to hers, notices another car approaching down the road. He picks her up like a doll and carries her back to the Overland.

She touches his face in a surge of sympathy. What has she done to him? He kisses her neck and leads her toward the front door.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">236	CRANE TO CHUCK
</p><p></p><p id="act">The camera rises to the uppermost story of the Belvedere. Chuck has seen them. Hot tears leap to his eyes. Before Bill left for the winter he often observed such intimacies between them. Now it all looks different.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">237	CHUCK'S POVS (HIGH ANGLES)
</p><p></p><p id="act">He looks around at his estate--his barn, his auto, his great house and his granary. None of them is any consolation now. Far a moment it seems to him as though he lived here in some time long past.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">238	INT. BEDROOM

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">No.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Will you hand me that magazine?
He gives her the magazine she wants.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">What's the matter?
He seems for a moment to consider telling her, then shrugs and goes downstairs.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">239	INT. LIVING ROOM
</p><p></p><p id="act">He stumbles into a bird cage but hardly notices. The jostled birds raise a fuss.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">240	EXT. FRONT PORCH
</p><p></p><p id="act">He runs into Bill on the front porch.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I've been looking for you. I have to take off again, real soon here, and...
Chuck puts a hand on Bill's shoulder, stopping him. They look at each other for a moment, then he passes on. Bill seems puzzled.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">241	EXT. FIELDS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Chuck walks out into the deep of his fields. The wheat, a warm dry gold, is almost ready to take in. He sits down and rests his head against a 
furrow, powerless to think. The wind makes a song in the infinitude of sweet clicking heads.
He puts his hands over his heart and breathes in gasps, with the dumb honesty of a wounded animal. He could not himself quite say what it is that he knows.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">242	EXT. BONANZA - SERIES OF ANGLES
</p><p></p><p id="act">Late that afternoon disaster strikes as a swarm of locusts sweeps down on the bonanza. We do not see where they come from. They seem to appear out of nowhere, unnoticed. Ursula works in the kitchen, Bill by the barn. Chuck lies asleep in the field, Abby upstairs in bed.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">243	ANIMALS ON BONANZA
</p><p></p><p id="act">The animals sense it first. The buffalo move off in a mass. The horses become uncontrollable. One runs around the barn in a panic. Bill watches it, puzzled.
Two peacocks have a fight.
A dog in the treadmill races in vain to escape, driving the machine to a feverish pitch. The shadow of a giant cloud licks over the hills.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">244	EXT. FIELDS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Everything seems normal in the fields.
Then, as you listen, a strange new sound begins to rise from them, a wild sea-like singing. As the camera moves over the fields and down into the wheat it swells in a crescendo until...
</p><p></p><p id="slug">245	TIGHT ON LOCUSTS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Suddenly we see them up close, devouring the stalks in a fever, the noise of their jaws magnified a thousand times.
They slip into the Belvedere, under the sash and wainscoting, turning up first in places it would seem they could never get into: a jewelry case, the back of a radio, the works of a music box, a bottle with a miniature ship inside, etc.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">246	EXTREME CLOSEUPS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Their eyes are dumb and implacable. They seem to have a whole hidden life of their own.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">247	INT. KITCHEN
</p><p></p><p id="act">Little by little they gather in numbers. Ursula first sees one on the drainboard. She swats it with a newspaper. Others sprout up. One by one she picks them up with a tongs and drops them into the stove. This method
is too slow. She begins to use her fingers. She moves with a quick, nervous energy, even as she understands this is futile. At last claustro-phobia seizes her. She spins around with a shriek, lashing out at everything in sight.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">248	INT. MASTER BEDROOM
</p><p></p><p id="act">In the bedroom overhead, Abby wakes up from one nightmare into another. She jumps out of bed and goes to the window. The locusts pelt against the pane like shot. She throws the bolt. Suddenly a crack shoots through the glass. She jumps back and watches in horror as a sliver of the pane falls in. They are free to enter.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">249	SERIES OF ANGLES
</p><p></p><p id="act">Suddenly they are everywhere: on the clothesline, in the pantry, in hats and shoes and the seams of clothing. Not a nook or cranny is safe from penetration.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">250	TIGHT ON CHUCK - SLOW MOTION
</p><p></p><p id="act">Chuck, asleep in the deep of the wheat, bolts up in slow motion. His hair is seething with them.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">251	EXT. BONANZA - FURTHER ANGLES
</p><p></p><p id="act">Panic hits the bonanza. Workers tie string around their pant cuffs to keep the insects from crawling up their legs, then rush out to the fields with gongs, rattles, pot lids, scarecrows on sticks, drums and horns and 
other noisemakers to scare them off.
Some pray. Others run around like madmen, stamping and yelling, ignored by the gathering host. A couple get into a fistfight.
A storm flag is run up the flagpole. A tractor blasts out an S.O.S. The peacocks huddle under the stoop.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">252	TIGHT ON CHUCK

</p><p></p><p id="slug">255	INT. MASTER BEDROOM

</p><p></p><p id="slug">256	CHUCK AND BENSON
</p><p></p><p id="act">Benson reports back to Chuck. A team of horses races by, nearly bowling them over.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BENSON
</p><p id="dia">We can't get the machines out. They're jamming up the gears.
There's a good chance they'll pass on south, though. Unless...

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BENSON
</p><p id="dia">They'll set down and walk in.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The locusts devour not just the crops but every organic thing: pitchfork handles, linens on the clothesline, leather traces, flowers in the window boxes, etc. Soon a large area of wheat is eaten down to stubble.
Bill looks away from a tree for a second. When he turns back it has been stripped to a wintry bareness.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">258	EXT. WIND GENERATOR, OTHER ANGLES
</p><p></p><p id="act">The vanes of the wind generator begin gently to stir. Little by little the wind picks up. A dust devil spins across the yard. The grass lists by the well. A power line moans.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">259	EXT. FIELDS
</p><p></p><p id="act">As the sun dips below the horizon, the locusts pour in like a living river, walking along the ground like a procession of Army ants. The roar of their wings is deafening. The air hisses and pops with their electric frenzy.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">262	SAME FIELDS - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">The wind has picked up. Chuck, Bill and Abby have come out to the fields with a dozen WORKERS to investigate the extent of the damage. The insects buzz around blindly in the light of their lanterns, which they carry Japanese-fashion at the ends of cane poles.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">263	TIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Chuck inspects the grain.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">There's nothing we can do but wait. They're either going to take it all or they're not.
He covers his face with his hands. The others shy back at this display of grief, startling in one so formal. Their jostled lanterns cast a dance of lights.
Bill, moved to real sympathy, takes him by the shoulders.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Come on. They might still lift. Hey, I've seen a wind like this lay
down and die. Don't give up now.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="spkdir">(ignoring him)
</p><p id="dia">We could at least make sure they don't get the people on south.
He breaks open the mantle of his lantern, still unsure what he should do. Some of the flaming kerosene splashes onto the crops nearby, setting them ablaze. Bill drops his rattle and swats the fire out with his coat.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">What're you doing? Watch it! What're you, crazy? There's
still a chance, don't you see?
Chuck goes to his horse. Bill grabs him by the sleeve. Does he really mean to set the fields on fire? Chuck pushes him aside. Bill, frantic, turns to the others for support.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Stop him, or it's all going up.
They, however, are too uncertain of their ground to intervene. Chuck turns on Bill.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">What does it matter to you?
Chuck slings fire out of the broken lantern onto the crops next to Bill -- a sudden, hostile gesture that catches them all by surprise. Independent of his will, the truth is forcing its way up, like a great blind fish from the bottom of the sea.
He slings the fire out again. A patch lands on Bill's pantleg. Bill slaps it out.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">What's got into you?
They stare at each other. Bill backs off like a cat, sensing Chuck knows the truth, but at a loss to understand how he could.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">Why do you care? I gave my life for this land.
Chuck walks towards him. Suddenly Bill turns and takes off running. Chuck swings at him with the lantern. Bill escapes behind the building wall of flame that springs up between them.
The whirr of the locusts stops for a moment--they seem at times to have a collective mind--then, just as mysteriously, resumes.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Stop, Chuck!
Chuck leaps on his horse. She tries to drag him off but is thrown aside and almost trampled underfoot. Now the others join in, trying to knock away the lantern or catch his stirrup. He eludes them and rides off after Bill,  leaving a slash of flame behind him in the grain. They tear off their coats to swat it out, in vain--already it stretches a hundred yards.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">264	BILL
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill runs through the night, still carrying his lantern. Chuck bears down on him. Abby chases along behind him, screaming for him to stop.
Bill realizes the lantern is giving his position away He blows it out and vanishes from sight. All we can see is the thundering horseman, sowing fire.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">265	CRANE SHOT
</p><p></p><p id="act">With a rough idea where Bill is, Chuck begins to lay a ring of fire around him, fifty yards in diameter.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">266	BILL AND ABBY INSIDE RING
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abby spots Bill against the flames. She rushes up, gasping. They have been caught inside the ring.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">What're you doing? This is a bad place to talk
He throws his coat over Abby's head, picks her up by the waist and crashes through the flame. They have to shout to make themselves understood. The locusts roar like a cyclone.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Did you see that? He was trying to burn me. What's got into him?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">He knows. He must.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">A whole year's work. All wasted! These bugs, once they make up

Bill stalls. The fire races toward them through the wheat. They appear as silhouettes against it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I need to get out of here. I think you probably should, too.  
</p><p id="spkdir">(pause)

He leaves. Abby wonders if she ought to run after him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY  
</p><p id="dia">Bill!
But this moment's hesitation has been too long. Already he is swallowed up in the night, her voice swept away in the roar of the flame and the locusts, who seem to wail louder now, and with a great mournfulness--like keening Arab women--as if they knew the fate shortly to envelop
them.
Abby turns back. She, too, has reason to fear Chuck and must escape.

His face, black with soot, looks gruesome in the gas1ight. The locusts have chewed up his clothes.

Outside the window fires rage along half the horizon. He sits down. He wants to sob, but cannot.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">You're so wonderful. How could you do this?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY

</p><p id="dia">All right. I'm going away. You'll never have to see me again.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">Away?
He gets up, suddenly alarmed, walks to the mantel and opens a chest.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">What're you doing?
Chuck drapes his neck with the stole he used in slaughtering the hog. Her face goes empty. He gets his razor strop from the shaving basin. She shrinks back in the corner. He looks at her for a moment, then leaves the room. 
</p><p></p><p id="slug">276	INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Where are you doing? Chuck! What are you doing? I won't  
let you! Come back!
Again he throws her aside, and again she keeps after him, desperate to prevent any harm coming to Bill. Finally he picks her up and drags her outside.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">277	EXT. PORCH - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">He lashes her with a rope to a column of the porch. She struggles vainly to free herself. Does he intend to use the razor on her?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">No, Chuck! Please, darling! It wasn't his fault. It was mine.
Let him go. I love you, Chuck. Do anything, only please... 
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK

He stuffs a handkerchief in her mouth and leaves.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">278	TIGHT ON CHUCK - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Chuck wanders through the night with a lantern, calling his mare.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">279	EXT. BURNT-OUT FIELDS - DAWN
</p><p></p><p id="act">Dawn breaks. Chuck rides over the burnt-out fields looking for Bill. The feet of his lank white mare are wrapped to the fetlock in wet burlap, to protect them from the smouldering grass. It prances warily along, without
making a sound, wreathed in a mist of blue smoke. With him he carries a stool. The camera pans up to the smoke which is carrying his fortune off.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">280	CHUCK'S POVS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Burnt, blind deer stand and look at him in utter terror, as though they understood his intentions. The roasted corpses of sharptail grouse, coyotes and badgers lie scattered here and there. Piles of dung burn on after the grass is out.
A peacock from the Belvedere wanders around, angry and
perplexed.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">281	BILL
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill is repairing his motorbike by a rock in the middle of the scorched landscape. The tires are soft as licorice from the heat. Suddenly, he looks up. Chuck has found him.
He jumps behind the handlebars and fishtails off. Chuck breaks into a gallop, rides him down, knocks him to the ground with the stool, dismounts and stamps in the spokes of the front wheel to make sure he goes no further.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Who do you think you are? Now you've ruined it. What's got
into you?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK
</p><p id="dia">Where you headed?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Why do I have to tell you? I can come and go when I like.
This is still a free country, last I heard.
Bill stops when he sees the stool. Chuck calmly strops the razor on his stirrup flap. There are no secrets now.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">What can I say? Too late for apologies. You've got a right
to hate me.
Chuck puts the razor away and advances on Bill with the stool.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I want to leave. You won't ever see me again. I already got what
I deserve.
There is nothing Bill can say to appease him. This will be a fight to the death. Chuck lashes out with the stool. Bill ducks too late.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Watch it!
Chuck comes at him again. Bill throws a punch, but Chuck blocks it and knocks him down again with the stool.
Bill reels back and cracks his head on the bicycle frame. This time he stays down. Satisfied the struggle is over, Chuck goes back to get some rope.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">282	NEW ANGLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Chuck shuts his eyes to mumble a prayer of absolution--in Russian.
Bill in a panic, snaps a spoke out of the broken wheel and lays it against his sleeve.
Chuck moves in for the kill. Bill gets to his feet. He wants to run but fear makes his knees like water. Suddenly, they are face to face. Chuck swings at Bill with the stool but misses. Bill lifts the spoke above him and
drives it deep into Chuck's heart.
Chuck gasps. Bill seems just as shocked. Chuck sits down to determine the gravity of his injury. Blood jets rhythmically out the end of the spoke, as though from a straw. Bill circles him, unbelieving.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Should I pull it out?
Chuck puts his finger over the end of the spoke. Blood seeps out the side of his mouth, like sap from a broken stem.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I better get somebody.
He tries to catch the reins of Chuck's horse, but it shies out of reach, its conscience repelled. He looks back at Chuck in anguish.  What has he done?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">You were my friend.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">283	TIGHT ON BILL AND HIS POVS
</p><p></p><p id="act">The Belvedere is visible on the horizon. Bill hesitates
a moment, then heads back on foot to find Abby. He gives
Chuck a wide berth.
Then, on a ridge in the distance, he spots Benson.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Get a doctor! Fast!
How much did he see? Bill does not stay to find out but
takes off running, though not without first collecting his
rabbit.
Benson, meanwhile, bounds down the hill to Chuck's side.
His left sleeve has been burned away. The flesh beneath
is the color of a raw steak.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">284	CHUCK'S POVS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Chuck sees the smoke from his fields, the burnt deer,
a circling hawk.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">285	TIGHT ON CHUCK
</p><p></p><p id="act">He breathes in gulps. His eyes are blank, like a child's
marbles. He takes Benson's hand.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CHUCK  
</p><p id="spkdir">(weakly)
</p><p id="dia">Wasn't his fault. Tell her...forgive them.
The locusts can be heard no more. The prairie makes a
sound like the ocean. Chuck turns his back and dies.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">286	TIGHT ON BENSON
</p><p></p><p id="act">Benson weeps. Whether or not he understood Chuck's last
wishes, he seems unlikely to abide by them.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">287	EXT. BELVEDERE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill finds Abby bound to the house like the figurehead
of a ship. He cuts her loose. The ropes fall at her feet. She is free. 
They look at each other for a moment.
Then, in a rush of compassion for them all, she throws
her arms around him.
Bill wonders if she is taking him back. Might their
differences all have been a terrible misunderstanding?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">We have to hurry. Chuck's out looking right now. Oh, Bill,
what have we done? He took his razor. We need to hurry. He
might be coming back any minute.
Bill mentions nothing of his encounter. She grabs her
bindle, Bill a handful of silverware and an umbrella.
After a moment's hesitation, he puts them back.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">288	NEW ANGLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">They run down to the barn, where the cars are stored.
The saplings in the front yard have been stripped even
of their bark. Abby stops to look back at the Belvedere
one last time. Chuck does not want her anymore. How
could she expect him to?
Bill grabs her by the hand and tugs her along.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">289	EXT. BARN
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abby throws open the doors of the barn. Bill cranks up
the engine of the Overland.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Will the cops be looking for us, too?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Probably.
Abby stands in the door. She is reluctant to leave, though she 
knows they must.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Get in.
She notices that Bill's lip is cut, his shirt soaked with
blood.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">What happened to you? Where's this from?
Bill looks down. He forgot.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Had an accident.
She looks at him for a moment, not quite trusting this
explanation. The engine catches with a noise like start-
led poultry. Bill gets behind the wheel. Just as they
are pulling out of the garage, Ursula runs up, black 
as coal from battling the fire all night.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">URSULA
</p><p id="dia">Where you going?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="spkdir">(breathless)

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL 
</p><p id="dia">Just do what I say. Why're you always arguing about everything?

Bill gives Ursula his wallet and a kiss. Abby gives her a hug.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">290	EXT. BURNT GRASS
</p><p></p><p id="act">They roar off through the burnt grass of the prairie.
Abby waves goodbye.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">291	THEIR POV (MOVING)
</p><p></p><p id="act">As they crest a ridge, Benson appears in front of them,
waving a hand to flag them down. Bill puts his foot on
the gas. Benson sees they are not going to stop and fires
at then with a pistol. Bill grabs a shotgun from a scab-
bard under the dash and fires back. Nobody is hurt.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">What's the matter with him?
Bill shrugs. Inside he feels a great relief. They are
free at last. At last he has her back.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">292	EXT. BONANZA GATES

</p><p></p><p id="slug">293	EXT. SHACK ON RIVER
</p><p></p><p id="act">They have come to a lone shack on the river, a drinking
house for passing boatmen. They negotiate (in pantomime)
with the PROPRIETOR for a tiny steam boat moored at the
end of the pier. When the car is not enough, Abby throws
in her necklace.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">294	ABOARD THE BOAT

</p><p></p><p id="slug">295	TIGHT ON NECKLACE

they are leaving behind evidence that could betray them.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">296	EXT. BOAT ON RIVER - AND MOVING POVS
</p><p></p><p id="act">They glide along in the hush of evening. The reeds are
full of deer. Cranes, imprudently tame, dance on the
sand bars.
Bill looks around in wonder. He knows these may be his
last days on earth. Abby throws a sounding line.
A COUPLE from a local farm seeks privacy in the willows.
Other BOATMEN glide past in silence. A CHILD plays a
fiddle on the deck of a scow. HUNTERS creep along the
shore in search of waterfowl.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">297	EXT. CAMP - DUSK
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill sleeps under a tarp. Abby looks out across the water
and bursts into sobs. She has wronged Chuck and thrown
her life away.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">298	THEIR POVS (MOVING) - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">They shine a lamp into the murky depths and spear pickerel
with a hammered-out fork.
Strange rocks loom up and give way to wide moonlit fields.
They have the sense of entering places where nobody has
been since the making of the world.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">299	EXT. FARMHOUSE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Four LAWMEN, in pursuit, interrogate some FARMERS. Have

border of black crepe at the corners.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">300	EXT. ABOARD THE BOAT - DUSK
</p><p></p><p id="act">They drift idly on the flood. The phonograph is playing
in the stern. Abby is back in trousers. Bill points to
a white house on the shore, an image of comfort and peace.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I used to want a set-up like that. Something like that, I thought,
and you'd really have it made. Now I don't care. I just wish
we could always live this way.
He sees that her mind is somewhere else. He wants to tell
her the truth about Chuck, for intimacy's sake, but it
would just put more of a cloud over everything. It might
even cause her to hate him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Maybe you want to write him a  letter.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">I hadn't thought of that.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="spkdir">(shaking her head)
</p><p id="dia">Too late for that. I could never face him again.
They look at each other for a moment. He touches her face,
to show that he does not hold it against her. She touches
him back. They only have each other now. They must save
what moments they can.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL

Bill is caught off guard. Before he can make a move she
throws it far out into the river. They laugh, without
knowing why, at this extravagance.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">302	EXT. SHORE .. TRACKING SHOTS
</p><p></p><p id="act">They gather May apples and black haws. The music from

Abby, afterwards, lies in a naked daze. The damp greens

</p><p></p><p id="slug">304	THEIR POV - ON CITY ON RIVER - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rounding a bend in the river that night, they come upon
the lights of a great city. They have doused the running
lamp. Except for a faint groaning of the trees along the
shore, the river is silent, conveying the sounds of the
city to them from across a great distance -- bells, joy-
ful voices, horns, the chirping of brakes, etc.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">305	EXT. CITY STREETS AND THEIR POVS - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">They sneak down an alley.
There are signs of life behind a few windows, but the

Suddenly, they come upon a POLICEMAN making his rounds.
They let him pass, then cut through a vacant lot back
to the boat.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">306	EXT. RIVER FRONT - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">The next morning finds them camped in a thicket on the river
front below a factory.
Bill wakes up, mysteriously happy. Their blankets are heavy
with dew. Overhead, finches tilt from branch to branch. A
light wind rushes through the leaves. Whatever his trou-
bles, they seem very small to him in the great. scheme of
things.
He looks at Abby, mouthing silent words in her sleep.
He puts on a white scarf and starts down to the boat. The
slope is strewn with sodden cartons, burnt bricks and burst
mattresses, an avalanche of urban excreta.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">307	HIS POV
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abruptly he stops. Two POLICE OFFICERS are combing over the
boat. They have not seen him. He edges back. Suddenly, there is yelling on the hill above them. Bill looks up. Benson is calling him to the attention of a car-load of POLICEMEN pulling up beside him. The Officers at the boat now spot him, too, and open fire. Bill darts like
a rabbit into the thicket.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">308	TIGHT ON ABBY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Abby bolts awake. Bill jumps down beside her, breathless,
and begins looking frantically for the shells to his shotgun.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY
</p><p id="dia">Who? What're you talking about?  Stop a minute.
He covers her with his body as bullets zoom through the
undergrowth. His face is close to hers. She bursts into
tears.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">Don't get shot. Look for me under that next bridge down. 
After dark.
He empties out the contents of his pockets -- a watch, a
couple of dollars in change, a ring -- and slaps them down
in front of her.
The Police fan out along the ridge above them. He jams a
flare pistol into his belt and kisses her goodbye--after
a moment's hesitation -- on the cheek. She tries in vain
to hold him back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BILL
</p><p id="dia">I wish I could tell you how much

</p><p></p><p id="slug">309	EXT. MUD FLAT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill runs from the thicket down to the water. The Police
have bunched on the other side. It seems he might be able
to escape. Keeping low, he splashes across a mud flat.
Suddenly he runs into a trot line that a fisherman has
left out overnight. The hooks bite into his thigh and
shoulder, yanking a string of startled, thrashing catfish
out of the water.
He keeps running in a panic, not realizing the line is
staked to the shore. All at once, he jackknifes in the
air. The stake twangs loose. The Police now spot him 
and begin firing.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">310	TIGHT ON ABBY

</p><p></p><p id="act">Bill stumbles along, trying to rip the hooks from his
flesh, but the fish--fighting their way back to the
water--only drive them in deeper.
Ahead two MOUNTED POLICE surge into the river, blocking
his retreat.
He empties his shotgun at them and throws it away. They
hold up, astonished. He dashes across a sand bar for the
deep of the river and comparative safety. Black mud clings
to his feet, drawing him down like a fly in molasses.
Benson goes running out into the river ahead of the Police.

Abby takes the hat off and gives it to Ursula, who lately

in a window of the train.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ABBY

Signals nod. A lamp winks. There are leave-takings up
