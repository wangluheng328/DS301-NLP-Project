The story is set in 1916.

He flees to the Texas Panhandle with his girlfriend Abby (Adams) and younger sister Linda (Manz), who provides the film's narration.
Bill and Abby pretend to be siblings to prevent gossip.

The three hire on as part of a large group of seasonal workers with a rich, shy farmer (Shepard).
The farmer learns that he is dying of an unspecified disease.
When he falls in love with Abby, Bill encourages her to marry him so that they can inherit his money after he dies.
The marriage takes place and Bill stays on the farm as Abby's "brother."
The farmer's foreman suspects their scheme.
The farmer's health unexpectedly remains stable, foiling Bill's plans.

Eventually, the farmer discovers Bill's true relationship with Abby.
At the same time, Abby has begun to fall in love with her new husband.
After a locust swarm and a fire destroy his wheat fields, the farmer goes after Bill with a gun, but Bill kills him with a screwdriver.
Bill then flees with Abby and Linda.
The foreman and the police pursue and eventually find them, and the police kill Bill.

Later, Abby inherits the farmer's money and leaves Linda at a boarding school.
Abby leaves town on a train with soldiers leaving for World War I. Linda runs away from the school with a friend.
