<b>                             TRON LEGACY
</b>



                             Written by

                          Richard Jefferies





<b>1   INT.   CYBERSPACE
</b>
    Electric-neon netherworld.     Pulsing chromatics over jet black.

    CONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS.
    CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded "X-NET".

    3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New,
    unused data OPTIK HIGHWAY routes radiate from all sides,
    crossing cyberspace.

    X-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every
    inch.


<b>2   INT.   X-NET NEXUS - UNDER CONSTRUCTION
</b>
    DATA "TRAIN" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off,
    shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect
    lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points.

    X-Takks notice, moving to investigate.

<b>    DEEP IN THE LATTICE:
</b>
    Red data "uploads" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see
    from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic
    detail, lethal EDGES -

    Then slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry
    eyes, riveted to a TASK -

<b>    TRON 2.0.
</b>
    Seriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The
    friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a
    ruthless cyber-ninja.

    X-Takks search ten story gantries.

    TRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding
    detection. Slips into:


<b>3   INT.   NEXUS MAIN SHAFT
</b>
    X-Takks on high alert.

    TRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts
    behind MAIN POWER SUPPLY.

    Pulls his DISK.     DISK opens, extends oscillating DATA KEY.



<b>                                                (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                        2
</b>
<b>3   CONTINUED:
</b>
    TRON inserts key in and ENCRYPTION PANEL.     Circuits energize.
    Shockwave quakes system.

<b>    POWER SUPPLY OVERLOADS, SHORTING OUT.
</b>
    X-Takks spot TRON.

<b>                              X-TAKKS
</b>                 Intruder!   Fix coordinates!

<b>    POLICE POUNCE, FIRING.
</b>
    Tron pulls hyper-disk off his back and HURLS IT -

    DISK strikes cop, fries his circuits. Disk ricochets,
    brutally accurate, takes out three more Police -

    TRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for
    him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate.
    DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts.

<b>    ALARMS WAIL -
</b>
    POWER SUPPLY VERGES on MELTDOWN, CIRCUITS FRY, PLASMA SPEWS.
    X-NET CRISIS TEAM rushes in, inserts MASTER KEY. POWER SUPPLY
    STABILIZES. Catastrophe averted.

    TRON flips away, chased by firing X-Takks -

    Arriving on the scene - split-second response:

    Elite team of X-NET SECURITY AGENTS, lead by:

    RX23 SECURITY LEADER (Cyber-twin of our real-world hero RUSH).

    TRON jumps down MAIN SHAFT - a thousand stories. Riding his
    DISK as a heat shield dodges X-Net fire, swerves into a DATA
<b>    CHANNEL -
</b>
    RX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles,
    hotly pursuing TRON.

    TRON PLUNGES onto a DATA HIGHWAY - speed out of NEXUS, hurls
    across cyberspace.

<b>                             AGENT 1
</b>                 This is the first time an Intruder
                 has broken into X-Net!

<b>                             RX23 LEADER
</b>                 And it's the last. Follow him!
                 Shut him down!

    They speed onto the OPTIK HIGHWAY.
<b>                                        3
</b>



<b>4   INT.   X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY
</b>
    Broadband, light-speed OPTIK HIGHWAY.     Empty, except for:

    TRON - accelerating, escaping.

    Rx23 and AGENTS catch up fast on Pulse Rider Vehicles.

    TRON throws his disk. Blings off Agents - triggers CRASH.
    PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall.

    Rx23 emerges unscathed, pursuing.


<b>5   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE
</b>
    TRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into
<b>    ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE.
</b>
    Rx23 roars after him, riding hard, joined by:

    Airborne SEARCH ENGINE vehicle, piloted by a dumpy nerd
    program called KROD.

<b>                           KROD
</b>               I got a lock. Coordinate 32937!

<b>                             RX23
</b>               I'm on him!

    RX23 chases Tron into a dark canyon. Hairpin turns and blind
    curves. RX23 arrives a junction. Tron has vanished.

<b>                           RX23
</b>               Which way did he go?!


<b>6   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION BETA TEST LAB - DAY
</b>
    Rabbit warren of computer programmers in crisis mode.

    A head shoots up from a cubicle. It's Rush Nortebi, 23,
    computer security expert. Real world version of the RX23
    program. His cubicle is jammed with racks of vintage and
    bleeding-edge computer gear.

<b>                           RUSH
</b>               I said WHICH WAY DID HE GO?

    Dozens of programmers work feverishly to track the system
    intruder. Everybody's stumped. Dangling from desk lamps,
    the company toy: Conical pyramid with a square stuck on top,
    labeled "X-NET RULES!"


<b>                                                (CONTINUED)

</b>
<b>                             RUSH
</b>                 Come on guys! Nobody hacks X-Net.
                 You gonna let him get away?!

<b>                             MILES
</b>                 Rush, I think I found him!

    In the adjacent cubicle: Overweight ultra-nerd MILES RABBISH -
    real world version of cyberworld Krod.

<b>                             MILES
</b>                 Check the old game grid!

    Rush jockeys an old Apple LISA computer.     On screen: a crude
    old vector graphics game grid.

    A RED FIGURE steps appears the grid.

<b>                             RUSH
</b>                 You get a cookie, Miles!

    Programmers gather to watch Rush in action.


<b>7   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - THE OLD GAME GRID
</b>
    Vast, low-rez, uncool, largely forgotten.

    TRON pulls a LIGHT WAND from his legging, grips it. A TURBO-
    CHARGED LIGHT-CYCLE rezzes up beneath him. He fires his
    LIGHTCYCLE. ZIP, he's gone.

    Onto the grid blasts RX23, speeding on his Pulse rider.    He
    skids and swerves, learning the funky surface.

    Search Engine flies onto the scene, hovering overhead.

<b>                             KROD
</b>                 Coordinate 6532.02!   There he goes!

    The chase is on.

    TRON escapes across the vast grid-plane, head down, eyes
    hollow. He gains speed, retreating to somewhere...

    RX23 surges on his Pulse Rider, closing the gap.


<b>8   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM BETA TEST LAB - DAY
</b>
    Rush gets the hang of this old game.

<b>                             RUSH
</b>                 I haven't played this since I was 4.
                 But I was mighty awesome.

<b>                                                (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                               5
</b>
<b>8    CONTINUED:
</b>
     RED LIGHTCYCLE turns hard 90 degrees, Rush maneuvers to
     counter.

     Co-workers lean over the cubicle walls from all sides:

<b>                              RUSH
</b>                  Score an ID on this leech?

<b>                                MILES
</b>                  Negative.    He's nobody.

<b>                              KELTER
</b>                  Rush, you've gotta nail him.

<b>                              PHLEGMAN
</b>                  Or you know we're all fired.

     Rush baits the RED LIGHTCYCLE. It anticipates his every
     move, goading him, tailing him.

<b>                              MILES
</b>                  Whoa, Rush! I groked a pattern in
                  his moves! Fake left, go right!


<b>9    INT.   CYBERSPACE - GAME GRID
</b>
     Search Engine flies overhead - Krod locks on Tron.

     RX23's Pulse Rider pulls the move, surges up beside red
     lightcycle.

     Tron pulls away, baiting his opponent.

<b>                               OTHERS
</b>                  Crash him!   Rush RUSH RUSH.

     RUSH hits keys, jockeys mouse.      Feeling good.     Shifts drive
     status to: "TURBOJECT".


<b>11   INT.   CYBERSPACE - GAME GRID
</b>
     RX23's Pulse Rider SCREAMS, gaining on Tron.         Neck-and-neck.

     But Tron suddenly brakes, quitting the chase.

     RX23 is puzzled.    Looks forward.       Eyes spring wide.

<b>13   CYBERSPACE - GAME GRID
</b>
     Pulse Rider smashes into rocks, RX23 pulverizes to neon bits.
     Electro SHOCKWAVE sears across game grid. Search Engine
     freezes overhead, glitches and CRASHES like a blimp.

     All goes white - snow crash.

</b>                  We think it happened.

     Meg agrees.    Rush gets a chill.

<b>                              SINCLAIR
</b>                  It was a fluke. But Flynn worked
                  for years, down here, trying to make
                  it happen again. One day a test
                  went bad. A plasma reaction destroyed
                  this lab. Flynn was reduced to ash.

     Rush views the charred remains in the glass case. Photos of
     the destroyed lab. Spooky evidence of a hellish death scene.

<b>                               RUSH
</b>                  I was never told how he died. It
                  was all just weird, you know, because
                  Flynn's the guy who hired me. But
                  he was strange, kept to himself, I
                  didn't know what job I was supposed
                  to be doing.
                      (to Sinclair)
                  Then you came onboard, the company
                  woke up, we had a direction. It was
                  kind of pathetic, because by the
                  time Flynn died, everybody was too
                  busy to care.

<b>                              SINCLAIR
</b>                  He was brilliant in his way, but
                  genius without discipline leads to
                  nothing. His reckless habits nearly
                  ruined this company... And for sure
                  got him killed.

     A last look at the charred remains of Flynn's machine.

                  again. We've upgraded the system in
                  ways Flynn never could. The chips
                  didn't exist until now.

     FINAL BITS of Rush scan away.

     Plasma ball FRIES the unit.         Breakers trip.   Power fades.

     Meg and Sinclair come up to find:

     He turns, looks up a FIREWALL. Hundreds of X-Takk Troops

     A FIGURE comes at him, down the wall, STREAKING RED.

<b>     BLAMMO!

     TRON lands on a plateau above Rush, gazing down.

     They face each other, equally perplexed.

     Rush is no longer human, but not quite a program either.
     Energy zaps off his body, infusing the surrounding circuitry.

     Rush's body circuits PULSE with anger - data surges out his
     feet, across floor circuitry, up to the plateau. Energy
     interacts with Tron's body circuits, siphoning off bits of
     code.

     Tron leaps off the plateau, cutting the data connection.      He
     whips his disk off his back and THROWS.

</b>                  Okay. Sorry. I'm a program, guess
                  I got a piece of my code corrupted.
                  Whatever it is, it's given me power

<b>42   EXT.   ANCIENT COMPUTER SYSTEM I/O PORT
</b>
     D-Rezz screams like a modem, hurls ROMBALL -

     Mega and Krod dive clear -

     ROMBALL misses them, but BLAZES DOWN two more I/O Ports.        D-
     rezz retrieves ROMBALL, bears down on Mega and Krod.

<b>                             RUSH
</b>                Hey! Double points if you nail me!
                Bring it on!

     D-Rezz turns his ugly sights on Rush, baited away from Mega
     and Krod.

     D-rezz flexes and ROARS, revealing an X-NET LOGO on his chest.

<b>                              RUSH
</b>                Stop!    End your routine!

     D-rezz corners Rush, hurls his ROMBALL - Ball fires every
     circuit in its path, bleaching away data energy.

     Rush dodges -

<b>                              RUSH
</b>                Cease!    Desist! We're on the same
                team!

     Mega throws her disk, plings D-rezz on the skull.      D-rezz
     turns on her -

     Rush runs, LEAPS on D-Rezz's back.      Like riding a gorilla -

     D-Rezz flips Rush to the ground, pins him with one mighty
     hand, raises his ROMBALL for the kill.

<b>                            RUSH
</b>                I'm X-Net too!

     Data flows from Rush's body, up D-Rezz's clamping arm.
     Radiant energy between predator and prey.

     Digits race in D-rezz's eyes. A code unlocks. He looks
     down, finally registering the X-Net markings on Rush's outfit.

     D-Rezz lets go of Rush, slumps back on his haunches.       Lowers
     his head in shame.

<b>                            RUSH
</b>                No, hey, hey big guy, don't take it
                so hard. We all have bad days.

     D-Rezz stands, clutches his ROMBALL.       Reporting for duty.

<b>43   EXT.    GAME PORTAL OUTPOST
</b>
     Obsolete, abandoned computer game entry portal, guarding
     entry to the old game grid beyond. An electro-tech carnival
     zone gone dark. No life in sight... Then:

     Beam of DATA ENERGY sling-shots at ground level, solidifying
     to become:

     A slender, jumpy Program called I-BEEM. He wears the X-Net
     logo and a cracked disk on his back. He's highly unstable
     and way unplugged from the system (like one of those Japanese
     soldiers still fighting alone in the hills 10 years after
     WWII was over).

     I-Beem sees something - he PANICS, zapping away in
     characteristic streaks of airborne data. He reassembles in
     a hiding place, skittish, observing:

     Rush, Mega, Krod and D-Rezz arrive. See GIANT PILE of GAME
     VEHICLE PARTS blocking access to the grid.

     Rush picks up an old LIGHT WAND.       Krod finds one too.

<b>                               RUSH
</b>                  D-rezz.   Cut a path.

     D-Rezz hurls his Romball, ZAPS into VEHICLE PARTS.       A dent.

</b>                  That's good.     Keep doing it.

     D-rezz retrieves Romball for another whack -

     ZAP -    DATA ENERGY BEAM snaps in front of them, becoming I-
     Beem.    He grips his rickety disk, challenging them.

<b>                               I-BEEM

     Mega scans I-beem.     He freaks, drops his disk, grabs for it.

</b>                  Pound him to bits, D-rezz.

     D-Rezz raises his Romball to pulverize I-Beem.

     I-Beem freaks, ZAPS away in his data beam as Romball crashes
     down. I-Beem reforms further way, then beside them - He
     snatches his pancake disk, the zaps away again, emerging
     then high on the pile of parts.

<b>                              RUSH

     He kicks parts - avalanche fills the gap D-rezz blasted.

<b>                              KROD
</b>                  D-rezz, take out this blip.

     D-rezz cocks Romball. I-Beem freaks, sling-shots all over
     the place via his data beam, tossing his wobbly disk.

     Rush catches I-Beem's disk.       Holds off D-Rezz.

<b>                             RUSH
</b>                  Hang on. I-Beem. We're from X-Net

                  here. Everybody knows it.

     Mega throws Rush a look.    I-beem comes up, grateful.

                  rogue Program around here? He's
                  red. Super fast. Known as "Tron".

     Data zags to Rush, forming into: I-Beem.       Wide-eyed.

     I-Beem stiffens, reflexively vigilant. He scans the four of
     them again, finally softening. He zaps to a wall near his
     giant barrier, then proudly pushes aside a thin panel. Beyond
     a corridor of game gear, view expanses to reveal:


<b>44   EXT.   OLD GAME GRID

     Rush steps across the vast vector-graphic grid surface.

     Eerie.   Quiet.     Pure.

     Mega, I-Beem, Krod and D-rezz follow.

     Rush kneels, touches grid lines.    Circuits energize, as his
     energy surges in all directions.    He draws in data.

     Mega considers. There's more on her mind she's not talking

     A nod between Rush and Rush - they TAKE OFF.

     LIGHT CYCLES shoot across grid surface.

     Mega screams and clutches Rush, throwing her body against
     his, clamping her arms around him.

     Krod and Rush turn 90 degrees, rallying, passing each other,
     getting warmed up. It's familiar territory.

     Light cycles race toward each other on the same line.

     rolling safely to a halt, nose-to-nose. Directly over:

     A BIG RED DOT.      The only dot on the grid.

     Grid Center.

     Approaching cycle comes at 90 degree angle, turns hard, closes
     the distance.

     It's TRON.    Heartless eyes, ruthless moves.

     Rush turns quick, baiting Tron.      Tron turns to follow, coming
     alongside.

     Krod runs interference, cuts sharp in front of Tron.

     It's a high-stakes speed-chase, narrowly missing side walls
     and rock outcroppings.

     I-beem zaps onto the grid, tracks horizon dots.

<b>                              I-BEEM
</b>                  Here they come!

     He zaps back to the edge, signals upward. D-rezz straddles
     the rock passage above, ready to hurl his Romball.


<b>48   EXT.   GAME GRID
</b>
     Tron takes the lead in a three-way heat.      Revs to breath-
     taking speed.

     Rush and Krod gain, coming up on either side of Tron.

     Tron looks to each opponent.      His eyes lock on Mega.

     Mega stares into Tron's cold eyes, almost like she's trying
     to signal him. But Tron returns his gaze forward, as the
     ROCKY EDGE looms closer.

<b>                               RUSH
</b>                  Wuss!   You call that speed!?

     Rush kicks in a hyper-burner, surging forward.      Krod does
     the same. Tron responds with more speed.

     Rush and Krod have Tron sandwiched, heading for the rock
     edge. Tron pulls ahead, aiming for the hidden crevasse.

     Mega worries.    Clings to Rush.


<b>49   EXT.   EDGE OF GAME GRID

     D-rezz, astride the crevasse, sees light cycles speeding his
     way. He's got the Rom-ball poised to intercept Tron.

     I-beem de-rezzes into the grid, clearing the path.

     Rush and Krod taunt Tron into the trap...

     But, out of nowhere, Mega reaches to Rush's handlebars and
     turns 90 degrees too soon.

<b>                              KROD
</b>                  Hey, what are you - ??

     Tron sees the bail-out, knows something's wrong. He looks
     ahead, sees D-rezz astride his crevasse escape root, rom-
     ball poised in the air.

     Tron bails out 90 degrees, cutting behind Krod.       Krod turns
     twice, ending up in Tron's lane.

     To the side, Rush's light cycle screams toward solid rock,
     vibrating out of control.

     Rush grabs Mega and JUMPS OFF.       They slide on the grid,
     holding each other.

     Krod's lightcycle heads for the rock escape passage.

<b>                               KROD
</b>                  No!   It's ME!

     Rush and Mega slide to a halt, in time to see:

     Their light cycle SMASHES rocks, explodes in a million bits.

</b>                  No!   It's Krod! Tron is OVER THERE!

     D-rezz makes mental switch, hurls Romball.

     Romball bounces down solid rock, onto game grid, rolls with
     ferocious speed, DIAGONALLY across the grid.

     Romball curves to track Tron - like a great bowling shot.

     Romball clips rear wheel of Tron's lightcycle.       Lightcycle
     vaporizes. Tron skids and tumbles.

     I-beem zaps beside Rush and Mega.       Krod and D-rezz join them.

     WHOOSH! Electro-fire Romball careens across grid, bearing
     down on them.

     Group DIVES CLEAR.

     D-rezz swings in a foot, stopping the Romball - inches short
     of mowing down Krod.

                  If Tron got through here, then I can
                  too. Who's with me?

     D-rezz steps forward, then I-Beem.      Shamed, Krod joins them.
     Finally, Mega makes it unanimous.

                  until you come back.

     I-beem and D-rezz buddy up and depart on a recon mission.

     Krod pulls off his disk, nervously practices boomerang throws.

     Rush pulls the disk off his own back.      He throws - disk flies
     wild - he runs to retrieve it.

     Mega retreats to a side area, partially eroded by memory
     leakage. She finds the remnants of COM CIRCUITRY and stares
     data beams into its transducer.

     Energy ZAPS between them, racing through their body circuits.

     circuits, reaching into Tron's body.

<b>                              RUSH

                  code. WHO IS YOUR USER?? 392 -

     Tron's body animates painfully, as the first three code digits
     click into place.

     Tron FLIPS away, breaking contact with floor.        Data transfer
     stops. Tron steals away through a tunnel.

     Rush pursues.

     Krod, Mega and I-beem clamber for a way to follow.

     Circular, riddled with memory leaks.

     Rush hurries to the center.       No sign of Tron.

     Rush sends data coursing into floor circuits. It radiates
     up walls, across bridges... And finds TRON in hiding.

     Data races into Tron's body. Six code numbers engage; he
     glitches. He LEAPS to breaks the contact, flinging his disk -

     Tron's disk SLAMS Rush.       Rush tumbles off a ledge, dangling
     over a memory leak.

     Tron pounces in.    Snags his disk.

     Tron steps on Rush's hand.         Pain energy jolts Rush's circuits.

     Rush slips, grabs a slim protrusion.         Feet zapping an inch
     from the memory leakage.

     Tron throws his disk for a final time.         It arcs wide, coming
     around directly at Rush.

     Tron leans down, gazing into Rush's eyes.

<b>                                 RUSH

     Burst of SEARING DATA surges off Rush's hands, radiating up
     circuitry, loading into Tron's body. All nine code numbers
     LOCK in.

     Tron's body seizes. He fights the data intrusion, but his
     circuits sequentially SHUT DOWN.

     Tron's airborne disk wobbles and darkens.

     Tron tumbles off the edge, plummets past Rush.

     Disk misses Rush, skates into darkness.

     Mega, Krod and I-beem hurry in and see:

     Rush, climbing to safety.

     And below: Tron's body slips into the memory leakage, zapping

     SOUNDS echo around them.       Coming fast.    Electro-metallic
     footsteps.

     Rush, Krod and I-beem bunch together and pivot.

     Black-clad FINITY FIGHTERS appear, blocking all exits.            Disks
     ready for attack.

     Rush double-takes on faces among them: QUANTZ, tall silent,
     hardcore (looks like real-world Phlegman) And BOOLE, rotund,
     seen it all (like real-world Kelter).

<b>                              KROD

     But I-beem freezes, terrified.         Fighters tighten perimeter.

     A hush.   Footsteps.      Clunk-zap...    Clunk-zap.

     Rush and Krod turn.       Fighters defer to:

     data corruption.

     I-beem panics, zaps away in an energy beam. He reforms
     further along for a "breath", then zaps further away. Three
     FINITY FIGHTERS chase him.

     Rush is amazed to find him self in the presence of Encom's
     former leader.

     Flynn comes closer, recognizing Rush.

     Flynn yanks Tron's disk from Rush, peers over the precipice.
     Below, the last of Tron is consumed by memory leakage.

     Flynn ponders Tron's lifeless disk. He falters on his bad
     leg. Mega throws an arm around to help him stand. Melancholy
     energy courses between them.

     Flynn reviews Fighter training. Troops throw disks, battle
     in pairs, repair weapons, tweak armor circuitry.

     Flynn carries Tron's dark disk, contemplating it.       He moves
     past a line-up of his finest Fighters.

                  beginning of the end of a free and
                  open cyberspace. We can't let Plexor
                  get away with this. Our game plan
                  has not changed. Tron was specially
                  programmed to break into X-Net and
                  shut down power supplies. We would
                  then exploit these weak points and
                  cripple the system. Tron's role was

                  to blame you.

     All stand firm.

     Flynn lays Tron's disk in the first Fighter's hands. Fighter
     summons his will, causing the disk to glow faintly. But it
     soon goes dark again.

     Mega puts her hands out to receive the disk.

     Flynn hesitates, then hands her Tron's disk.

     Mega clenches it, concentrating deeply. Her energy infuses

     But Plexor resists Rush's data infusion, freezing the circuits
     around his feet. Cutting off the flow.

     Death Disk slices walls, arcing back toward Plexor -

     Rush LEAPS at Plexor.

<b>     BLANG!

     Plexor is solid-state, like a cast iron statue.    Rush flips
     airborne, goes down hard.

     Mega struggles to compute.

     Rush turns to help Flynn down the pipe. Mega assists.
     Flynn's wounded leg gives out, he slips. Rush holds him,

      Plexor crosses into his inner sanctum. Raises his disk,

</b>                   Why didn't you tell anyone it was

      Flynn looks at his leg.     Then at Rush.

<b>                               FLYNN

      He takes up Tron's dark disk.

      Rush holds off Krod, takes the disk.

<b>                               RUSH
</b>                   What do I do - ?

      Waves of Rush's DATA ENERGY surge into disk circuitry.

<b>                               RUSH
</b>                   Yow!

      He buckles and shakes.    Hands zapping.    Knees trembling.

      Rush clenches teeth, concentrates.     Grips the disk.

      Energy surges back and forth, up Rush's arms, around the
      disk. He holds tight, ready to scream -

<b>                               KROD
</b>                   Awesome, dude! Don't let go!

      of TRON.

      Rush looks at his arms, astounded. His circuitry strobes in
      hues of brilliant red. Disk animates and unfolds, revealing
      infinite surface variations.

      Rush feels new power surging inside his body. His eyes
      harden, keen like Tron's. Rush LEAPS BACKWARD, goes airborne,
      lands on a ledge high above. Amazing balance.

      Rush's voice is a little deeper, with a digital edge.       It
      surprises him.

      He cocks his disk and THROWS.

      Disk rockets across the landscape, a mile away and STRIKES
      an X-NET SURVEY POST, blasting it to bits. Disk arcs high,
      shoots back toward Rush.

      Rush looks worried for a second, ready to duck -

<b>                               FLYNN
</b>                   Don't flinch, Rush!   It's your disk
                   now.

      Disk snaps back into Rush's hand, painlessly.       Throbbing
      with energy.

<b>                               RUSH
</b>                   Oh man, this is good.

      Rush pulls a new LIGHT WAND from a thigh bracket. It extends
      into a hundred-foot vaulting pole. Rush VAULTS across the
      canyon, lands with precision. Light pole retracts into the
      wand in a nanosecond.

<b>                                KROD
</b>                   Awwwww!   Where can I get one of those?

      Another two vaults and a leap - Rush tosses his disk into a
      spiral, steps off it mid-air (like stairs), and lands
      perfectly - rejoining the group.

      Cheers from Krod, Quantz, Boole and Code Monkeys.       Flynn
      shakes Rush's hand - energy surges between them.

      They turn, eyes scanning. Behind them, a LIGHT POLE extends
      into the canyon, then swings across.

      It's "tronified" Rush, using his vaulting pole to ferry
      Fighters across the moat edges.

      He returns to the far side, landing momentarily on a lone
      central pinnacle to make the distance.

      Rush vaults back to gather Krod, who's the last to cross.

      He hugs Krod and vaults them across.    Krod clings and
      struggles, then YELPS -

      X-Takks hear and scan the pinnacle and moat edges.

      On top of the pinnacle, Rush and Krod hunker.      Flynn signals
      from the far side "stay down!"

      X-Takks patrol below, pausing to gaze up.

      Atop the pinnacle, Krod's circuits energy-zap with fear.
      Rush holds him down.

      At last, X-Takks move on.

      Rush extends his light pole to the moat floor - vaults to
      the far side with Krod.

      Krod stabilizes, looks around.

      X-Takks stream across, firing -

      Rush and Mega duck inside entry point, pelted by disks.

      Before them: A vast, brilliant, energized LATTICE. Power
      surges in rings, drawing down huge columns. Every piece of
      geometry is based on perfect squares, made of mirror-finished
      rare earth elements.

      Rush pulls the HOLOGON KEY into view. Facets resonate with
      energy patterns like those in the core.

      Rush and Mega charge the center, throwing disks, fighting
      back-to-back.

      Problem is, ENERGY RINGS move continuously down the columns -
      and the columns are spaced close - leaving just enough time

      He and Mega JUMP, nearly raked by down-flowing ENERGY RINGS.

      X-Takks fire NEGABYTE BLASTERS - but many of the beams are
      caught in the energy flow and sucked away. That's how intense
      this place is.

      X-Takk Soldier is grazed, stumbles into ENERGY COLUMN. RING
      rakes down and ZAPS him nasty - reducing him to bits, sucking
      his energy to the levels below.

      Rush and Mega encounter oncoming X-Takks - they must split
      up. They fling disks, taking out X-Takks, dodging fire -
      working their way deeper.

      Meg and Rush throw their disks simultaneously.     Both disks
      score hits, then arc to return.

      Rush and Mega catch each other's disk. They each look at
      the strange disks - it's just not the same. The do a quick
      swap and keep fighting.

<b>132   INT.   CONTROL CELL CHAMBER

      Rush and Mega battle off three X-Takks - the way is clear.

      Rush leaps, crashes planes of silicon.     Stows his disk, pulls
      out the HOLOGON.

      Spots the control cell's key receptacle - SHAPES MATCH.

      Rush moves to insert the hologon.

      A DISK STRIKES his arm - HOLOGON flies wild.

      Plexor snatches his Death-disk, corners Rush for the kill.

      Mega's disk crashes silicon, comes at Plexor - But his
      defense field repels it. He slams it aside and it's raked
      away by downward flowing energy rings.

      Rush DIVES at PLEXOR. He's like a statue. But this time
      RUSH holds him and infuses tron-energy, breaking down Plexor's
      defense field, eating into his body circuits. It's fractal
      zapping fireworks - evenly matched foes battling face-to-

      Mega scoops HOLOGON off floor, makes for CONTROL CELL -

      Plexor's hand shoots out, GRABS HER, stops her like iron.

      Plexor exerts his power, holds Rush and Mega by the throats
      with his two hands, backing them toward a surface ripping
      with HOT ENERGY RINGS.

      Rush and Mega struggle, an inch from death -

      Plexor stops, annoyed.      Turns and sees:

      Krod, Fighters and I-beem have arrived, firing blasters at
      Plexor's SPINAL NEXUS. It hardly makes a dent, but it creates
      a fleeting opportunity for Rush -

      Rush ducks forward, SHOOTS his disk off his back, smacking
      Plexor in the throat. Mega falls clear -

      Rush hurls Plexor against energy rings - Energy rakes down
      his body, but he fights the effects an DOES NOT MELT DOWN.
      He step away, shakes off the damage, retrieves his disk into
      a hand.

      Mega snags the hologon -

      Energy rings go dim, then dark -

      Silicon shatters to ash -

      X-Takks power down. X-Net armor de-rezzes, leaving innocent
      civilian Programs. They shake off the mind-control and rise
      unshackled.

      And Plexor, like all things X-Net, chatters and glitches.
      His code erodes, his bits darken, the fiber of his being
      erodes from inside.

      Rush executes a final leap, extending his feet for the final
      blow, straight at Plexor - CRASH - shattering him to bits.

      Rush finally breathes.       Sees I-beem, Krod, Quantz, Boole,
      Code Monkeys.

<b>                               FLYNN
</b>                   Put on some coffee. You two are
                   going to be putting in a lot of
                   overtime together.

      Meg turns to Rush.

<b>                               MEG
</b>                   Do you remember how, along time ago,
                   you used to give me a professional
                   congratulatory peck on the cheek?

      Rush goes for the lips.
