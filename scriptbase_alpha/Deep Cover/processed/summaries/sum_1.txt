The black policeman Russell Steven applies for a special anti-drug squad which targets the highest boss of cocain delivery to LA: the Columbian foreign minister's nephew.
Russell shall work his way up from the bottom undercover, until he reaches the boss.
First step is to get the lawyer and hobby dealer David Jason to trust him.
Jason wants to switch to legal designer drugs, but hasn't got the capital yet, so Steven's ambitious help is welcomed.
To keep his cover, Steven has to go farer than any officer before: he has to really sell the drugs he buys, and some day even eliminate a competitor... and gets problems seeing the line between the good and the bad.
