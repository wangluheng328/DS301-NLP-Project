<b>                                      "BLOOD SIMPLE"
</b>
                                            By

                                 Joel Coen and Ethan Coen

<b>               LANDSCAPES
</b>
               An opening voice-over plays against dissolving Texas 
               landscapes--broad, bare, and lifeless.

<b>                                     VOICE-OVER
</b>                         The world is full of complainers. 
                         But the fact is, nothing comes with 
                         a guarantee. I don't care if you're 
                         the Pope of Rome, President of the 
                         United States, or even Man of the 
                         Year--something can always go wrong. 
                         And go ahead, complain, tell your 
                         problems to your neighbor, ask for 
                         help--watch him fly. Now in Russia, 
                         they got it mapped out so that 
                         everyone pulls for everyone else--
                         that's the theory, anyway. But what 
                         I know about is Texas...

<b>                                                                     CUT TO
</b>
<b>               ROAD  NIGHT
</b>
               We are rushing down a rain-swept country road, listening to 
               the rhythmic swish of tires on wet asphalt.

<b>                                     VOICE-OVER
</b>                         And down here... you're on your own.

<b>               INT. CAR NIGHT
</b>
               We are looking at the backs of two people in the front seat--
               a man, driving, and a woman next to him.

               Their conversation will be punctuated by the occasional glare 
               of oncoming headlights and the roar of the car rushing by.

               The windshield wipers wave a soporific beat. The conversation 
               is halting, awkward.

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         ...He gave me a little pearl-handled 
                         .38 for out first anniversary.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Uh-huh.

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         ...Figured I'd better leave before I 
                         used it on him. I don't know how you 
                         can stand him.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Well, I'm only an employee, I ain't 
                         married to him.

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         Yeah...

               Pause, as an oncoming car passes. Finally:

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         ...I don't know. Sometimes I think 
                         there's something wrong with him. 
                         Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... 
                         Or is it maybe me, do you think?

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. 
                         I don't know what goes on, I don't 
                         wanna know... But I like you. I always 
                         liked you...

               Another car passes.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         ...What're you gonna do in Houston?

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         I'll figure something out... How 
                         come you offered to drive me in this 
                         mess?

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         I told you. I like you.

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         See, I never knew that.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Well now you do.

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         ...Hell.

               Another pause. Another car.

               Suddenly:

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         Stop the car, Ray!

<b>               CLOSE SHOT BRAKE
</b>
               Stamped on.

<b>               EXT. CAR
</b>
               Low three-quarters on the car as it squeals to a halt.

               A car that has been following screeches to a halt just behind 
               it.

               Both cars sit.

               Rain patters.

<b>               INT. FIRST CAR
</b>
               Close on the man, from behind.

               He looks at the woman.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         ...Abby?

               She doesn't answer. He turns to look back and we see his 
               face, for the first time, in the headlights of the car behind.

<b>               HIS POV
</b>
               The car behind them waiting, patiently. Rain drifts down 
               past its headlights.

               Finally it pulls out and passes them slowly, their headlights 
               showing it to be a battered green Volkswagon. First the car 
               itself, then its red taillights, disappear into the rain.

<b>               BACK TO THE MAN
</b>
               Cutting between him and the woman, each from behind.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         ...You know that car?

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         No.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         What's the matter?

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         I don't know... I just think maybe 
                         I'm making a mistake...

               She looks at the man.

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         ...What was that back there?

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Back where?

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         Sign.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         I don't know. Motel... Abby--

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         Ray. Did you mean that, what you 
                         said before, or were you just being 
                         a gentleman?

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         Abby, I like you, but it's no point 
                         starting anything now.

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         Yeah.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                         I mean, I ain't a marriage counselor--

<b>                                     WOMAN
</b>                         Yeah.

               The man is uncomfortable.

               Pulling back from RAY and ABBY in bed, making love.

               The only light is from cars passing along the highway outside. 
               Each sweeping light-by ends in black.

               The pullback ends in a wide shot of the motel room. The black 
               following the last car lingers.

               A telephone rings.

               Ray and Abby are asleep. On a nightstand next to the bed, 
               the telephone is ringing.

               Ray stirs, reaches for the phone.

               Ray listens to another silence. It ends with a disconnect.

</b>
               We are tracking past a man seated behind a wooden desk, 
               towards an 8 x 10 black-and-white photograph that has just 
               been slapped down on the desktop.

               The picture is of Abby and Ray in bed together in the motel 
               room.

                         framed.

               The voice is familiar as that of the narrator whose musings 
               on life in Texas and the Soviet Union opened the movie.

               We cut to him.

               He is settling himself into a chair facing the desk. He is 
               LOREN VISSER, a large unshaven man in a misshapen yellow 
               leisure suit.

               He smiles at the man behind the desk.

               Sits staring down at the photograph. Behind him a window 
               opens on the bar proper. Country-western music filters in 
               from the bar.

               Marty is not pleased.

               He removes a pouch of tobacco from his breast pocket and 
               nonchalantly starts rolling a cigarette.

               He lights his cigarette, then slaps his lighter onto the 
               desktop.

               It is silver, engraved on the top with a lariat spelling out 
               "Loren" in script, and on the side with a declaration that 
               he is "Elks Man of the Year."

                         and then get started again. Quite

               Marty stares down at the photograph.

                         bad news.

               A smoke ring floats into frame from offscreen.

</b>                         No. It just made them feel better.

               Marty rises and goes to a safe behind his desk.

               Visser laughs as he watches Marty.

<b>                                     VISSER
</b>                         Well first off, Julian, I don't know 
                         what the story is in Greece but in 
                         this state we got very definite laws 
                         about that...

               Marty, hunched over the standing safe behind his desk, tosses 
               in the photograph and takes out a pay envelope.

<b>                                     VISSER
</b>                         ...Second place I ain't a messenger, 
                         I'm a private investigator. And third 
                         place--and most important--it ain't 
                         such bad news. I mean you thought he 
                         was a colored.

                         ...You're always assumin' the worst...

               Visser blows another smoke ring, pushes a fat finger through 
               the middle of it, and beams at Marty.

<b>                                     VISSER
</b>                         ...Anything else?

</b>                         Yeah, don't come by here any more. 
                         If I need you again I know which 
                         rock to turn over.

               Marty scales the pay envelope across the desk. It hits Visser 
               in the chest and bounces to the floor.

               Visser looks stonily down at the envelope; no expression for 
               a beat. Then he roars with laughter.

<b>                                     VISSER
</b>                         That's good... "which rock to turn 
                         over"... that's very good...

               Sighing, he leans forward to pick up the envelope. He rises, 
               straightens his cowboy hat, and walks over to a screen door 
               letting out on the bar's back parking lot.

<b>                                     VISSER

                         cut off my head...

               He pauses at the door, cocks his head, then turns back to 
               the desk and picks up his cigarette lighter. Returning to 
               the door:

               The door slams shut behind him.

               Marty scowls at the back door. After a moment he rises and 
               crosses the office to the window looking out on the bar.

               Over Marty's shoulder we see the long bar leading up to the 
               window in perpendicular. The camera is tracking forward, 
               past Marty, to frame on the window.

               A black man is just now vaulting the near end of the bar, 
               over onto the customer side.

               MEURICE, the black bartender, is muscular, about 200 pounds, 
               dressed in white pants and a sleeveless T-shirt. He is making 
               his way through the crowd towards the jukebox.

               Another man stands in front of it examining the selections.

               He deposits a quarter.

                         buildings.

               A Motown song drops. We track behind Meurice as he makes his 
               way back toward the bar. When he reaches it, he claps a couple 
               of people on the shoulder, who make way for him. He vaults 
               back over the top, walks down the bar, and stops in from of 
               an attractive white woman sitting on a bar stool and sipping 
               a brandy.

               Marty smiles bleakly. Debra drains her glass as Meurice 
               returns. He sets another Cognac in front of Debra, and a 
               glass of milk in front of Marty.

               Meurice is pouring the milk down the sink. He looks innocently 
               up.

<b>               BACK TO MARTY
</b>
               Angry but not knowing what to say. He glances around the 
               bar, sinks slowly back onto his stool.

               Marty sits staring across the bar for a moment, nods a couple 
               of times at nothing in particular, then looks back at the 
               woman.

               Marty tosses a beer nut into his mouth.

                         that. Now that I've communicated, 
                         why don't you leave?

               They both fall silent as Meurice enters frame. He takes a 
               bottle from the bar and pours himself a drink.

               Marty tosses back Meurice's drink, then turns to Debra, 
               smiling.

               Debra watches him go, then turns back to Meurice.

<b>               MARTY'S HOUSE  TRACKING DOWN HALLWAY
</b>
               We are following a large German shepherd as it pads down the 
               hall toward a warmly lit room at its end. We hear only the 
               sound of the dog's paws on the hardwood floor, and the faint 
               clicking of billiard balls.

<b>               BILLIARD ROOM
</b>
               It is a paneled, carpeted room with black leather furniture 
               and a nine-foot billiard table. Various stuffed animal 
               trophies are scattered around the room, including a moose 
               head mounted on one wall. Ray stands alone in the foreground, 
               shooting pool, an unlit cigarette in his mouth. The room is 
               very quiet.

               In the background the German shepherd enters from the hallway, 
               sits down in a corner, and benignly watches Ray.

<b>               UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
</b>
               It is expensively appointed; a brightly lit woman's bedroom. 
               Abby is opening a hinged drawer in a white antique bureau. 
               She pulls out a leather handbag, gropes nervously through 
               its contents, then puts it aside.

               She crosses the room to a vanity table, takes a purse from 
               underneath, and spills its contents out on top of the table.

<b>               BILLIARD ROOM
</b>
               Ray pockets a couple of balls, looks over at the dog, then 
               up at the wall at the far end of the room.

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               Hanging on the wall are a couple of framed photographs of 
               Marty and Abby, taken a long time ago.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               Staring at the pictures. He looks back down at the pool table.

<b>               UPSTAIRS BEDROOM
</b>
               Abby is sitting on a large double bed. She puts aside another 
               purse, rises and crosses the room hurriedly, and pushes back 
               the sliding doors of a long wardrobe closet. The upper shelf 
               is lined with handbags--fifteen or twenty of them. She grabs 
               the first one, looks in, tosses it aside; grabs the second, 
               looks--and stops.

<b>               HER POV
</b>
               Inside the purse, a small pearl-handled gun.

<b>               BILLIARD ROOM
</b>
               Ray is now standing in front of the pictures on the wall, 
               looking from one to the next.

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               A picture of Abby and Marty standing together on a Gulf beach. 
               Marty is wearing a long velour beach robe, Abby is in a 
               swimming suit. Ray's hand enters frame. He traces a finger 
               down her leg.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  RAY
</b>
               His head cocked to the side. After a moment his eyes shift.

<b>               EXTREME CLOSE SHOT  PHOTO DETAIL
</b>
               Of Marty's face. He is staring into the camera, at whoever 
               took the picture. His head is thrown back slightly; he is 
               laughing.

               From offscreen in the quiet room we hear a static hum and 
               then Abby's voice over an intercom.

<b>                                     ABBY'S VOICE
</b>                         Ray...?

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               He turns from the photograph and walks to an intercom speaker 
               next to the mounted moose's head. He presses the speaker 
               button.

<b>                                     RAY
</b>                         Yeah...

               He idly takes his unlit cigarette and sticks it in the moose's 
               mouth.

<b>                                     RAY

<b>               MARTY'S FRONT FOYER
</b>
               We are looking across a dark, high-ceilinged foyer toward 
               the front door. Ray leans against the doorjamb, in silhouette 
               in the open doorway. He is facing a curved staircase that 
               descends into the foyer. Abby appears at the second-floor 
               landing and starts down the stairs.

               The crowd has thinned out. Meurice and Debra are in the 
               foreground.

               Ray enters from the street and makes his way over to them.

                         one, though. This white guy walks in 
                         about one o'clock, asks if we have a

                         thinking that maybe it ain't such a 
                         bad idea...

               He pours Debra another drink and starts to set one up for

               Marty is sitting on the stoop that descends from his back 
               office to a graveled back parking lot; he is framed in the 
               open doorway of his brightly lit office. He stares fixedly 
               at something offscreen.

</b>
               In the middle distance a huge incinerator operates full blast. 
               Orange flames lick out the sides; white smoke billows out 
               the top. Two figures in silhouette are chucking garbage in 
               through a large gate.

<b>               BACK TO MARTY
</b>
               Behind him, in the office, we see the door from the bar open, 
               and Ray entering.

</b>                         Marty?

               Marty looks over his shoulder, then back toward the furnace. 
               Ray descends the stoop and stands in front of him.

</b>                         ...Well...? What?

               Marty stares past Ray across the parking lot.

<b>                                     MARTY
</b>                         I don't particularly want to talk to 
                         you.

                         I might as well quit.

                              (still staring fixedly 
                              at the furnace)
                         ...Having a good time?

               Ray tenses. There is a pause.

</b>                         ...I don't like this kind of talk.

               Marty still stares at the furnace.

</b>                         Then what'd you come here for?

               Marty shakes his head.

</b>                         Nope. She's an expensive piece of 
                         ass...

               He finally looks up at Ray.

<b>                                     MARTY
</b>                         ...You get a refund though, if you

</b>                         I want that money. If you wanna tell

                         counselor?

               Ray breaks into a strained half-smile.

               Marty grins humorlessly back, mimicking Ray's smile.

<b>                                     MARTY

                         that's not what's funny. What's funny 
                         is her. What's funny is that I had

                         you, she's been sleeping with someone 
                         else...

               He grabs a knee in each hand and leans forward, still looking 
               at Ray. He is becoming only slightly more animated.

</b>                         ...What's really going to be funny 
                         is when she gives you that innocent 
                         look and says, What're you talking 
                         about, Ray, I haven't done anything 
                         funny...

               He leans back again.

<b>                                     MARTY
</b>                         ...But the funniest thing to me right 
                         now is that you think she came back 
                         here for you--*that's* what's funny.

               Ray moves forward and Marty's eyes follow him as he 
               approaches. Marty's smile abruptly turns to a look of 
               apprehension. Ray enters frame and brushes past Marty as he 
               walks up the stoop, and crosses the back office toward the 
               bar.

               Marty relaxes, and his gaze returns to the furnace.

               Ray opens the door to the bar and shuts it softly behind 
               him.

               At the cut the music and all other bar noise drops out. We 
               hear only the rhythmic whir of the fan. We tilt down from 
               the ceiling fan to frame Marty, tilted back in his desk chair, 
               staring up at the fan.

               Meurice is standing in the door to the bar. Far behind him 
               we can see Debra waiting in the dimly lit, deserted bar.

               Meurice and Debra can be heard leaving the bar. Marty looks 
               down at the telephone in front of him on the desk, then picks 
               up the receiver and dials. He tilts back in the chair and 
               stares back up at the ceiling.

               In the foreground Ray sits behind the wheel of his parked 
               car, slumped back against the seat. He is staring at his one-
               story bungalow, in which a couple of lights are burning. 
               Inside we can faintly hear his telephone ringing.

               It rings for a long time.

               Marty listens. He says nothing, still tilted back in his

<b>               RAY'S LIVING ROOM

               Abby listens. She shifts the phone to her other ear, listening 
               hard to the sound of the fan. There is another long pause.

               Still tilted back in his chair, Marty stares glumly at the 
               ceiling. The bar itself is completely still except the

               lying under a sheet on Ray's couch, staring up at the fan in 
               the darkened living room. The room is still. We hear only 
               the whir of the fan and the distant sound of crickets. Abby

               in darkness. We hear a faint cough and the creaking of 
               bedsprings.

               onto the bed. We hold on the moonlit window.

               shot on her hand as she reaches into her purse and withdraws 
               a small plastic compact.

               Marty's hand clamps over her mouth from behind. His other 
               hand circles her waist. Abby struggles.

                         Lover-boy oughta lock his door...

               Marty's hand drops from her waist to her thighs and slides 
               under the robe.

<b>                                     MARTY
</b>                         ...Lotta nuts out there.

               Still holding her from behind, Marty forces her down on her 
               knees. Abby's cries are muffled by the hand clamped over her 
               mouth. Marty shoots a glance down the dark hallway. There is 
               no movement.

               Abby's hand is groping forward out of frame.

</b>
               She upsets it. The contents spill out, among them a small 
               pearl-handled revolver. Her hand gropes for the gun.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY AND MARTY
</b>
               Marty yanks her to her feet, looking down the hallway.

<b>                                     MARTY

               He is dragging her to the front door.

<b>                                     MARTY
</b>                         ...in nature.

               He pushes her through the screen door.

<b>               EXT. RAY'S BUNGALOW
</b>
               The neighborhood is deserted and still. The streetlamps are 
               still on. Marty and Abby stumble down the front stoop onto 
               the lawn.

               His hand is still clamped over her mouth. She reaches up, 
               grabs a finger, and bends it back.

               We hear the bone snap.

               Marty screams. His hand drops. His other hand cuffs her on 
               the side of the head, spinning her around.

               Marty is now clutching his broken finger with his good hand. 
               Abby kicks him in the groin.

               He sinks to his knees, drops forward on one hand, and vomits.

<b>               FRONT STOOP
</b>
               Ray is coming out the door, hitching up his pants. In his 
               right hand he hold Abby's pearl-handled revolver.

<b>               MARTY
</b>
               Slowly gets to his feet, looking at Ray.

<b>               ABBY
</b>
               She has backed away from Marty and now stands on the lawn, 
               breathing heavily. She looks from Ray to Marty.

<b>               BACK TO MARTY
</b>
               Backing toward his car, a Cadillac parked at curbside, still 
               looking at Ray. He turns to get into the car.

               The German shepherd lopes across the lawn and takes a clean 
               leap into the car through the open window on the passenger 
               side.

               Marty turns the ignition. The engine coughs and dies. He 
               tries again; it starts.

               The car roars up the street.

<b>               RAY
</b>
               Watching the car. He looks at Abby.

<b>               ABBY
</b>
               Still panting. Up the street we can hear Marty's car 
               alternately racing and stopping, shifting in and out of gear.  
               His engine rumble starts to grow louder again.

                         found the dead end.

               In the background we see Marty's car roar by in the opposite 
               direction.

               Moving past a row of cars parked on an overlook near the top 
               of the mountain. Below we can see the lights of the city of 
               Austin. The lot is littered with beer cans. We hear the sound 
               of rock music coming from various car radios. Several 
               teenagers lean against cars drinking beer; inside the cars 
               we can see the vague forms of others.

               His friends laugh.

<b>               TRACK PULLING MARTY
</b>
               Ignoring the laughter as he walks past the cars, apparently 
               looking for someone. His right index finger is taped up in 
               an aluminum splint.

<b>               MARTY'S POV
</b>
               At the end of a row of cars we see a green Volkswagon bug. 
               Leaning against the hood is Visser, still dressed in his 
               rumpled yellow suit. He is smoking a cigarette, talking to a 
               sixteen-year-old girl in shorts and a tube top. When he 
               notices Marty:

<b>                                     VISSER
</b>                              (to the girl)
                         Sorry sweetheart, my date is here...

               The girl drifts off. Marty enters frame and Visser turns to 
               him.

<b>                                     VISSER
</b>                         ...She saw me rolling a cigarette 
                         and thought it was marijuana.
                              (he laughs)
                         I guess she thought I was a swinger.

               Visser open the back door of the car. Marty ignores the 
               invitation, walks around to the front on the passenger side 
               and gets in.

<b>               INT. VISSER'S CAR
</b>
               As Visser gets into the driver's seat. A small topless doll 
               is suspended from the rearview mirror. Visser gives it a 
               tap. As it swings back and forth two small lights, one behind 
               each breast, blink on and off.

               Both men sit watching the doll intently.

               Finally Marty reaches up and stops its swinging with the 
               rounded end of his splint. Visser eyes the splint.

<b>                                     VISSER

                         Stick your finger up the wrong 
                         person's ass?

               Marty is silent, but Visser is in a good mood.

<b>                                     VISSER
</b>                         You know a friend of mine broke his 
                         hand a while back. Put in a cast. 
                         Very next day he takes a fall, 
                         protects his bad hand, falls on his 
                         good one, breaks that too. So now 
                         he's got two busted flippers and I 
                         say to him "Creighton, I hope your

                         five weeks you cannot wipe your own

               Overcome by laughter. Finally:

               Visser shrugs, lights up another cigarette with his 
               fraternally inscribed lighter and drops the lighter onto the 
               dashboard.

               Marty doesn't answer. Finally Visser laughs.

               Visser eyes him, still smiling. Finally he shrugs.

               Marty's shoulders slump. He seems less tense, almost relieved.

               In the closeness of the car Marty is starting to sweat.

               Marty is slumped in his seat, not responding to the fact 
               that Visser has just ended the conversation.

               Finally he rouses himself and gets out of the car, leaving 
               Visser staring at the door he has left open behind him.

               After a moment we hear Marty's footsteps approaching again, 
               and he leans back into the open door with an afterthought.

               Visser leans over to grab the handle of the still open door.

<b>               INT. EMPTY APARTMENT  NIGHT

               The apartment is dark. We are looking across a shadowy floor 
               towards a large window, through which cold blue street light 
               shines. Through the window we can see the facade of the 
               building across the street; we are three or four floors up.

               We can hear the animated, accented voice of an Hispanic woman 
               approaching the apartment from the hallway behind us.

               A crack of light shoots across the floor as we hear the 
               apartment door open behind us. A figure enters frame. As it 
               crosses into the shaft of light we see that it is Abby. She 
               moves across the dark apartment, in silhouette against the 
               window.

               An overhead light is switched on and the room is bathed in 
               light. Several feet from Abby, an old man in a dirty 
               undershirt is asleep on a cot. Abby starts.

               The old man grumbles, slowly sits up, squints.

               With the light, the window behind Abby has become a mirror 
               of the entire room, in which we now see the matronly Landlady 
               standing by the wall switch.

               The Landlady roars at the old man in Spanish. The man glowers 
               at her. The Landlady looks back at Abby.

                         I show you around.

               We follow Abby as she accompanies the landlady back into the 
               short hallway-entrance foyer. Abby glances back at the old 
               man.

                         Esteves?

               The Landlady laughs cheerfully.

               She gestures to a kitchen alcove on the left.

</b>                         ...That's the kitchen...

               She turns and throws a few more barbs in Spanish back toward 
               the old man, then opens a door on the right side of the foyer 
               and enters the bathroom.

               She flushes the toilet.

</b>                         ...The toilet works and everytheen...

               She bustles out of the bathroom and takes the two short steps 
               back into the main room. She gestures expansively.

<b>                                     LANDLADY

                         room.

               She gives one vigorous stomp.

</b>                         ...That's Mr. Garcia.

               The old man is now sitting on the edge of the bed, smoking a 
               cigarette, looking for a place to put the ash. The Landlady 
               snaps at him again in Spanish, and is again cheerful as she 
               turns back to address Abby.

               She walks to the apartment door.

               She walks out and shuts the door.

               The room is quiet.

               Staring at the door. She looks at Mr. Garcia, looks nervously

               Staring vacantly at Abby. He blows a stream of smoke across

               Hunched over the public address microphone in his small 
               cubicle of exhortation, is the middle-aged strip-bar barker. 
               Years of service in the bar have left his exhortations 
               depressingly bereft of conviction.

<b>               THE BAR PROPER
</b>
               Meurice is one of a line of men sitting at the bar, all 
               looking intently at the same point off left. All of the men 
               except Meurice are conservatively dressed and apparently 
               well-to-do. An audio loop is blaring a bump-and-grind version 
               of "Yellow Rose of Texas," punctuated by the crash of cymbals 
               and the thumping of toms.

               Abby enters and sits into an empty chair next to Meurice.

                         out of session.

               Meurice continues to stare intently off.

               All of the heads at the bar start to swivel, including 
               Meurice's. A couple of patrons hurriedly snatch their drinks 
               off the bar.

               In the extreme foreground a stripper dances on the top of 
               the bar into frame. We crop her just above her white high-
               heeled cowboy boots and her bare calves.

               The conversation continues with Abby looking at Meurice, but 
               Meurice and everyone else at the bar looking up at a point 
               somewhere above the stripper's calves.

               The stripper drops a white leatherette vest onto the bar in 
               the foreground. The audience cheers.

<b>               RAY'S BEDROOM
</b>
               The room is dark. We are looking across the room toward a 
               moonlit window. Beyond, across the lawn, the lamplit street 
               is empty.

               Suddenly Abby sits bolt upright into frame from the bed below.

               Offscreen we hear Ray stirring in bed.

               Abby twists around to look down at him.

               He pulls her down out of frame and we hold on the window and 
               the empty lamplit street. Then Abby rises back into frame, 
               in silhouette against the window, looking down at Ray.

               the bed, revealing, through the window, a green Volkswagon 
               now parked at curbside on the lamplit street.

               We hear the rustle of sheets.

               As we hold on the window, we begin to hear the faint, distant 
               sound of metal scraping against metal.

<b>               HALLWAY / LIVING ROOM

               We track down the dark hallway into the living room. As the 
               camera advances the sound of the scraping becomes louder.

               We are moving across the living room up to the front door of 
               the bungalow. The scraping is louder still as we finally 
               frame on a close shot of the doorknob, which is jiggling 
               ever so slightly.

               We hear a click as the lock finally releases.

               The door swings slowly open, revealing a man's hand on the 
               outside doorknob. We follow the hand as the man advances 
               slowly and quietly across the living room.

               Abby's purse comes into frame, sitting on a bureau; next to 
               it is a large tote bag. The hand rummages through the tote 
               bag briefly, then the purse. The man withdraws Abby's pearl-
               handled revolver. He breaks it open.

               It is Visser. As we hear a click offscreen, his face glows a 
               dim orange.

<b>               BACK TO HIS HANDS
</b>
               His right holds the revolver, cylinder open, inside the purse.  
               His left holds his cigarette lighter as he inspects the 
               chamber. Three of the holes glint silver, the other three 
               are black--empty.

               We hear the faint creaking of bedsprings.

</b>
               Visser cocks his head, listening, and looks down the hallway. 
               He takes a couple of quiet steps across the living room and, 
               as the camera tracks up to him, opens the back door of the 
               bungalow.

               We follow him outside onto the lawn.

<b>               EXT. RAY'S BUNGALOW
</b>
               We track behind him as he rounds the corner of the house and 
               approaches the open window to Ray's bedroom. He slows, moves 
               more cautiously, then sinks to his knees under the window. 
               As he reaches into his breast pocket the camera continues 
               tracking up to and over him, finally framing his POV through 
               the window.

               On the bed inside we can dimly see Abby and Ray, asleep.

               We have been hearing a faint rumble, becoming louder and 
               louder as if approaching from a distance. Just as the rumble 
               becomes deafening a sudden bright flash of light illuminates 
               the room, seeming to polarize the image of Abby and Ray in 
               bed, and we:

               A huge truck roars by on the street behind Visser, and with 
               it the deafening rumble recedes. It is a painfully bright 
               day. Visser stands sweating in the phone booth with the 
               receiver pressed to his ear. We hear the phone ringing at 
               the other end.

               Finally, it is picked up.

               Visser forces a chuckle.

               Being plopped down onto Marty's desk.

<b>               WIDER  THE OFFICE
</b>
               Visser sits facing the desk. He lights himself a cigarette 
               and sets the lighter down on the desk in front of him. Marty 
               settles, fidgeting, into the chair behind it.

               The bar is quiet, shut down. We hear only the whir of a fan 
               somewhere offscreen. Marty and Visser are lit by a lamp on 
               the desk between them. Light streams into the room from a 
               bathroom in the background. Visser is looking at the dead 
               fish.

                         They look good.

               Marty half-rises from his seat and picks up one of the 
               strings.

<b>                                     MARTY
</b>                         Want a couple?

               He drops them on Visser's side of the desk. Visser's head 
               draws back: he was only being polite.

<b>                                     VISSER

</b>                         Got something to show me first?

               Visser hands a 9 x 12 envelope across the desk. Marty stares 
               at it for a moment, then quickly bends back the flap and 
               takes out an 8 x 10 photograph.

<b>               THE PHOTOGRAPH
</b>
               It is a black-and-white shot of Abby and Ray in Ray's bed. 
               The sheet that partially covers them is pocked with three 
               dark bullet holes and is stained with blood.

               Staring dully down at the picture.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  THE TOP OF THE DESK
</b>
               Visser is pushing the fish away from his side of the desk 
               with the eraser end of a pencil.

<b>               BACK TO MARTY

               Still looking at the picture. He traces the outline of Abby's 
               body with his finger.

               Marty slips the picture back into its 9 x 12 envelope. His 
               face is pale.

               He rises and heads for the bathroom, still clutching the 
               envelope.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER
</b>
               As his eyes follow Marty's exit. The bathroom door doesn't 
               close all the way; a narrow shaft of light slices the office 
               from the bare bulb in the bathroom.

               The standing safe behind the desk.

<b>               BACK TO VISSER

               Still looking at the safe. Beads of sweat have popped out on 
               his forehead. He fans himself with his cowboy hat.

               We hear a toilet flush offscreen.

               Visser stares dully down at the desktop.

                         you been very very careful?

<b>               HIGH ANGLE  CORNER OF THE OFFICE

               Marty is hunched over the open safe, still holding the 
               envelope. Blocking Visser's view of the safe with his body, 
               he slides the picture of Abby's and Ray's corpses from under 
               the envelope into the safe, then withdraws two packets of 
               money.

               He shuts the safe and spins the dial.

</b>                         ...This is an illicit romance--we've 
                         got to trust each other to be

               He walks across the room and throws the money and the envelope 
               down on the desk.

               Visser looks from the money down at his hands. They are 
               sweating.

<b>                                     VISSER

               He nods toward the envelope on the desk.

                         Can't have it both ways.

               He pushes the money across the desk with his boot.

               His hand comes out with a gun pointing at Marty and--BAM--he 
               fires, an orange lick of flame spurting from the gun.

               Both men sit frozen. Visser's hand is the only thing that 
               moved.

               His eyes are now shut. Otherwise he hasn't moved. A blood 
               stain is growing on the front of his shirt.

               The two face each other across the desk. Visser's gun is 
               still trained on Marty.

               After a moment Visser starts fanning himself again with his 
               cowboy hat. The only movement in the frame is the slow back-
               and-forth of the yellow hat, rhythmically in and out of shadow 
               as it catches and loses the light from the desk lamp. There 
               is a long pause.

               Finally one of Marty's feet slips from the desk and hits the 
               floor with a THUD.

               Visser lays the gun on the desk.

               Visser's hands move over the near part of the desk, picking 
               up the money and the 9 x 12 picture envelope.

               The door slams shut.

               The only sound is the whir of the fan. A pause. The camera 
               tracks slowly forward, tilting down to keep Marty and the 
               desktop centered in frame. As the camera moves the noise of

<b>               MARTY'S BAR  LATER

               It is completely still. We are looking from the bar, across 
               the dark empty floor, toward the pebbled windows at the front 
               of the building that catch a hard blue light from the 
               streetlamps outside. The jukebox in the middle distance glows 
               in the darkness.

               A pair of headlights catches the pebbled glass and grows 
               brighter as we hear a car pull up to the bar and stop. We 
               hear a car door open and shut, then the sound of feet on 
               gravel. A huge shadow appears on the pebbled glass as the 
               figure crosses in front of the headlights. The man tries the 
               door, finds it locked, and walks back in front of the 
               headlights to cup his hands at a window. He walks back to 
               the door, and a moment later it swings open--framing him in 
               the doorway in silhouette.

               We follow him as he moves across the floor, behind the bar 
               and up to the cash register. He switches on a small 
               fluorescent light clamped to the top of the cash register. 
               It is Ray.

               He punches a key and the register rings open. He lifts up 
               the empty cash drawer and takes some papers from underneath 
               it.

</b>
               As he flips through the papers; bills, receipts, no money.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               As he finishes flipping through the papers.

<b>                                     RAY
</b>                              (muttering)
                         Damn...

               He slips them back under the cash drawer and slams the 
               register shut. Turning from the register he glances around 
               the bar, the pauses, noticing something.

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               Light is spilling out from under the door to Marty's office.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               As he starts across the floor to Marty's office.

<b>                                     RAY
</b>                         Marty...

               He reaches the door and knocks sharply. No answer. He turns 
               the knob.

<b>                                     RAY
</b>                         Marty...

               The door is locked. We hear the muffled whir of the ceiling 
               fan inside.

               A pause. Ray withdraws a ring of keys from his pocket and 
               uses one on the door. The door swings open.

               Over his shoulder we see Marty, still at his desk, his back 
               to us. On foot is still propped on the desk.

               No answer.

               Ray stumbles toward Marty.

               He stumbles slightly and we hear the sharp blast of a gun 
               and the sound of something metallic skating across the floor.

               Ray, startled, steadies himself against the desk, then studies 
               Marty.

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               There is a dark pool of blood under Marty's chair.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               He looks back up at Marty, then walks behind his chair and 
               throws a wall switch. The room is bathed in light. His eyes 
               still on Marty, Ray crosses behind the desk.

<b>               RAY'S POV  TRACKING SHOT
</b>
               The camera moves in a slow arc around the back of Marty's 
               motionless head.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               Still moving. He looks away from Marty, scans the floor. He 
               gets down on his hands and knees and peers under the safe.

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               There is a glinting silver circle in the darkness under the 
               safe. It is the business end of the revolver that Ray half-
               stumbled over, half-kicked.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               Still on his hands and knees. He reaches in and we hear a 
               rattle as he gropes under the safe. He withdraws the gun, 
               looks at it.

<b>               THE GUN
</b>
               It is Abby's revolver.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               For a long moment he doesn't move. Then, slowly, he starts 
               to get up.

<b>               WIDER
</b>
               The desk, Marty behind it, Ray straightening behind him. Ray 
               looks from the gun to Marty, slowly sets the gun down on the 
               desk. A pause. He begins to hoist Marty from the chair.

               There is noise from the bar, as of someone entering.

               Ray reacts.

<b>               THE DOOR
</b>
               Separating the bar and back office. Ray hurries to it.

               Footsteps approach the door.

</b>
               He turns it gently. The bolt clicks shut.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               Meurice's footsteps draw nearer.

</b>                         Marty, ya home?

               There is a rap at the door; Ray stands frozen. The doorknob 
               rattles. Ray reaches out compulsively to grab it, but stops 
               himself before actually touching it.

               Now Meurice's footsteps can be heard going casually back 
               into the bar. We hold on Ray's rigidly set face.

               We hear a record drop on the jukebox and a Motown song blares.

               Ray crosses to Marty's chair and takes off his nylon 
               windbreaker. He stoops down and tries to mop up the pool of 
               blood with his windbreaker. This isn't going to work.

               He rises and walks over to the bathroom, the windbreaker 
               dripping blood.

               The song continues faintly in the background. The faucet is 
               turned on and Ray's hand enters frame, holding a dirty white 
               towel under the stream of water.

<b>               BLOOD-SPATTERED FLOOR
</b>
               The song continues in the background. Ray's hand enters frame 
               holding the balled-up towel. His windbreaker is wrapped 
               inside. The camera follows as he pushes it across the trail 
               of dripped blood to the pool of blood under Marty's chair.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  MARTY
</b>
               He still has not moved. Ray rises into frame and takes him 
               under the armpits. He notices something on the desk in front 
               of him.

               Marty is hoisted up.

<b>               EXT. BACK OF THE BAR / PARKING LOT
</b>
               Ray appears in the doorway. The music from the bar, though 
               fainter, can still be heard.

               There are three or four wooden steps going down from the 
               back door to the small gravel parking lot in back. Ray backs 
               down the stairs; Marty's feet THUMP-THUMP-THUMP down the 
               stairs after him.

               The rear door of Ray's car is open. Ray heaves in Marty's 
               torso. Marty's legs rest on the ground outside the car. Ray 
               takes an ankle in each hand and pushes.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  RAY
</b>
               As he shuts the door. He looks up across the parking lot.

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               The incinerator belching fire and smoke. We hear its distant 
               roar over the bar song. We hear the car door slam.

<b>               HIGH-ANGLE TRACKING SHOT  TOWARD INCINERATOR
</b>
               We are looking down on Ray's car as the camera tracks behind 
               it towards the incinerator. At the cut the roar of the 
               incinerator is suddenly louder. It grows louder still as we 
               approach it.

               Ray's car draws even with the incinerator without slowing or 
               stopping. The wadded-up towel is chucked out of his window 
               into the fire. We hold on the fire as Ray's car rolls on out 
               of frame.

<b>               INT. RAY'S CAR
</b>
               As he drives down a deserted country highway. We hear the 
               rhythmic sound of the wheels clomping over asphalt. The radio 
               is broadcasting a fundamentalist's sermon, periodically 
               interrupted by static. Ray is sweating.

               Ray twists around and looks in the back seat.

               Ray switches off the radio.

               We hear the sound of faint, labored breathing.

<b>               EXTREME CLOSE SHOT  RAY

               His jaw tightens. He whips his head toward the back seat. 
               His head snaps forward again and he slams on the brakes.

               The car screeches to a halt.

               As Ray's door flies open. He is bolting from the car. The 
               camera, at waist level, tracks toward him as he races out 
               into the field that abuts the highway.

               Fifty yards in he finally stops, panting, framed from a low 
               angle. His breath vaporizes in the crisp night air. We hear 
               only his breath and the chirring of crickets. He is looking 
               back toward the road.

<b>               RAY'S POV  LONG SHOT  THE CAR

               Standing abandoned on the shoulder of the deserted highway. 
               Its headlights cast a lonely beam up the road. No movement.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               His panting slows. He is in a cold sweat. After a long moment, 
               he starts walking slowly, reluctantly, back toward the car.

               He slows as he draws up to the back of the car. He looks in

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               Marty is crawling up the road on his hands and knees, leaving 
               a trail of blood. The headlights of Ray's car give a 
               fantastically long shadow.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               Still no reaction. He gets into the driver's seat and stares 
               through the windshield as he gropes for the ignition key.

</b>
               He throws the car into drive, looks at his target, thinks--
               decides. He pulls the key out of the ignition and goes around 
               to the trunk of the car. He opens it and pulls out a shovel.

               From in front. The headlights glare behind him. His breath 
               vaporizes. In the background Ray is walking toward him, 
               dragging the shovel, which scrapes along the asphalt. As Ray 
               moves into the foreground and turns to face Marty only his 
               lower legs and the shovel are in frame.

               The shovel rises out of frame.

               Both hands hold the shovel tensed over his shoulder. He stares 
               down at Marty. A long pause. We hear a distant rumble.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  RAY'S FEET
</b>
               Inches away from Marty. Marty's hand slides forward and wraps 
               around one of Ray's ankles.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               He shudders. He adjusts his grip on the shovel.

               The rumble grows louder.

<b>               RAY'S FEET
</b>
               He jerks his foot away, breaking Marty's grasp.

<b>               BACK TO RAY

               Looks up from Marty. The rumble grows louder.

<b>               RAY'S POV

               Headlight beams, although not yet the headlights themselves, 
               are visible a long way down the road.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               Staring down the road. Finally he lowers the shovel, walks 
               back to the car and throws it viciously into the trunk, walks 
               back up into the foreground and stoops down.

               back to the car. Just before Ray heaves him into the back 
               seat, Marty coughs weakly. A fine spray of blood comes out 
               with the cough.

               The engine rumble is quite loud now.

               As he slams the back door shut. He presses himself against

               Sudden quiet at the cut. We are looking at Ray's car in 
               profile, parked in the middle of a deserted field. From 
               offscreen we hear the sound of a shovel biting into earth.

               We track laterally down the car, along the beam of its 
               headlights, to finally frame Ray as he climbs out of the 
               shallow grave he has just finished digging.

               He plants the shovel and walks back to the car.

               Ray is dragging Marty toward the grave. He dumps him in.

               As he bends over to pick up the shovel, dripping sweat. We 
               hear the shovel biting into earth.

</b>
               Ray, in the foreground, pitches the first shovelful of earth 
               onto Marty. Marty moves slightly.

</b>
               As he pauses, looking down into the grave. He stoops down 
               and resumes shoveling, bobbing in and out of frame as he 
               hurls dirt into the grave.

<b>               BACK TO HIGH SHOT
</b>
               As Ray shovels, Marty is moving under the loose dirt. A faint, 
               inarticulate noise comes from the grave.

               Almost imperceptibly, Marty's right arm starts to rise.

<b>               LOW SHOT  FROM INSIDE THE GRAVE
</b>
               Ray stands on the lip of the grave, hunched over his shovel, 
               crisply illuminated by the headlights. In the shadowy 
               foreground Marty's arm rises, extended toward Ray. He is 
               clutching Abby's gun in his splint-fingered hand.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  RAY
</b>
               As he straightens up and stands motionless, expressionless, 
               watching Marty, making no attempt to get out of the way.

<b>               HIGH SHOT  MARTY
</b>
               The gun extended into the foreground. His index finger 
               splinted, he slides his middle finger over the trigger of 
               the gun.

<b>               LOW SHOT  RAY
</b>
               Watching.

<b>               HIGH SHOT  MARTY
</b>
               The gun trembling in the foreground. His knuckle whitens 
               over the trigger.

               The trigger releases and we hear the dull click of an empty 
               chamber.

<b>               LOW SHOT  RAY
</b>
               Staring blankly down at Marty.

               Of Marty's gun hand as Ray slowly sinks down on the lip of 
               the grave, bracing himself with the shovel. His hand reaches 
               for Marty's. Marty squeezes off two more empty chambers. 
               Ray's hand slowly closes over the barrel of the gun.

               As he pulls, the gun slides from Marty's fingers.

</b>
               It is filled. Ray is packing down the earth, slamming the 
               shovel furiously against the bare patch of earth.

               Being slammed down against the earth. Again and again.

<b>               EXT. OPEN FIELD  SUNRISE
</b>
               The staccato beat of the shovel slamming against earth drops 
               out at the cut. There is perfect quiet. The sun is just 
               peeping over the horizon. In the foreground Ray is sitting 
               in the open door of his car, smoking a cigarette. His gaze 
               is fixed on a spot offscreen.

<b>               HIS POV
</b>
               A house. Quite near by.

               The house and its perfect green rectangle of lawn are set 
               incongruously in the middle of the open field.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               Staring, without emotion.

               He takes one last, fierce drag on the cigarette, then flicks 
               it away. He takes the shovel, walks over to the grave and 
               stares at it for several seconds, shovel clasped firmly in 
               both hands.

               He walks back to the car.

<b>               HIGH SHOT
</b>
               House, car and grave. Ray throws the shovel into the car, 
               gets in, and turns the ignition.

               The engine coughs weakly and dies.

               He tries again. Same result.

               One more time. The engine coughs, sputters, and fires to 
               life. The car runs over the grave and rattles on across the 
               rutted field towards the highway in the distance.

<b>               INT. RAY'S CAR  DAWN

               As Ray drives down the straight empty highway in the flat 
               early-morning light.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  RAY
</b>
               Pale and unblinking.

<b>               RAY'S POV  THE HIGHWAY
</b>
               In the distance we see a beat-up white station wagon 
               approaching. It's headlights wink on, then off again.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               He squints at the approaching car.

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               The car is closer. It's headlights wink again.

<b>               BACK TO RAY
</b>
               His jaw tightens. He stares intently at the car. Then, 
               abruptly, he looks down at his dashboard.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  HEADLIGHT KNOB ON THE DASHBOARD
</b>
               His headlights are on. Ray's hand enters frame and pushes in 
               the knob.

<b>               SIDE ANGLE  RAY
</b>
               Watching the approaching station wagon. As it passes we catch 
               a glimpse of its occupant. He grins and cocks a you-got-it 
               finger at Ray before roaring out of frame.

<b>               EXT. DESERTED GAS STATION

               The station hasn't opened yet. Ray's car, empty, stands alone 
               in the lot. Flat prairie stretches to the horizon. No movement 
               in the frame.

               At the cut we hear the faint sound of a phone ringing through 
               a receiver. After four or five rings the phone is picked up 
               and we begin a slow crane down.

               The continuing crane down reveals Ray in a phone booth in 
               the foreground.

               The phone disconnects.

               Her sleeping head on a pillow. Offscreen we hear a door open 
               and shut. A moment later Ray's dirt-caked hand comes into 
               frame and gently brushes a wisp of hair back for Abby's face. 
               We hear Ray walk across the apartment and a moment later the 
               sound of water running.

               Abby stirs. She looks offscreen.

               Standing in the doorway to the bathroom. He is wiping his 
               hands on a towel.

               Still half asleep, Abby smiles.

</b>                         I said you're bad.

               There is a long pause. Finally:

                         ...You're bad too.

               Ray swings a chair out and sits down behind a table at the 
               far end of the room. He leans back and props his legs up on 
               the table. He is staring across the room at Abby.

               As we hear the click of a pull-string the camera is dropping: 
               down past an orange safe light, down the length of the string, 
               down to a metal darkroom tray where two short strips of 
               negative are burning.

               Visser's hand and yellow sleeve cuff (now orange) enter frame, 
               with an 8 x 10 black-and-white photograph. The photograph is 
               dropped into the tray. As it burns we see that it is the 
               same picture of Abby's and Ray's "corpses" as Visser showed 
               Marty, except that in this print the bullet holes and blood 
               are less convincingly brushed in.

               Another print is dropped into the tray and ignites. In this 
               one we see bullet holes but no blood.

               A third print is dropped in and ignites. It is the original 
               undoctored shot of Abby and Ray asleep in bed.

               Visser's hands enter frame holding the picture-envelope that 
               he took away from Marty's office. Visser rips it in half and 
               is about to drop it into the tray, but stops abruptly.

               There is posterboard, not a photograph, peeking out of the 
               torn envelope.

               Visser's hands pull the two halves of the placard from the 
               envelope and fit them together. The stenciled 8 x 10 placard 
               says: "All Employees Must Wash Hands Before Resuming Work."

               Staring at the placard in disbelief.

               After a moment his hand rises into frame to deposit a 
               cigarette in his mouth. His hand drops back down, groping in 
               a pocket.

               His hand jumps back into frame, empty; he thumps at his breast 
               pockets; he can't find his lighter.

               He wheels and exits frame. The light snaps off. A door slams 
               shut.

               Ray's pacing is more agitated as he looks distractedly around 
               the apartment.

                         gonna get up and try and kill you.

               He pauses, seemingly at a total loss.

               Ray is walking to the window. Sunlight streams in around 
               him.

</b>                         That ain't important. What's important 
                         is that we did it. That's the only 
                         thing that matters. We both did it 
                         for each other...

               He stoops down to look through a pile of clothes by the 
               window.

               Ray's head snaps around. Staring at her he slowly rises to 
               his feet and then remains still.

               We track toward him, isolating him against the window. He is 
               perfectly still. For a long time he can't speak.

               The ring of the telephone cuts her off. She looks at the 
               phone, pauses for a moment, then continues, struggling.

               Her voice trails off.

               The telephone won't stop ringing. Abby and Ray are staring 
               at each other, seemingly oblivious to it. Finally:

               Through the phone we hear only the rhythmic whir of a ceiling 
               fan. Abby shifts the phone to her other ear, listening hard. 
               It is the same sound we heard earlier when she picked up the 
               phone at Ray's house.

               As before, the line clicks dead.

                         ...Welp, that was him.

               There is a long moment of silence. Then Ray's voice comes 
               from across the room:

               There is silence again.

               Ray shifts in front of the window. He laughs humorlessly. 
               The laugh stops abruptly.

               He pauses at the foyer and pulls Abby's gun out of his pocket. 
               He sets it on a shelf by the door.

               Watching. We hear the door open.

               We hear the door slam shut.

               We hear the rhythmic whir of the fan. We tilt down from the 
               ceiling to reveal that we are in the living room of Ray's 
               bungalow.

               In the foreground Visser sits in a chair with the cradled 
               telephone in his lap, facing the front door, which stands 
               open in the background. The contents of Abby's tote bag lie 
               strewn on the bureau next to Visser. Her purse is not there. 
               After a moment Visser rouses himself and starts to sweep the 
               articles back into the tote bag.

<b>               INT. MEURICE'S APARTMENT  DAY
</b>
<b>               LOW WIDE SHOT  LIVING ROOM
</b>
               It is dark, lit only by the morning light leaking in around 
               the drawn blinds. It is a small modern apartment such as one 
               sees in large apartment complexes--shag carpeting, built-in 
               bar. In the extreme foreground the small red "Power" light 
               of a telephone answering machine glows in the darkness.

               The front door opens in the background, spilling bright 
               sunlight. Meurice stoops down, picks up two newspapers, 
               enters, and shuts the door. He walks toward the camera and 
               his hand enters frame in extreme foreground to punch the 
               rewind button on the machine. His hand leaves frame. A few 
               pieces of mail are flipped down onto the machine table, piece 
               by piece, as the machine rewinds. He reaches down again and 
               hits playback. After a beep:

               Mow that his temper is gone, he realizes he has nothing much 
               to say. He shakes his head and turns back down the drive, 
               muttering as he lights himself Ray's cigarette.

                         about this shit.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  RAY
</b>
               Standing in front of the back door of his car, watching 
               Meurice walk away. His right hand rises into frame to deposit 
               another unlit cigarette in his mouth. Offscreen, Meurice 
               calls from the end of the drive:

<b>                                     MEURICE
</b>                         I'm not laughing at this, Ray Bob, 
                         so you know it's no fucking joke.

               We hear his car door slam. After a moment Ray exits frame, 
               heading for the house. The camera tracks slowly in to the 
               back window of the car.

               Traces of blood are starting to seep up from the upholstery 
               into the sheet.

</b>
               We are looking across the tiled floor toward the front 
               doorway. The room has the dim gray cast of daytime inside a 
               shuttered house. We hold on the empty foyer as we hear an 
               intermittent high whining sound. We hear the padding of feet 
               on carpet, and then the clatter of nails on tile as Opal, 
               Marty's German shepherd, trots into frame and circles the 
               foyer, still whining. She jumps up and scratches desperately 
               at the front door.

               A slow, rhythmic pounding is very faint on the track.

<b>               EXT. MARTY'S BAR  DUSK
</b>
               Abby has just gotten out of her car and is walking up to the 
               front of the darkened bar. The faint, rhythmic thumping 
               continues over the cut, its source somewhere offscreen. As 
               Abby takes a key out of her purse and lets herself into the 
               bar, the thumping stops.

<b>               INT. MARTY'S BAR
</b>
               Abby switches on the lights, looks around, goes to the back-
               office door. Locked. As she fits her key into the lock:

<b>                                     ABBY
</b>                              (quietly)
                         Marty?

               The door swings open, fanning a shaft of light onto the 
               darkened room.

<b>               MARTY'S OFFICE BATHROOM
</b>
               We are looking from the inside at the bathroom door that 
               won't close all the way. As the light fans into the office 
               beyond and seeps in through the crack of the bathroom door, 
               we see Visser's sleeve cuff and his hand pressing against 
               the door, to hold it near-shut.

</b>
               Standing in the office doorway. We pull her into the room. 
               She stops abruptly, looking past the camera, and wrinkles 
               her nose.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               Marty's fish, now half-decayed, still lie on the desk.

               Some of the desk drawers stand open, with some of their 
               contents strewn across the surface of the desk.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               She takes a step forward. We hear the crunch of glass 
               underfoot. She looks down at the floor.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               Shards of broken glass lie on the floor.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY

               She looks up from the floor toward the back door.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               The pane of the back-door window closest to the knob has 
               been shattered from the outside, scattering broken glass 
               into the office.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               She crosses slowly to the desk, staring at the rotted fish. 
               She looks up from the desk.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               On the standing safe behind the desk lies a white towel. 
               Abby's hand enters frame ans picks up the towel.

               In slow motion a hammer that's been wrapped inside slips out 
               of the towel, falls end-over-end, hits the floor with a dull 
               thud.

</b>
               Stooping down to pick up the hammer. At eye level as she 
               stoops down is the combination dial to the safe. The dial 
               has been battered by the hammer. Abby looks from the hammer 
               to the floor under the desk chair.

               Blood stains.

               Staring down at the floor. She rises and looks at the desk. 
               As she rises we hear glass under her feet.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               The dead fish. Beyond them, on the floor around the desk, 
               broken glass.

               The dead fish.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               She seems to be falling slowly backwards. The camera falls 
               with her, keeping her in close shot. Her head hits a pillow. 
               We pull back slowly to reveal that she is lying on the bed 
               in her apartment, staring across the room. She lies motionless 
               on the bad, her eyes wide.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               Across the darkened apartment we see the curtainless windows, 
               and beyond them, across the lamplit street, the facade of 
               the opposite building.

               Lying still. After a moment she gets out of bed, crosses to 
               the front door of the apartment, locks it, then walks 
               unsteadily back to the bed.

<b>                                                                   FADE OUT

               She opens her eyes, lies still for a moment, coughs. She 
               gets out of bed and walks across the still dark apartment to 
               the bathroom. She shuts the bathroom door.

<b>               BATHROOM
</b>
               Abby looks at herself in the mirror above the sink, then 
               turns on the tap water. From a neighboring apartment we hear 
               a dull rhythmic thumping on the wall. She pauses, listens 
               for a moment, then starts to splash water on her face.

               From somewhere offscreen we hear the sharp sound of glass 
               shattering. It reverberates for a moment, then dies. Abby 
               looks up at the bathroom door. We hear a scraping at the 
               lock of her apartment door. Abby listens.

               Suddenly we hear the lock springing open, and the front door 
               swinging on its hinges.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY
</b>
               Startled. She shuts off the water and stands motionless. 
               Droplets of water are streaming down her face.

               We hear the sound of footsteps in the next room, crunching 
               across broken glass.

<b>                                     ABBY
</b>                         Ray...?

               There is no answer. After a moment we hear bedsprings creak 
               in the next room. Abby opens the bathroom door and walks 
               out.

<b>               MAIN ROOM
</b>
               A shaft of light slices across the floor from the open 
               bathroom door. Broken glass glints on the floor. In the semi-
               darkness we can see that someone is sitting on the bed. The 
               person looks up.

               It is Marty.

               Abby recoils.

<b>                                     MARTY
</b>                         Lover-boy oughta lock his door.

               Abby looks nervously at Marty. Droplets of water are still 
               running down her face. She brushes one from her eye.

<b>                                     MARTY

               He smiles thinly.

</b>                         ...That's a stupid thing to say, 
                         right?

               Abby takes a step back.

</b>                         I... I love you too.

               Still smiling, Marty shakes his head.

                         you're scared...

               He stands. We hear glass under his feet. He unbuttons the 
               middle button of his coat and reaches inside.

               He withdraws something from an inside pocket and tosses it 
               to her.

               She looks from her hands up to Marty.

               Marty gags, leans forward, doubles over to vomit--blood.

               The blood washes over the floor at his feet.

               Bolts upright in bead with a muffled groan. Sweat pours down 
               her face. She brushes a drop of sweat from her eye and looks 
               around.

               Moonlight glints through the windows across the hardwood 
               floor. Through the windows we can see the facade of the 
               opposite building. The apartment is dark and still, just as 
               we left it before she fell asleep.

               She slumps back onto the bed. One hand gropes down out of 
               frame and comes up holding an illuminated alarm clock. She 
               looks at it, drops it back to the floor.

               She turns on her side and stares across the room toward the 
               window.

               It is still not quite light. The few lights that shined in 
               the windows of the opposite building before are now off; the

               After a moment Abby enters frame. She picks her coat off a

               We hear a car door slam.

               Abby has just gotten out of her car in the foreground and is 
               crossing the lawn to the house. Down the road the street 
               lights are still on. One light burns in the house, in the 
               window of Ray's bedroom. Abby approaches it.

</b>
               Over Abby's shoulder, as she leans against the sill of the 
               open window and looks inside.

               Ray sits on the bed in the empty room, smoking a cigarette, 
               his profile to the window, gazing fixedly at the wall.

               Abby is coming through the screen door. The room is strikingly 
               bare of everything except furniture. All personal effects 
               have been removed.

               Abby looks around, bewildered, as Ray enters from the hallway.

               Abby, still standing in front of the door, looks at him 
               uncomprehendingly. Ray walks over to a couple of cardboard 
               boxes stacked in the corner.

               He ties a knot around the top carton with a piece of cord, 
               then cuts the cord with a collapsible fishing knife.

               It's difficult to bring out. Ray's hand gropes for the cross-
               slat on the screen door. Finally:

               Abby stares.

               An object materializes in the sky beyond them. It is flipping 
               end-over-end in slow motion, moving toward Abby and Ray and 
               the screen door. Abby and Ray, each staring at the other, 
               fail to notice until--

               THWACK--it bounces off the screen.

               Abby starts; Ray doesn't.

               The spell is broken, Abby pushes hesitantly at the screen 
               door. Ray's hand slides off the cross-slat; he makes no move 
               to stop her.

               More blood has seeped into and dried on the dropsheet covering

               Meurice is standing in the doorway in a long bathrobe. A

               The engine rumble continues over the cut. There is no other 
               traffic on the highway. A light fog covers the road. A green 
               highway sign says: "San Antonio 73 mi." We hear a car radio 
               playing softly.

</b>
               Driving. He is gently lit by the light from the dashboard. 
               He reaches forward to turn off the radio. The only sound now 
               is the hum of the engine and the rhythmic clomping of tires 
               on pavement. The look and sound of the scene are close to 
               those of the first scene of the movie.

               Ray takes a cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his 
               mouth, but leaves it unlit.

               The headlights of an approaching car materialize in the fog. 
               The car passes with a roar.

               Up ahead a traffic light is turning amber.

<b>               BACK TO RAY

               The engine hum drops as he slows. We hear the low engine 
               rumble and the squeaking brakes of another car. Ray is now 
               stopped in front of the deserted intersection. He looks up 
               in his rearview mirror.

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               Another car is stopped just behind him, the fog floating up 
               past its headlights. The headlights halate in the fog; none 
               of the rest of the car is visible.

<b>               BACK TO RAY

               The unlit cigarette still in his mouth. He looks down from

               is a long pause, during which we hear only the steady purr 
               of Ray's car and the knocking rumble of the car behind him.

               Ray looks up at the traffic light.

               The headlights of the other car remain motionless behind 
               him. The car makes no move to pass.

               He slowly takes the cigarette from his mouth and drops it 
               onto the seat next to him. His eyes shift from the rearview 
               mirror to the traffic light.

               of its engine.

               His eyes shift back to the mirror. He gropes for his window 
               handle and slowly rolls it down. He sticks out his left arm, 
               eyes still on the rearview mirror, and waves for the other 
               car to go around him.

<b>               RAY'S POV
</b>
               The other car remains still for a moment. White fog floats 
               up beyond the red fog created by Ray's brake lights.

               As the car pulls out into the light from the intersection 
               and Ray's headlights, we see that it is a battered green 
               Volkswagon. First the car itself, and then its red tail 
               lights, disappear into the fog.

               Watching, for a long moment.

               Finally he takes his foot off the brake, turns the steering 
               wheel hard left and hangs a U-turn.

               the bedroom where we earlier saw Abby looking through her 
               purses.

               We start to hear the faint buzzing of a fly.

               Meurice glances around, throws off the light, and shuts the

               At desk level, we again see the glint of Visser's lighter 
               under the dead fish.

               Ray crosses slowly around the desk into the foreground and 
               lays the picture flat on the desktop. For a moment he stares 
               down at it, then wheels abruptly and leaves frame.

               Abby approaches her door in the foreground and lets herself 
               in.

               Looking toward the window. The room is dark. Through the 
               window we see the facade of the building across the street. 
               Abby enters frame in the foreground, in silhouette against 
               the window, and throws an overhead light switch. The bright 
               light reveals Ray standing by the window, looking out.

               From the roof of the building across the street we are looking 
               down on the facade of Abby's building. Most of its windows 
               are dark, but in a brightly lit fourth-floor window we can 
               clearly see Abby and Ray.

               A man is on the roof in the foreground, hitching a rifle to 
               his shoulder.

<b>               INT. ABBY'S APARTMENT

               Ray turns from the window which, with the switching on of 
               the overhead light, has become a mirror of the interior of 
               the apartment.

               The light goes out in the apartment across the street; its

               Dark now. Ray still stands by the window, looking out. Abby 
               still stands by the light switch.

                         No curtains on the windows.

               Abby is clearly apprehensive--about Ray, not about anything 
               outside.

               Abby doesn't understand, and has had enough. As she throws 
               the light back on:

               Ray and Abby are once again clearly visible. Ray is starting 
               across the room.

<b>               INT. ABBY'S APARTMENT

               Abby takes a fearful step back as Ray strides toward the 
               light switch, next to her.

<b>                                     ABBY

                         --If you do anything the neighbors'll 
                         hear.

               This brings Ray up short. He stares at Abby. It registers 
               that it is him she's afraid of.

               He shakes his head.

</b>                         ...Abby. I meant it... when I 
                         called...

               Abby takes another step back. Her voice comes out, after a 
               pause, half-strangled:

<b>                                     ABBY
</b>                         ...I love you too.

               Ray winces. He slowly shakes his head with a pained half-
               smile.

</b>                         Because you're scared.

               We hear the dull report of a rifle and the deafening sound 
               of shattering glass. The gun shot hits Ray in the back, 
               knocking him to the floor. He lies still.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY
</b>
               She stares dumbly down at Ray. She looks slowly up to the 
               window.

<b>               THE WINDOW
</b>
               It has a gaping black hole. The sound of shattering glass 
               still reverberates in the apartment. Small shards of glass 
               chink down from the window and shatter on the floor.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               Staring at the window, paralyzed--almost in a trance. Quiet 
               except for the chinking of glass.

<b>               EXT. FACING ROOF
</b>
               We are looking through the telescopic sight of a high-powered 
               rifle. The rifle sweeps up from Ray's body across the brightly 
               lit room, and centers Abby, still staring at the window, in 
               the cross hairs.

<b>               INT. ABBY'S APARTMENT
</b>
               We are looking past Abby toward the shattered window at the 
               far end of the room. A brass lamp stands in the foreground, 
               between Abby and the camera. Abby still stands paralyzed.

               Glass has stopped chinking from the window to the floor; 
               there is a painful silence.

               Suddenly Abby dives to the floor just as CRASH the rest of 
               the window falls away and PING the brass lamp somersaults 
               toward us from the impact of the bullet.

               The window is now completely gone--just a black hole in the 
               brightly lit wall.

<b>               ABBY
</b>
               Scrambles into a corner at the window end of the room. The 
               only sound is her heavy breathing. She looks over at Ray, 
               then up at the bulb on the ceiling.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY

               Breathing heavily, almost hysterical. She looks down at the 
               floor.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               Ray is sprawled on the floor in a pool of blood and broken 
               glass.

</b>
               She reaches down and pulls off one of her shoes. She throws 
               it at the ceiling bulb.

               We hear the bulb shatter and the room goes black.

               Abby rises and makes her way cautiously across the glass-
               littered floor toward Ray. She stoops over him.

               Its front door in background. Abby rises into frame and backs 
               toward the doorway, staring down at the floor. One of her 
               hands is covered with blood.

               She winces and almost loses her balance as we hear a piece 
               of glass crunching under her bare floor. She turns and moves 
               to the front door, favoring one foot, and throws the door 
               open.

<b>               HALLWAY

               Abby lurches from her apartment and pounds on the neighboring 
               door. No answer. She pounds on the door across the hall.

               Abby heads for the stairway at the far end of the hall. The 
               heel of her shod foot is throwing her weight onto her bad 
               foot; she kicks off the shoe.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY

               As she reaches the top of the stairs. She takes one step 
               down, then brings herself up short. She looks over the railing 
               down the stairwell. It is quiet. An innocent-sounding cough 
               echoes somewhere in the building.

               We hear the sound of footsteps from somewhere below.

               Abby turns and hobbles back to her apartment. The bareness 
               of the hallway sets off her abandoned shoe.

<b>               ABBY'S APARTMENT
</b>
               As she enters and slams the door behind her. She scrabbles 
               at the lock, finally manages to get it shut, then turns and 
               looks frantically around.

               Ray is lying still in the darkness.

               We can hear footsteps approaching up the hallway.

               Abby enters frame and kneels down next to Ray. She fumbles 
               around him briefly in the darkness.

               The doorknob rattles. Abby freezes, listening, trying to 
               control her breath. After a moment we hear a scraping at the 
               lock.

               Abby moves to the bathroom adjoining the main room and shuts 
               the door behind her.

               It is very small. Abby presses her palms against the door 
               and slowly eases her ear against the door to listen. The 
               scraping in the apartment door lock continues. Sweat streams 
               down Abby's face. She brushes a drop from her eye.

               We hear the snap of the lock springing open, and the front 
               door swinging on its hinges.

<b>               CLOSER ON ABBY

               Her ear pressed to the door. From the next room we hear the 
               sound of footsteps crunching across broken glass.

               Abby backs away from the door, stares at it, then turns and 
               moves to the bathroom window. She looks out.

               A sheer drop to the narrow backyard of the building four 
               stories below. Next to Abby's window is another window, 
               separated from hers only by the breadth of the wall, that 
               separates the two apartments.

               Visser looks down at Ray, glances around the room, looks 
               back down at Ray.

               His hand, gripping something, flashes down out of frame. We 
               hear a dull crunch.

<b>               BATHROOM

               Abby has drawn her head back from the bathroom window. She 
               moves back to the door and braces herself against it.

<b>               ABBY'S APARTMENT

               Visser straightens up from Ray's body. He drops something to 
               the floor, out of frame, that lands with a thud.

               He goes over to the light switch on the wall and flips it 
               back and forth. No light.

               He goes over to the brass lamp, sets it upright, tries its 
               switch. Again nothing.

               He disappears into the kitchenette as we hold on its open 
               doorway. After a moment we hear a refrigerator hum as a cold 
               blue light plays in the doorway. There is the rattle of a 
               can being pulled off the refrigerator rack, and the snap of 
               its pull-tab being opened. After a couple of audible slurps 
               we hear the can go back on the rack and, as the blue light 
               disappears, we hear the refrigerator door close.

               Visser reappears in the doorway. He surveys the room, fixes 
               on the bathroom door, goes over, turns the knob. The door 
               swings open.

               He walks in.

<b>               BATHROOM
</b>
               Visser looks around the cramped space. The shower curtain is 
               drawn. He casually draws it back. The shower is empty.

               He goes to the window and leans out.

               The sheer drop below; the other window to one side.

<b>               BACK TO VISSER

               He draws his head back in, presses his palms against the 
               adjacent wall, and eases his ear to the wall to listen.

               Perfect quiet.

               After a moment he goes back to the window, braces himself 
               against the sash, and sticks his arm out--groping for the 
               window of the adjacent apartment.

               Again we see him through the window. His jaw is set as he 
               gropes offscreen.

               Suddenly his body jerks violently forward, his head smacking 
               against the glass and cracking it.

               apartments. A line of light shoots across the dark apartment 
               from the bright bathroom next door.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               Staring at the wall. We hear a second CRACK.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               A second hole has opened in the wall, letting through a second 
               shaft of light.

               Four more sharp reports in rapid succession: With each gun 
               blast a bright circle opens and a new shaft of light 
               penetrates the dark apartment.

               Finally we hear the CLICK of an empty chamber, and the clatter 
               of the empty gun being dropped to the floor of the bathroom 
               next door.

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY
</b>
               Staring at the lines of light that crisscross the apartment.

               There is a long moment of silence, then a sudden THUMP.

<b>               ABBY'S POV  THE WALL
</b>
               Six circles of light.

               The circles go black momentarily as there is another THUMP. 
               And another. Each time Visser pounds his fist against the 
               wall, there is a muffled THUMP and his swinging arm strobes 
               the bullet holes.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               She turns and hobbles toward the door of apartment. The 
               muffled thumping continues, as in her dream.

<b>               HALLWAY
</b>
               As Abby emerges from the adjacent apartment. She stops and 
               looks down the hall.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               The stairway is at the far end of the hall. The door of her 
               own darkened apartment stands slightly ajar.

<b>               ADJACENT APARTMENT
</b>
<b>               CLOSE SHOT  THE WALL
</b>
               The bullet holes strobing. The pounding, more purposeful 
               now, grows louder and more intense.

               Finally, with a crash, Visser's fist penetrates the wall in 
               an explosion of light and dust.

<b>               HALLWAY
</b>
               We pull Abby as she limps hesitantly down the hall.

<b>               ADJACENT APARTMENT
</b>
<b>               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S HAND
</b>
               Waving aimlessly through the ambient dust. He is blindly 
               groping for the sill--and the knife that pins his other hand.

               His outstretched middle finger just grazes the handle of the 
               knife.

<b>               ABBY'S HALLWAY / APARTMENT
</b>
               Pulling Abby as she draws even with the door of her apartment.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               Her pearl-handled revolver sits on the shelf just inside the 
               door, where Ray left it. It catches the light from the hall.

<b>               ADJACENT APARTMENT
</b>
<b>               EXTREME CLOSE SHOT  VISSER'S FINGERTIPS
</b>
               The side of his middle finger rubs against the knife handle; 
               the tip of his index finger barely touches it. Visser's 
               fingers are trembling, indicating that his arm is stretched 
               to its uttermost.

               A surge against the wall gives his fingers another inch or 
               so and they curl around the handle of the knife.

</b>
<b>               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY
</b>
               As she steps in from the hallway to pick up the gun. She 
               looks around the apartment.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               The window of the apartment, its glass now completely gone, 
               lets in streetlight. Ray's corpse is a dark form in the middle 
               of the floor. A bright shaft of light slices across the room 
               from offscreen. It glints on the shards of glass that litter 
               the floor, just as in Abby's dream.

<b>               BATHROOM
</b>
<b>               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER
</b>
               As he slowly, quietly draws his hand in from the hole in the 
               wall. He is holding the knife.

               He turns slowly to face the door, listening.

<b>               ABBY'S APARTMENT
</b>
<b>               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY
</b>
               She steadies herself against the wall and turns to look toward 
               the bathroom.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               The bathroom door stands slightly ajar. The interior of the 
               bathroom is a bright band in the shadowy recesses of the 
               back of the apartment.

<b>               BATHROOM

<b>               CLOSE SHOT  VISSER

</b>
<b>               CLOSE SHOT  ABBY
</b>
               Staring, almost transfixed, at the bathroom door. She raises 
               the gun, trembling, and trains it on the band of light.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               Visser's shadow falls across the crack in the doorway.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               She shifts the gun slightly and fires.

<b>               ABBY'S POV
</b>
               With the roar of the gun, a small circle of light opens in 
               the door. As the door waffles under the impact, we hear Visser 
               collapsing behind it.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               Leaning against the facing wall. She lowers the gun. She 
               slides down the wall to finally rest seated on the floor. 
               She brushes a drop of sweat from her eye.

<b>               HER POV
</b>
               The cracked bathroom door spilling light.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               A pause. After a moment, her voice comes out half-choked:

<b>                                     ABBY
</b>                         ...I ain't afraid of you, Marty.

<b>               HER POV
</b>
               The bathroom door. Quiet for a long moment.

               Then, from inside the bathroom, we hear laughter.

<b>               BACK TO ABBY
</b>
               Staring at the door. We hear the laughter subside, to leave 
               the sound of labored breathing. Finally:

<b>                                     VISSER (O.S.)
</b>                         ...Well ma'am...

<b>               BATHROOM
</b>
               Visser lies on his back, his head underneath the bathroom 
               sink.

               His good hand is pressed against his belly, which rises and 
               falls with his heavy breathing. Blood seeps out between his 
               fingers.

               He is smiling.

<b>                                     VISSER
</b>                         ...If I see him, I'll sure give him 
                         the message.

<b>               HIS POV
</b>
               The underside of the sink, its convoluted chrome works beading 
               moisture.

<b>               VISSER
</b>
               Looking, with mild interest.

<b>               HIS POV
</b>
               A condensed droplet trickles down the chrome.

               Directly overhead, it hangs for a moment from the lowest 
               joint of the pipe.

               It fattens, wavers, wavers--and falls, spelling...

                             [DELETED SCENE FROM 1st. DRAFT]

               "...In an early draft of the script, Ray, the befuddled 
               bartender who for want of a more compelling character served 
               as our story's hero, fled the scene of the tale's protracted 
               central murder and checked into a motel outside of San 
               Antonio:"

<b>               MOTEL LOBBY  DAY
</b>
               DUSTY RHODES, a lean man with a weathered face and large 
               Adam's apple, stands behind the Formica check-in counter. 
               KYLE, a heavyset man of thirty wearing a feed cap, sits in 
               the lobby's one piece of furniture, a beat-up leatherette 
               sofa. He sips from a can of soda.

               Ray, begrimed and haggard, enters out of the glare of the 
               noonday sun.

               found in the finished script but not in the finished movie.
