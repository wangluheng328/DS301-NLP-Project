Arrested development confronts 30-something Rob Gordon when Laura, his smart and successful lover, leaves him because he hasn't changed since they met.
He reviews his top five worst breakups (he constantly makes top five lists, though usually about music).
He recalls each breakup, reconnects with these former loves to find out why they dumped him, and wallows in misery from losing Laura.
Much of it plays out at his vinyl record store where he and two clerks, socially-inept savants, live and breathe obscure contemporary music.
Rob makes fruitless attempts to win Laura back, indulges in new relationships laced with fantasy, and tries introspection.
What will Laura do?
