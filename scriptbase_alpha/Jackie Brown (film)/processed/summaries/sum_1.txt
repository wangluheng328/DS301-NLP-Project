44 year old flight attendant Jackie Brown gets caught with gun dealer Ordell Robbie's money and to get the ATF off her back she sets up Ordell with her new friend, a bail bondsman named Max Cherry.
But what the ATF doesn't know, is that they are part of her wild plan to get Ordell's half million dollars and get off scott free.
However, she has to do it under the noses of both Ordell, the ATF man and a local cop.
What she doesn't know is Ordell's blonde beach bunny wants the money for herself as does Ordell's ex-con friend.
