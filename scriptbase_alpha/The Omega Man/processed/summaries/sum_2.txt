Two years after much of humankind was destroyed in a global war with biological weapons, Dr. Robert Neville leads a solitary existence in Los Angeles.
Those humans that do remain are pigment-less albino creatures that roam the night destroying what remnants that may exist of the previous civilization.
Neville, who had worked on an antidote to the virus, is one of their main targets.
By day, he searches for their nests while they sleep.
He comes across a small band of survivors, mostly children, but which includes two adults.
Having injected himself with his experimental serum several years before, Neville in fact may carry the immunities needed to reverse the creatures' condition.
The only question is whether he can survive their constant attacks long enough to prove it.
