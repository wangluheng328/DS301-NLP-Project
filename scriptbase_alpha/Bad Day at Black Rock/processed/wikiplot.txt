In late 1945, John J. Macreedy (Spencer Tracy), who lacks the use of his left arm, steps off the Southern Pacific passenger train at the desert hamlet of Black Rock.
It is the first time the train has stopped there in four years.
Macreedy is looking for a man named Komoko, and a place called Adobe Flats, but the few residents are inexplicably hostile.
The young hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth (John Ericson), claims he has no vacant rooms.
The newcomer is none-too-subtly threatened by local tough Hector David (Lee Marvin).
Later, Reno Smith (Robert Ryan), the town's unofficial leader, informs Macreedy that Komoko, as a Japanese-American, was interned during World War II.

Certain that something is wrong, Macreedy sees the town sheriff, Tim Horn (Dean Jagger), but the alcoholic lawman is clearly afraid of Smith.
The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie (Walter Brennan), advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but Smith lets slip that Komoko is dead.
Pete's sister, Liz (Anne Francis), rents Macreedy a Jeep and he drives to nearby Adobe Flats, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground, a deep well, and wildflowers.
On the way back, Coley Trimble (Ernest Borgnine) tries unsuccessfully to run him off the road.
