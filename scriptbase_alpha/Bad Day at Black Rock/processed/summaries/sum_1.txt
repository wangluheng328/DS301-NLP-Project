John J. Macreedy doesn't know it, but when he steps off the train at the jerkwater town of Black Rock, he will soon find himself the object of fear, hatred, and even a murder plot!

What Macreedy couldn't know when he stepped off of that train was that the town had a shameful secret, one that must be kept at all costs.
