It is October 30, 1988, and Michael Myers has been in a coma at the Ridgemont Federal Sanitarium since that night a decade ago when his doctor set him on fire in Haddonfield, IL.
An ambulance makes its away along the road to Ridgemont in a thunderstorm, and Myers is soon on his way to another hospital in Smith's Grove, IL.
During the ride, he overhears the crew mention his young niece in Haddonfield, and he comes to life, savagely killing the crew trapped inside.
Dr. Loomis & Dr. Hoffman, head of Ridgemont, are alerted by the state troopers after the ambulance is found upside-down in a river with blood everywhere.
Meanwhile, Myers has already started to make his way toward Haddonfield, where he acquires his traditional coveralls & nasty-looking knife, confronts his niece in a pharmacy, and then kills the town's phone & power lines, leaving his niece & her adopted sister trapped in their home...and he's coming to pay young Jamie a visit.
