During a sanitarium transfer, Michael Myers murders his hospital escorts and brutally murders the staff of a gas station.
Dr Loomis hears of the incident, and he is confident that Myers is planning to return to Haddonfield to kill his niece.
He confronts Michael in the empty gas station, but he escapes.
When Loomis finally arrives in Haddonfield, the sun is down and the children have begun trick or treating.
He warns the police, and they, in turn, order the entire town into a state of curfew as they hunt for Myers.
A group of rednecks leaded by a man named "Earl" attempt to capture Myers for themselves.
As this happens, the entire town of Haddonfield falls into a state of darkness as a blackout occurs.
Can they wit stand the devil in human form?
