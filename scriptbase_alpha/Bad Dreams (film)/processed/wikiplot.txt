In 1975, a sinister hippie cult called Unity Fields commits mass suicide in a horrific manner - by fire - at the behest of its psychopathic leader, Franklin Harris (Richard Lynch).
Only one young woman named Cynthia (Jennifer Rubin) survives to tell the tale.
Now, 13 years later, Cynthia is having grim reminders of the mass suicide, as people around her begin to die one at a time.
Cynthia finds out quickly that the ghost of Harris is back to claim his 'love child'.
