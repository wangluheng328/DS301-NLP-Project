The Bank of England has discovered that someone is stockpiling vast quantities of gold and suspects international bullion dealer Auric Goldfinger of being involved.
The Bank requests that British agent James Bond be sent to investigate.
Bond soon uncovers an audacious plan to commit "the crime of the century" and bring economic chaos to the West.
