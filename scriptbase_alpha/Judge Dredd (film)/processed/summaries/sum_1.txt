In a standard comic book dystopian near-future Americans are ensconced in mega-cities which protect them from the desolation of the world outside, and the peace is kept by The Judges.
This elite group who upholds "The Law" is police, jury, and executioner all in one.
Judge Dredd, the most formidable and revered of the Street Judges, is convicted of the murder of a snooping reporter.
With the help of a prisoner who he himself convicted, Dredd sets out to clear his name while leaving a trail of destruction, snappy catch- phrases, and dazzling special effects in his wake.
