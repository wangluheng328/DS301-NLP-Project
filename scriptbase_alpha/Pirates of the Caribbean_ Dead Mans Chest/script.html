</b>                         I think it's bad luck for the groom 
                         to see the bride before the wedding.

                         King's governor of Port Royal, and you 
                         will tell us what we are charged with.

                         is *also* death. Perhaps you remember 
                         a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
