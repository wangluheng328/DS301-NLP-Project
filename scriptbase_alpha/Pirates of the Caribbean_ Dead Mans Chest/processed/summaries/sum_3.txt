Picking up where the first movie left off, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan are to be married.
However this is interrupted when both are arrested for aiding in the notorious Captain Jack Sparrow's escape.
The new captain, Beckett, will lift all charges, if Will can hunt down Jack and bring him back to Beckett, along with his magic compass.
However, Jack has other problems.
Years ago, he made a deal with Davy Jones to raise the Black Pearl.
Time is up.
His part of the deal was to give Davy Jones his soul.
Once Will finds Jack, unaware of the current situation, Jack coaxes Will into boarding Davy Jones's ship, the Flying Dutchman, and retrieve a mysterious key.
This key opens the chest that contains Davy Jones's secret.
With it, you can control Davy Jones and his fearsome beast, The Kraken.
Once Will retrieves said key, Davy Jones is hot on his trail, now hunting down both Jack and Will.
It is now, only a matter of time, before something happens.
Hopefully the pirates can reach the chest and stop Davy Jones, before he reaches them and sends them all to a watery grave...
