A young man has dropped out of Queens College but desperately wants to please his father, a federal judge who's harsh with his son.
At his father's insistence, Seth Davis closes a casino he operates in his own house, mostly for college students.
Thinking he'll please dad, he takes a job in a small brokerage house, an hour from Manhattan, where trainees make cold calls to lists of well-paid men, and then apply high-pressure tactics to sell initial public offerings exclusive to the firm.
He's terrific at sales.
Once training is over, the pay is phenomenal, and Seth wonders why.
Curiosity leads him to ethical dilemmas, encounters with the Feds, and new territory with his father.
