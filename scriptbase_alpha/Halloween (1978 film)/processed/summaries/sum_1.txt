Fifteen years ago, 6 year old Michael Myers brutally killed his older sister.
The silent child was incarcerated in the Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of psychiatrist Sam Loomis.
The town of Haddonfield had slowly began to forget the tragic crime, until Loomis returned to the town to warn of Myers escape from Smith's Grove.
With Michael set on killing a group of high school students, Loomis seeks the help of the hesitant town sheriff to stop him before it's too late.
