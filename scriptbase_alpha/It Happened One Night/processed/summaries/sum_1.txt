In Miami, the spoiled socialite Ellie Andrews is trapped in the yacht of her controller father, the Wall Street banker Andrews, who has just annulled her secret marriage with the snobbish aviator King Westley.
Out of the blue, Ellie jumps overboard and swims to the shore.
Andrews hires a detective agency to find her and offers a 10,000 dollars reward for any information about his daughter.
But Ellie pawns her watch, buys some clothing and a bus ticket to New York to meet her lover.
She seats side-by-side with the cynical reporter Peter Warne.
However, when a thief steals her purse with her money in a bus stop and Ellie does not report to the police, Peter recognizes and blackmails Ellie, asking her to travel together with him.
He promises to protect her and in return he would write her adventure to meet King Westley.
Along their journey, Ellie falls in love for Peter; but when he vanishes from the motel where they are lodged and contacts her father later, she believes he was only interested in the reward.
In the end, love triumphs and the wall of Jericho falls.
