<b>				RUSH HOUR
</b>
			Original Screenplay

				  by

				Ross LaManna
<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT.  LOS ANGELES - DAY
</b>
The whole dysfunctional megalopolis, beige and blurry in the
summer smog. If this is the American Dream, do me a favor and
wake me up.

<b>EXT.  LAX - DAY
</b>
The traffic loop outside the terminals is gridlocked -- mostly
with stretch limousines.

<b>INT.  LAX - (INCLUDE NEWS REPORT MONTAGE) - DAY
</b>
Inside, the airport is done up with festive posters, streamers
and banners: Welcome - Pacific Partners Summit

A planeload of cheerful CHINESE DELEGATES come into the
crowded terminal. Some sport red T-shirts with a picture of
Mao wearing Mickey Mouse ears.

They get onto the people mover, passing by a TV REPORTER:

<b>				REPORTER
</b>			(to TV CAMERA)
		Eager to mend its tarnished image,
		Los Angeles has really put out the
		welcome mat for tomorrow's summit.
		The city promises quite a party as
		leaders from Japan, China, South
		Korea, Australia, the U.S. and
		others begin talks for the largest
		free-trade treaty in history.

The SCENE changes to TAPE of DELEGATES from other countries
arriving.

Then, we see massive SECURITY PREPARATIONS all around the city.

<b>				REPORTER (VO)
</b>			(continuing)
		The one sour note is North Korea,
		the only Pacific Rim country not
		participating. There are rumors of
		secret meetings with North Korean
		representatives, but U.S. officials
		insist the North must first hold
		democratic elections, and halt its
		nuclear weapons program -- as they
		claimed to have done back in 1995.

We CUT TO a heated debate in the UN SECURITY COUNCIL.

Then ARTILLERY FIRE over the Korean DMZ.

The SCENE returns to LAX.

<b>				REPORTER (VO)
</b>			(continuing)
		Tensions remain high since last
		year's skirmishes between North Korea
		and the U.S. So any chance of the
		communist North joining the Pacific
		Partners seems highly unlikely.

<b>							DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY
</b>
An exclusive, walled-off section of Hancock Park. There's only
one route in and out, past a manned guardhouse on Wilshire.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
A Colonial-style mansion, surrounded by an imposing, wrought-
iron fence. There is a bronze plaque, in English and Korean,
next to the entranceway:
<b>     
</b>				Consulate
				 of the
		Democratic People's Republic of Korea

The driveway gate opens and a long, black Mercedes with tinted
windows and diplomatic license plates glides out.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
An alert North Korean CORPORAL watches the perimeter MONITORS.
He pushes a switch to close the gate behind the Mercedes.

<b>EXT.  UTILITY POLE - OLYMPIC BLVD - DAY
</b>
From atop a pole outside the south wall, a man with binoculars
overlooks the private streets of Fremont Place.

<b>HIS POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS
</b>
as the Mercedes cruises through the quiet neighborhood.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
The man, PAUL JAVAL, is thirtyish, nervous; with short, sandy
hair. He takes the binoculars away from his face and we see
his eyes -- they're a strange, unnaturally light gray.

Javal takes an ORANGE PILL from an unlabeled prescription
bottle and pops it into his mouth. He climbs down the pole to
a van with a phone company logo on it.



<b>EXT.  WILSHIRE BLVD - DAY
</b>
The Mercedes comes out of the Fremont Place gate, and turns
into the heavy morning traffic.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
It is extremely quiet, due to inch-thick glass on the windows
and 4,000 pounds of armor plating on the car's chassis.

The DRIVER is a North Korean Army Major. On the seat beside
him is an AMD-74, a 5.45x39mm-caliber machine gun.

A HAND from the back seat darts between the front seats and
turns on the RADIO to a ROCK station. The Driver turns it off.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The hand belongs to 10-year-old SAM KE HAN. Sam sits back and
sighs to his sister, JOY (15). Between them sits a middle-aged
Scandinavian GOVERNESS.

<b>				SAM
</b>		I can't stand it -- half an hour to
		get to the stupid school every
		morning... with no music...
			(Korean; subtitled)
		[Just our damn Nanny...]

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
Javal's van, also with tinted windows, turns onto Crenshaw. It
follows the Mercedes, several cars behind it.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Javal, wired, drums on the steering wheel while driving. He
glances at some expertly constructed, radio-control REMOTE
UNITS sitting on the seat next to him.

<b>EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
Traffic is moving at about 35 MPH. The Mercedes merges onto
the freeway, heading west. Javal's van follows.

The thumping of a RAP SONG rattles the other drivers' fillings
as a LOWRIDER with its stereo turned up to "11" cruises by.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Even 500 watts of bass cannot penetrate the armored silence.
The Driver scans the road, wary but sensing no danger. He puts
on his blinker to take the 405 South exit.



<b>EXT.  SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
The van follows, now directly behind the Mercedes, in a
procession of vehicles going up the long, curved overpass
arcing 100 feet above the 10, toward the 405.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
As they approach the crest of the overpass, Javal flips a
switch on his radio-control unit...

<b>CLOSE - ROAD SURFACE OF OVERPASS
</b>
Six small SEMICIRCLES, exact replicas of the stay-alert bumps
on the white lines of the overpass, EXPLODE. They spew hundreds
of sharp, triangular nails across the roadway. Immediately,
scores of tires on passing cars BLOW OUT...

<b>WIDER
</b>
Causing, 50 yards ahead of the Mercedes and van, the most
hellacious, gut-wrenching, piss-your-pants, chain-reaction
PILE-UP you can imagine.

Dozens of drivers LOSE CONTROL of their vehicles... sideswipe
their neighbors... grind against the guard rails. Some
fishtail into 180's, smashing headlong into the traffic still
coming onto the overpass.

Brakes squeal, people scream, metal crumples, airbags deploy,
glass shatters.

And then it gets really nasty...

A Honda gets jammed under a truck hauling cinder blocks. The
truck JACKKNIFES, tipping over like a drunken giant.

It SMASHES through the concrete wall and guard rail...

Along with several cars and their SCREAMING OCCUPANTS, swept
over the edge by the truck like discarded soda cans.

They plummet through space, CRASHING onto the freeway below.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Sam, Joy, and the Governess brace themselves as the Driver
slams on the brakes. He barely avoids hitting anything.

<b>				DRIVER
</b>			(Korean)
		[Stay in the car.]



<b>EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
</b>
A nightmare scene of smoke, twisted wrecks, dazed victims. The
Mercedes and van sit motionless in the backed-up traffic.

<b>INT./EXT.  JAVAL'S VAN &amp; ROADWAY - DAY
</b>
Javal slides open a TRAP DOOR on the floor of the van. He
slips a wheeled, mechanic's repair platform through it.

<b>ANGLE WITH JAVAL
</b>
as, unnoticed amid the chaos, he lies on the platform and
rolls under the Mercedes.

The undercarriage of the Mercedes is armored with steel. Javal
stops at a patch of perforations -- an air exchange vent. He
attaches a slim DEVICE over the vent, flips a switch on it,
then rolls back toward the van.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - DAY
</b>
Oblivious to Javal's actions below them, everyone watches as
police and news helicopters circle above. Then, some CHP
motorcycles straddle the lanes and zoom by.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
</b>
Sweating, Javal sits back in the driver's seat and checks
another radio unit. Working.

<b>EXT.  FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
</b>
The CHP has cleared a path through the devastation, and
traffic trickles through. As the Mercedes and the van pass by,
Javal looks proudly at the misery he's wrought. He follows the
Mercedes onto the 405 south.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Javal drives behind the Mercedes, with one hand on the radio
unit. The Mercedes signals to take the Venice exit.

Javal fingers the radio unit, itching to use it...

But he PASSES by the Mercedes as it gets off the freeway.

<b>INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES
</b>
Javal's device is armed, and waiting...

<b>							FADE TO:
</b>


<b>EXT.  SIERRA BONITA AVENUE - CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
A pretty street in the Miracle Mile, lined with neat, single-
family homes. Timed SPRINKLER systems water some of the yards.

Every house on the block except the one we're in front of has
a "For Sale" sign on the lawn. From the weathered looks of the
signs, they've been there for quite a while.

<b>INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
It's a hot night. The ceiling fan above the bed spins slowly.

PETE CARSON tosses restlessly in bed, the sheets half-covering
him. Next to him his wife, MIRANDA KNOLL, snores contentedly.

Carson is in his late thirties, outdoorsy, with a tight,
muscular build. Emotionally he's tightly-wound as well.

Miranda is 35, raven-haired, sensible, pretty. She believes
above all else that one should never raise one's voice.

Carson groans... he's DREAMING...

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT.  BEVERLY DRIVE - (CARSON'S DREAM) - DAY
</b>
Quick, SILENT IMAGES: A street cordoned off with police tape.
Cops, SWAT teams, FBI surround BEVERLY THRIFT, a bank.

Carson, younger, hair shorter, sits in an FBI COMMAND TRUCK
across from the bank. Covering the mouthpiece of the phone in
his hand, he's arguing with the OTHER AGENTS in the truck.

Suddenly, a huge, fiery EXPLOSION blows out the front of the
bank building. Horrified, Carson runs toward it...

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM AND HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
Carson is snapped awake by a CAR ALARM going off outside.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Son of a bitch!

He bolts out of bed, wearing nothing but a pair of striped
bikini briefs. Miranda rolls over, sleepy, unconcerned...

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Pete... please... we have to be up
		early tomorrow. Call the police.



<b>				CARSON
</b>		Yeah, right.

He races down the hall -- right past the house alarm keypad,
its LCD reading "ARMED."

He grabs an aluminum baseball bat from the umbrella stand.
Forgetting to disarm the house alarm, he yanks the front door
open. The house alarm begins SHRIEKING.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing)
		Shit!

<b>MIRANDA
</b>
pulls the pillows over her head and sighs.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Not again...

<b>EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Carson comes around to the driveway, which is illuminated by
the streetlight --

Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.

Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.

Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.

Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.

Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.

As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.

Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.

Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.

Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --

And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.

Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

Then, blue flashing lights appear from around the corner: A
WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble
with their sidearms.

<b>				WESTEC GUARD
</b>		Everybody... chill! Bikini boy! On
		the ground!

Asshole #2 is still trying to gouge Carson with the
screwdriver. Carson glares at the dopey Guards.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Asshole was trying to boost my car!

<b>ANGLE ACROSS STREET
</b>
Carson's fiftyish, black, next-door NEIGHBOR, wearing pajamas
and a robe, comes out of his house. Carson sees him.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Mike -- call 911!

<b>				NEIGHBOR
</b>		Been trying...
			(has a cordless phone)
		It's busy.
			(to Guards; re Carson)
		He's the good guy, you schumcks.

The Guards seem to get it. Without warning, one takes out a
TASER and ZAPS Asshole #2. Carson lets go just in time.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
Holding his bleeding side, Carson walks back to his house. He
notices the "Neighborhood Watch" sign has graffiti spray-
painted on it. He touches it -- the paint is still wet. His
Neighbor shrugs -- whatta ya gonna do?

The PAPER GUY drives by... and tosses Carson's newspaper right
under the gushing SPRINKLER.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		I hate this fuckin' town.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</b>
<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
Joy is standing on the toilet, blowing cigarette smoke into
the exhaust fan. Someone KNOCKS on the door. She flicks the
cigarette into the toilet, puts a ZIPPO LIGHTER in her pocket.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Joy opens the bathroom door. Sam is standing there, grinning.

<b>				JOY
</b>		There are six bathrooms in this
		house, Sam.

<b>				SAM
</b>			(fanning the air)
		But only one with a smoking section.

She quickly closes the door behind her. Sam laughs.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
Sam and Joy sit at the table. AMBASSADOR HAN and MRS. HAN are
having breakfast: radish soup, kimchi and grilled fish.

Ambassador Han reads through the morning's faxed communiquÈs.
He's 43, rarely smiles, and hates living in the U.S. He's
dressed in an impeccably-tailored, Valentino two-piece suit.

Mrs. Han is slender, soft-spoken, but as iron-willed as her
husband. She, however, is quick to smile. She's wearing a
summery dress with a white sweater over her shoulders.

Ambassador Han pulls the front of Sam's shirt to reveal the
"Nirvana" logo on his T-shirt.

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>			(Korean)
		[Go change.]

Ambassador Han's X-ray stare turns to Joy.

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>			(continuing)
		[You smell like a fireplace.]

A BUTLER appears with a phone. He WHISPERS to Mrs. Han.

<b>				MRS. HAN
</b>		It's the Governess...
			(into phone)
		Hello, Hilda...

<b>CUTAWAY - CLOSE ON GOVERNESS
</b>
as she speaks into a cellular phone. She's extremely nervous.
We cannot see her surroundings.

<b>				GOVERNESS
</b>			(thru phone)
		Mrs. Han... I am very sick today...

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>				MRS. HAN
</b>			(into phone)
		We will see you next week...
			(hangs up; smiles to kids)
		It appears I'll be taking you to
		school.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
</b>
In the back of his van, Javal pats the Governess' hand.

<b>				JAVAL
</b>		Very good. You may go now...

He speaks with a slight accent, French, perhaps. He pops an
orange pill, then unlatches the rear doors of the van. With a
quick glance back at him, she goes to open the doors.

Javal grabs a plastic tarp and throws it over the Governess'
upper body. He puts his arm across her neck, flicks open a
gravity knife and PLUNGES it through the tarp, into her chest.

He drops her on the floor of the van and fastidiously wipes a
small smudge of blood from his hand with a handkerchief.

<b>INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BATHROOM AND BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Carson steps out of the shower. He looks exhausted. Toweling
off, he goes into the bedroom, where Miranda is riding an
exercise bike, listening to music on headphones and reading
the sprinkler-soaked newspaper, all while watching the TV.

<b>ANGLE ON TV
</b>
A perky blonde traffic reporter, BOBBI MARCHFELDER, talks to
us from a local NEWS COPTER.



<b>				BOBBI
</b>			(on TV)
		...Good morning, Summit Day! It's
		gonna be the Super Bowl, the 4th of
		July, the Olympics and Woodstock all
		rolled into one! All over town
		there'll be parades, concerts,
		rallies, festivals... So get out
		there everyone, but plan your drive-
		time accordingly! This is Bobbi
		Marchfelder, your Eye in the Sky...

We CUT TO the White House lawn, where the PRESIDENT is about
to board a helicopter.

<b>				MORNING ANCHOR (VO)
</b>			(on TV)
		The President is on his way...

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(on TV)
		...It's an honor hosting my fellow
		leaders in Los Angeles, the capitol
		city of the Pacific Rim...

We CUT BACK to the studio and the MORNING ANCHOR.

<b>				MORNING ANCHOR
</b>			(on TV)
		We'll see the menu for Mayor
		Simpson's Brentwood barbecue, right
		after this...

We CUT TO a MUSICAL MONTAGE of preparations for the events
around town.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
As the MUSIC swells, Carson turns the TV off.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		I was watching that.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		If I hear one more Beach Boys song,
		I'll shoot myself.

Miranda points at the headphones -- she can't hear him.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing; while smiling)
		I said, if we were having sex once in
		a while, you wouldn't need to ride
		that fucking bike every morning.



<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(hasn't heard a thing)
		Be right with you...

As Carson dresses, we get a LOOK at their bedroom -- Miranda's
nightstand has two neat stacks of periodicals on it, with Los
Angeles magazine and Psychology Today on the top of them.

Carson's nightstand is overflowing with books and magazines
about other cities and states: Wonderland Washington;
Magnificent Oregon; Welcome to North Carolina."

<b>INT./EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - PATIO &amp; KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
Miranda, dressed in a conservative skirt, jacket, black shoes,
is out on the patio. Her breakfast -- a bowl of fruit and
wheat germ -- sits on the patio table while she waters some
sickly-looking ROSE BUSHES in a planter.

Carson, dressed in shirt and tie, looking beat, fries a steak
and three eggs in butter. He comes outside with his breakfast
and a magazine article: "American Expatriates in New Zealand."

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(looks him over)
		Have you gotten any sleep lately?

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(ignores the question)
		Shop's gonna tow the car in --
		goddamn ignition's trashed.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Take mine. I'll ride in with Diane.

Carson watches as she carefully picks the dead leaves off the
rose bushes.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		You ask me, those suckers are a lost
		cause.

She continues, then glances at the article Carson is reading.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		It's not for you.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		You mean it's not for you.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		I don't chase car thieves in my
		underwear. C'mon, you'd die of
		boredom if we ever sold this house
		and moved.



<b>				CARSON
</b>		I'd die of shock, from finding
		anyone dumb enough to buy the place.
		Even for what it's worth now.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Lots of people bought at the top of
		the market...

<b>				CARSON
</b>		That sure cheers me right up.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		I don't know why we even talk about
		it. The city's not the problem. So
		we move. It wouldn't matter. What's
		that saying: "Wherever you go, there
		you are."

Carson just looks at her. Reaching for the salt, he winces
from the cut in his side.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(continuing)
		I hope you're current on your
		tetanus booster. Was it worth it?

<b>				CARSON
</b>		One cut... two assholes in the
		hospital... Yep.

Carson glances at his watch and gets up.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing)
		Well, another day of baby-sitting my
		favorite bunch of people...

He grabs a Bianchi shoulder holster with a Sig-Sauer P-229,
9mm pistol, straps it on, then pulls on a blue windbreaker.
Emblazoned on the back are large yellow letters: FBI.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Ask for a transfer.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		They're not gonna transfer me. You
		know damn well why I was bumped down
		to guard duty...
			(as he's leaving)
		My outstanding people skills.

Miranda tries to return to tending her roses. But instead, she
sadly watches him go.



<b>EXT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
A look of sorrow crosses Carson's face as he watches some
YOUNG KIDS laugh and shove, getting onto a school bus.

He then glances at his wounded Mustang, parked in the street.
He spots something on the windshield: A pink parking ticket.

The parking sign above the graffiti-stained Neighborhood Watch
sign reads: Street Cleaning - Friday 8-10 AM.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		I hate this fuckin' town.

Carson CHIRPS open Miranda's car: a red Volvo 960.

As he pulls away, we SEE a bumper sticker on the car: a circle
and slash through cartoon weapons on one side, cartoon teddy
bears on the other, and "Arms Are For Hugging" in between.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
The Driver backs the Mercedes out of the garage behind the
Consulate. We notice there is ANOTHER MERCEDES parked inside.

Mrs. Han, Sam and Joy come outside. They hear some heartfelt
<b>SWEARING:
</b>
<b>				ANGRY VOICE (OS)
</b>		Goddamn Limey overpriced piece a
		shit...

<b>THEIR POV
</b>
In the driveway across the street, a man in a business suit
has his head under the hood of a brand-new Jaguar convertible.
The JAG OWNER's 15-year-old, blonde daughter, LISA, sits in
the car with her schoolbooks in her lap.

<b>JOY
</b>
turns to Mrs. Han:

<b>				JOY
</b>		Can we give Lisa a ride?

<b>INT./EXT.  MERCEDES - DAY
</b>
It pulls into the driveway across the street. The Jag Owner is
still SWEARING mightily. Lisa climbs into the Mercedes.

<b>				LISA
</b>		Hey, Joy... Sam...

Joy rolls the window up and the SOUND of cursing disappears.



<b>				LISA
</b>			(continuing)
		Excellent -- I can't hear him!

<b>				SAM
</b>			(raps on window)
		The glass is an inch thick.
			(points to doors, roof)
		Armor-plated. Bulletproof. Bomb-
		proof.

<b>				LISA
</b>		Perfect car for L.A.
			(looks back at her Dad)
		Starts, too.

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
As the Mercedes travels its usual route down Crenshaw, Javal's
van begins following it.

<b>INSERT ANGLE - UNDER THE MERCEDES
</b>
where Javal's DEVICE is attached, still waiting...

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
A dark-green government Dodge pulls up and parks behind one
just like it on a paved area near the Consulate gate.

DAVE JUAREZ, (chubby, 40, Mexican-American, a desk jockey) gets
out of the Dodge and hangs an FBI shield over his top pocket.

He glances over at North Korean Security Chief COLONEL LEE,
(45), who has paused inside the gate to regard Dave, and the
outside world, with profound contempt.

Dave, attachÈ case in one hand and notebook computer in the
other, walks to a 10-by-15 detached guardhouse on the far
corner of the property, just outside the high fence.

<b>INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
Inside are two desks and four chairs, a console of
communication equipment, a microwave and a Mr. Coffee.

Dave enters. Two FBI agents, finishing their shift, gather
their belongings: ROBBINS (late 20's; male; thinning hair) and
SABATINI, (early 30's; cute; dark, bobbed hair; female).

They wear blue FBI blazers and have standard-FBI-issue 10mm
Heckler &amp; Koch MP-5 machine pistols in oversized shoulder
rigs. Dave is in civilian clothes, and is not armed.



<b>				ROBBINS
</b>		Yo, Dave the Computer Man! Actually
		escaped the office!

<b>				DAVE
</b>		I'm doin' field upgrades. Gives 'em
		a chance to hose out my cage.

He glances through the window at Colonel Lee.

<b>				DAVE
</b>			(continuing)
		Who's the fuckin' gargoyle?

<b>				ROBBINS
</b>		Their Chief of Security, Colonel Lee.

Sabatini makes the jerk-off sign with her hand.

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		"Chuckles," as we're inclined to
		call him.
			(yawns; flops in a chair)
		Friggin' graveyard shift...

<b>				ROBBINS
</b>		Love to know what dope made it the
		Bureau's job to give full-time
		protection to foreign consulates.
			(offers coffee to Dave)
		Cup a mud?

<b>				DAVE
</b>		Not if you made it. Why don't you
		get Sabatini to brew the java? She's
		the alleged chick.

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		Blow me.

<b>				DAVE
</b>		Where's Carson?

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		On his way. Some creeps tried to rip
		off his Mustang last night.
			(beat; solemnly)
		They cut the ragtop.

<b>				DAVE
</b>		Motherfuckers...

Dave takes three PCMCIA computer cards from his attachÈ case.



<b>				DAVE
</b>			(continuing)
		Latest and greatest. Wireless
		network link-ups.

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		Whoa, slow down, I'm gonna pee.

<b>				ROBBINS
</b>		Me, too.

<b>				DAVE
</b>		Ingrates.

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
The van drives in the lane alongside the Mercedes.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
HUMMING, Javal drives with one hand, while tapping with his
other on the top of the radio-controlled remote box.

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
As they approach the light at Washington Blvd, just turning
yellow, Javal's van gets in front of the Mercedes.

Their lanes stop for the red light. A FRUIT VENDOR holding a
bag of oranges walks from car to car.

Javal slips the van into neutral and lets it roll back until
his rear bumper taps gently against the Mercedes' front bumper.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - INCLUDE POV THROUGH REAR VIEW MIRROR - DAY
</b>
The Driver hits the HORN. The van doesn't move. The Driver
glances in the rear-view:

There's a Jeep Cherokee tight on his tail, and the BLACK LADY
in it is busy dealing with a carpool full of 8-year-old KIDS.

The Driver looks at Mrs. Han, who's peering out the side
window, fascinated by the African-American-themed storefronts.
They're all festooned with Summit-related banners, and SHOP
OWNERS are preparing for a community sidewalk bazaar.

Sam, bored, stuffs several pieces of GUM into his mouth.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - SAME
</b>
Javal flips the switch on his radio-controlled remote.



<b>INSERT
</b>
Under the Mercedes, the device Javal planted there begins to
emit thick, white CS TEAR GAS.

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - DAY
</b>
The GAS pours in through the ventilation system. Everyone
inside starts coughing and choking uncontrollably. The Driver
grabs his AMD-74 machine gun and pops the door locks.

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
The Driver, Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam and Lisa pile out of the car.

Jittering with excitement, fear and speed, Javal hops out of
his van, holding a Benelli M-1, a semi-automatic shotgun.

He SHOOTS the Driver in the chest. The BLAST from the shotgun
muzzle, however, is unlike anything we've ever seen before: it
is blindingly BRIGHT, even in broad daylight, belching a huge
cluster of glowing, white-hot magnesium.

The Driver flies back against the Mercedes, EMPTYING his
machine gun into the air. The wound in his chest is full of
BURNING magnesium shrapnel.

<b>WIDER
</b>
The other drivers in the intersection see this and go
completely nuts. Some duck for cover under their dashboards.
Others peel away. A few COLLIDE with oncoming traffic.

The Carpool Lady in the Cherokee pushes the kids down on the
floor. The Fruit Vendor hides by rolling under a car.

Sam and Joy are incapacitated by tear-gas coughing fits. Mrs.
Han stumbles toward them, trying to get them to run away.
Javal PUNCHES her, knocking her down.

He turns to Lisa, surprised to see her. Sweating, he points
the shotgun at her... almost pulls the trigger... then notices
Mrs. Han's expression of horror and thinks the better of it.

He spots a MOTORIST in a Ford Escort, peering cautiously over
his dashboard to get a look at the action.

Javal SHOOTS the Motorist through the windshield with another
bright, searing blast of magnesium. The Motorist and the
entire front of his car burst into FLAMES.

Mrs. Han is on her knees, sobbing. Javal grabs her by the arm
and pulls her to the back of the van. He opens the doors.



<b>				JAVAL
</b>		You see that I'm serious in my
		intention, yes?
			(she nods)
		If you cooperate, you and your
		children will be home for dinner
		tonight.

He tightens his grip on her. She nods again, then looks at the
kids. Javal shoves her, Sam, Joy and Lisa into the van.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
</b>
He grabs three pairs of handcuffs off a C-shaped bar welded on
both ends to the inside of the van. He handcuffs one of Mrs.
Han's arms, passes the chain through the bar, then handcuffs
the other. He does the same with Sam; then handcuffs one of
Joy's arms, passes the chain through and attaches the other
handcuff to Lisa.

Javal hops in his seat and drives away on Washington.

<b>EXT.  CRENSHAW BLVD - DAY
</b>
Several people, including the Carpool Lady, rush over to the
Driver, who lies DEAD and SMOLDERING on the ground.

His hand is halfway inside his bloody pants pocket, holding a
small plastic card with the Consulate's phone number on it.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
Colonel Lee and a North Korean Army OFFICER come running out.
ANOTHER OFFICER starts up a car in the back of the house.

<b>INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
Robbins and Sabatini see the commotion and go to investigate.
Dave follows.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
Ambassador Han runs out. He has a stricken look on his face.

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>			(Korean; to Ambassador Han)
		[You must stay here.]

Ambassador Han nods. The FBI agents run up. To them:

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>		Someone took my family!

The agents look at each other -- holy shit! Colonel Lee's car
SCREECHES to a stop. Sabatini stands in front of it.



<b>				SABATINI
</b>		You got no jurisdiction outside
		this property!

Colonel Lee shoves a big, ugly Tokorev 7.62x25mm-caliber
pistol in her face as he's opening the car door.

<b>				SABATINI
</b>			(continuing)
		Shit!
			(to Ambassador Han)
		Yank his fuckin' leash!

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>		My men are going!

Colonel Lee jumps into the car and it screeches away, almost
running Sabatini over.

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>			(continuing; to Sabatini)
		It's a white telephone van, driving
		west on Washington Boulevard.

The agents rush back to their guardhouse. Dave's government
Dodge is blocking theirs.

<b>				ROBBINS
</b>		Keys!

Dave tosses them to Robbins. Sabatini shoves Dave into the
back seat. He looks at her, dumbfounded.

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		You're ridin' shotgun.

<b>INT.  DAVE'S DODGE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Dave is thrown against the back of the seat by the ACCELERATION.

<b>				ROBBINS
</b>		Cherry?

<b>				DAVE
</b>		Under the seat.

Sabatini grabs the red flashing light, puts it on the dashboard.

<b>				ROBBINS
</b>		Siren?

<b>				DAVE
</b>		I don't know! I'm never in a fuckin'
		hurry..!



<b>EXT.  FREMONT PLACE - DAY
</b>
Just as they race out of Fremont Place past the guard gate,
Carson, in Miranda's Volvo, comes in on the other side.

<b>INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Carson sees the agents in the Dodge and floors the Volvo. He
fishtails, making a U-turn.

He straddles the lanes on Wilshire to pull up next to them.
All the cars in front of them swerve to clear out of the way.

He rolls down his window. Sabatini shouts over to him:

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		Someone snatched Han's family! White
		phone van, westbound on Washington!

Carson looks like he's been punched in the stomach.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Give me a secure radio!

Sabatini takes a small two-way MOTOROLA RADIO out of her
pocket and throws it through her window to Carson. Dropping it
in his lap, he punches the gas. Robbins floors Dave's piece-of-
shit Dodge, trying to keep up.

<b>EXT.  FEDERAL BUILDING, WESTWOOD - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</b>
<b>INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY
</b>
Diplomatic Liaison EARL WALTHER is using the reflection in his
office window to adjust his necktie. Walther is 30, good-
looking, black; a GS lifer working his way up the ranks by
virtue of his quiet competence.

A CO-WORKER sticks his head into the office, then shields his
eyes from the sight of Walther's sharp new suit.

<b>				CO-WORKER
</b>		Someone's been to Nordstroms, big
		time.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Clothes make the man.

<b>				CO-WORKER
</b>		But does the man make enough for the

<b>				WALTHER

		The man makes payments on his Visa.

Walther's SECRETARY rushes in.



<b>				SECRETARY
</b>		Mr. Walther... priority line!

<b>				WALTHER

		This is Diplomatic Liaison Earl
		Walther... What's the nature of your
		emer --
			(grimaces)
		Aw, Jesus... not today...

<b>INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Carson drives with one hand, while holding the radio.

<b>				CARSON

		You bet -- nice and easy.

Real easy, until he narrowly MISSES a bunch of cars when
SCREECHING around a corner.

<b>INT.  FEDERAL BUILDING - STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY
</b>
Walther presses the intercom button on the phone.

<b>				WALTHER

<b>EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY

Driving skillfully, Carson edges past the North Koreans.



<b>INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
And then, Carson can't believe it: he spots Javal's van, a
couple blocks ahead, driving at normal speed.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(into radio)
		Check it out! Ahead, on the right!

<b>				SABATINI (VO)
</b>			(thru radio)
		Think it's them?

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(into radio)
		Yeah... but it seems too easy... I'll

He looks over at Colonel Lee, whose car is pacing his.

<b>				CARSON

		If the Mod Squad gets in your way,

Sabatini pulls out her machine pistol, and tosses the two-way
to Dave. He looks scared, and carsick.

<b>				SABATINI

<b>EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY
</b>
Carson tries to approach Javal without drawing his attention.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
He still drives at the same speed as the surrounding traffic.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
As Carson nonchalantly passes, Javal NOTICES the government-
issue two-way radio sitting on the seat of Carson's Volvo.



<b>JAVAL
</b>
grins... it's show-time. He STOMPS on the gas.

<b>INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Pissed that he's been made, Carson speeds up.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Driving fast, Javal makes a hard right. As the van leans with
the turn, something rolls out from under a sheet of canvas on
the floor -- the Governess' BODY, bloodied and grotesque under
the plastic tarp it's wrapped in.

Joy starts SCREAMING, as does everyone else when they see it.

Javal pulls out a Beretta Centurion 9mm pistol and FIRES a
deafening round through the roof of the van.

<b>				JAVAL
</b>		I need to concentrate!

<b>EXT.  WASHINGTON BLVD - DAY
</b>
During a lull in traffic, a WELL-DRESSED WOMAN jaywalks across
the street. An LAPD black-and-white changes lanes and puts on
its flashing lights. As two COPS write her a ticket...

Around the corner TWO MEN make a quick exchange of money and a
vial of crack.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
The Cops do notice Javal speeding by, with Carson's Volvo, the
FBI Dodge and Colonel Lee's car in hot pursuit. They shove the
ticket in the Well-Dressed Woman's hand and hop in their car.

<b>EXT.  LA CIENEGA BLVD / SIDE STREETS - DAY
</b>
Javal turns onto the side streets -- rows of run-down
apartment buildings. He takes a circuitous route, gaining a
one-block lead on Carson and the others.

Then, he makes a sudden turn into a one-way alley.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S VAN - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Javal hits a remote garage door opener. Ahead, rickety doors
on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley OPEN up.

Across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an
empty building, we notice a duplicate van. It's facing the
same direction as Javal is driving.

Javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and
then quickly backs up into the garage.

<b>INT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE / JAVAL'S VAN - DAY
</b>
As he pulls in, we catch GLIMPSES of the van slipping backwards
into a FIBERGLASS SUPERSTRUCTURE that fits tightly around the
rear two-thirds of it. As the van comes to a stop, several snap-
buckles on the edge of the superstructure spring closed.

Javal reaches out the van window and pulls on a rope hanging
from the ceiling of the garage. The rope releases the door
from the opening mechanism, so it immediately falls CLOSED.

Then, Javal turns several switches on another of his neatly-
constructed remotes:

<b>INT.  DUPLICATE VAN - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY
</b>
Steel straps are holding the steering wheel rigid.

A set of relays, triggered remotely, start the engine;

Engage the transmission;

And supply fuel to the carburetor.

<b>EXT.  ALLEYWAYS
</b>
The duplicate van takes off down the alley. Just as it gets up
to speed, Carson and the others round the corner into the alley
behind it. As far as they know, they're still chasing Javal.

The alley is several blocks long, running parallel to the main
road, separated at each block by perpendicular streets. The
duplicate van races along, scraping against parked cars and
the rear walls of buildings...

<b>INT.  CARSON'S VOLVO - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
<b>				CARSON
</b>			(into radio)
		He's gonna wrap it around something!

<b>EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY
</b>
Indeed, as the duplicate van crosses a street, cars swerve to
avoid hitting it. It continues into the next alley.

Up ahead, a garbage truck lumbers into the far end of the
alley, its metal lift-rods extended to pick up a dumpster.

<b>				CARSON (OS)
</b>		Oh, shit...

The duplicate van CRASHES into the garbage truck and EXPLODES.



<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Carson, horrified, jumps out of his car. Robbins and Sabatini
run up. They have to hold Carson away from the burning van.
Dave hurries to the back of a building and gets sick.

Colonel Lee, wide-eyed with anger, gets in Carson's face.

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		You should not have interfered!

Carson shoves Colonel Lee out of his way, hard.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		I'm in no mood...

Colonel Lee comes back, ready for a fight. Carson is happy to
oblige, but Robbins grabs Carson's arm.

<b>				ROBBINS
</b>		Forget about him!

By now, ONLOOKERS have begun to gather, as LAPD black-and
whites and helicopters converge on the area.

<b>EXT.  ALLEYWAY GARAGE - DAY
</b>
A block away, the garage door opens, and we hear something
eerie and unexpected: a scratchy, music-box kids' SONG, coming
from a loudspeaker.

Javal's van pulls out and we see its TRANSFORMATION: The
superstructure surrounding the body of the van makes it look
like a graffiti-covered, unlicensed ice cream vendor.

<b>EXT.  ALLEYWAYS - DAY
</b>
The entrance of the alley is blocked by a black-and-white. So,
accompanied by the SONG, Javal drives along the one-way alley
in his camouflaged van, passing unnoticed by the authorities.

Anguished, Carson is staring at the BURNING duplicate van...

that something isn't right, then turns to the other agents.



<b>				CARSON
</b>		Let's get back to the Consulate.

Off their perplexed looks, we

<b>							DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
One room, bathroom and kitchenette. A laptop computer and
peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a
toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry.

In the main room, there are three large Lazy-Boy easy chairs,
side by side, facing a 27-inch TV on a stand. A cloth covers
two OBJECTS sitting atop the TV.

The door opens. Mrs. Han, Joy, Sam, and Lisa walk in, rigid
with fear. Javal, Beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them
and closes the door. Javal strips off his sweat-soaked shirt
and wipes his face with it. Mrs. Han realizes he's wired to
the moon... and it terrifies her.

<b>				JAVAL
</b>		Does anyone need to use the rest

</b>			(after a beat)
		Lisa...

Still holding the Beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the
closet and pulls it on. As the family sits in the chairs:

<b>				JAVAL
</b>		No, Mrs. Han, this one. Thank you.

He takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. He tries
to handcuff Lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.

<b>				JAVAL
</b>			(continuing; sotto)
		You afford me some additional
		bargaining power. But not much.

She wilts. Javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator.
He puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth.

He uncovers one of the items atop the TV: An electronic box with
three pairs of oversized, LED VU meters on the front of it.

We NOTICE neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs
up into it. Javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a
green light and the meters come to life.

<b>				JAVAL
</b>			(continuing)
		There. No taping your mouths, no
		restraints. Please remain still
		while I explain. The meters on the
		left indicate sound pressure --
		Decibels. There are microphones on
		your chair backs. If you raise your
		voices above certain level, putting
		your meter in the red zone for more
		than one sustained second, the
		circuit will be closed.
			(beat)
		The right meters indicate motion.
		There are pressure sensors inside the
		armrests and seats. The sensors don't
		like to get wet, so I hope you were
		honest about not needing to use the
		loo. If you make any excess
		movements, or try to leave your
		chair, the circuit will be closed.

<b>				MRS. HAN
</b>		I don't understand...

She looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.

<b>				MRS. HAN
</b>			(continuing; softly)
		What happens if the circuit closes?

<b>				JAVAL
</b>		Kaboom...

He uncovers the other item atop the TV -- a one-pound brick of
C-4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into
it. Mrs. Han gasps and begins to PANIC.

<b>				JAVAL
</b>			(continuing)
		Easy... deep breath...
			(to the kids)
		Do each of you understand?

They nod. Tears roll down Joy's face.

<b>				JAVAL
</b>			(continuing)
		Keep your wits, and all will be fine.

He flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. He
then turns on the TV. COVERAGE of the Summit is everywhere.

<b>				COMMENTATOR #1
</b>			(on TV)
		...Not since the '84 Olympics has the
		whole city had an such an opportunity --

Javal turns the channel to a SOAP, and MUTES it. He starts
pacing, and glances at his watch. It's 9:15 AM.

<b>INT.  GOVERNMENT HELICOPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Earl Walther looks through the window as his copter lands on
the lawn behind the North Korean Consulate.

<b>EXT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
As the copter lands, Carson comes out to meet Walther.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Carson?
			(Carson nods)
		Walther. Who told the Ambassador?

<b>				CARSON
</b>		His Security Chief.
			(beat)
		There was a civilian with them --
		fifteen-year-old girl from across
		the street. We're trying to reach
		the parents.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Goddamn it...
			(sotto)
		Look, Mrs. Han was the North Korean
		Premier's niece! We're hearing
		rumors they're gonna make a major
		issue out of what happened here...

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Carson and Walther come into the house. We hear only the
TICKING of the grandfather clock in the foyer.

Colonel Lee and his Officers stand by the stairs; Robbins,
Sabatini and Dave stand together near the front door.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		I'm not so sure what happened here.
		Something smells. Asshole was acting
		like he wanted us to spot him...



<b>				WALTHER
</b>		What the hell are you talking about?

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
</b>		Mr. Walther?

Ambassador Han comes down the stairs, his face tight with
repressed emotion.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Ambassador Han... my deepest --

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>		-- I have no wish for condolences.
		Just answers.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		As soon as we have any to give...

Suddenly, the Butler sprints across the foyer. He shoves the
cordless phone into Ambassador Han's hands.

Ambassador Han listens to the phone, then takes in a sharp
breath and sits on the steps.

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>			(into phone)
		Yoon..?!

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(to FBI agents)
		Start a trace!

Carson is elated. Robbins, Sabatini and Dave rush out. Walther
pulls out a cell phone and hits a speed-dial key.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>			(into phone)
		Mr. Secretary... they're alive!

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>			(to Carson; incensed)
		You are tapping our phones?!

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(while crossing to
			Ambassador Han)
		Yeah, you didn't know. And I'm Meryl
		Streep.

<b>INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Javal is holding his cell phone next to Mrs. Han's face.



<b>				MRS. HAN
</b>			(into phone)
		We are not hurt. But this man is
		very serious --

He pulls the phone from her, takes a breath to compose himself.

<b>				JAVAL
</b>			(into phone)
		I want you to remember the feeling
		you had when you thought your family
		was dead, and use it to inform the
		choices you're about to make.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
<b>				CARSON
</b>		Say you want to talk to the kids...

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>			(into phone)
		I need to know my children are all
		right.

<b>				JAVAL (VO)
</b>			(thru phone)
		Be in front of a television in two
		minutes. Tune it to channel four.
		You'll get the picture.

Javal hangs up. Stunned, Ambassador Han stands up.

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>		There is a television in my office.

As Carson, Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee and Walther hurry to
the office in the back of the house, Carson's radio crackles:

<b>				ROBBINS (VO)
</b>			(thru radio)
		We're screwed on the trace -- he's
		on a cell phone.

<b>INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
Dave and Robbins watch Sabatini work the comm console.

<b>				DAVE
</b>		Play the tape back. I might be able
		to pull the electronic serial number
		out of the subcarrier.

<b>				CARSON (VO)
</b>			(thru radio)
		Ask Dave if he knows how to find the

<b>				ROBBINS
</b>			(smiles; into radio)
		Hey, great idea...

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Ambassador Han turns on the TV to channel 4.

<b>ANGLE ON TV
</b>
It's the same medical SOAP that's on at the apartment -- a
DOCTOR and NURSE are screwing in a deserted operating room.

<b>INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Javal is standing in the kitchenette, pointing a DIGITAL STILL
CAMERA at the family. It FLASHES as he takes a picture.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
There is a cable running from Javal's computer to his cell
phone. He hooks another cable to the digital camera, and an
IMAGE appears on the screen of his laptop. He clicks on "SEND."

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Everyone stares expectantly at the TV. They turn as the fax
machine on the credenza RINGS. An IMAGE begins to emerge from
the machine: the picture from Javal's digital camera.

<b>CLOSE ON FAXED PICTURE
</b>
It shows the Han family sitting in their booby-trapped chairs
in front of the TV. The explosives and the electronics are
clearly visible atop the set, as is the program on the TV.

<b>				CARSON (OS)
</b>		Oh, Jesus, those're explosives!
			(beat)
		Look at the TV -- this was just
		taken.

<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
A second page on the fax begins to come through. As it does,
the telephone RINGS. Carson and Colonel Lee both go for the
extension near the sofa; Carson grabs it first. Ambassador Han
picks up the phone on his desk.



<b>				JAVAL (VO)
</b>			(thru phone)
		There must surely be several people
		in the room; you may put me on the
		speakerbox if you wish.

Ambassador Han clicks on the SPEAKERBOX. Carson and the others
look at the second faxed page: a list of instructions.

<b>				JAVAL (VO)
</b>			(continuing; thru
			speakerbox)
		I am not a terrorist. Your
		countries' political posturing means
		nothing to me. So do not waste time
		trying to negotiate.
			(beat)
		The Federal Reserve Bank of Los
		Angeles can furnish ten million
		dollars U.S. by 2:00 PM. The
		required denominations are in the
		instructions, as is the method of
		packaging. Be in your car at 3:00
		PM, and drive north on Highland
		Avenue. I will call with where to
		leave the money, which you will do
		at 3:30. If I am unmolested, I will
		call again at 4:00 with the family's
		location and the method for removing
		them from their... predicament.
		Could you please refer to page one?
			(they look at the photo)
		Any deviation from these instructions
		and my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM.

CLICK. Ambassador Han looks around, feeling totally helpless.
Carson says nothing, trying not to show how uneasy he feels.

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>			(to Walther)
		P'yÚngyang must approve the ransom...

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Of course. The FBI's top Hostage
		Negotiator is on the way --

<b>				CARSON
</b>		-- Goddamn Negotiator's the last
		thing we need! This asshole sound
		like he was interested in bargaining?

Walther glares at Carson, then continues to Ambassador Han:


<b>				WALTHER
</b>		We have people who are experts in
		these situations. We really feel it
		would be best if you let them
		coordinate everything...

Numb, Ambassador Han nods.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>			(continuing; to Carson)
		Let's get on it...

<b>INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
Robbins, Sabatini and Dave look up as Carson and Walther enter.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		...You're gonna just pay up, count
		on his good nature to return the
		family?!

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		It's the President's intention to
		keep this quiet, move forward with
		the Summit, and work with the North
		Koreans. Jesus, you've already
		embarrassed the shit out of us over
		the phone surveillance --

<b>				CARSON
</b>		-- They know their phones are tapped!
		They tap our fucking phones!

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		That's not the point! The point is
		not acknowledging it!
			(beat)
		We got an international incident
		brewing, with a country we were
		practically at war with last year!
		Our best Negotiator is gonna run
		point. If you got a problem, you can
		take the goddamn rest of the day off.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		This Consulate is my responsibility.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Not any more.

Carson is stunned. (OS), we hear a CHOPPER approaching.



<b>				WALTHER
</b>			(continuing)
		That's the Negotiator. You do the
		briefing.

Carson shoots a disgusted look at the others, then leaves.

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Carson turns off the Beach Boys SONG on the TV behind him.

Holding Javal's faxes, he's facing Ambassador Han, Colonel Lee
and the Hostage Negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)

<b>				CARSON
</b>		...Our worst enemy'll be the city.
		There are events gearing up all
		around town, and a dozen world
		leaders arriving. Add the Friday
		rush hour and usual L.A. bad
		behavior and it'll be a nightmare
		out there by 3 PM. It all works to
		the advantage of the kidnapper,
		hinders our pursuit efforts...
			(frowns)
		You don't agree?

<b>WIDER
</b>

The Negotiator stands and takes the faxes from Carson.


It's Miranda, his wife. Her FBI shield-holder is folded over
the breast pocket of her jacket.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		I'm wondering whether to believe him
		when he says he's strictly motivated
		by money.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(grabs faxes back)
		You see one word of Peoples'-
		Liberation, Holy-Jihad, Revolutionary
		whatever-it-is-we're-pissed-off-about-
		this-week bullshit in this entire
		letter?

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		I still want to check the MO against
		known politicals, terrorists --



<b>				CARSON
</b>		-- Already doing it. We're
		coordinating with the Secret
		Service, the NSA and the CIA.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Have someone talk to the LAPD, give
		them a cover story for the media
		about the crash on La Cienega.

Walther comes in and looks at Carson.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Why didn't you tell me Doctor Knoll
		is your wife?!

This surprises Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(while looking at Miranda)
		If she'd changed her name when we
		got married, I wouldn't have to.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(to Carson)
		I'm so enjoying this opportunity to
		finally work together...

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Jesus, forget I asked.
			(beat)
		The cash will be here in an hour.
			(to Miranda)
		Any thoughts on the kidnapper's
		thoughts?

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Everything indicates he's working
		alone. And his concerns do seem to
		be solely about the money... so I
		agree that he's only using the
		Summit and the tension with North
		Korea to create extreme motivation
		to pay the ransom.

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		I will bring the money to him.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		My ass.

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		The hostages are citizens of the
		People's Republic of Korea --

<b>				CARSON
</b>		-- Hey, do I go to the torture
		chambers in your prisons, tell you
		how to do your job?

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		All right, you're outta here! Is
		this the same insubordinate crap you
		pulled at Beverly Thrift?

Carson glares coldly at Walther.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		I'll coordinate the drop.

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>		Perhaps that is better. Inspector
		Carson knows the terrain --

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		-- Then he can come with me.

Walther looks at Miranda. She nods her assent.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>			(firm; to Carson)
		It's settled.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		It sucks.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		But it means we can get on with it.

The Americans leave the room.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Still fuming, Carson walks ahead. Miranda pulls Walther aside.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(sotto)
		Get one thing straight, Mr. Walther.
		If the Bureau had listened to Pete,
		Beverly Thrift never would've
		happened.

<b>INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Hands shaking with nerve- and speed-induced jitters, Javal
turns two switches on the unit atop the TV. Two LED readouts
light up: one shows the current time -- 2:30 PM -- the other
is fixed at 5:00 PM. Below, the TV is still on.

Javal flips the channels, stopping at a rerun of "Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous." He suppresses a gleeful giggle.

<b>				JAVAL
</b>		That's more like it...

He checks the contents of his prescription bottle. Two pills.
He takes one, stuffs the bottle in his pocket, and leaves.

<b>EXT.  PíY³NGYANG, NORTH KOREA - DAY

SUPER: PíyÚngyang. Capitol of North Korea.

Poster city for the charms of Communism: dreary, crumbling,
gray, stifling, hopeless.

<b>INT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - CONFERENCE CHAMBER - DAY
</b>
In the main government offices, a meeting of ten overly-
decorated MILITARY MEN and their SUPPORT STAFFS.

Sour GENERAL KAI (50's) is ARGUING heatedly in KOREAN with an
aged MODERATE GENERAL. The weak-willed PREMIER OF NORTH KOREA
sits up front and listens passively.

An ARMY MAJOR sitting behind General Kai stands and slips out
the door.

<b>EXT.  WORKERS' PARADISE HALL - ROOFTOP - DAY
</b>
Crouched behind an air-conditioning unit, the Major, an
American Operative, speaks in UNACCENTED ENGLISH into a small
UPLINK DEVICE, disguised to look like a palmtop computer.

<b>				OPERATIVE
</b>			(into uplink device)
		...They've got the Premier agreeing
		to the hard-line position --

He hears footsteps approaching (OS).

<b>				OPERATIVE
</b>			(continuing; sotto)
		More to follow...

He angles skyward a tiny dish-shaped antenna on the Device. On
its screen it says COMPRESSING... SCRAMBLING... UPLINKING...

After it's finished, the Operative snaps it closed and puts it
into a false bottom in his attachÈ case. He disappears just
before a GUARD rounds the corner.

<b>EXT.  STREETS OF LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS ANGLES - DAY
</b>
"Welcome Pacific Partners" banners hang everywhere.

WORKERS and CATERERS prepare for the various parties and
events around town. COPS and PRIVATE SECURITY do their best to
keep traffic moving, but it's already getting congested.

<b>INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY
</b>
Dave stares at his computer, looking through a DATABASE of
kidnappers and their modus operandi. He rubs his eyes.

<b>				DAVE
</b>		I wanted to be home by now, take the
		kids to the rally in Boyle Heights.

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		We got a cabin in Big Bear. By now,
		L.A. was supposed to be a brown
		blotch in the rear-view mirror.

She's helping Walther stack packs of THOUSAND-DOLLAR-BILLS
into a series of small plastic bags, tying each one off when
it's the size of a brick. They then put the individual bags
into two larger bags.

Robbins rubber-bands a matchbook-sized HOMING TRANSMITTER in
between two packs of cash. He then hollows out a dime-sized
space inside a different pack of money with a razor knife.

He puts a tiny, SECOND homing transmitter in the space. Carson
checks some hand-held receivers. Miranda crosses to him.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		He'll expect a homing device --

<b>				CARSON
</b>		-- I expect him to expect it. He'll
		check the cash with an RF detector...
			(re larger transmitter)
		Meaning he'll find this one.
			(re smaller transmitter)
		This only has a quarter-mile range,
		but on a frequency too low to detect.
			(turns off receiver)
		And I doubt the asshole will have an
		X-ray machine or a metal detector.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Why must you always refer generically
		to criminals as "assholes?"

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Gosh, you're right. It could
		undermine their self-esteem and spoil
		their chances for rehabilitation.

<b>	
</b><b>				MIRANDA
</b>		You been reading my magazines in the
		bathroom again?

She returns to listening to an AUDIO TAPE:

<b>				JAVAL (VO)
</b>			(thru recorder)
		"And my device will fulfill its
		function at exactly 5:00 PM..."

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		He's really exhibiting pressured
		speech... big effort here to sound
		calm. Same with his vocabulary... if
		he were in control, he wouldn't feel
		such a need to sound that way.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Just tell me if we can use it.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		If we needle him he could get sloppy
		and give us an opening, but I'm not
		going to risk it. This is the worst
		kind of perpetrator: anything makes
		him deviate from his carefully-
		scripted plan, he could become
		extremely volatile.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

During this, Colonel Lee stands in a window on the top floor,
pointing a LASER EAVESDROPPING UNIT at the FBI guardhouse.

<b>				MIRANDA (VO)
</b>			(thru headphones)
		Do we have back-up if the bleeper
		fails?

<b>				CARSON (VO)
</b>			(thru headphones)
		Nothing but physical surveillance.

<b>INT.  FBI GUARDHOUSE - NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - DAY

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		It's real important we don't lose

		What the hell is the big crisis?

<b>				SECRETARY OF STATE
</b>		We just received a missive from the

		kidnapping is a U.S. plot to provoke
		and humiliate them during the Summit.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		Bullshit. They're just ticked because

</b>		We have a covert operative in place.
		He reports the hard-liners and

		Respond?! Christ. What about the

<b>				SECRETARY OF STATE
</b>		He's weak. He has to look tough to

</b>		There's a Diplomatic Liaison from

<b>				CIA CHIEF
</b>			(to FBI Chief)
		What about your man stationed at the

Inside, the grandfather clock in the foyer CHIMES THREE TIMES.

Colonel Lee, carrying an AMD-74 machine gun, goes to get in the

Carson drives off just a moment before Colonel Lee is

Javal bears to the right, toward the South on-ramp.

Sabatini and Dave follow a few cars behind as he gets on it.

Suddenly, he scoots over to the shoulder and slams the van
into REVERSE. He backs off the on-ramp, past a row of angry
drivers, passing by Sabatini and Dave.

Peeling in reverse onto Highland, Javal stomps on the brakes.
The snap buckles holding the ice-cream-truck superstructure
around his van BREAK APART, and the whole thing slides off...
blocking Sabatini's way.

Javal drives forward again, this time getting onto the 101
North on-ramp.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Miranda looks at Ambassador Han and Lisa's father while
anxiously clutching her two-way radio.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(into radio)
		What happened?

<b>				CARSON (VO)
</b>			(thru radio)
		We're made! Gotta grab him!

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(beat; into radio)
		All right... Carefully...

<b>INT.  MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Carson follows Javal onto the freeway. Colonel Lee grabs his
AMD-74 machine gun.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Watch it! We need him alive!

<b>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
Colonel Lee leans out and SHOOTS Javal's rear tires out.

The van drives erratically, held in its lane by bumping
against the cars around it.

Carson pulls up closer...

Suddenly, the rear doors of the van burst open...

And Javal flies out, riding a motorcycle. He's got the money
stuffed into two big, chaps-sized SADDLEBAGS slung over the
back of the machine.

He straddles the lanes, going against traffic, riding like a
maniac back the way he came.

Carson watches him in the rear-view... and speeds up, driving
away from him.

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		Turn around!

But Carson hugs the shoulder, moving through the heavy
traffic, until he spots what he was looking for:

The Biker Club, riding in formation up ahead.

Carson cuts in front of them and slams on the brakes. He jumps
out and grabs one of the Biker's machines by the handlebars,
wrestling it to a stop. While pulling its BURLY OWNER off it:

<b>				CARSON
</b>		FBI. Call our office, they'll take
		care of you.

Meanwhile, the other BIKERS have come to help their friend.
They pull guns, knives, chains...

They're stopped by Sabatini, who appears holding her MP-5
machine pistol. The Biker yells at Carson as he drives way:

<b>				BIKER
</b>		I'm a taxpayer! I'm a goddamn
		dentist!

<b>COLONEL LEE
</b>
gets in the driver's seat of the Mercedes and turns it around.

<b>JAVAL
</b>
continues down the freeway on his bike, straddling lanes,
driving the wrong way, retracing his route back to Highland,
leaving CAR HORNS, CURSING, and COLLISIONS in his wake.

<b>WIDER
</b>
When everyone thinks they've seen it all, here comes another
mad biker -- Carson -- riding against traffic in pursuit.



<b>EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
</b>
Javal rides against traffic down the Cahuenga on-ramp, then
jumps the divider, runs the light crossing Highland, and gets
into the southbound lanes.

He just misses a BUS, nearly wiping out.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Just don't kill yourself, you piece
		of shit...

Carson fishes out his two-way.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing; into radio)
		Helicopter or two would be nice!

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
Listening to the two-way, Miranda tries to follow the action.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(into radio)
		Love to be in the loop on this...

<b>EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
</b>
Speeding up, Carson precariously cuts in between traffic.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(to himself)
		Not just now, dear...

Seeing Carson approaching on his right, Javal pulls his Benelli
shotgun from one of the saddlebags. He rests the barrel on his
arm and FIRES a blinding-white load of magnesium at Carson.

Carson grabs the brake handles to slow down, and the BLAST
crosses just in front of him. A few BURNING pieces pepper the
front fender of the bike, but the bulk HITS the concrete art-
deco statue in the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl. The statue
shatters into a million FLAMING fragments.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing; grumbling)
		I coulda had a ranch... maybe some
		horses... but no, we moved to L.A.

<b>JAVAL
</b>
speeds up. A car passing on the right BUMPS him. Javal grabs
for the handlebar to stabilize himself, DROPPING the shotgun.

A HELICOPTER appears, and flies just above him.

Then, spotting some police cars ahead, he quickly hangs a
right, ducking onto Alta Loma Terrace.

<b>EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
</b>
Carson stops at the entrance to the winding, hillside
neighborhood, accessible only by footpaths. The area is
covered by thick foliage, hiding Javal from the helicopter.

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.

He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.

Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.

<b>ANGLE WITH CARSON
</b>
as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...

And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.

Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.

<b>HIS POV
</b>
The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.

Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of
the tower on the hose to High Tower Drive, the street below.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(into radio)
		He's on foot, at the base of the
		elevator tower!

But just as Carson is about to climb down the hose...



<b>EXT.  HIGH TOWER DRIVE - DAY
</b>
Javal spots a COLLEGE GIRL backing a tiny Geo out of her
garage. He rips her out of the car, jumps in and tears away.

<b>EXT.  ALTA LOMA TERRACE - DAY
</b>
Carson jumps back on his motorcycle and starts it up.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(into radio)
		Goddammit! He's in a blue Geo!

<b>EXT.  HIGHLAND AVENUE - DAY
</b>
In the Geo, Javal drives out onto Highland. He muscles his way
through traffic, then cuts across to Franklin.

Behind him, Robbins and Walther drive along the divider lane.

On the bike, Carson emerges from Alta Loma, joining Sabatini
and Dave in Dave's Dodge and Colonel Lee in the Mercedes as
they all try to catch up to Javal.

The helicopter flies ahead, then disappears past the hill
below Franklin.

<b>EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY
</b>
Javal hangs a hard right off of Franklin onto Vine, putting
him on top of a hill that drops down to Sunset.

Carson and Colonel Lee close in on the Geo.

Suddenly, the helicopter RISES UP from the bottom of the hill.
It's less than fifty feet in front of Javal, at eye level.

Javal FIRES at the copter with his Beretta.

Colonel Lee indiscriminately FIRES his machine gun at the Geo.

Carson SHOUTS at Colonel Lee, furious at his carelessness!

<b>INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Colonel Lee's BULLETS trace across the cockpit of the
helicopter; one hits the PILOT in the neck. Clutching it with
one hand, the Pilot loses control of the copter.

<b>EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY
</b>
Everyone on the road scatters to get out of the copter's way.
It appears as though it's going to crash onto the street, then
it gains altitude, GYRATING wildly just above the Geo.

Javal tries to move away, but one of its landing runners
SMASHES through the top of the windshield, WEDGING itself
against the inside of the Geo's roof.

Snared, the little Geo is LIFTED off the ground -- instantly
too high for a terrified Javal to escape from it.

<b>INT.  PURSUIT COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
The wounded Pilot, barely conscious, searches for safe area to
set down -- but there are cars and people everywhere.

The Pilot wrestles his stick; his copter is almost impossible
to control with the car hanging from it. He's fading...

<b>EXT.  VINE STREET - DAY
</b>
The copter and Geo lurch over and past the round Capitol
Records building, KNOCKING the spindle off the top of it.

The impact further destabilizes the copter's flight. It's
heading right toward the 20-story Sunset Vine Tower, at the
bottom of the hill.

<b>INT.  JAVAL'S GEO - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Javal, trapped inside, looks through the windshield as the
glass and steel side of the tower looms closer. He SCREAMS.

<b>EXT.  SUNSET VINE TOWER - DAY
</b>
The copter and the Geo CRASH into the side of the Tower, 12
floors up. Glass blows out in all directions; the rotor
shatters; office furnishings are blown through the hole like
backwash.

The Geo hangs passenger's side down from the runner.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.

The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.

<b>ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW
</b>
In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.



<b>JAVAL
</b>
reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.

He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...

And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

We stay with him as he FALLS 12 stories, SCREAMING...

Then LANDING on top of a parking meter. It RIPS though his
chest and he hits the sidewalk with a wet THUD.

<b>EXT.  VINE AND SUNSET - DAY
</b>
Carson rushes across the street to Javal's body. The teetering
copter and Geo are right above it.

Grimacing, Carson tries to lift Javal's body up off the
parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work...

Unable to move the body, Carson quickly searches its pockets.
All he finds is the now-empty prescription bottle.

Above, the copter GROANS... it's about to come loose...

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
Javal's right wrist, then TEARS the HAND off the body.

With a loud WRENCHING of metal, the copter and Geo break away
from the building.

Carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the
street, diving for cover behind a car.

<b>BEHIND CARSON
</b>
the copter and Geo crash to the sidewalk and EXPLODE.

<b>NEW ANGLE
</b>
Sooty, covered in Javal's blood, Carson crosses to the others.
He throws Walther the saddlebags and Sabatini the severed hand.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Fingerprint it.
			(to Walther)
		He's not gonna tell us where to find
		the hostages...
				-more-

				CARSON (Cont'd)
			(looks at watch)
		Meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to
		figure it out for ourselves.

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Figure it out?! With what?!

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(ignores him; into radio)
		Miranda! We need a copter, pronto!
			(to Robbins)
		Get back to his van. There were no
		plates, but check the VIN, look it
		over, then meet us at the Consulate.

Robbins is still trying to process what just happened.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing)
		Go!

</b>
<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - AMBASSADOR HAN'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
The clock reads 3:50 PM. Carson, Miranda, Robbins, Sabatini,
Ambassador Han and Colonel Lee are all TALKING at once.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(to Walther)
		...Scrounge us some bodies: National
		Guard, State Troopers, CHPs, local
		PD's, meter maids --

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		-- They're gonna search the whole
		city in a goddamn hour..?!

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Look, I don't need you to tell me
		how fucked we are!

<b>				WALTHER
</b>		Fuck you!! Every time you're on a
		case something explodes!

Carson looks like he's going to explode. Before he can reply:

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Stop! The clock's running! Arguing
		is a luxury we can't afford!
				-more-

				MIRANDA (Cont'd)
			(looks at Carson)
		What's done is done. There'll be
		plenty of time to point fingers
		later.

Carson would love to get into it, but he lets it slide. He
looks Sabatini, wandering aimlessly with Javal's severed hand.

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		I need some fuckin' ink!!

Carson grabs one of the expensive pens from Ambassador Han's
desk, SNAPS it in half, and hands it to her.

In the b.g. she stands at the credenza, inks the hand's fingers
and thumb and rolls them onto a piece of letterhead paper.

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>		This is impossible! How can you even
		begin to find them?

Good question. All eyes go to Miranda.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Well, the normal procedure is to
		negotiate with the perpetrator...

Her head is spinning. She looks at Carson.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Let's take stock. We've got a picture
		of where he hid the family, and
		recordings of his calls --

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		-- That's right! We can send them to
		our experts for analysis...

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(to Ambassador Han)
		Same with his fingerprints. But that
		means we need high-quality image and
		data transmission. We can piss away
		ten minutes coptering this shit to
		our offices in Westwood, or we can
		use your surveillance equipment.

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		There is no surveillance equipment.
		This is a diplomatic facility --

<b>				CARSON
</b>		-- You want to play games, fine.

He turns to go. Ambassador Han turns to Colonel Lee.



<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>		Take them upstairs.

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
In the converted attic, several North Korean ESPIONAGE AGENTS
monitor military and police frequencies, downlinks from remote
wiretaps and surveillance units; short-wave, cellular, etc.
Their equipment, being of Chinese and Iranian manufacture, is
hardly cutting-edge technology.

Colonel Lee and Ambassador Han enter. The Espionage Agents are
surprised when Carson, Miranda, Walther and Sabatini follow.
Walther looks around, amazed. Carson grabs a pair of headphones.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		South Korean Consulate's just down
		the street -- want to take a listen?

Colonel Lee pulls the phones away from him.

Carson takes the page with the fingerprints from Sabatini. The
Espionage Agents back away from her and Javal's hand.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing; re hand)
		Shitcan that thing, will you?!

She looks around. Then, shrugging, she tosses it into a
wastepaper basket.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing; to Colonel Lee)
		Got a digital scanner?

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		Analog.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(looks equipment over)
		You might want to drop a few bucks at
		Radio Shack and get with the decade.
			(into radio)
		Dave -- get in here. Bring your
		computer, a city map, and the tapes
		of the ransom calls.

<b>				DAVE (VO)
</b>			(thru radio)
		On my way...

He's also HEARD, faintly, through the laser eavesdropping unit
by the window. Carson notices, but doesn't comment.



<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(to Colonel Lee)
		Colonel, you saw the perp. Describe
		him to the Ambassador, see if it's
		anyone he knows.

Colonel Lee begrudgingly obliges. Carson dials a phone.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(into phone)
		This is Carson in L.A. There's a set
		of prints coming over. Narrow the
		search criteria: Male, thirties,
		Caucasian... French, Belgian, Swiss,
		maybe Canadian. Try kidnappers and

Carson clicks off the phone, then, as he dials another number:

<b>				CARSON

		We got one of the best sound guys
		right here in town...
			(into phone)
		Newman in Audio Analysis...

<b>				DAVE (OS)
</b>		Newman's gone.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Dave comes into the room.



<b>				DAVE
</b>		He quit, couple weeks ago. Opened a
		bed and breakfast in Wyoming.

Carson looks at Miranda and hangs up the phone.

<b>				DAVE
</b>			(continuing; looks around)
		Damn... they get HBO? I'd sure like
		to see the fight tonight.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Get those tapes transferred to a
		sound guy. We need ambient and
		background analysis, the whole
		enchilada.

<b>				DAVE
</b>		Enchilada -- you saying that because
		I'm Mexican?

<b>				CARSON
</b>		No... 'cause you're fat.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(picks up Javal's fax)
		Photo enhancement... Isn't there
		some amazing tech with the LAPD --

<b>				DAVE
</b>		-- Bronsky. Transferred to Seattle
		PD a month ago.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Jesus H. Christ...

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		I'd send it to Langley. Let the CIA
		earn their keep.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Do it.

Carson tosses Javal's bloody, unlabeled prescription bottle to
Miranda. She looks it over, runs her finger inside, tastes the
dust on her fingertip.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Given his behavior, this orange
		residue... I'd say Desoxyn, 25 mg.
		Amphetamines.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Any significance?



<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		It's consistent with the lone wolf
		scenario: A handful of these is pure
		bravery-in-a-bottle, 'til the
		psychosis and paranoia kick in.
			(beat)
		We could check pharmacy records, on
		the remote chance he got them
		legally... if we had a couple of
		weeks, that is.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(to Sabatini)
		Get the Bureau on it.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Forget it. It's a waste of manpower.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Look, goddammit, you start skipping
		no-chance-in-hell leads, we can all
		quit and go to the beach right now.

Sabatini looks at them -- which will it be? Miranda frowns and
nods her okay, then spreads the L.A. map out on the table.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing)
		He grabbed the family at 8:30. The
		last certain visual we had was just
		before his van went into the alley
		on La Cienega at 8:42. He called the
		Consulate at 9:30.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		That gives him about fifty minutes
		to get to his location, move and
		secure the hostages, and activate
		his time bomb.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		He probably waited a while to pad
		the time -- he wanted us know the
		family was still alive...
			(sotto; re Koreans)
		...So these crazy bastards wouldn't
		throw a premature shit hemorrhage,
		but he didn't want to call too soon,
		either. I say they're within 15 to
		20 minutes, via surface streets, of
		where we last saw them.

He draws a circle on the city map: Beverly Hills to downtown,
Hollywood to Inglewood.



<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		The most densely-populated part of
		the L.A. basin. This narrows it down
		to about 200,000 dwellings.

A beat while this sinks in.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>			(continuing)
		He was traveling west --

<b>				CARSON
</b>		-- Bet he doubled back.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		C'mon, that's total conjecture --

<b>				SABATINI
</b>			(re Carson)
		-- I'd trust his instincts when
		dealing with maniacs. He is deeply
		disturbed.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		You're telling me?

<b>INT.  WHITE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</b>
Everyone is smoking. Their tension has increased tenfold since
we last saw them. The President, SEEN through the video setup,
is pacing on Air Force One.

<b>				SECRETARY OF STATE
</b>		...North Koreans have gone ballistic,
		accusing us of botching the ransom
		drop on purpose.

<b>				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
</b>		They're still harping on that
		"American plot" nonsense.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		Meaning?

<b>				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
</b>		They say the death of the Premier's
		niece and her family would justify
		immediate retaliation.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		Are they out of their fuckin' minds?!
		What kind of retaliation?

Everyone in the room looks at one another.



<b>				CIA CHIEF
</b>		They're threatening to pull a Saddam
		Hussein: remember the Scuds he lobbed
		at Jerusalem during Desert Storm?
			(beat)
		They're talking about firing a
		missile into Los Angeles --

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		-- A goddamn WHAT??

<b>				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
</b>		Best guess is an AS-15, medium-range
		cruise -- their version of our
		Tomahawk, launched from offshore.

<b>				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
</b>		The AS-15 is gyro-guided. It will
		find the city, but it's not too
		accurate beyond that.

<b>				VICE PRESIDENT
</b>		Still, for their purposes it's
		perfect: Hit somewhere in L.A., take
		out a city block or two...

<b>				SECRETARY OF STATE
</b>		To the eyes of the world it's a
		measured response -- like what Reagan
		did to Qaddafi. But actually striking
		at an American city would be a huge
		psychological victory for them.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		I don't believe I'm hearing this!
			(beat)
		So if we know it's coming, we can
		knock it out of the fuckin' sky!

<b>				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
</b>		These weapons fly subsonically, below
		radar... we don't have the defenses
		in place... If we'd had the time to
		deploy a string of Patriot anti-
		missile batteries across the coast --

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		-- You're saying we got all this
		lousy hardware and can't stop one
		goddamn missile??

Everyone's silence answers his question.



<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(continuing; thru video
			link)
		I want an immediate search for all
		ships within range.

<b>				FBI CHIEF
</b>		We better inform the other leaders,
		stall on the Summit --

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		There's no reason to panic yet --
		they can't launch until after the
		family's confirmed dead!

<b>				CIA CHIEF
</b>		Afraid that's not the case...

The Intelligence Officer illustrates his explanation with
FOOTAGE and DIAGRAMS on a nearby COMPUTER SCREEN:

<b>				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
</b>		The North Korean Premier holds what
		we call a "Brinksman Switch." He's
		able to destroy a missile in flight,
		right up to the moment before it
		achieves its target.

<b>				CIA CHIEF
</b>		Our Op says they've timed their
		retaliation to hit right after 5:00.

<b>				FBI CHIEF
</b>		And if the family turns up okay,
		they'll just make it self-destruct.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		Shit! I really don't need this today!

<b>				VICE PRESIDENT
</b>		We're forgetting one thing here: the
		family. Intelligence is sure the
		North will abort their attack if Mrs.
		Han and her kids are safely returned?

<b>				CIA CHIEF
</b>		Absolutely. Their whole game depends
		on claiming a legitimate provocation.

<b>				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
</b>		Still, we should let them know there'd
		be a response... if it comes to it.



<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		I'd like to turn 'em into a
		radioactive parking lot.

<b>				SECRETARY OF STATE
</b>		That's the problem: we can't. We're
		the last superpower. Our hands are
		tied by politics, alliances, goddamn
		stacks of treaties... most we could
		do is give 'em a "measured response"
		back again, or everyone starts
		crying that we're the bullies.

<b>				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
</b>		Damn, I miss the Cold War. Russians
		wouldn't have dreamt of pulling a
		stunt like this.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		Believe me, the North drops one in
		my fuckin' city, I'm dropping ten in

At the kidnapping site, the intersection is blocked off with
yellow police tape. Several LAPD cruisers are parked nearby.
Some COPS are interviewing the Carpool Lady.

Despite this, the neighborhood's bazaar -- a sidewalk sale
with MUSIC, food vendors, etc. -- has half-heartedly begun.

The government helicopter HOVERS and Carson helps Miranda climb
down a long chain ladder. Colonel Lee follows impatiently.

Carson uncovers the bodies of the Driver and the Motorist,
lying on the sidewalk. He grimaces. Colonel Lee does not.
Miranda wants to look, but Carson drops the cover. She picks
it up, then turns away in horror.

A young BLACK COP crosses to them. He's holding a plastic bag
with a spent shotgun shell in it.

<b>				YOUNG COP
</b>		Inspector! Look at this...

		"Dragon's Breath..?"

</b>		Twelve-gauge shell filled with

The North Korean COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER puts down his

Suddenly, a BEARDED CREWMAN crosses to the Captain. He calmly
SHOOTS him and the FIRST MATE.

The rest of the Crew is shocked. Holding his pistol on the
Crew, the Bearded Crewman nods at the Missile Experts.
Saluting, they remove the green warhead from the missile.

Two OTHER CONSPIRATORS, carrying a metal locker, appear from
below deck. The Crew murmurs nervously as they remove from the
locker a red warhead and attach it to the missile.

Finishing, one of the Experts pushes the firing trigger and
the missile WHOOSHES from its launching pad.

Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee hurry back in. Disgusted,
Carson throws his jacket on a chair.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Wasted trip: Witnesses say he was

The CIA technicians have enlarged and enhanced every part of
the fax deemed significant, in individual blowups.

<b>BACK TO SCENE

Colonel Lee is standing right beside Carson, leaning over to
look at the pictures. Carson looks at him, irritated.

</b>		We going steady?



<b>				SABATINI
</b>		The sun position tells us the

		Here's the best -- look at the glass

</b>		Looks like the wheel of a car.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		We talked about these billboards,

<b>				CARSON
</b>		I thought that about all of them.
		C'mon, think, dammit!!

</b>		You think!! You were there, too!

They're stumped, and bitterly frustrated. To Sabatini:

</b>		Call the outdoor advertising

Meanwhile, Dave and Robbins are calling car alarm shops:

A GUNSHOT rings out (OS), and the Operative's chest EXPLODES
in blood. He pitches forward... but presses the "transmit"

Angry, General Kai steps INTO FRAME and kicks the Operative

Mrs. Han and Joy sit motionless. Sam, on the other hand, is

The family becomes aware of a shrill SOUND, (OS), distant at
first, but growing increasingly louder... The sound-level
meters all begin to creep upward...

<b>EXT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - CLOSE - DAY

A team of GARDENERS has arrived on the property for their
weekly mow, blow, and go. They have lawnmowers, edgers, blowers
-- it's as NOISY as an aircraft carrier during takeoffs.

<b>INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
The SOUND is getting louder, and louder...

<b>				JOY
</b>		Oh, my God...

The meters are hovering just below the red...



<b>SAM
</b>
pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger
than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest.

He begins chewing his wad of GUM... leans in toward the
microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing...

He moves back and we see he's SEALED the front of the mic with
a small piece of the gum.

And his meter drops to zero.

<b>WIDER
</b>
Sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he
can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. Then, while
keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his
hand over to Mrs. Han. They can't quite reach each other...

He FLICKS the piece of gum and she catches it.

Meanwhile, the NOISE increases. The two meters peak into the
red... the yellow WARNING LIGHT begins to flash...

Mrs. Han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half,
and cautiously passes the remainder over to Joy.

Joy puts the gum in her mouth. She tries to push it over her
mic, but her hair is in the way. She shakes her head; some
hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the
Gardeners' noise reaches a CRESCENDO...

All three sound meters sit pinned to zero. The yellow light
stops flashing.

Sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts
laughing. They join him: a celebration for a small victory.

The clock on the wall reads 7:13, eastern time. The President,

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		So what the hell does "Kipchak" mean?

<b>				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
</b>		Uh, it's a code name... for weapons
		using the Yersinia Pestis bacillus...

He really doesn't want to be the one telling the President
about this.



<b>				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
</b>			(continuing)
		Kipchaks were Asian nomads. In 1347
		they attacked a Genoese fort, and
		catapulted infected corpses over the
		walls. The Genoese who survived
		carried the disease back to Europe...
		and it killed half the population.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		Get to the goddamn point, Major.

The Intelligence Officer looks at the CIA Chief.

<b>				CIA CHIEF
</b>		Seems the missile is armed with a
		warhead carrying the Pneumonic
		Plague.

The President goes nuts.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		The Black Plague?! Every time I talk
		to you fuckin' guys it gets worse!
		What happened to this "limited
		retaliation" shit?

<b>				SECRETARY OF STATE
</b>		The North Koreans insist the missile
		carries a conventional payload. They
		say we're trying to trick them into
		aborting the attack.

<b>				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
</b>		Especially since the uplink from our
		Op in P'yÚngyang was unencrypted.

<b>				CIA CHIEF
</b>		We think one of the Hard-liners
		switched the warhead without the
		Premier's knowledge. But he's not
		about to take our word for it, and
		he's too weak to risk the
		humiliation of backing down.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(incredulous; thru video
			link)
		They use a biological weapon on
		American soil, they have to know
		we'll respond!



<b>				SECRETARY OF STATE
</b>		Maybe they don't think we got the
		guts. Maybe they want a war, 'cause
		they think they can whip us, like
		what happened in 'Nam. Look who
		we're dealing with: a teetering,
		outlaw regime, and inside it, some
		wild-ass renegades working their

<b>				PRESIDENT

		What the hell are we doing in L.A.?

<b>				SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
</b>		We've deployed Marines from Pendleton

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		All right. Assuming the worst...
		What'll happen?

The Intelligence Officer demonstrates with another of his
<b>COMPUTER GRAPHICS.
</b>
<b>				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
</b>		The warhead vents the plague
		bacteria above the target area,
		infecting about 50,000 people. First
		symptoms are vomiting, lymph nodes

		lung hemorrhaging, usually die the

			(beat)
		There are treatments -- streptomycin
		and tetracyclines -- but we'd be
		overwhelmed by the numbers and its
		extreme contagiousness.

</b>		We could have 500,000 infected in a
		week, who knows how many after that.

Long beat as everyone tries to contemplate the unthinkable.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		I'm gonna toast those fuckers! Have

<b>				FBI CHIEF
</b>		Yes, sir... no one's landing in L.A.
		'til we give the all-clear.

<b>				PRESIDENT
</b>			(thru video link)
		And you're sure it's safe if we can

<b>				INTELLIGENCE OFFICER
</b>		The bacteria can't survive the heat
		of an explosion.

<b>				CIA CHIEF
</b>		I suggest none of this go any
		further -- not even to the agents
		working to find the family. Word

Miranda and Colonel Lee immediately get out of the car and run
off, leaving Sabatini to contend with it.

		'She's got the field experience'...
		To park the fuckin' car!

<b>EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY
</b>
A boxy, ten-story complex built in the sixties.

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY
</b>
Carson, (FBI jacket folded over his arm) Miranda, and Colonel
Lee rush into the lobby.

Carson is about to show the CONCIERGE behind the desk his i.d,
but the Concierge is nervous and sweating. Carson pulls out
his Sig 9mm, approaches the door behind the desk, which is
ajar... He pushes it open...

And finds himself staring at the muzzles of three M-16 rifles.

Three SWAT TEAM members are standing there in full body armor.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(pulls out his i.d.)
		Whoa... FBI..!

They lower their weapons.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing)
		How the hell you get here so fast?



<b>				SWAT TEAM #1
</b>		They're shootin' a cop movie down
		the street. We're workin' as extras.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Terrific. Who else is here?

<b>				SWAT TEAM #1
</b>		Three officers on the roof, next
		building over, and two in the tenth-
		floor hallway.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Tell 'em to be cool. We're going up.
			(to Concierge)
		Give me your master key.

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - DAY

Sabatini drives the Lexus in and parks it in the fire lane.

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
The fire door opens next to an elevator with the number "10"
on it, and Carson, Miranda and Colonel Lee come out.

Carson and Miranda creep quietly along the hallway, toward
apartment 1060. Carson listens at the door, hears nothing.

He moves to the next door down, apartment 1058, and quietly
unlocks the door.

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY
</b>
The shades are drawn, and the apartment is dark.

As Carson and Miranda cut through the apartment, they realize
there's a WOMAN lying in the bed. She's naked, and she's not
alone. Someone is under the sheets. ANOTHER WOMAN.

The first Woman opens her eyes, sees the intruders, and grabs
for a Colt Gold Cup .45 auto in the dresser drawer.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		What the fuck..!

Her friend sits up. Miranda holds her finger to her lips and
shows them her FBI shield.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Sorry...

Carson cranks open their window and steps out onto the foot-
wide, ornamental balcony.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(to Miranda)
		Wait here.

She begins to protest. He shoots her a look that silences her.

<b>EXT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - DAY
</b>
The SWAT sharpshooters watch from the next building over as
Carson, ten floors up, peers through the slit in between the
curtains into the window of Javal's apartment.

He swings his legs over onto Javal's ornamental balcony... the
bolts holding the rail onto the wall are loose and rusty...
the balcony SLIPS a little...

He leans on the crank-operated window until it SNAPS open.

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Carson steps inside. He looks around the bedroom -- it's
empty. No furnishings, the closet shelves are bare, even the
pictures on the walls are gone, leaving only their outline.

Carson cautiously goes into the living room --

It's also empty. All that remains are a few cardboard boxes,
and three flower pots in macramÈ ceiling hangers by the living
room window. Some dead leaves lie on the floor beneath them.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(into radio)
		I'm in. It's empty, but sit tight
		while I look around.

Carson cautiously approaches the cardboard boxes.

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY

The clock on the bedstand reads 4:25. Miranda smiles
uncomfortably at the two naked women together in bed.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		I like what you've done with the
		place...



<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
The elevator DINGS. Sabatini comes out, H&amp;K MP-5 in hand.

SWAT Team #2, standing on the far side of the hallway with
Colonel Lee, sees her machine pistol and takes aim.

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		Wait!

Colonel Lee walks over to Sabatini.

<b>				SABATINI
</b>		Where's Carson?

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		Inside.

Sabatini starts down the hall. Colonel Lee stays where he is.

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - JAVAL'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
Carson cautiously peers in the moving boxes. They're empty.

He crosses to the front door, looks it over, unlocks the
deadbolt. He turns the knob, the button POPS open...

He stops, noticing a HAIRLINE SEAM in the doorjamb where a
piece was cut, then neatly replaced.

Then, he's startled as he hears a strange, mechanical whining
NOISE coming from the kitchen.

He goes to investigate -- it's an almost-dead, avocado-green
refrigerator straining to start its compressor. He looks for
booby-traps, opens it, and looks inside. Empty.

Looking down, he notices he's got a dead leaf stuck to the
bottom of his shoe.

Glancing in the living room, he sees the dead leaves on the
floor below the three hanging plants. He looks at the plants:
two are dead. The one in the middle is not. It's plastic.

We HEAR the jiggle of the front doorknob.

<b>				CARSON
</b><b>		NO! --
</b>
Too late... The front door opens....

Carson crouches behind the big, heavy refrigerator door...

As the middle flower pot EXPLODES. It's a shrapnel bomb: it
spews thousands of tiny carpet tacks 360 degrees around room.

Sabatini is HIT full on -- she falls backwards into the hall.



<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - #1058 - DAY
</b>
Miranda and the women in the darkened bedroom SCREAM as the
tacks tear hundreds of HOLES through sections of the wall.

Tiny shafts of LIGHT appear in the wall, except where it is
covered by furniture (keeping them from being shredded.)

<b>INT.  MIMOSA APARTMENTS - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
SWAT Team #2 and Colonel Lee come running, as does Miranda.

Carson is kneeling next to Sabatini. She looks up at him and
tries to say something, but a only long, mournful, final
BREATH escapes her. Agonized, Carson looks around...

And sees Colonel Lee. He lunges for him.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		I said keep everyone back!!

He punches Colonel Lee in the jaw. Colonel Lee slams against
the wall, then comes back at Carson, hitting him in the throat.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Stop it!

Miranda and SWAT Team #2 pull them apart.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(to Colonel Lee)
		Get out of my sight.

He kneels next to Sabatini, and closes her eyes.

Carson and Miranda sit together in the back and Colonel Lee
sits next to the Pilot as they fly back to the Consulate.

Miranda looks at Carson, who's trying real hard not to let
Sabatini's death slow him down.

</b>		-- "Should've." Shit, there's a

Carson is in the FBI command truck, talking on the phone to:

A BANK ROBBER, barricaded inside the bank. Phone in hand, he
holds a shotgun on a dozen hostages: BANK EMPLOYEES and
CUSTOMERS -- including a couple of YOUNG KIDS. One is holding
a soccer-sized, rainbow-colored rubber ball.

The OTHER BANK ROBBER wires up a series of explosive charges.

Both Robbers rush inside the vault, and pull the door closed
to protect themselves...

The front of the building, where the hostages are, EXPLODES.

Carson runs to the bank. He spots the kid's ball, rolling in
the street... BURNING. He turns away, horrified, devastated...

Their CRIES echo faintly through a deserted tangle of ladders,

<b>INT.  NORTH KOREAN CONSULATE - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY

The mood is glum. Carson looks at Robbins, Dave and Walther,
then at the empty chair where Sabatini had been sitting.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		C'mon! Who's pulling Javal's bank
		records? What about cross-referencing
		possible aliases? We got 33 minutes!

Hearing Beach Boys MUSIC on the TV's and radios on the
surveillance console, Carson angrily punches them all off.

Suddenly, Miranda looks at him:

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Camry! The billboard! Toyota Camry!
			(reaches for phone)
		Where are the numbers for the

<b>				ROBBINS
</b>		Parker Center's making those calls.

The TV's are off -- so they see none of Bobbi's report.

Carson crosses to Dave. He's at his computer, looking at a
long column of telephone numbers.

<b>				DAVE
</b>		Finally got the call list from
		Javal's phone. Most aren't his;
		they're from the legit user who

Dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.

</b>			(while scrolling)
		The rest are dupes... all from the

on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."



<b>BACK TO SCENE
</b>
Across the room, Colonel Lee is watching Carson intently.

Carson turns to look at him. They make eye contact.

Time stands still.

Realization.

Feeling like he's moving in SLOW MOTION, Carson reaches for
the Sig 9mm in his shoulder holster.

Colonel Lee grabs the AMD-74 machine gun on the desk.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Get down!

Colonel Lee STRAFES the room and backs toward the door.

The BULLETS trace a line across the room. One of the North
Korean Espionage Agents is HIT. He slams against the console.

Carson tackles Ambassador Han and shoves him onto the floor,
while popping off several ROUNDS in Colonel Lee's direction.

Robbins also dives for cover, pushing Walther down first.
Robbins takes a BULLET in the shoulder.

Miranda is HIT. The impact tumbles her over the desk.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing)
<b>		MIRANDA!
</b>
Colonel Lee, still FIRING, slips out the door.

Gunsmoke hangs in the air as Carson scrambles to Miranda.
Several PHONES have begun ringing. No one notices them.

Dave never moved -- he sits hunched over, clutching his
notebook computer, muttering the HAIL MARY.

Carson rolls Miranda over. She's got a large, scorched bullet
hole in the front of her blouse. Carson tears her blouse open.
She's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is
mushroomed against the vest.

She awakens, GASPS and starts swinging her fists at him.
Carson is overwhelmed with relief.

Then he notices Robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against
the wall next to Walther. Walther is dead -- shot in the head.

OS, we hear several SPURTS of machine gun fire, and a car
ENGINE roaring to life. Miranda looks at Carson...

<b>				MIRANDA

The city's reaction to Bobbi's announcement is immediate and

Carson bursts through the door just as the second armored
Mercedes CRASHES through the wrought-iron entry gates. Carson
fires several SHOTS, which ping harmlessly off the Mercedes.

Carson sprints for a car. Miranda's Volvo is the closest one.

As Carson is starting it, the passenger door opens and

Ambassador Han responds by putting on his seat belt. Carson

Colonel Lee crashes through the Fremont Place guard gate, then

follow the pursuit. They join the police and TV copters, and
it looks like the Ride of the Valkyries.

Everyone, everywhere is getting into their cars in a mad dash
to get out of town or rendezvous with loved ones.

This is the mother of all rush hours.

<b>EXT.  WESTERN AVENUE - DAY

Colonel Lee's car turns right onto Western Avenue. He's in the

He swerves through the panicked drivers jamming the roads --

HITS crumple against the Mercedes without slowing it down.

Carson's Volvo follows, squeezing through traffic in its wake.

All of the celebration locales are trampled, abandoned messes.

The windows on the Mercedes glide open....

Carson hurries to catch up to it...

Colonel Lee FIRES a rocket at the bulldozers through the
driver's side window. The BACKBLAST from the launcher vents
through the passenger's side.

The ROCKET impacts the bulldozer on the left; the EXPLOSION
actually FLIPS the huge machine head over tail into the air.

The bulldozer lands upside down on the lane divider, crushing
a portion of it.

Colonel Lee rolls up his windows and drives around the burning

As Carson moves forward, Colonel Lee's window opens enough to
allow the barrel of his AMD-74 machine gun to poke through.

Carson shoves Ambassador Han's head down and ducks. Colonel
Lee STRAFES the Volvo.

Carson looks up just in time to see...

A pickup truck, ahead, stalled on the shoulder.

Carson slams on the brakes, but it's too late... The Volvo

</b>			(dazed)
		I can't believe I'm still alive...

<b>				CARSON
</b>		This were a Hyundai you wouldn't be.

Ambassador Han looks at Carson, wondering if he's putting him
on. The car is a twisted mess. Carson can't get the door open.

<b>EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

A red and white LAFD paramedic's ambulance puts on its SIREN
and hurries to the Volvo. Two PARAMEDICS jump out.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Get me out of here...

They pry his door open with a crowbar. Carson climbs onto the
roof of his car. Grimacing from pain, he looks around.

<b>				CARSON

		Anybody see him?

<b>				MIRANDA (VO)

		Still heading north on the 110.

Bobbi is standing next to her copter in the back of the

Carson waves his arms as he sees a helicopter approaching.

The glare from the sun masks the copter's markings. It HOVERS
above him. With the canvas bag slung over his shoulder, Carson
jumps up onto the runner, then climbs up inside the cockpit.

<b>INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson has the Pilot hover just above and behind the Mercedes.
It comes to a stop and the sunroof opens up.

Carson lashes himself to the copter's center post with a piece
of the seat harness, then slides the door open.

He reaches into the canvas bag and takes out a road flare. He
breaks the flare open, IGNITING it.



<b>				CARSON
</b>			(to Pilot)
		Pull hard to the left, on my

He braces himself on door jamb...

Below, Colonel Lee's head pokes up from the sunroof.

Colonel Lee calmly aims the rocket launcher and FIRES.

Carson tosses the lit flare, hard, away from the helicopter.

The Pilot swings the helicopter in the other direction, and
the rocket FOLLOWS the flare, streaking past the helicopter.

A few seconds later, the rocket EXPLODES in midair behind them.

<b>EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY

Miranda and the L.A. Cop, both holding small tear gas pistols,
split up. Crouching behind the cars on the freeway, they sneak
up on the stopped Mercedes.

<b>INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY

Carson takes another flare out of the canvas bag. He breaks
the top off... and it doesn't ignite.

Below, Colonel Lee loads another rocket into the launcher...



<b>EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
Miranda is climbing the metal stairs leading to a graffiti-
covered freeway sign.

<b>INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Carson fumbles to pull another flare out of the canvas bag.

<b>EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
Avoiding coils of razor-sharp concertina wire around the sign,
Miranda FIRES a tear gas canister at the Mercedes' sunroof.

It misses, bouncing off the windshield, filling the area with
white smoke. Colonel Lee keeps his eye on the copter...

<b>INT.  NEWS COPTER - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Carson gets the new flare lit and throws it away from the
copter just as Colonel Lee FIRES another rocket.

The rocket EXPLODES a few dozen yards away. Shrapnel PEPPERS
the copter, DAMAGING the rear rotor.

Struggling to maintain control, the Pilot heads for the Sixth
Street on-ramp, below the freeway, out of the line of fire.

<b>EXT.  HARBOR FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
Colonel Lee spots Miranda, up on the freeway sign, loading
another tear gas canister. He STRAFES the sign.

She flattens; the BULLETS tear through the sign above her.

The L.A. Cop rushes the Mercedes. Colonel Lee FIRES at him,
hitting him across the legs.

Colonel Lee ducks back into the Mercedes and drives away.

<b>VARIOUS ANGLES
</b>
As Miranda comes down from the sign...

Carson climbs up the embankment from Sixth Street to the 101...

The downed L.A. Cop waves as a pair of ambulances drive up,
lights flashing and sirens WAILING.

Carson runs alongside one of the ambulances, pulling the
driver's door open before it's stopped.

The Paramedic is the one who helped him and Ambassador Han out
of the Volvo. Carson yanks him out of his ambulance.



<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Sorry...

<b>INT.  AMBULANCE - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Carson jumps in. Miranda climbs in the passenger's side. As he
peels away, Miranda smacks Carson on the head.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		You're completely deranged! Playing
		chicken with rockets!

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Well, what the hell were you doing
		out there?

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN (OS)
</b>		What are both of you doing?

Carson turns, surprised and annoyed to see Ambassador Han, his
arm bandaged, lying in the cot in the back.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Oh, for Christ's sake... Hold on!

Lights and SIRENS going, they rush into the 110/101 interchange.

Ahead, Colonel Lee's Mercedes is driving through the cars that
are parting like the Red Sea for him.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Even if we can pry him out with...
			(looks at her watch)
		Twelve minutes to go, I doubt he'll
		be very cooperative.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		I'll just use my outstanding people
		skills.

Carson glances up at the sign showing the upcoming exit:
Glendale Blvd - Echo Park. A thought is forming...

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing; to Ambassador
			Han)
		That car's like a rock, right?

<b>EXT.  HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - DAY
</b>
Carson suddenly cuts to the left. When they reach the Glendale
Blvd exit, he SLAMS the ambulance into the side of the
Mercedes, forcing it onto the freeway off-ramp.



<b>INT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - (MOVING SHOT) - DAY
</b>
Carson pushes the Mercedes across Bellevue Avenue, toward the
park surrounding Echo Lake. Colonel Lee STRAFES the ambulance.

<b>EXT.  GLENDALE BLVD - DAY
</b>
Carson keeps BUMPING the Mercedes as they reach Glendale Blvd,
running right alongside the lake.

With a hard shove, Carson sends the Mercedes SKIDDING off the
road, through the small guardrail, and INTO the lake.

Carson slams on the brakes, fishtailing the ambulance into the
grass surrounding the lake. Sig 9mm in hand, he hops out.

The Mercedes is so heavy that it's already half-submerged.

<b>INT./EXT.  COLONEL LEE'S MERCEDES - DAY
</b>
WATER pours in from the floorboards, the air vents...

Colonel Lee climbs out through the sunroof and FIRES at Carson
with his AMD-74.

<b>EXT.  ECHO LAKE - DAY
</b>
Carson ducks behind the ambulance, takes careful aim...

And SHOOTS Colonel Lee, WINGING him in the shoulder. Colonel
Lee's machine gun goes flying, and he tumbles into the water.

Meanwhile, Cops, Army, Marines, etc. arrive via helicopter and
car. Major Vreeland is among them. The news media, ENG cameras
bouncing on their shoulders, run alongside them.

<b>CLOSER
</b>
Carson races over to grab Colonel Lee, who is slogging out of
the lake. There is a glint of bright steel... and Colonel Lee
SLASHES at Carson with a knife.

Carson moves aside... but the knife SLICES across his upper
arm. Carson falls backwards.

Colonel Lee, on hands and knees, tries to crawl away. Suddenly,
someone KICKS him in face, flipping him over.

It's Miranda. Colonel Lee's knife goes flying.

Carson, bleeding, piles onto Colonel Lee. Vreeland assists.
Colonel Lee fights like mad to break free...

Until Miranda JAMS her heel into his groin. He cries out.



<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Ever hear of "fuck-me" pumps?
		Well, these are fuck you pumps!
			(pushes harder)
		Where's the family?

Surprised at his wife's new negotiating technique, Carson
shoots a look at Vreeland. Vreeland grimaces.

While Miranda continues to apply encouragement to Colonel
Lee's gonads, Ambassador Han limps over. He yells some ORDERS
at Colonel Lee. After a moment, Colonel Lee sags.

<b>				AMBASSADOR HAN
</b>		Let him up.

Carson's not so sure, but they're completely surrounded by
military and law enforcement personnel. He releases his grasp.
Miranda removes her heel.

Then, with lightning reflexes, Colonel Lee grabs Vreeland's
Rock Island Arsenal Colt .45 Auto from its snap-holster.

<b>				COLONEL LEE
</b>		Victory!

Carson dives back onto him. But he twists his arm around and
PULLS the trigger -- with the muzzle underneath his own chin.

Carson, Miranda and Ambassador Han are SPRAYED with his blood.

Dumbfounded everybody looks at each other...

Carson, dogged, kneels next to Colonel Lee's body and searches
through his pockets, looking for something, anything.

Several helicopters circle the complex. One has a PA in it:

The family listens, frustrated, as the HELICOPTERS circle (OS).

Joy carefully slides her arm along the arm rest, then tries to
coax something out of her pocket -- her Zippo lighter.

<b>				JOY
</b>		Mother... Sam...

They look over at her as she lights it. After a beat, Mrs. Han
understands... She hesitates, then:

<b>				MRS. HAN
</b>		Do it.

Joy drops the lighter to the floor, then swats it with her
foot to Mrs. Han. She does the same, passing it to Sam, who's
sitting closest to the window.

With one eye on the VU movement meter, Sam kicks the lighter,
sliding it across the carpet toward the curtains.

The Apache hovers parallel to the apartment, 20 feet away.
Carson feeds out a steel cable from a winch...

Then throws a spring-loaded grappling hook onto the thick,
iron balcony railing.

Hanging onto a webbed rescue harness, Carson slides quickly
across the line, onto the balcony. Using the butt of his Sig
9mm, he BREAKS a hole in the glass on the locked sliding glass
door. He reaches through and unlatches it.

<b>INT.  BACHELOR APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
The FLAMES have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun
to creep across the floor and the ceiling.

Carson glances over at the electronics on the TV: 4:55 PM.

The family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic.

In the kitchen, Lisa can't cough through the tape on her
mouth. She's freaking out.

Seeing this, Carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off.
She starts SCREAMING, so he grabs her face.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Okay... work with me here!

He grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it
won't come loose. Lisa cries out in frustration.

<b>				LISA
</b>		Hurry, please hurry...

Carson spots Javal's toolbox. In it, he finds a socket set
handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and
the door. He rips one handle loose, then the other.

Carson turns his attention to the booby-trapped chairs.

Lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed
hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs
for the front door. Just as she reaches it:

<b>				CARSON
</b><b>		DON'T!
</b>
He grabs her before she opens the door. There's a small
magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing)
		We have to go out the window.

<b>				MRS. HAN
</b>		Can't you disarm the bomb?



<b>				CARSON
</b>		Too risky. Let's concentrate on
		getting you out of here.

He looks at the meters on the electronic units.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing)
		Sound detectors?

<b>				MRS. HAN
</b>		Sam covered them with chewing gum.

<b>				SAM
</b>		High-tech problem, low-tech solution.

Carson looks at Sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Pressure sensors. Use 'em in
		convertibles: Bad guy sits on your
		seat, he sets the alarm off. These
		are rigged backwards -- get up, you
		set 'em off.

<b>				SAM
</b>		You a bomb expert?

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Nope. But I've had some car alarms
		in my day.
			(to himself)
		For all the goddamn good they do...

Carson looks around, thinking. He spots the roll of duct tape
on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing; to Mrs. Han)
		Slide your arm forward... Watch the
		meter... Keep the pressure on the
		armrest with your elbow...

He wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.

<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing)
		It'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate
		the weight of your arm... Okay...
		pick it up.

They look at each other, scared... After a beat, she does.

The meter JIGGLES... but stays in the black! Everyone sighs
with relief. Carson repeats the process on her other armrest.



<b>				CARSON
</b>			(continuing; to Sam)
		Low-tech solution...
			(to Mrs. Han)
		Lean back... Carefully.

Carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried
under Mrs. Han's thighs. He runs a long piece of tape around
the seat and wraps it tightly.

He tries to lift Mrs. Han, but the meter moves to the red.

<b>				MIRANDA (VO)
</b>			(thru radio in his pocket)
		How's it going in there?

<b>				CARSON

		Nag, nag, nag...

He wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries
again to lift her. This time it works!

the pieces of her hair stuck to the gum over the microphone

Mrs. Han sees the meter heading for the red, and the yellow

Carson quickly covers the mic... The meter drops to zero.

slides back across to him; Carson grabs it with one hand and

But the cable is crooked, and the buckle is JAMMED -- if he
can't release it, he's stuck there! Carson tries to free the
hook, but it's dug in between the concrete and the railing.

Carson looks over at the helicopter and waves them away.

		team.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		What did you say?

<b>				CARSON
</b>		Told 'em I'd sleep on it...

Miranda smiles, then looks at him, surprised, as he crouches
down and helps her turn the soil around the rose bushes. They
work in silence. Then, tentatively, she leans over and kisses
him. Soon they're in each other's arms, holding tight...

<b>INT.  CARSON'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Still entwined, Carson and Miranda stumble in. While kissing:

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		Working with you today was
		certainly... interesting, Inspector.

<b>				CARSON
</b>		It's my outstanding people skills.

He slips her out of her robe and they fall onto the bed. It is
a tender, romantic moment...

Until, (OS), a CAR ALARM goes off. Miranda bolts up.

<b>				MIRANDA
</b>		I hate this fucking town...

Carson ignores the ALARM -- and Miranda's comment. He pushes
her back onto the bed and turns off the bedside lamp.

All of the books and magazines about other places to live
spill from his nightstand, onto the floor...

<b>							FADE OUT.
