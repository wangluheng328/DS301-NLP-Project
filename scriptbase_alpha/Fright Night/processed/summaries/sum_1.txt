Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) believes that his next door neighbour Jerry Dandridge (Chris Sarandon) is a vampire.
His belief is strengthened when mysterious deaths of girls are reported.
When Dandridge confronts Charlie in his own bedroom one night and tries to kill him, Charlie concludes that the monster must be destroyed.
But since nobody believes his story he enlists the help of Peter Vincent, the vampire killer from his favourite horror TV show, who is in fact sceptical about vampires existing for real.
