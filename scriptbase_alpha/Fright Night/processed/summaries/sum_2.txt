While with his girlfriend Amy Peterson in his bedroom, teenager Charley Brewster sees a coffin being transported to the house next door.
A couple of days later, he concludes that his neighbor Jerry Dandrige is a vampire, who has committed some recent unsolved murders.
Charley decides to look for help first from his friend Evil Ed Thompson, since the policemen do not believe his accusations.
Jerry is upset and promises to kill Charley.
Later, he meets Peter Vincent, a middle aged man, who is a vampire killer in a television show but does not believe in vampires in real life.
Amy and Ed seek out Peter Vincent, and the group tries to prove to Charley that Jerry is not a vampire.
