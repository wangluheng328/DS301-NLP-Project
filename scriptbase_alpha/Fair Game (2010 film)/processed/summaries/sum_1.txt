In the run-up to the Iraq War, Valerie Plame, a supervisor of covert operations at the CIA, is assigned to determine if Saddam has nuclear weapons.
In secret, she interviews scientists inside Iraq and suggests that her husband go to Niger to investigate a report from the Vice President's office that Iraq bought enriched uranium there.
When the country goes to war, in part based on the President's claim that the sale took place, Plame's husband, Joe Wilson, writes in the New York Times that the report is false.
The White House smears the couple to change the subject.
Her career ruined, his credibility under attack, their marriage starts to crack.
Can they find trust and fight back?
