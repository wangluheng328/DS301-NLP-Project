In 1941, bugler and career soldier Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (Montgomery Clift) transfers to a rifle company at Schofield Barracks on the island of Oahu.
Captain Dana "Dynamite" Holmes (Philip Ober) has heard he is a talented middleweight boxer and wants him to join his regimental boxing team.
Prewitt refuses, having stopped fighting because he blinded his sparring partner and close friend over a year before.
Holmes is adamant, but so is Prewitt.

Holmes makes life as miserable as possible for Prewitt, hoping he will give in.
Holmes orders First Sergeant Milton Warden (Burt Lancaster) to prepare general court martial papers after Sergeant Galovitch (John Dennis) first insults Prewitt, then gives an unreasonable order which Prewitt refuses to obey.
Warden, however, suggests that he try to get Prewitt to change his mind by doubling up on company punishment.
Warden's goal is not to punish Prewitt; but, to prevent a court martial for a career soldier.
The other non-commissioned officers assist in the conspiracy.
Prewitt is supported only by his friend, Private Angelo Maggio (Frank Sinatra).
