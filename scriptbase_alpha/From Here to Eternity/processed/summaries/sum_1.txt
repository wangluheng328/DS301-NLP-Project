In Hawaii in the months preceding the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Pvt.
Robert E. Lee Pruitt reports for his hew assignment as an infantryman.
At his previous Post, Pruitt was a bugler and his unit's top boxer.
After a man died in the ring however, Pruitt wants nothing to do with the sport.
Trouble is, his new company commander, Captain Dana Holmes, has the championship boxing team and Pruitt's refusal to box results in most of the NCOs giving him a pretty hard time.
Pruitt forms a close friendship with another GI, Angelo Maggio, who makes the mistake of crossing Sgt.
Fatso Judson, the man in charge of the stockade.
When Judson effectively beats Maggio to death, Pruitt seeks his revenge.
Meanwhile, Company First Sgt.
Milt Warden pursues and has an affair with Capt.
Holmes's beautiful wife, Karen.
