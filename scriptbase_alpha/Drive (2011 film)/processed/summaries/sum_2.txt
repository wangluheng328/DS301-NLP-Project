This film is about a 'driver' (Ryan Gosling) who works at a garage fixing cars, but also drives stunt cars in movies.
He also does some getaway driving to earn extra cash.
He gets close with a woman, Irene, and her child, who is his neighbor.
Her husband gets released from prison and and owes some people money, so the 'driver' ends up doing a job with him.
But it goes wrong and the 'driver' ends up in a crime he didn't want to be involved in.
Can he protect the people that he now cares about?
