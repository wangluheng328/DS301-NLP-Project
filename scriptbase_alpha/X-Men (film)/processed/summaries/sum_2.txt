In the near future, when children are being born with a special X-factor in their genes, giving them special powers and making them mutants, the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sown by Senator Robert Kelly.
The situation brings into opposition the fellow mutants and former friends, Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a.
Magneto, and Professor Charles Xavier.
While Xavier wants a peaceful means of stopping the hatred toward mutants, Magneto seeks to even things out with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal.
To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called "X-Men" to stop him.
In the meantime, two mysterious mutants emerge: Logan, a powerful and aggressive mutant with no past, no memories, and a young girl named Rogue.
Their quests for identities eventually land them in the sights of Xavier and Magneto, but for what purpose?
