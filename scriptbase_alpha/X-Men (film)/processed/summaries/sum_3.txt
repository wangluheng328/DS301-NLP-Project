Meanwhile, a group of good mutants is assembled by Charles Xavier, who trains and cares for them.
Magnus, now under the guise of Magneto, assembles the villains Sabertooth and Mystique to destroy anyone who gets in his way, including a furry Canadian mutant named Logan (Wolverine).
A fierce battle ensues between Sabertooth and Wolverine.
