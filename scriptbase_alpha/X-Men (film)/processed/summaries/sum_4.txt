Across the world, children are born with an extra twist to their chromosomes that allow them to exhibit superhuman abilities: fire a beam of force from their eyes, sprout wings that allow flight, or read men's minds.
These 'children of the atom' are often feared and despised by the world, forcing these mutants to resort to desperate actions.
However, one group of mutants have banded together to show the world that it need not fear their kind.
Apart, they are simply scientific curiosities, freaks and monsters - but together, united by their shared belief, they are more.
They are the uncanny X-Men.
