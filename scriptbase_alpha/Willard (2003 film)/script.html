</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">In the pitch darkness of an old shivery east coast cellar, the audience sits amongst SILENCE. Then... Rising from the THEATRE'S REAR SPEAKERS...faint tiny claws, many, moving as one, scuttle; seemingly in the roof of the THEATRE. CHEWING. SCRATCHING. TEARING.
</p><p></p><p id="act">An elderly woman, shrill and startling, calls out in the
</p><p></p><p id="act">dark.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES
</p><p id="dia">Willard!
</p><p id="spkdir">(beat)
</p><p id="dia">There are rats in the basement!
</p><p></p><p id="act">The scuttling stops. Silence. Beat; another, then...a metal doorknob, distinctive to a classic antiquated house, CLACKS and echoes. O.S., A door slowly squeaks open.
</p><p></p><p id="act">From an upstairs room, a rhomboidal patch of light creeps across the TOP RIGHT OF FRAME. Within the light holds the hesitant shadow of an average sized man at the summit of a flight of stairs, descending into a cold, dark cellar.
</p><p></p><p id="act">
<a href="http://www.horrorlair.com"><img border="0" src="http://www.horrorlair.com/scripts/leach.gif"/></a>O.S., a light switch FLIPS. A FLASH! An exaggerated POP! The light bulb blows in the f.g., a fuse-box CRACKLES, sprays tiny blue sparks, then returns to darkness.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The shadow FLIPS the light switch with anxious futility. The basement remains dark.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The shadow SIGHS, shrinks, before the man DESCENDS an OS set of stairs; the risers bare. The aged wood creaks. Eerie as Arriving at a landing, he enters frame. Remaining in silhouette, yet backlit by the light spilling into the cellar from the upper room. Although face obscured by darkness, his posture reflects a dread as he continues down the stairs.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Upon reaching the cement floor, CAMERA CREEPS BACK. The light is dim, yet enough to reveal a fuse-box beside wooden storage shelves lining the walls. With a hand against the stone wall as a guide in the darkness, the figure moves to the fuse-box. 
</p><p></p><p id="act">Opening the fuse-box door releases residual snaking blue smoke. He twists the fuses; taps on them. Nothing. Closing the fuse-box, he notices the wires have been chewed.
</p><p></p><p id="act">With cautious loathing, the man blindly continues to the shelves and rummages through the supplies.
</p><p></p><p id="act">His hands find a shoe box labeled FUSES and begins sliding it off the shelf. Until...he petrifies. CAMERA SWEEPS into the shoebox lid REVEALING half a dozen tapered rat droppings.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Aghast, the figure quickly pulls his hands away, trembling in the gray light. He holds. Still shaking, the hands quickly remove a toilet plunger from a shelf. CAMERA FOLLOWS the improvised weapon as it RISES several shelves. Chewed holes replace the Quaker's eyes on a tube of oatmeal giving the
</p><p></p><p id="act">pilgrim's smile the appearance of a madman. The toilet plunger pokes around, discovering chewed holes in boxes of Jello and Jiffy-Pop. Even candles and canned food have been gnawed.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Tense, the plunger pulls away knocking items off the shelf. A reflective glint rolls INTO FRAME. The bulb end of a cheap flashlight is grabbed by the man and hurriedly lit.
</p><p></p><p id="act">As the small light flares...SCUTTLING. The man spins toward the SOUND...
</p><p></p><p id="act">IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM
</p><p></p><p id="act">A glimpse, yet...an unmistakable glimpse...of several rat tails dashing through a hole in a mesh screen; disappearing beneath the house.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA PUSHES IN on WILLARD STILES, 30's. Under-lit by the trembling flashlight, still in his short sleeve white collar shirt and cheap tie work clothes. CAMERA CONTINUES...MOVING CLOSE on his puppy like eyes; locked on the mesh screen across the room. CAMERA CONTINUES until these eyes FILL THE FRAME; these eyes...afraid.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. DUANE READE DRUG STORE - NIGHT - CLOSE-2-SHOT
</p><p></p><p id="act">A line drawing of a mouse, ears and tail, sits in the center of a red circle and slash; in the chief of the d-CON herald. 
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Agonizes over a laminated placard chained to the store shelf.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - PLACARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">d-CON Guide to Rodent Control...
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Sighs, reaches out and holds the guide...
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - d-CON GUIDE TO RODENT CONTROL
</p><p></p><p id="act">His finger searches through questions on the far right. "What type of rodents do you have?" "Mice", "Rats". "Where will product be used?" "High traffic areas (Kitchen, Family Room, etc.) "Low Traffic Areas (Attics, Garages, basements, etc...)
</p><p></p><p id="act">The finger pauses upon... "Do you want proof you caught the rodents?" *Yes, I want proof. *No, I do not want to see or come in contact with a dead mouse/rat."
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Perspiration beads on his forehead.
</p><p></p><p id="act">D-CON GUIDE TO RODENT CONTROL (FILLING THE FRAME)
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard's trembling finger settles beneath... "No, I do not want to see or come in contact with a dead mouse/rat..."
</p><p></p><p id="act">The finger moves across the guide to the recommended d-CON product which is "Mouse-Prufe II".
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Searches the shelves with his eyes.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSE - DUANE READE SHELVES
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA PASSES OVER several sickening options. A package of an electronic pest repeller illustrates spiders, moths and rats fleeing from concentric circles of ultra sound.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The Giant Destroyer is powdered sodium nitrate; "The Effective Gas Killer! Kills Gophers, Moles, Woodchucks, Rats, Skunks &amp; Ground Squirrels!"
</p><p></p><p id="act">Zep Commerical offers "Pest Glue Traps"; squares of cardboard with dabs of adhesive. "Traps Crickets, Spiders, Scorpions, Cockroaches and Larger Pests!"
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Frustration increasing; rummaging the shelves. He holds...
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - STORE SHELVES
</p><p></p><p id="act">The store marker indicates the location of "Mouse Prufe II." The area, however, is empty. The store is sold out.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDE OVERHEAD ANGLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Bright fluorescent lights glare upon Willard standing before the pest control section; an aisle amongst several aisles. While he is motionless, other customers move amongst the aisles like lab rats in a maze...
</p><p></p><p id="act">EXT. STREET - OLD BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Dead LEAVES blow across a cracked sidewalk. A pair of worn wing-tip shoes enter frame. CAMERA FOLLOWS the shoes adjusting to reveal Willard proceeding along the way.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA FOLLOWS Willard, passing nineteenth century brownstone houses. Several are under renovation; caged by scaffolding. Others are for sale, marked by high-end realtor signs.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA MOVES AHEAD OF WILLARD until pausing on a corroded bronze plaque marked "STILES". CAMERA PAUSES as Willard, carrying a Duane Reade bag, starts up the steps.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a three-story brownstone suggesting hints of a proud past, turned pathetically decrepit, dark, and sad. The first and second level windows are barred. High above, centered, sits a yellow stained glass Dormer window beneath a Mansard roof.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">The whistling wind GUSTS as Willard enters, holding a bag of large wood Victor rat traps. Several real estate agency business cards and solicitations are attached with rubber bands to the doorknob. Willard removes and tosses the calling cards atop a stack of mail atop a desk-table.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSE - TABLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">The new solicitations fall up several dozen previous offers.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. BASEMENT - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT - EXTREMELY CLOSE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Metal coils strain as a thick copper bow is pulled back. 
</p><p></p><p id="act">A LOCKING BAR
</p><p></p><p id="act">Is placed over the bow and engaged on the curved portion of the bait pedal, dabbed with peanut butter. SUDDENLY! the locking bar slips out of place. The bow releases! SMACK!
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Drops the rat trap, clutching the knuckle of his index
</p><p></p><p id="act">finger. Faintly splattered with peanut butter, he sucks on his throbbing knuckle.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Angry, he picks up the trap intending to heave it against the wall. His eyes however, flash upwards; considerate of not waking someone in the house, upstairs.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Holding the trap, he takes a closer look. Pulling the bow, he feels the tension. Releasing it, he imagines the death blow. SNAP! He pulls back the bow; releasing it. SNAP!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard appears repulsed by the medieval device. And yet... He considers the power over another life which lies in his hands. He pulls back the bow; releases it. SNAP!
</p><p></p><p id="act">As he continues, hypnotized by the rat trap, CAMERA PULLS AWAY, as if to leave Willard alone in the cellar. SNAP! Several successfully set rat traps encircle him. He pulls back the bow; releases it. SNAP!
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA NOW SHIFTS...PANNING. ACROSS THE CELLAR to the small hole in the wire mesh, leading beneath the house. Willard is not alone.
</p><p></p><p id="act">AS CAMERA PUSHES IN, THROUGH THE DARKNESS and HOWLING WIND OUTSIDE,.. two quarter-sized opalescent circles reflect light in a manner unique to animal eyes. OS, SNAP! The flashlight spill creates the illusion of mean, furrowed brows. Whiskers
</p><p></p><p id="act">extend six inches in each direction from the snout.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA CREEPS towards an enormous greasy eighteen inch black Norwegian rat; watching Willard.
</p><p></p><p id="act">This is BEN. SNAP!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Awful Mother, Awful Name
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. PARLOR - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Two stuffed pheasant silhouettes frame the f.g., Positioned high upon a bookshelf, OS, a CLOCK peals. Across the dim room of dark wood, Willard appears and starts up a staircase. 
</p><p></p><p id="act">The clock CHIMES. He checks his Timex wristwatch, then sighs with frustration. As he starts down the stairs, CAMERA MOVES RIGHT, as if along the wall; black figures of stuffed animals pass between Willard and CAMERA.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Reaching the fireplace mantle, CAMERA HOLDS as if settling upon the mantle. CAMERA is always a touch above eye level on Willard. Looming above him is an ornately handled funeral urn.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He checks his watch, reaches to the mantle, and resets the clock. After winding several revolutions, he wipes at the layers of dust, leading the urn. He freezes! Sad and pining.
</p><p></p><p id="act">REVERSE - LOWER ANGLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Like a fading omnipresent memory, a portrait of a pin
</p><p></p><p id="act">stripped suited captain of industry yet also a kindly father in his early fifties hangs above the urn in the dim light. An engraving identifies the urn as the ashes of "Alfred Benjamin Stiles. Loving husband and father. 1944-1995."
</p><p></p><p id="act">RETURN - WILLARD - HIGHER ANGLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE on Willard's expression, lost in fond but pained memories of his father...
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. 2ND STORY LANDING - HALLWAY - WILLARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard's shadow stretches across a wall as he moves up the stairs. Willard turns off the downstairs light and continues along the hallway. Outside, the cold WIND CONTINUES HOWLING.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Willard.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard holds before a bedroom, door ajar. CAMERA CREEPS INTO HIM; eyes reluctantly turning toward the room.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S BEDROOM
</p><p></p><p id="act">A slash of autumn light cuts across a pair of elderly female eyes, reflecting an iridescent gray; eerie, like an animal. The encircling skin is pale. The lids, lined a dying pink.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Although at the core the woman's voice is a loving mother. The edges are shrill and nagging.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES
</p><p id="dia">What are you doing?
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Holding in the hallway, dry and well mannered.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">I'm going to bed.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">It's late!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Yes. I'm going to bed. Good night, mother.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He begins moving off, then freezes upon...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">What were you doing down there, so late?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">You said there were rats.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Did you see them?!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Pause. A smile spreads over Willard which his mother can read as reassuring, however, he's enjoying lying to her.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">There are no rats.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">There are!
</p><p id="spkdir">(catches her breath)
</p><p id="dia">All our neighbors moving away and all these new people remodeling the houses are stirring up rats.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The smile quickly fades.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Have you been to the basement?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Oh, you know I can't. But I know they're there. I smell them! All my life I could smell mice.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Smell mice.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">And hear them! Don't you hear them down there?!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">It's just the wind. There are no rats.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES (O.S.)
</p><p id="spkdir">(a tubercular sigh)
</p><p id="dia">Come in here.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA INCHES, AGAIN... CLOSE to Willard. His expression reflecting neither disgust or hate...just...reluctance.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Come in here!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard CLEARS FRAME, moving toward his mother's bedroom...
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. MRS. STILES' BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Mrs. Stiles wears a mousy light brown fleece nightgown beneath a down comforter and still suffers chills. She is propped against pillows, three deep; the cases blotted with dried yellow and gray fluidal stains.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard enters and stands at her bedside. Although she takes his hand, his mother never looks at him while she talks; closing her eyes or busying herself, but never looking into his eyes and truly seeing him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES
</p><p id="dia">I'm sorry I've been such a bad mother to you...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard moves to her with sincerity and warmth, carefully removing the pillows behind her and fluffing them.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">You've been... You are...a wonderful mother.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES
</p><p id="dia">It's my fault your life was wasted.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Holding a pillow at each end, he is about to return it to its original position, yet the comment freezes him. For a beat...he's in a tempting position to suffocate her. Yet, he carefully eases her forward, places the pillow behind her, and gently returning his mother to a comfortable position.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES
</p><p id="dia">Willard...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Conflicted, unable to see her so ill and yet anxious to leave the room, he forces a warm smile, as if "yes, mother?"
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES
</p><p id="dia">What an awful name. Willard.
</p><p id="spkdir">(sigh)
</p><p id="dia">If you had a stronger name, Frank Martin wouldn't push you around.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard holds, hurt, aware his mother is not daffy or Alzheimer's demented, rather, unwittingly mean.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES
</p><p id="dia">Or maybe you'd've found a girlfriend if you'd had a more handsome name. Mark or Kyle. 
</p><p id="dia">Clark.
</p><p id="spkdir">(beat)
</p><p id="dia">From now on, Willard, you're name's Clark.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Mrs. Stiles settles back and closes her eyes.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MRS. STILES
</p><p id="dia">Good night, Clark.
</p><p></p><p id="act">As Willard holds in the darkness, stoic, yet wanting to cry...
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">In a queen sized bed, natural shadows created by barred windows fall across Willard, awake. The wind has died. It is QUIET.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Then...from within the ceiling...a PIT-A-PAT is first HEARD in the REAR SPEAKERS Of the theatre. Claws scuttle. CLICK CLICK CLICK. Seemingly moving from rear to forward speakers, as if over the audience.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA CREEPS FORWARD, toward Willard, frozen with anxiety by the tiny scratching claws. As CAMERA REACHES Willard, a beat of silence. Then snap! O.S., in the basement, a rat trap is set off. SNAP! Another. SNAP! SNAP! SNAP!
</p><p></p><p id="act">As Willard slams his eyes shut.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. BASEMENT - MORNING
</p><p></p><p id="act">CLICK! A flashlight beam cuts the darkness. Willard holds at the top of the landing. CAMERA SWEEPS UP the beam revealing Willard's baffled and distraught expression:
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - CELLAR
</p><p></p><p id="act">The dozen traps have all been tripped, however, every one is empty. There is not a dead rat in sight.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He Wants to See You
</p><p></p><p id="act">EXT. FACTORY - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">An old brick and iron decorative arch extends over the walkway to a factory; designated "Martin-Stiles Iron Works." A sub-sign clarifies: "Industrial &amp; Commercial Fences."
</p><p></p><p id="act">On the large sign, "Martin" has clearly been added in recent years and maintained, as has Manufacturing", while "Stiles" has been allowed to oxidize and drips green.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Late, Willard, with a hand-me-down leather accordion briefcase under his arm hustles beneath the archway. An old decorative iron fence frames the factory grounds.
</p><p></p><p id="act">EXT. PARKING LOT - FACTORY - MORNING
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard sighs with dread while checking his cheap watch. Approaching the factory office, he notes...
</p><p></p><p id="act">A PARKING SPACE
</p><p></p><p id="act">A mid-nineties Cadillac is parked in the power spot. A sign on the brick wall declares: RESERVED - MR. MARTIN
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. HALLWAY - ELEVATOR - MORNING
</p><p></p><p id="act">The building was erected during the first world war. 
</p><p></p><p id="act">Perfunctory pastiche renovations have created a sampling of lifeless 20th Century office building decor.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA FOLLOWS the patch of yellowing plastic fluorescent lights leading along a hallway of gray and red speckled linoleum floors and wood paneled walls.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The greasy elevator arrives. A metal door opens before a second wire mesh door can be opened. Willard hustles out and dashes into the hallway.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. OFFICE BULLPEN - MORNING
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard passes through a doorway leading to a shared office with several gray metal desks. Cathryn responds to his awkward charm with a pained, yet sincere smile. She quickly assesses he is being bullied.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CATHRYN
</p><p id="dia">Yeah. It seems no one told Mr. Stiles I would be here.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MS. LEACH
</p><p id="spkdir">(mocking him)
</p><p id="dia">Well, Willard...maybe that's why he wants to see you.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ms. Leach fires her thumb blindly over her shoulder toward a closed door. CAMERA INCHES IN on Willard tensing with intense dread and suppressed anger as his eyes flash toward...
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - THE CLOSED DOOR
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Well above his eye-line, nearly looking down on him, CAMERA LEADS WILLARD toward the door. Cathryn watches him, feeling somehow responsible for his call to the principal's office.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - OFFICE DOOR
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA PUSHES IN... The name FRANK MARTIN growing larger. Willard's hand knocks. After a power pause...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Yeah.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. MR. MARTIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">The door opens revealing FRANK MARTIN, early 60's, eyes down, working at a large desk placed in the power position. Cuff links, suspenders and televangelist hair, Mr. Martin believes he is the top of the pyramid. At a conference of true CEOs, however, he'd be avoided like the plague. An old economy, fold school, embarrassment.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ventures an arm length into the room, clutching the doorknob, while awaiting acknowledgement.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MR. MARTIN
</p><p></p><p id="act">Keeps working, making Willard hang...
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Averts his eyes, then quietly attempts a retreat.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">Who's that at your desk, Willard?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Caught, Willard looks up.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MR. MARTIN
</p><p></p><p id="act">Eyes still on his work, gestures pointedly for Willard to take a seat in one of the leather chairs across his desk.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDER
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard moves like a condemned man trying to maintain a morsel of dignity. He sits. Martin maddeningly busies himself as a means of intimidation...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. MARTIN
</p><p id="dia">Who's that at your desk, I said.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. MARTIN

</p><p></p><p id="act">Out of habit, he clicks the light switch, but it doesn't work. Having placed a flashlight on the top step, he grabs it, CLICKS it on and whips the beam down the stairs.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Suddenly, movement. A small two weeks old white rat with red eyes is caught in the glue trap. However, only the hind legs are stuck and immobilized. The front legs remain free. Desperately scuttling across the floor like an amputee panhandler gone mad on his wheeled cart.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">His head and eyes dart, watching the young rat. The pest situation, his mother, his work seems to boil over. Enough.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He marches into the cellar, grabbing the first lethal tool he finds, a garden hand cultivator with three pointed prongs. As he turns and searches for the rat on the floor...

</p><p></p><p id="act">IN THE FLASHLIGHT BEAM
</p><p></p><p id="act">The light pans up to the hole in the wire mesh. An older, larger white rat, surrounded by a half-dozen young rats looks directly at Willard.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Senses this is the mother of the trapped rat. The mother rat expresses a submissive posture to Willard; ears back and head down, eyes toward him...

</p><p></p><p id="act">While the young rat REEK! REEK! REEKS!, darting in and out of FRAME on the floor, Willard returns to the shelf holding rusted garden tools. HE sets down the hand cultivator, quickly places a pair of work gloves on his hands and turns toward the small white rat.

</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Holding the young, white rat, moves to the opening in the wall and holds before the mother rat and her offspring. Willard raises the white rat and sets it before the mother. The large white rat squeaks while rubbing her head over Socrates.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Fascinated, Willard studies the homecoming. Then, as if wishing to contribute, Willard crosses to the storage shelves. He opens a can of Planter's peanuts.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. MARTIN (O.S.)
</p><p id="dia">My tires've been slashed. Call Brinks.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Just as Willard is about to make a dash toward the front yard, the garage door motors ENGAGE! The garage door begins opening. The car alarm stops.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard desperately cuts toward the side of the garage toward the back yard just as Mr. Martin appears and steps out of the garage, looking out into the front yard.
</p><p></p><p id="act">EXT. SIDE OF GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard moves as fast as he can without making much noise. CAMERA SUDDENLY DROPS DOWN to the ground revealing an area along the side of the house of landscaped gravel. As Willard runs on the crushed stones, CRUNCH! CRUNCH!...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Mr. Martin turns to the rear of the house. As he rounds the corner, he's struck by a strong beam of light -- Martin shields his eyes as he looks to --
</p><p></p><p id="act">A BRINKS PATROL CAR

</p><p></p><p id="act">With that...Willard bolts across the backyard. CAMERA LEADS HIM as he tries to run with the bags. In the darkness, he runs into a chain-linked fence bordering the neighbor's yard.
</p><p></p><p id="act">EXT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">The patrolman shines the light around the neighborhood.

</p><p></p><p id="act">As Willard charges across the neighbor's yard, a dog barks. This is not booming Rommel-like bark. It's the YAP of a Maltese or Jack Russel. Lights turn on inside the house.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The small YAPPING dog appears out of the darkness SNAPS at Willard's heels. Willard continues, searching for a path toward the front yard. He plows through some shrubs...
</p><p></p><p id="act">EXT. MARTIN'S NEIGHBOR'S FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard barrels through the bushes and hustles toward the sidewalk.
</p><p></p><p id="act">SIDEWALK
</p><p></p><p id="act">Sweating and winded, Willard appears on the sidewalk, returning to a quick walk in order to avoid attracting any further attention. He checks behind for any signs of the Brinks patrol, however, they're not yet in sight.
</p><p></p><p id="act">This street is QUIET. Willard eases, until --
</p><p></p><p id="act">THE YAPPING LITTLE DOG
</p><p></p><p id="act">Charges out of the front yard and runs toward Willard.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Picks up his pace. In a moment, the dog is at his heels barking and trying to get at the bags. Willard pushes the dog aside with his leg.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Go.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The dog continues barking, leaping to get at the bags. Willard nudges the dog with his foot.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Get away.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The dog, however, is a tenacious little tyke. Willard's eyes are crazed with a fury of which he did not seem capable.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">YOU WANNA SEE IN THE BAG, MOTHERFUCKER?!
</p><p></p><p id="act">He reaches down and grabs the dog. The bag is opened revealing a DOZEN RATS. The dog is tossed inside the bag and zipped shut.

</p><p id="dia">TEAR IT UP!
</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDER
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard resumes his walk up the pretty street. The bags begin knocking. He struggles to hold them. The dog's tough YAPPING has turned into muffled YELPS.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Pauses. Guilty. He sets the bags down and opens the one holding the rats and dog. The small lap dog springs out of the bag and hauls ass back toward its house.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDE - THE STREET
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard, a macabre form carrying the bags, continues up the street. He turns to the right and vanishes down another block. Up the road, on an intersecting street, a Brinks patrol car appears, slows, and not seeing anyone on the street, continues. As the neighborhood returns to SILENCE.

</p><p id="dia">Someone broke into Martin's garage last night, slashed his tires and peed on the floor.

</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA HOLDS on Willard, pleased. In fact, at this point, having always SHOT WILLARD above eye level, now slowly, eerily, DROPS BELOW EYE LEVEL. It underlies his NEW SENSE OF CONFIDENCE AND POWER.

</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDER - THE OFFICE

</p><p id="dia">No, sir.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The employees follow much the same example and return to work while Mr. Martin eyes them like a street fighter whose just kicked some ass and postures "Anyone else want some?"

</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard cautiously checks over his shoulder. He's the only person at the service. He removes Socrates from his coat pocket and holds him out toward the head of the casket.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MRS. STILES
</p><p></p><p id="act">Socrates brushes his nose against her dead face.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD

</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDER - CASKET

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CATHRYN (O.S.)

</p><p></p><p id="act">Startled, he thinks quickly, places Socrates inside the casket. Willard eyes over his shoulder, then back to the coffin.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="spkdir">(whispers)
</p><p id="dia">In.
</p><p></p><p id="act">SOCRATES
</p><p></p><p id="act">Waddles deep into the casket, disappearing into the dark toward Mrs. Stiles' feet.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD &amp; CATHRYN
</p><p></p><p id="act">He turns just as she carefully approaches the casket.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CATHRYN
</p><p id="dia">Are you alright? I didn't mean to upset you.
</p><p></p><p id="act">With residual startle, he shakes his head and guides her away from the coffin and to the chairs. They sit.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">You didn't have to come here.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CATHRYN
</p><p id="dia">We didn't hear from you and I wanted to make sure you're okay. To let you know...you have a friend.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard is caught off guard and sincerely touched. His eyes begin to well, bringing tears to his eyes. She reaches out and softly caresses his face.
</p><p></p><p id="act">This may be the first time he's ever been touched in such a way. As he begins to close his eyes and cherish the moment, his eyes freeze. Never fully closing.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - MR. MARTIN
</p><p></p><p id="act">Enters, appearing annoyed and put upon. He moves to the casket.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD &amp; CATHRYN
</p><p></p><p id="act">As Willard hatefully looks off, Cathryn turns to see Mr. Martin. Sparing them further hassle, she pulls her hand away.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CASKET
</p><p></p><p id="act">Mrs. Stiles rests in the f.g., just beneath the closed half of the casket lid hides Socrates. Martin ENTERS FRAME, takes a perfunctory look and moves off.
</p><p></p><p id="act">FUNERAL HOME
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard and Cathryn avert their eyes as Martin approaches. Dismissive, he eyes Willard, then, somewhat lasciviously, eyes Cathryn.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. MARTIN
</p><p id="dia">Shouldn't you be working?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CATHRYN

</p><p id="dia">Hell of a way to spend it, huh?
</p><p></p><p id="act">He looks to Willard, who doesn't look back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. MARTIN
</p><p id="dia">She's better off, Willard.
</p><p id="spkdir">(a dig at Willard)
</p><p id="dia">She's with your dad.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard doesn't acknowledge this in any manner. Behind Mr. Martin, a man, JOSEPH GARTER, Mr. Martin's age, suit and tie enters and moves to the casket paying a brief moment of respect. The man looks toward Willard while...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. MARTIN
</p><p id="dia">What now? Gonna sell the house?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard shrugs, then with false altruism...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. MARTIN
</p><p id="dia">Give it some thought. Take the rest of the day off.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He pats Willard on the leg, shoots Cathryn a jilted look and moves out of the funeral parlor. Cathryn places a sympathetic hand on Willard's back, however, before any words are exchanged about Mr. Martin's behavior, they're approached by Mr. Garter.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">Willard Stiles?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard looks up, nods.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER

</p><p id="dia">Can I come over after work? Check up on you?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">I'll be okay. Thanks, Cat.
</p><p></p><p id="act">She gives him an awkward hug, then moves off while Mr. Garter turns a chair around to face Willard.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">Willard, I'm afraid I have some news... I don't know if you're aware of or prepared for.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard reacts, puzzled.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">Your parents had been living off an account they had originally set up for your future. It was intended to be yours upon their passing.
</p><p id="spkdir">(beat)
</p><p id="dia">However, your father's death left debts that even Mr. Martin's buy out didn't completely relieve.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard tenses.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">In fact, there remains pending litigation on some unsettled debts.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">I still have the house?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">Your mother refinanced the house after your father's death, so, in fact, we still owe...
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard's devastated.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">We? It's my house.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">Of course, you grew up there. It's your home, but it is the bank's house.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">It's my house.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">There's no need for a single man to live in such a large house. Sell it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Why do I have to pay for what things my parents did?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">The money will help you start over.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Start over?! I'm almost done!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">Willard, you have no choice. As the executor...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Then why...why'd you come here?! Why do you even bother telling me?! Do you get off on telling me I have no control over my own life?! I have no money. No home. And it's not my fault!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Mr. Garter stands and reaches for his business card.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">This is not the time or place. Think about it. Then please, you have to contact me.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard snaps the card out of Mr. Garter's hand.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MR. GARTER
</p><p id="dia">I understand, Willard, however, this is the only way you can take control of your own life.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard sighs, settles. Mr. Garter takes a beat, assured that Willard has composed, then moves out of the room. Willard stands and moves toward his mother's casket.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Socrates.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Socrates appears from behind the bottom lid and scuttles to Willard who picks him up and holds the rat against his cheek. As Willard looks to his mother, he notes movement O.S.
</p><p></p><p id="act">THROUGH STAINED GLASS WINDOW
</p><p></p><p id="act">Mr. Martin's form holds in the parking lot. He is motioned by another form who shakes Martin's hand. It's Mr. Garter.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Moves to the window for a better look. Although distorted and oblique through the stained glass, Mr. Garter's posture conveys he is reporting to Mr. Martin. Garter gestures with a thumb toward Willard in the funeral parlor. Mr. Martin nods, pleased. The two men shake hands.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">As he watches out the window, Socrates held to his cheek.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Tears open the sealed envelope holding his father's personal affects. A ring, wallet. Holding a leather billfold with reverence, his eyes well with tears looking at the driver's license, a photo of Mrs. Stiles and a photo of Willard.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Hesitating, he removes a Swiss Army knife from the package and opens the blade. Along the edge is a line of brown stained blood. Willard untucks his shirt and rubs the blade. The blood is gone.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA INCHES INTO WILLARD. Holding the knife and considering the blade. His father's act. Willard places the knife tip against his wrist... Until Socrates races from Willard's shoulder and rushes down his arm.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S HANDS
</p><p></p><p id="act">The right hand holds the knife tip against the left wrist. Socrates ENTERS FRAME and nips Willard's fingers.

</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">The image and Ben's presence disturbs him. He turns and begins moving out of the dark office.
</p><p></p><p id="act">About to exit, Willard pauses. Looking to an umbrella stand holding several antique umbrellas and swagger sticks. As he reaches out, raises one of the wooden swagger sticks for examination, then subtly looks back at Ben.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Once secured, he CLICKS off the light. The room turns dark, CAMERA CREEPS IN ON WILLARD. Listening... In the B.G., the door opens, intruder unseen.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard's eyes check the door. He remains still. Listening. Then, faintly, against the hardwood floor, CLICK CLICK CLICK of nails and the sliding of an approaching tail.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard stealthily reaches beneath the pillows and grabs the swagger stick's silver tip.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The sheets tug toward the foot of the bed.
</p><p></p><p id="act">FOOT OF THE BED

</p><p></p><p id="act">Waits a beat, then, slowly and carefully extends his arm and reaches beneath the pillow. Willard reacts, puzzled. He digs deeper beneath the pillows, but apparently can't find the swagger stick. His eyes move toward the right side of the bed. Willard reacts, afraid...

</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD

</p><p></p><p id="act">Cathryn looks desperately toward Finch as Willard's SCREAMS can be heard in the house.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DETECTIVE FINCH
</p><p id="dia">I ain't settin' foot in there. There's, like, thousand fuckin' rats.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cathryn moves toward the door, struggling with the doorknob.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DETECTIVE FINCH
</p><p id="dia">Hey, you want to get eaten alive?
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA SWEEPS IN ON CATHRYN, realizing...

</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard throws his hands over and behind his neck, pulling off his coat. With rats clinging to the coat, Willard whips it against the hard marble atop the island...again and again. Rats squeal and squish.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Dropping the coat, he retreats against the cabinets. He freezes with shock at something O.S., CAMERA RUSHES INTO WILLARD...
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - THE ISLAND
</p><p></p><p id="act">The trap is still there, encircled by blood. Ben, however, is gone. Only his forearm remains, in the trap.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Breaks for the back door. He tugs on the handle, it won't open.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - DOOR FRAME
</p><p></p><p id="act">Nails are hammered into frame. Fortifying the house to keep the rats out...he's locked himself in.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">He turns toward the front of the kitchen. 
</p><p></p><p id="act">KITCHEN - WILLARD'S POV
</p><p></p><p id="act">The hardwood floor rolls in waves of fur...toward him.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Summons the courage.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard makes a desperate dash toward the dining room.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S FEET AND LEGS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Teeth. Claws. Hairless tails whip and snap at him. Several rats are crushed by the impact of his feet.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">The dividing door BANGS open! Willard charges inside, grabs a chair and SMASHES the bay window.
</p><p></p><p id="act">DINING ROOM/FOYER DOOR
</p><p></p><p id="act">Barricaded by the upended dining room table...LURCHES from the force of the rats on the other side.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Moves to the bay window...and meets the security bars. He clutches them, tugs and pulls with all his might. They will not move. CAMERA PUSHES INTO WILLARD.

</p><p id="dia">Cathryn!

</p><p id="dia">Help me...
</p><p></p><p id="act">EXT. WILLARD'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cathryn continues backing away...afraid of him.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard yanks on the bars. Inside the dining room, a loud crack. Willard turns.
</p><p></p><p id="act">DINING ROOM CEILING
</p><p></p><p id="act">A crack extends from the chandelier outward and across the ceiling, which appears to sag.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CHANDELIER
</p><p></p><p id="act">Begins to sway. Then, inside the crystal column in the chandelier, a rat crawls from the inner ceiling. Another follows. The chandelier begins filling with rats.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Reacts, horrified. O.S., a screech on the floor.
</p><p></p><p id="act">UPTURNED TABLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">Marauding rats break through from the foyer.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CHANDELIER
</p><p></p><p id="act">The crystal shatters. The chandelier chain SNAPS. The fixture falls. RATS pour from the hole in the ceiling.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Attempts one final tug on the bars. They do not budge. He turns and breaks across the dining room to the foyer.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard charges up the steps, several at a time...
</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSE - STAIRS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rats snap and bite at his feet.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard reaches the upstairs landing. He looks down the hall toward his bedroom.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. WILLARD'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">The shadows of the confining bars ripple upon the curtains.
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard continues toward the second flight of the stairs...
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. THIRD FLOOR LANDING - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard reaches the landing and races immediately toward a closed door...
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. MR. STILES' HOME OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">The door bangs open; dust particles swirl. Willard appears and holds. CAMERA SWEEPS IN ON his expression of hope at something, O.S.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S POV - DORMER WINDOW
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the yellow stained glass window, a shaft of golden light filtering inside, underlined by the dust particles. It's small, but large enough to crawl through...
</p><p></p><p id="act">INT. MR. STILES' HOME OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard races toward the light, plants his foot on the
</p><p></p><p id="act">bookcase and rises toward the window...
</p><p></p><p id="act">WINDOW
</p><p></p><p id="act">The yellow light FILLS THE FRAME, until the black silhouette quickly blocks the light...the silhouette of a large armless rat. BEN.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD
</p><p></p><p id="act">Holds, afraid.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WILLARD
</p><p id="dia">Ben...I thought we were friends.
</p><p></p><p id="act">BEN
</p><p></p><p id="act">Beat. Then, Ben hisses! SNAPS INTO CAMERA!
</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDER
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard's back is to CAMERA as BEN BITES into Willard's face. Willard's hands clamp onto the bookcase, struggling to free himself of Ben's violent grasp.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WILLARD'S FEET
</p><p></p><p id="act">Slip from the bookcase, dangling. Rats begin chewing through his feet and legs.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WIDER
</p><p></p><p id="act">Willard continues struggling, however, as CAMERA PULLS BACK to REVEAL the rising tide of rats spilling in from the walls and doorway, it is apparent Willard's struggle will be short and futile.
</p><p></p><p id="act">EXT. WILLARD'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cathryn, street level, is looking up, as are the two officers. O.S., Willard's muffled and desperate screams can be heard, growing louder as CAMERA BEGINS TO RISE up the house.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The rain POURS and the wind BLOWS as CAMERA continues CRANING UP THE HOUSE. Upon reaching the second level...Willard's screams cease. Only the rain and wind remain.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CAMERA CONTINUES RISING and PUSHING CLOSER to the top level until the exterior of the yellow stained glass Dormer window once again FILLS THE FRAME AND CAMERA HOLDS...
</p><p></p><p id="act">After a beat, Ben's silhouette climbs into the window, licking his wound. As the black form holds against the gold light and turns toward CAMERA, drum sticks CLACK introducing Pearl Jam's "RATS", which continues over a slow...
