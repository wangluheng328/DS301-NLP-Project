In London, after investigating crack addicted junkies for an article in her newspaper, the journalist Amy Klein watches a bizarre videotape.
Her editor Charles Richmond received the footage of an underground group of youngsters in Bucharest apparently becoming zombies through the power of their leader Winter from a member, Marla, and invites Amy to prepare the story.
Amy accepts the challenge, and once in Romania, she finds Marla dead with a puzzle cube in her hands.
She brings the object to her hotel room, and opens it, beginning her journey to hell.
