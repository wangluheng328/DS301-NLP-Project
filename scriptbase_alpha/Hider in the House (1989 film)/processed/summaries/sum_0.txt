A deranged man, Tom Sykes, hides out in the attic while an unsuspecting couple (Rogers & McKean) and their family carry on their life in the house below.
Once Tom stops just hiding out and becomes involved with the family and, in particular, the wife, the problems begin.
An original USA made for cable movie.
