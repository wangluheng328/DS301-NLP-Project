        EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

        On a very lovely street in a very nice neighborhood, Tom
        Sykes, THE HIDER, is out for a walk.  The Hider is a man
        who blends in well with his surroundings.  A good-looking
        man in his thirties.  To look at him, you wouldn't know
        there was anything wrong...

        The Hider walks with such strange grace that he could be
        on a conveyor belt, a variety of neighborhood houses
        passing him by, one style after another.

        Sunlight and shadow play over the Hider's face as he walks,
        filtered through the lush trees and greenery all around.

        Then the hedge he's walking past ends and the next house
        makes him stop.  Because it isn't a house yet.  It's a
        half-house.  A house under reconstruction.  Part built,
        part torn down, part finished, part matchstick frame.  An
        evolving house, with a swarm of workmen all over it,
        hammering, sawing, drilling.

        The Hider stands and watches awhile.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. THE HOUSE - EVENING

        The workmen have gone.  The Hider enters the house from the
        back where it's all completely open without doors or
        windows.


        INT. THE HOUSE

        The Hider explores in the waning light.  There are building
        materials about.  He runs his hand over a pile of bricks.
        He looks at some wooden boards and planks leaning against
        a wall.  WIND HOWLS through the dark house.

        He tries the tap on a newly installed sink.  Water gushes
        out.

        Where the main stairway will be is now only a ladder.  The
        Hider climbs it to the next floor.  There are a number of
        rooms; a hallway to more rooms.  On a worktable are some
        plans and blueprints.  The Hider looks at them.

        Behind a door is a narrow little stairway.  The Hider goes
        up it to --


        THE ATTIC

        A fairly large attic, with a small window at one end.  The
        attic is a part of the house that has remained pretty much
        untouched.

        The Hider looks up.


        EXT. THE ROOF

        A trap door is opened.  The Hider climbs out from the
        attic.  He surveys the scene from up here.  Below in the
        backyard there's an empty swimming pool, a partially
        completed patio, piles of dirt.

        Because the house itself has many curves and corners and
        levels, so does the roof.  The Hider jumps down to another
        section and teeters for a moment where there's a gaping
        hole (where the skylight will be).  He catches himself.
        The hole goes right through the house all the way to the
        ground floor.


        INT. THE ATTIC

        The Hider drops back in from the roof.  He goes to the
        small window and looks out over the front street and
        neighborhood.  The Hider feels tired.  He lies down on the
        attic floor and curls up.

        MAIN TITLES BEGIN.

                                                   CUT TO:


        <u>MONTAGE</u> - EXT./INT. MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

        In which we SEE the gradual progress of the house as it
        grows toward completion -- juxtaposed with the activities
        of the Hider as he follows his own secret agenda:

        We SEE builders carefully fit a big skylight into place
        over that hole in the roof.

        We SEE how the Hider spends his days -- in a library,
        studying diagrams in a book on Home Improvements.

        We SEE him in the house at night, up in the attic, working
        on the floor in some way, hunched so we can't see.  He's
        draped a black cloth over the attic window and is
        surrounded by candles.

        We SEE the house taking shape.  Carpenters finishing a
        staircase.

        We SEE the Hider eating alone in a simple cafeteria.

        We SEE the back of the house at night.  The Hider appears
        over the edge of the roof, rappelling down on a rope,
        making little toeholds in the wall as he goes.  CHINK-CHINK
        with a small hammer, the SOUND MUFFLED by cloth.  The house
        is quite private from the view of its neighbors, and the
        section of wall the Hider has chosen for his secret ladder
        is further shadowed by being an indented corner.

        We SEE plumbers at work and painters arrive.

        We SEE the Hider cashing his disability insurance check at
        a check-cashing place.

        We SEE the house further along.  Painters painting.
        Electricians wiring.  Landscape gardeners planting.

        We SEE the Hider returning to the house at night, emerging
        out of shadows.  He goes to his special corner, looking
        around -- and starts climbing.  His hands and shoes finding
        the chinks in the wall only he knows are there.  In LONG
        SHOT, if we see the figure climbing fly-like up the side
        of the house at all, it's only because we know he's there.

        We SEE locksmiths installing locks on doors.  Not that it
        will do any good now.

        We SEE the Hider drop silently to the ground at night.
        Newly planted vines help hide his descent even more and
        cause natural shadows to move on the side of the house in
        the breeze of the night.  The Hider walks down into the
        empty pool.  He stands in the middle of it.  There's a full
        moon.  The Hider spreads his arms as if to float backwards.

        SPLASH!  We SEE the Hider backstroking off one end of a
        long swimming pool.  He rolls in the water and swims to the
        other end where he climbs out.  The Hider is strong and
        powerfully built.  He retrieves a towel from a bench.  The
        towel says "YMCA."

        We SEE the Hider at his YMCA locker, after having a shower.
        Inside is everything he owns in the world.  The locker is
        <u>packed</u> with stuff.

        We SEE the house nearing completion.  Two men with
        clipboards walk around, checking final details.

        They go up to the attic.  Everything looks fine.  They go
        back down, closing the attic stairway door.

        We SEE the Hider at a booth in a coffee shop, sketching a
        diagram in a notebook while he eats.

        We SEE the house is done.  And here the MAIN TITLES PAUSE.
        Because we are almost at the end of our set-up now.  Just
        one more important job to be taken care of.


        EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

        It's RAINING.  The house is all finished.  There are no
        more trucks parked on the street.  No more rubble in the
        driveway.  Nothing abnormal to set the house apart from any
        others on the street.  The house is still and peaceful in
        the rain and part of the neighborhood.


        EXT. BACKYARD

        The swimming pool has now been filled with water.  And
        RAINDROPS pound into it.


        INT. THE HOUSE

        The rooms are stark and empty.  White walls.  Shiny wood
        floors.  Light reflected off their smooth surfaces.  Coming
        through the bare windowpanes.


        RECEPTION HALL

        Here by the solid front door, the house is an invitation.
        The hallway leading deeper in.  Doors to rooms.  The
        stairway to the next landing.  The skylight over all, RAIN
        spattering up there on the thick glass.

        The only other NOISE, indistinct, is coming from the attic.


        THE ATTIC

        The Hider has the house to himself now.  He's finishing his
        wall -- a false wall at the far end of the attic.  The real
        wall goes straight for a while then juts off at an angle
        to form a sort of alcove.  The Hider has bricked off this
        alcove, giving the illusion of one straight wall running
        the length of the attic.


        THE ATTIC - LATER

        The rain has stopped.  Now the Hider is plastering his
        wall.


        THE ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOON

        The Hider is taking a breather.  He stands looking out of
        the small attic window as he eats a sandwich.  To the
        right, he sees a NASTY NEIGHBOR yell at some Kids who've
        come to retrieve their ball from his property.  The Nasty
        Neighbor kicks the ball away as hard as he can.  On the
        left, a car pulls into the driveway of the other
        neighboring house.  A mother (the NICE NEIGHBOR) bringing
        her kids home from school -- a Boy and a Girl.  Another boy
        comes by on a bike, pausing to talk to the first Boy.  At
        a house across the street, the Hider hears a DOOR SHUT and
        sees a Cleaning Woman in a white uniform walk away along
        a path.


        THE ATTIC - NIGHT

        The Hider stands back to look over his handiwork.  The
        false wall is now indistinguishable from the real wall.
        Such a good job that one wonders why the Hider built it,
        why he's cut off the extra space behind it, apparently
        without access...

        ... but wait.  He's made a secret panel in the floor.  By
        pushing down in a certain way then sliding away a section
        of floorboard, a hole is revealed, cut large enough to fit
        him like a coffin.  He lies in it, covering himself up with
        the sliding floorboard again, which CLICKS neatly back into
        place, and --


        BEHIND THE FALSE WALL

        -- as he rolls under the wall, coming up out of a similar
        trap on the other side.  He slides a floorboard cover into
        place over it.  He pulls down a foam mattress that he's cut
        to size and blankets from where they've been hooked up.
        He props up two pillows in place and sits against the front
        wall beyond which is the street.  He looks over his
        shoulder, pulling the lever of a second vent he's installed
        in this wall for air and to enable him to look out over the
        street.  Across the way, a mailman delivers mail to houses.
        A woman walking her dog says hello to the mailman.  The
        Hider looks forward again.  He's made a shelf or two for
        himself.  There are a few books, some snacks, a Thermos and
        plastic bottles of water.  He has a few other things.  He
        has a lantern and a flashlight.

        The space here is big enough for him to lie down with his
        arms at his sides, or to stand comfortably.  Like a monk
        in his cell, it's a room of his own.


        THE ATTIC - DAY

        Silent.  Empty.  The Hider behind the wall.


        EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

        Oh, and one last thing... a "FOR SALE" sign out in front.

        MAIN TITLES END.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. A KEY - DAY

        Turning in the front door.


        INT. THE HOUSE

        A REAL-ESTATE LADY comes in with a Yuppie Couple.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  -- and it's been done up so
                  beautifully, you're lucky to be
                  the first people to look at it.
                  It's my personal favorite of all
                  of our homes.

        They step into the light of the reception area, their heads
        turning up instinctively to the skylight.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        The Hider looks tense.  And displeased.  His privacy has
        been disturbed.  There are strangers in his house.


        INT. KITCHEN - DAY

        FOOTSTEPS approaching.

                                WOMAN'S VOICE
                  -- then there's the kitchen, which
                  has been entirely remodelled.

        She comes in and we SEE that it's a SECOND REAL-ESTATE
        LADY -- with an Older Couple this time.

        The wife goes to the sink and turns the tap.  She jumps
        back in fright as it SPITS violently and no water comes
        out.

                                SECOND REAL-ESTATE LADY
                         (going over)
                  That's strange.  I what
                  could be wrong here.


        INT. BATHROOM - DAY

        Another Couple have tried a tap, and this time the faucet
        has <u>burst</u> -- exploding water at them.


        INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

        Ouch!  A Single Man scratches his arm on a nasty splinter
        as he goes through a doorway.


        EXT. PATIO - DAY

        As he comes out, the door now comes unhinged, falling on
        him.


        INT. MAIN STAIRWAY - DAY

        Two Men are led upstairs.  Along the way, one of them
        notices a large patch of dampness on the wall and brings
        it to the attention of his friend.


        EXT. THE ROOF

        Spreadeagled on the roof as he peeks down through the
        skylight... the Hider.


        INT. HALLWAY - DAY

        A Black Couple are being taken through the house.  Suddenly
        the wife notices something on the floor as they pass -- a
        "Roach Motel."  She and her husband look at each other
        distastefully.


        INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

        The Hider looks over a display of meat.  He selects a
        steak.


        INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

        The Hider puts the steak away -- underneath the floor of
        a room.


        INT. HALLWAY - DAY

        A Fat Couple are sniffing the air as they follow a
        REAL-ESTATE MAN.  The Real-Estate Man opens the door to a
        room -- and a <u>cascade of flies</u> swarms out.


        EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

        The Fat Couple hurry out, handkerchiefs over their noses,
        chased by the upset Real-Estate Man.

                                REAL-ESTATE MAN
                  -- in all new houses there are
                  certain kinks to be ironed out.

        CRANE UP to that vent in the wall at the very top of the
        house.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        He watches the Fat Couple leaving.  His expression says:
        "Yeah, that's it, go away, go away, you awful people."

                                                  CUT TO:


        EXT. THE STREET - DAY

        A car approaches the house.


        INT. AN UPSTAIRS ROOM

        The Hider is lying on the floor in a patch of sunlight.
        When he hears the CAR PARK and DOORS OPEN, he stands up in
        one quick movement and goes to the side of the window.


        EXT. HOUSE

        The original Real-Estate Lady has come out of the car.
        While from the other side of the car emerges --


        JULIE DREYER

        A beautiful woman.  She gets out of the car with an
        extraordinary grace.

        She smooths her skirt with one light brush of her hand.
        She turns to look at the house, afternoon sunlight falling
        on one side of her face.


        THE HIDER

        His face moving closer to the window, though keeping to the
        side in shadow.


        THE HIDER'S FACE

        A look we haven't seen before.  A look of fascination.
        He's smitten.


        JULIE DREYER

        Walking toward the house now, glancing gently from side to
        side, almost gliding.


        THE HIDER

        steps back from the window, instinctively neatening his
        hair.


        INT. DOWNSTAIRS

        The front door opens and the Real-Estate Lady and Julie
        come in.

                                JULIE
                  It's been on the market a while,
                  hasn't it?

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  Not very long.  There have been
                  a couple of bids already.

                                JULIE
                  Because it caught my eye when it
                  was in a higher price bracket in
                  the listings.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  Oh, yes, well, you know, when
                  developers remodel a house they
                  often overestimate their costs at
                  first.  It's not like it's been
                  marked down or anything.

                                JULIE
                         (a sly look)
                  Just reduced.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                         (concedes with a
                          shrug)
                  Sometimes they prefer a quicker
                  return on their investment.

                                JULIE
                  This is a terrific entrance hall,
                  What a welcoming feeling.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  Isn't it?

        Julie steps on a floorboard that CREAKS, but it doesn't
        seem to bother her.  It's clear her first impressions of
        the house are very good.


        INT. UPSTAIRS - DAY

        Julie and the Real-Estate Lady come up.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  You'll see that there's really
                  much more space than the average
                  three bedroom.

                                JULIE
                  Oh, space!  -- You said the right
                  thing.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  How large is your brood?

                                JULIE
                  Two -- three if you count the
                  husband.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  We must <u>always</u> count the husband.
                  By my count there've been... four.
                  But I still live in hope.

        Julie is looking around, still liking what she sees.  She
        goes into the room the Hider was in.


        INT. ROOM

        Of course he's not here now.  Julie walks around the
        room.

                                JULIE
                  Well, Phil wasn't sure he wanted
                  us to be this far outside the
                  city.  But we have friends around
                  here and something told me I
                  should take a look at this house.
                  I want to be somewhere surrounded
                  by <u>green</u>.

        The window the Hider was at has been opened, the
        branch of a tree swaying outside it, and Julie takes a
        breath, the air fresh and sweet.

                                JULIE
                         (continuing)
                  ... I just had a feeling.

        She walks around the room, almost a waltz in beauty.  She
        comes to the closet.  She opens the door and looks in, left
        and right.  It's quite empty.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        Above the front bedroom that Julie is in.  The Hider is
        crouched on the floor, a look of contentment on his face.
        his cheek against the wood like a caress.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

        The Hider is sitting in a chair.

                                THERAPIST
                  How's the new place?

                                HIDER
                  It's great.  It's clean and airy
                  and quiet -- there are trees and
                  flowers.  There's still some
                  fixing up I have to do, but it's
                  coming along.

                                THERAPIST
                  And the rent is okay?

                                HIDER
                  Oh, it's nothing.  No problem.
                  I was really lucky to find this
                  place.

                                THERAPIST
                  All right then.  That's important,
                  isn't it?  -- For you to be in an
                  "up" environment.  I'm saying you
                  should literally take that as your
                  <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean?
                  It's something positive that
                  you've accomplished -- even if you
                  were forced by circumstance --
                  something for you to build upon.

                                HIDER
                         (nodding)
                  Right.

                                THERAPIST
                  And what about work?  Have you had
                  any more thoughts about what you'd
                  like to be doing now?

                                HIDER
                  Well, I've been doing a little
                  independent contracting, some
                  carpentry here and there, y'know,
                  do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I
                  still find it very soothing.

                                THERAPIST
                  I'm happy that you're working
                  again.  As long as it comes
                  naturally, that's terrific.
                  You've always liked working with
                  your hands, haven't you?

                                HIDER
                  Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had
                  a woodwork class once when I
                  was... in school that time.  Then
                  I learned a lot more when I was
                  in the --

                                THERAPIST
                  -- hospital.

                                HIDER
                  -- institution.

                                THERAPIST
                  Right.
                         (shuffles paper)
                  So, you have a new place, you've
                  started working a bit -- I'm sure
                  you'll be meeting some new people.

                                HIDER
                  Actually, I have met someone.
                  There's a woman I think I like.

                                THERAPIST
                  Oh, good -- well, I hope you'll
                  have more to tell me next time.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. ATTIC STAIRWAY - DAY

        A twelve-year-old boy, NEIL DREYER, rushes up the steps to
        the attic.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        The Hider watches through the vent as Neil runs around the
        attic in a circle then runs out again.


        DOWNSTAIRS

        Neil runs down the stairs and past Julie, who's with the
        Real-Estate Lady, and past --


        PHIL DREYER

        Husband and father, who turns around as Neil zooms past.

                                PHIL
                  Neil, calm down.

                                JULIE
                  Neil, don't leave the back doors
                  open -- I don't want Holly near
                  the pool.

                                PHIL
                  We'd have to get one of those
                  sliding covers for the pool.

        The Real-Estate Lady glances with a smile at HOLLY DREYER,
        five years old, wandering around in the next room.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  Yes -- they're quite inexpensive
                  and easy to install.

                                PHIL
                         (taking Julie aside,
                          to Real-Estate Lady)
                  Do you mind if we --

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  Please -- take as much time as you
                  want.

        The Real-Estate Lady goes to be with Holly while Phil leads
        Julie into the living room.  On the way, Julie happens to
        notice that the creaking floorboard doesn't anymore.


        LIVING ROOM

        Phil paces around.

                                PHIL
                  <u>Julie</u>, I just don't think we can
                  afford this house.

        ZOOM to an air-conditioning vent in a wall behind them.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        The Hider is listening on an <u>intercom</u> he's obviously set
        up.

                                HIDER
                         (mouths the word to
                          himself)
                  ... "Julie"...


        INT. LIVING ROOM

        Julie remains still and calm as she watches her husband
        walk nervously around her.

                                JULIE
                  I hear what you're saying, but I
                  know what you're thinking.

                                PHIL
                  What?

                                JULIE
                  You're thinking exactly what I
                  thought when I first saw this
                  house,

                                PHIL
                  What's that?

                                JULIE
                  This -- is -- the -- one -- for
                  -- us.

                                PHIL
                  Stop knowing me so well.

                                JULIE
                  I know it's at the high end of our
                  range --

                                PHIL
                  High end?  Honey, it's a whole new
                  budget.

                                JULIE
                  But it's what we want.

                                PHIL
                  You wanted furniture too, didn't
                  you?

                                JULIE
                  They don't expect to get what
                  they're asking.  Let's make an
                  offer.

                                PHIL
                  You want me to bargain at the high
                  end of our range?  -- I'll have
                  a stroke.  I've got to save all
                  my sweat for my meeting in three
                  weeks.

                                JULIE
                  You could have a pool to cool off
                  in.

                                PHIL
                         (looks out at pool,
                          nodding)
                  It's a nice pool, isn't it?

                                JULIE
                  And it's a shorter commute.

                                PHIL
                  It'll be even shorter if I get
                  that new job.  Come on.

        Phil takes her hand and walk out of the room.


        EXT. POOL - DAY

        Neil kneels by the pool, splashing his hand in the water.


        JULIE AND PHIL

        Standing back further in the garden, regarding the house
        from this viewpoint.  Little Holly plays on the grass near
        them.

                                JULIE
                  Let's do it.  Take a
                  breath and -- and if we're
                  over our heads, well, we'll
                  sell it.  Philip, this <u>is</u> our
                  house.  You know it is.  It's our
                  house.

        Phil is nodding to himself now, her enthusiasm turning him
        on.  Finally he gives in.

                                PHIL
                  All right, but look, we can't say
                  anything to this shark lady now,
                  okay?  We have to play it real
                  cool.


        OTHER SIDE OF FENCE

        The Nasty Neighbor, watering his yard, notices them,
        particularly Julie, and stares.


        JULIE AND PHIL

        Starting back to the house.

                                JULIE
                  What if someone else buys it in
                  the meantime?

                                PHIL
                  Honey, nobody buys a house
                  overnight -- if someone else comes
                  back at them, well, we might have
                  to make a counter offer.  But we
                  can't look too eager or we'll get
                  screwed.


        THE POOL

        The Real-Estate Lady stands by Neil.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  So you've seen a lot of houses
                  then?

                                NEIL
                  Yeah, a bunch, but my mom really
                  likes this one.  She was all
                  excited when she saw it and got
                  my dad all excited when she told
                  him about it.  He's sick of
                  looking already.


        JULIE AND PHIL

        Strolling back, trying to look cool.

                                NEIL
                  Are we gonna buy this house?

                                PHIL
                  Do you have enough money?

                                JULIE
                         (to the Real-Estate
                          Lady)
                  We're going to think about it.

                                PHIL
                  It's very nice, but it's still a
                  little pricey for us.

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                         (as they go back
                          inside)
                  Well, Mr. Dreyer, I don't have to
                  tell you what an important
                  investment a house is.

                                PHIL
                  Actually, I never recommend
                  property to my clients as merely
                  a good investment.  There are
                  bonds that can serve just as well.
                  A house for me is a place I want
                  to live and raise my family in.


        INT. DOWNSTAIRS ROOM

        There's something shiny on the floor.  We HEAR them COMING
        BACK in.  Holly appears, notices the shiny thing, comes to
        pick it up.


        INT. HALLWAY

        Holly comes running out of the room.

                                HOLLY
                  Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

        Julie sweeps her daughter up in her arms.

                                HOLLY
                         (continuing)
                  I found a cent!

                                JULIE
                  "Find a penny, pick it up, all day
                  long you'll have good luck!"


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        Straining to hear the SOFTLY CRACKLING VOICES on his
        intercom, he's thrilled that she got the point and shares
        common folklore with him.  He goes "<u>Yeah</u>!" to himself.


        INT. DOWNSTAIRS

        Holly shows the Real-Estate Lady the penny.

                                HOLLY
                  Look at my coin!

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  Must be a good omen, sugar.

        As if on cue, some birds alight on a sunny windowsill
        nearby and start chirping.  Julie is delighted, turning
        Holly to show her.

                                JULIE
                  Must be.


        NEIL

        tugs his father's arm.

                                NEIL
                  Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf
                  gets to look too!

                                PHIL
                         (to Real-Estate Lady)
                  Would you mind if Rudolf had a
                  look too?

                                REAL-ESTATE LADY
                  By all means, let's Rudolf's
                  opinion.

        Neil flings open the front door -- and Rudolf comes
        charging in -- barking!


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        The Hider's eyes go wide in alarm.


        INT. HOUSE

        Rudolf races right up the stairs!


        UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

        Rudolf rushes toward the attic doorway, his paws sliding
        on the new floor.  He barks.


        DOWNSTAIRS

        Phil shouts upstairs:

                                PHIL
                  Rudolf, get down here!

        WOOF-WOOF!  Rudolf reappears. comes charging downstairs,
        goes running right through the house and --


        EXT. BACK PATIO

        The stupid dog runs right outside and jumps straight in the
        pool.

                                HOLLY
                  Oh, gross!

                                NEIL
                  It's okay -- Rudolf likes the
                  house!

                                PHIL
                  Hey, c'mon now, get him out of
                  there!  -- This isn't our house
                  yet.


        EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

        The family is leaving. Phil whispering an aside to Julie.

                                PHIL
                  How were we -- were we cool?

                                JULIE
                  Paul Newman in "The Hustler."

                                PHIL
                  Good -- that's what I was trying
                  to project.


        JULIE

        takes a last look over her shoulder, noticing more birds
        at another window.  A lyrical scene that charms her.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        Lying looking out his vent at her, the Hider bites his hand
        with glee.

        CAMERA PANS BACK from him to his shelf... where sits a
        packet of bird seed.

        EXT. THE HOUSE - EVENING

        The Hider, walking by again, sees that a "SOLD" sticker has
        been plastered onto the "FOR SALE" sign.

        INT. APPLIANCE STORE - DAY

        The Hider is looking at <u>telephones</u>.  He chooses one to buy.

        INT. THE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

        The Hider is in the house.  Doing something at a telephone
        jack.  Then we SEE him unreeling a length of wire into the
        closet, and we HEAR a DRILL.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM - NIGHT

        He's run a wire up here and is now connecting it to the
        phone he bought.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

        Now the Hider is relaxing on his mattress, his phone to his
        ear.  His call is answered.

                                HIDER
                  Hi, this is Tom Sykes.

                                ANSWER SERVICE
                  Mr. Sykes?  Let me see... there
                  were two calls for you today.  One
                  from Dr. Levine at three o'clock
                  -- he'd like to reschedule next
                  week's appointment, if possible.
                  And the dry cleaners called and
                  said your jacket is ready.

                                HIDER
                  Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
                  I've been real busy.  I just got
                  a new phone installed, so I
                  thought I'd test it.  Okay,
                  Claire, thanks a lot, talk to you
                  again.

                                ANSWER SERVICE
                  Goodbye, Mr. Sykes.

        The Hider disconnects his phone.

        INT. HIDER'S SEORET ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

        He's DRILLING again.  Stopping, he blows away the dust and
        presses his face down to the tiny hole he's made, squinting
        to see if he can see anything through it.  He sits up
        again, wiping his brow,


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM - DAY

        He's asleep.  Breeze enters through the outside wall vent,
        rustling his hair.  He's awakened by the SOUND of a CAR
        parking in the driveway.  He rolls over and pulls the lever
        of his vent for a view outside.


        EXT. THE HOUSE

        Phil gets out of his car, smiling, holding his hand out.

                                PHIL
                  Come on, honey -- let's go play
                  in the new house.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        He's all excited to see Julie again -- but then his face
        drops.


        EXT. THE HOUSE

        Another woman has emerged from the car, taking Phil's hand
        as he leads her to the front door.  A very attractive,
        toothy young woman.  His SECRETARY.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        They come in.  The Secretary looking around.  She has a
        certain air of sophistication that makes Phil want to
        swoon.

                                SECRETARY
                  Ooh, I like.

        Phil starts hugging her. They both giggle.


        INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY

        They come in.

                                PHIL
                  And this -- is the master bedroom.

                                SECRETARY
                  Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?

                                PHIL
                  Right over here.

        The room is still completely empty, but he goes and
        outlines where the bed will be.

                                SECRETARY
                  Is it a king or a queen?

                                PHIL
                  It's a double.

                                SECRETARY
                  Even better.

                                PHIL
                         (starting to nibble
                          her neck)
                  Even cosier.

                                SECRETARY
                  That's right -- you got the bill
                  this morning.  I put it on your
                  desk.

                                PHIL
                  Thank you -- how efficient of you.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        His face is to the floor, looking through the peephole he
        made.


        THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE

        He sees the two of them dropping to the floor, Phil's hand
        going up under his Secretary's skirt, helping her tug down
        her pantyhose.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        He recoils.  He's disgusted by this.  But more than that,
        he's angry -- angry for Julie.  She's married to this
        <u>bastard</u>.  The Hider gets more and more incensed as he
        thinks about it.


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

        Phil is on his feet again, buckling his pants.  His
        Secretary is pulling her pantyhose back on.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL - LATER

        Phil and his Secretary on their way out, Phil pausing to
        punch in the code on the security box.

                                PHIL
                  When we move in, everyone's going
                  to have to learn to work this
                  complicated security system.


        EXT. THE HOUSE

        Phil and his Secretary come out.  Phil double-locks the
        front door, proudly showing his Secretary the key to his
        new house.  His face flushed with contentment.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        The Hider watches them leave.  His face flushed with anger
        and hatred.

        There are boxes and things in the entrance hall, and VOICES
        coming from the living room.


        INT. LIVING ROOM

        The family cheers as a clear picture appears on a big color
        TV and Phil emerges from behind it.

                                PHIL
                  Okay!  We have TV!  We can all get
                  stupid again!

                                NEIL
                  What about cable?

                                PHIL
                  We'll get cable when the cable
                  company is good and ready -- you
                  think you can survive till then?

                                NEIL
                  No.

                                JULIE
                  Gimme a break, Neil -- your father
                  just spent three hours connecting
                  the VCR.

        Neil pushes a button to play a tape -- and we SEE Steve
        McQueen in solitary confinement in "Papillion" or "The
        Great Escape."

                                PHIL
                  All right, that's enough for one
                  day -- I want everyone up at the
                  crack of dawn.  We have the whole
                  weekend to get this place in
                  shape.

        Everyone moans, too excited to go to bed, as he turns off
        the VCR and the TV and everyone upstairs.

        seems to be the attic... a single light... comes on.

        out of the kitchen.


        EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

        Phil walks from the house toward his car -- when he sees
        the Nasty Neighbor kick a paper cup from his drive onto
        Phil's.

                                PHIL
                  Hey -- uh, excuse me.

        He goes over.  The Nasty Neighbor turns around and stares
        at him.

                                PHIL
                         (continuing)
                  I didn't kick this onto <u>your</u>
                  property.

        Phil tosses it into a nearby brand-new garbage can on his
        side of their common border.

                                PHIL
                         (continuing; holds out
                          his hand)
                  Phil Dreyer -- we just moved in
                  over here.

        The Nasty Neighbor stares at him.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                  I see you have kids -- and a dog.

                                PHIL
                  That's right.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                  Just keep 'em quiet and away from
                  my property.

        He walks away, muttering something under his breath.  Phil
        is stunned by this impoliteness -- as Julie comes out with
        the kids and the dog, ushering them into her car, then
        coming over to Phil.

                                PHIL
                  Did you hear that?

                                JULIE

                                PHIL
                  Did you hear what he said?

                                PHIL
                  He made, you know, a remark.

                                JULIE
                  Honey, are you okay?

                                PHIL
                  -- And keep my kids away from his
                  property -- who the hell does he
                  think he is?  Some nice
                  neighborhood.

                                JULIE
                  Honey, the meeting today is going
                  to be fine.  Don't get in an
                  uproar.

                                PHIL
                  I know.  It's just having to pass
                  muster with these juniors before
                  the senior partner even agrees to
                  see me.

                                JULIE
                  It's just a dumb game they play.
                  You want to be at a bigger firm,
                  get used to the politics.

                                NEIL AND HOLLY
                         (in b.g.)
                  MOM!

        Julie gives Phil a hug.

                                JULIE
                  Kill 'em.


        HIGH ANGLE

        A VIEW DOWN on the driveway from, say, the attic of the
        house.  We SEE Phil give Julie a perfunctory kiss.  He
        waves to the kids as he goes to his car but first turns
        to the garbage can, picks out the paper cup, and tosses it
        over the Nasty Neighbor's fence.

        INT. JULIE'S CAR - DAY

        She parks the car -- and turns to Neil.

                                JULIE
                  Good luck, kid,

        Neil doesn't find that particular amusing.  He looks with
        a frown at where they've arrived -- his new school.  He
        reluctantly gets out of the car.

                                JULIE
                         (continuing)
                  Hey.
                         (leans for a kiss)
                  Have a nice time -- it's a good
                  school.

                                HOLLY
                  Bye, Neil!


        NEIL

        As Julie drives away, he turns around to see --

        -- a terrifying, brutish kid staring malevolently at him
        and making kissing sounds.  This is the BULLY.

                                BULLY
                         (mimicking
                          sarcastically)
                  "<u>Bye</u>, Mom -- Bye, <u>Mommy</u>."

        The Bully has two Goons flanking him, also making kissing
        noises, and giggling at Neil's expense.

        Neil just thinks to himself, "Oh, Christ."

        Alone in the house now, the Hider descends from the attic,
        coming cautiously out of the attic doorway.


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

        The Hider, listening for sounds from the driveway outside,
        pulls a shirt of Phil's from a laundry basket.  He starts
        pouring perfume on it.

        Julie takes Holly inside with other small children

        EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

        Neil leans against a wall, frown on his face, hands in his
        pockets.  Watching a game of kickball he hasn't been
        invited to join in.  Suddenly, the Bully and his Goons are
        standing in front of him.

                                BULLY
                  So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?

                                NEIL
                  Okay.

                                BULLY
                  I'm Bernard, by the way.  Those
                  are cool Reeboks, Neil.  They're
                  real new, aren't they?

        The Bully scuffs Neil's new Reeboks with his own shoe.

                                NEIL
                  Hey, c'mon.

                                BULLY
                  They're really white.

        The Bully's two Goons join in, all smearing their shoes on
        Neil's.

                                NEIL
                  Hey, c'mon, you guys, lay off.

        He tries to move forward, but the Bully pushes him back
        against the wall and holds him there while the two Goons
        continue messing up Neil's shoes.

                                BULLY
                  We gotta break 'em in for you.
                  You don't wanna go 'round lookin'
                  like a new dil-wad, do ya?

        He points to something on Neil's shirt.  Neil looks down
        and the Bully slaps his face.  The Bully walks away, giving
        Neil a shove.  His Goons do the same.  Presently, two
        FRIENDLY BOYS come up to Neil (one is the boy who lives
        next door to Neil).

                                FRIENDLY BOY
                  You met Bernard.  Nice guy, huh?

        EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

        Julie's car comes back.  She gets out with the dog.  She's
        juggling two bags of groceries.  She drops one of them and
        after bending over to pick it up hears a NOISE, turns to
        see the Nasty Neighbor leering at her.  She goes inside.


        INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE HALL

        Putting the bags down, Julie peeks past the blind at the
        window next to the door, watching the Nasty Neighbor go
        back to his house.  She sees the Nasty Neighbor's Wife
        there, giving the Nasty Neighbor a hard time.  The Nasty
        Neighbor ignores his wife, walking past her into their
        house.

        INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

        Julie is putting laundry into the washer.  We HEAR a SMALL
        NOISE in the house that she doesn't seem to notice.  She
        sorts out some clothes.  Then pauses, pilling out a shirt
        of her husband's.  She holds the collar up to her nose.
        Something bothers her.  She smells the collar again.

        INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

        The Hider looks pensive.

                                HIDER
                  Yeah, things are moving along, but
                  she's still involved with this
                  other guy and it's a little
                  tricky.

                                THERAPIST
                  Listen, no one ever said
                  expressing yourself to the
                  opposite sex is easy, but when the
                  time comes, you have to do it and
                  you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good
                  for both of you.
                  You come out of solitary and you
                  rejoin the human race, as
                  difficult as that sometimes can
                  be.

                                HIDER
                  When I was a child... I got used
                  to the closets.  The boxes.  The
                  cabinet under the kitchen sink...
                  with that persistent drip.  I
                  used to the smell of the boxes.
                  Wood.  Cardboard.  I got so I was
                  comfortable there in the dark.
                  Even... even that old refrigerator
                  in the yard.  That smelled like
                  rust and decay.
                         (pause)
                  It was safe in the boxes.  It was
                  when they took me out --

        You don't want to know what his parents did to him when
        they took him out of the boxes.

                                THERAPIST
                  In the institution... when you
                  were violent... did you <u>want</u> them
                  to put you in solitary
                  confinement?

        He watches the Hider.

                                HIDER
                  I guess so.  I mean, I know I'm
                  responsible for my own actions.
                  It was never because I was angry
                  with anyone.  I didn't mean to
                  hurt anyone ever.

                                THERAPIST
                  You're responsible for your own
                  actions and you don't mean to hurt
                  anyone.  In other words, you've
                  done <u>your</u> best.  I'm saying don't
                  carry the burden of <u>other</u> people's
                  actions on your shoulders, because
                  they're beyond your control.

        The Hider nods in agreement.  There's a pause.

                                THERAPIST
                         (continuing; softer)
                  Are you still afraid of your
                  parents?  Of them finding you?

        The Hider shifts uncomfortably in his chair.

                                HIDER
                  That was years and years ago.
                  They must be very old now, if
                  they're still alive.

        He puts on a brave face.

                                HIDER
                         (continuing)
                  No, my parents don't worry me
                  anymore.  I mean, that's why I was
                  ultimately released, wasn't it?
                  I mean, even with the state
                  closing down the hospital and all.
                  Because I'm able to be on my own
                  at last.
                         (smiles)
                  I'm cured.

        Family life.  Holly is playing with toys in the living room
        with the dog.  Neil trails after his mother, who's moving

                  Because you'd have to get up at

                  why they let a psycho even go to
                  school!

        She pushes him out of the room.  She looks at Phil, who's
        tossing a salad.

                                JULIE

                  the first to know, all right?


        JULIE

        watches him take the salad out to the dining room.  We HEAR
        HIS VOICE from out there, saying the typical kind of thing
        a parent says in a child-filled house when he's trying to
        clear the table for dinner:

        Another couple, the Nice Neighbors, laugh at that.  (The

                  Yeah, I caught him <u>looking</u> at me
                  the other day.

                                NICE WOMAN
                  In all the years we've lived here,
                  I don't think we've spoken a word

                  hospital early in the morning,
                  I've seen him coming home.  Maybe
                  he works at night.

                  in a while at the supermarket.
                  Truly one of the walking dead.

        More easy laughter.  A very sensual woman, RITA, smokes a
        cigarette and gives Julie a wink.  Julie smiles back.
        Clearly they're best friends.

        INT. KITCHEN - DAY

        Julie is making coffee in here with Rita.

                                RITA
                  You've done a really great job
                  with the house.  It's great!

                                JULIE
                  Yeah.  There's still a lot I want
                  to do.  It's not quite... the kids
                  aren't really settled in yet.
                  Even the dog has been terribly
                  high-strung and whines a lot since
                  we've been here.  Look, he hasn't
                  even come in for his food today.

                                RITA
                  So you don't have anything
                  concrete?

                                JULIE
                  No, I told you.  A whiff of
                  perfume on his shirt.

                                RITA
                  Have you just plain asked him?

                                JULIE
                  I've asked him what's wrong.

                                RITA
                  And?

                                JULIE
                  The same thing -- his business
                  pressures, the whole move and
                  everything.  He's frantic about
                  nailing this new job, worried
                  about screwing over his present
                  boss.

                                RITA
                  I'm sure that's all it is, honey.
                  Maybe you both just need a
                  vacation.

                                JULIE
                  I've tried to get him to agree to
                  one.  I just -- I don't know...
                  I'm getting such weird vibes
                  lately.

                                RITA
                  Don't drive yourself crazy.  It's
                  probably nothing.

        The boys come in from the backyard.

                                RITA
                         (continuing; flirting
                          shamelessly)
                  Hi, Neil.

                                NEIL
                  Hi.  We're going to the mall.

        He and his friends go out.

                                JULIE
                  Rita, he's only twelve years old,

        INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

        Julie lifts Holly up into her lap, then engrossed in
        conversation doesn't pay attention when Holly climbs back
        down.

                                NICE WOMAN
                  ... No, not really.  We do hear
                  of break-ins now and again, but
                  it's generally a real low-crime
                  area.  We've never had any
                  trouble.

                                JULIE
                  Is there any kind of Neighborhood
                  Watch or --

                                NICE MAN
                         (puts arm around his
                          wife)
                  You're talking to her.

        His wife laughs and gives him a playful slap on the arm.
        Phil seems to be flirting with Rita.  Holly walks out of
        the room.


        INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL

        Holly comes out from the room.

        She starts along toward... the door out to the pool
        that's been left wide open.


        EXT. THE POOL

        Holly comes out.  She walks to the pool.  She walks to the
        edge and looks over the water, walks further on --
        toward the deep end.  She crouches the there.  She
        picks up a leaf and tosses it in the pool and watches it
        float.  She reaches to bring it back but it's already
        floated too far out.  She reaches further, leaning over the
        deep water and -- SUDDENLY two big hands lunge at her back
        -- as if to push her in -- but they grab her to <u>stop</u> her
        falling in, and lift her up in the air, running back to the
        house with her, pushing her inside and shutting the door
        with a definite CLICK behind her,

        Julie is looking at a very pretty green vase among other

                                JULIE

                  There's no card or anything.

                  I hear things in this house,

                                PHIL
                  All new houses have noises.

                                JULIE
                  How long does it have to be a new
                  house?

                                PHIL
                  One day before we know it it'll
                  be an old house and we'll be old
                  in it -- and I'll still be paying
                  for it.

                                JULIE
                  Neil's still having a bad time at
                  school.  I feel terrible seeing
                  him so upset all the time.

                                PHIL
                  He's made some friends, hasn't he?

        Julie is starting to give Phil little nibbles on his neck.

                                PHIL
                         (continuing)
                  I mean, he's a smart kid, he'll
                  get by -- he takes after me.
                  You're too sensitive.

                                JULIE
                         (seductively)
                  I know someone else who's
                  sensitive.

        She's rubbing him under the covers.

                                PHIL
                         (had enough of this)
                  Honey, I have a lot of meetings
                  in the morning.

        He turns away.

        EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

        All quiet.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        He wakes up.  He's restless.  He's hot.  He reaches for one
        of his water bottles, but it's empty.  He licks his lips.
        Now that he's thought about having a drink, he can't get
        the idea out of his mind.  He lies down again, but soon
        sits up.  He's starting to feel a little trapped.


        INT. THE ATTIC - NIGHT

        The Hider emerges out of his secret panel in the floor.
        He's holding an water bottle.


        INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

        The door from the attic stairway slowly opens.  The Hider
        carefully steps out.  He looks one way -- all clear --
        looks the other -- and stops dead in his tracks.

        Holly is standing at the other end of the hall looking at
        him.  She rubs her eyes sleepily.  When she looks again,
        the Hider is gone.

        Holly turns around and walks to her parents' door where she
        knocks.

        Julie opens the door, looking down at Holly.

                                JULIE
                  Baby, what is it?

                                HOLLY
                  I'm thirsty.

                                JULIE
                  Aw, okay.

        She starts to lead Holly down the main stairs.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        He's back in hiding, and hitting himself for his
        carelessness, sweating more than ever, desperately afraid
        that he almost blew the whole deal.


        INT. MAIN STAIRS

        Julie holds Holly's hand as they descend the dark stairs.

                                JULIE
                  It's the middle of the night,
                  sweetie.

                                HOLLY
                  A man scared me.

                                JULIE
                  A man?  Was it a dream?

                  Don't cry, honey, Rudolf knows how
                  to take care of himself.  I'm sure
                  he's okay.  Maybe he just went on

                  good for us to get away for a
                  while.  Maybe Rudolf got the same
                  idea.  Dogs need a change of

                  What did the thermometer say?

                                NEIL
                  The thermometer's broken.

                                JULIE
                  He doesn't have a temperature.

                                NEIL
                  I can't help it if my homework is
                  torn to shreds three times a week
                  by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me.

                                PHIL
                  Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel
                  our trip.  I really am. I've had
                  it.

                                NEIL
                  And I can't help having a cold.

                                PHIL
                  What d'you want me to do, Neil?
                  I've told you we'll get another
                  dog.  What does EVERYONE want me
                  to do?  You want to move back?
                  Huh?  Would you like that?  Should
                  we all just pack up again and MOVE
                  BACK?!

        This yell resounds throughout the entire house.

        EXT. A STREET - DAY

        Neil is walking home from school.  He HEARS something and
        looks back nervously.  Suddenly, the Bully and his Goons
        come out of some trees, surrounding Neil.

        Immediately they start shoving him around a bit, taking his
        bag.

                                NEIL
                  Give it here, Bernard.

                                BULLY
                  Whoa, check it out.

        A new fountain-pen set he finds in Neil's bag.

                                NEIL.
                  Put it back!

                                BULLY
                  Nice pen, Neil.

        He shakes it at Neil, spraying ink all over the new
        baseball jacket he's wearing -- then stabs the nib into a
        tree.

                                NEIL
                  Fucker!

        The Goons hold Neil back.  The Bully hits Neil.

                                BULLY
                  Don't call me a fucker, you little
                  asshole.

        He yanks a pocket of Neil's jacket until it tears.  Neil
        tries to get him again but one of the Goons trips him.

                                BULLY
                         (continuing)
                  Hey, you're really clumsy, Neil.
                  Look at the mess you made.

        He dumps the rest of the contents of Neil's bag over Neil's
        head and walks away laughing cruelly with his Goons.  Neil
        looks at his jacket and calls after them.

                                NEIL
                  FUCKERS!

        EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

        Now the Bully is walking home.  Alone.  Suddenly he stops.
        There's a dollar on the ground in front of him.  He bends
        to pick it up -- and a hand CLAMPS over his face and pulls
        him into some bushes.


        IN THE BUSHES

        The Bully is dragged deeper in.  He struggles in sheer
        panic.  He's twisted around momentarily.  His face is
        filled with fear as he glimpses his attacker.

                                BULLY
                  Please -- <u>please</u> --

        The Hider's big hand muffles him again.

        INT. THE HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

        Julie flattens the baseball jacket out to have a look with
        Neil.  It looks all right.  We HEAR a PHONE RING and PHIL
        ANSWER it.

                                NEIL
                  Thank God.

                                JULIE
                  I think we got it just in time
                  before the ink dried.

                                NEIL
                  Whew.

                                JULIE
                  The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew
                  it up for you after dinner, okay?

                                NEIL
                  Thanks, Mom.


        INT. KITCHEN

        Phil is about to hang up.  Holly sits at the kitchen table.

                                PHIL
                         (into phone)
                  Oh, gee, well, thanks for letting
                  us know. Goodbye.
                         (there's a <u>double</u>
                          click)
                  Hello?

        He hangs up.  Julie and Neil come in.

                                PHIL
                         (continuing)
                  Oh boy, I just heard something
                  horrible.  That was Audrey next
                  door.  Neil, do you know a boy
                  named Bernard Gunther?

        Neil looks up in alarm.

                                PHIL
                         (continuing)
                  He lives on the other side of the
                  hill, I guess, so don't get too
                  scared, but it looks like he was
                  just, I don't know, attacked on
                  his way home from school.  Audrey
                  heard that he was...
                         (catches himself with
                          a sigh)
                  ... well, apparently he's in the
                  hospital now.  One of his legs
                  was...  They don't know if he'll
                  ever walk properly again.

        In the silence and dread that follow, no one notices the
        great big beaming smile of sheer God-given good fortune
        that breaks out on Neil's face.

        INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

                  Really?

        Across the table from him is his Secretary.

                                SECRETARY
                  Really.

        Under the table she's slipped off a shoe and is running her
        stockinged foot up his thigh.

                                PHIL
                  Promise?

                                SECRETARY
                  Promise.

        In the b.g. the Hider sits at another table alone.

                                PHIL
                  I'd like that.

                                SECRETARY
                  Would you?

                                PHIL
                  Uh huh.

        The Hider takes a book of matches from the ashtray on his
        table and plays with it.

                                SECRETARY

        INT. THE HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - EVENING

        Phil comes upstairs looking for something.  Neil walks by
        wearing his bearded-man mask and goes downstairs.

                                PHIL
                  Honey!  Was the paper delivered
                  today?


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM

        Julie is for their trip.

                                JULIE
                  I think so!  Didn't you take it
                  in?


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        The Hider isn't here.  But more stuff is.  A cork bulletin
        board has been put up.  On the bulletin board are all sorts
        of pictures, clippings, bits and pieces.  Things that
        interest the Hider.  There's a calendar with "VACATION!"
        marked prominently.  And underneath on his mattress lies
        the newspaper.  Folded to the movie-listings page.


        INT. WALK-IN CLOSET - MASTER BEDROOM

        Julie takes one of Phil's jackets and something falls out
        of the pocket.  She bends to pick up whatever it is.


        INT. LIVING ROOM

        Neil, wearing his bearded-man mask, joins his sister on the
        couch to watch TV.  She pays no attention to him.


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM

        Phil is trying to look stunned.

                                PHIL
                  The old incriminating matchbook!
                  Are you kidding me?!  The oldest
                  cliche in the <u>world</u>!

        Julie is looking mad.

                                JULIE
                  No, I'm not kidding you, <u>Philip</u>.

                  What next?!  -- A strange bra
                  under my pillow!


        INT. MOVIE THEATRE - EVENING

        The Hider munches popcorn slowly as he watches a romantic
        scene.  He's quite swept up by it.


        INT. THE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - EVENING

        Phil tosses the incriminating matchbook onto the bed.

                                JULIE
                  I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that
                  jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day
                  you were all day in <u>meetings</u>
                  again?  And had to send out for
                  <u>sandwiches</u>?

                                PHIL
                  Honey, you know what I've been
                  like lately... I've been a total
                  zombie.  I have no idea what that
                  was doing in my pocket.

                                JULIE
                  Well, what about <u>these</u>?
                         (taking something else
                          out)
                  Do you usually put your <u>carbons</u>
                  in your pocket, too?!

        Her wild card.  She flings them in his face and storms into
        the adjoining bathroom.  Phil stares at the torn-in-half
        carbons.  He can't believe it.  Didn't he <u>leave</u> them in the
        restaurant?  <u>Is</u> he getting absent-minded?


        INT. BATHROOM

        Julie packs more things as Phil comes in.

                                PHIL
                  Sweetheart, this is a very risky
                  time for me right now.  Maybe you
                  don't appreciate that.

                                JULIE
                  I don't care, Philip.  You want
                  to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go
                  ahead.  Just watch out for those
                  buck teeth.

                                PHIL
                  Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe
                  this!

                  Do you usually pay for Charlie?
                  At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?

                                PHIL
                  Honey, I can't track of all
                  the meals Charlie and I have been
                  having.  This is a delicate time.
                  If it leaks out that I'm jumping
                  ship before I'm set up someplace
                  else I could be out on my ear
                  before I'm ready with nothing.

        The Hider strolls along, drinking a soft drink through a
        straw.  He passes a flower stand and pauses to look at the
        arrangements.  He turns a reel of seed packets, and pulls
        one of the packets out to look at.  Just then he hears a
        NOISE and turns to witness --


        A MINOR ACCIDENT

        A car cuts off a bicyclist.  The bicyclist falls off his
        bike -- scraping his knee quite severely.  Other onlookers
        go to his aid.  We SEE where his trouser leg was torn and
        the bloody kneecap.


        THE HIDER

        thinks it's funny.  The Hider laughs.

                  both of us.  You'll see.

        She nods, taking her tea, and they go out.  Phil shuts the
        light as they leave -- and we SEE the Hider's face at the
        window.

                  Did you lock the garage door?

        Neil thinks he's taking along a gigantic plastic Rambo
        machine gun.  Phil discourages him by grabbing it out of
        his hands and putting it somewhere.


        EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

        Phil makes sure the front door is double-locked, then joins
        the others in the cab.

        The cab doors SLAM.  The cab drives away.

        Whistling, the Hider strolls in, opens a cabinet, takes out
        a box of Raisin Bran, then finds a bowl for himself.


        INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

        The Hider watches a sporting event on TELEVISION, keeping

        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        A Cleaning Woman goes through the house.


        INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

        Mail has been neatly put on the table.  Out in the entrance
        hall, we SEE the Cleaning Woman leave, locking the front
        door after her.  The Hider steps INTO VIEW from the
        kitchen.  He sits at the table to go through the mail.  He
        opens a letter that's addressed to "OCCUPANT."


        EXT. GARDEN - DAY

        He plants some flower seeds using a gardening trowel.


        INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

        INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

        The Hider looks quite content today.

                                THERAPIST
                  And how are things with your lady
                  friend, if I may call her that?

                                HIDER
                  Oh, fine.  She's gone away for a
                  little while and when she comes
                  back I've sort of resolved to
                  really tell her how much I care
                  for her.

                                THERAPIST
                  That's terrific.  Don't be afraid
                  to be demonstrative.  You're
                  sounding a lot more confident than
                  when we last spoke.

                                HIDER
                  I am.  I'm really feeling pretty
                  good.  I have a much stronger
                  sense of how far I've come.

                                THERAPIST
                  As long as you keep remembering
                  why.

                                HIDER
                  Well, we talked about the whole
                  disapproval thing.

                                THERAPIST
                         (nodding)
                  The whole disapproval thing.  If
                  you allow yourself to get into a
                  situation where someone else's
                  potential disapproval becomes the
                  focal point of your life -- then
                  you're back to a life of fear,
                  aren't you?  -- You're a prisoner
                  to that again, and that isn't much
                  of a life.

                                HIDER
                  I understand that.

                                THERAPIST
                  And please, don't for God's sake
                  misinterpret that as being the
                  voice of discouragement in any
                  way --

                                HIDER
                  No, no, no, no.

                                THERAPIST
                  On the contrary -- this is
                  tremendous.  I mean, we're all
                  frightened to death of disapproval
                  and we're constantly hiding behind
                  these layers we manufacture for
                  ourselves -- and I'm not saying
                  we should, you know, <u>declare</u>
                  ourselves unhesitatingly to our
                  fellow human beings in the
                  interests of total openness and
                  honesty --

                                HIDER
                  That would be stupid.

                                THERAPIST
                  That would be monumentally stupid.
                  All I'm saying is --

                                HIDER
                  -- a sense of proportion.

                                THERAPIST
                         (nods emphatically)
                  A sense of proportion.

        INT. THE HOUSE - BY THE PATIO DOORS - NIGHT

        A SCRATCHING at the glass.  Then a TAP.  And a CLINK.  And
        a CLICK.  And the curtain stirs -- and a Burglar slips in.
        He crouches by the floor a moment, listening and getting
        accustomed to the dark.


        INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

        The Burglar opens the drawers of some cabinets in here.
        Looking for loot.  It's after midnight and the lights are
        out.


        INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

        The Burglar comes in.  He goes over to the TV and crouches
        down to look at the VCR in the trolley underneath.  He runs
        his hand over its smooth surface, then suddenly leans
        forward to unscrew cables at the back.  This abrupt
        movement probably extends his life by a few minutes --
        because when a <u>hammer</u> comes down on his head, the blow is
        only a glancing one.

        The Burglar groans and turns -- the Hider was thrown off-
        balance by his miss -- and the Burglar has enough time to
        put an arm up for protection -- the second blow shattering
        his elbow.  He cries out in pain, but he's a strong man
        himself.  He's a match for the Hider!  He manages to grab
        the Hider's ankle at the same time and pull him completely
        off-balance -- the Hider throwing his arm out to stop
        himself falling, knocking to the floor the vase he bought
        for Julie -- landing on the floor himself as it SMASHES
        alongside him -- and with a great gasp the Burglar pushes
        the big television off the trolley onto the Hider.

        The Hider has the wind knocked out of him as the big TV
        lands heavily onto his chest, nearly squashing him like a
        bug.  The Burglar is already running away, clutching his
        broken elbow -- but the Hider's powerful arm shoots out to
        catch his leg, pulling the Burglar back, while with an
        almost superhuman effort the Hider heaves the TV off his
        chest.

        The Burglar struggles with all his might.  The two men
        wrestle on the living room floor.  The Burglar tries to
        gouge out the Hider's eyes.  Craning his face out of the
        reach of the Burglar's flailing, frenzied fingers, the
        Hider tries to get a firm grasp on him.  He grabs wildly
        at the Burglar's hair, finally getting a good hold.  He
        smashes the Burglar's head onto the glass-topped coffee
        table.  BANG, BANG, BANG -- the glass cracks -- BANG, BANG,
        BANG, the Burglar's face into the glass until the
        glass breaks completely.

        The Burglar won't give up.  He's beyond pain.  He's only
        trying to survive.  His hand is at the Hider's throat,
        squeezing.  They throttle each ether.  The Burglar is on
        his back, his legs kicking at the Hider.  His shoe catches
        the Hider a kick to the ear.  They both cough and gasp as
        a release is forced, both struggling for a better position,
        the Burglar trying to slide out from under again, the Hider
        keeping him down -- and now the Hider is able to seize the
        Burglar's arm again and jam the fingers in a door jamb and
        pull the door back.  We don't hear the Burglar scream
        because the Hider's other hand is in his mouth, but the
        Burglar bites down so hard on it the Hider is the one who
        lets out a roar of animal agony and the Burglar's good hand
        punches at his face, the Burglar somehow on his feet again,
        trying to make it to the dining room.

        The Hider catches hold of the Burglar's shirt, tearing it.
        but pulling the Burglar back to the floor -- and the
        Hider's foot slips in some blood and he lands hard on his
        back, hitting his head, the Burglar's torn shirt in his
        hand.  The Burglar is crawling on all fours to get away,
        but his knees slip in the blood, too, and the Hider's legs
        grapple him like a pair of pythons, pulling him back, and
        the two of them struggle on the slippery floor, out of
        breath, near exhaustion.

        There's a tall plant in the hall.  The Hider stuffs the
        Burglar's face in the pot, suffocating him in the soggy
        earth.  The Burglar's body twists and turns and kicks as
        he's smothered in the damp dirt, the tall plant shaking
        above the two of them, casting horrible shadows around the
        entrance hall in the moonlight cast from the skylight.

        The Hider can barely hold the Burglar's head in place,
        every muscle tensing as the Burglar's body shudders in
        rebellion -- and then the tremendous surge as the Burglar's
        body breaks free!  -- Tall plant tipping as the Burglar
        pushes back against the Hider with unbelievable strength
        -- tall plant falling -- the Burglar knocking the Hider
        back flat on the floor, the Burglar on top, but the Hider
        still hugging him in a death grip, then getting a
        full-nelson hold on the Burglar's shoulders and neck, the
        two of them struggling to a standing position again, the
        Hider again smacking the Burglar's head again and again and
        again, into the front door this time, the Burglar sinking
        back to the floor, still resisting, still breathing, his
        good hand still madly feeling for a grip on the Hider, but
        this time the Hider's hold is too strong and when he's got
        the Burglar on the floor again, he's able to get a knee
        into the small of the Burglar's back and with the knee as
        leverage and the full nelson on the Burglar's neck, the
        Hider pulls back with every last ounce of strength,
        pulling, pulling, moaning with the sheer effort of it until
        -- the Burglar's neck BREAKS.

        The Hider rolls off, gasping for breath.  He pulls himself
        to a sitting position against the front door.  He sits
        here in the entrance hall under the moonlit skylight with
        the shadows and the dead Burglar and the blood and the
        earth all over the floor and he breathes air into his lungs
        as if he'll never get enough.

        INT. GARAGE OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT

        The Hider enters, carrying over his shoulder a giant-sized
        black Hefty trash bag with the body of the Burglar in it.
        From his pocket he takes -- the keys to Phil's car.  He
        lays the body bag on the floor in the back and gets in the
        front.  He adjusts the driver's seat to suit him.

        The Hider, driving Phil's car, turns into a filthy alley.

        out, dumps it callously on the ground, and drives away.

                  You better believe it, buddy.
                  Your average Rolls Royce doesn't
                  have to pass as many tests.  You
                  want consistency?  You want
                  dependability?  You want safety?

                                HIDER
                  Safety?

                                BERT
                  Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em,
                  pour water all over 'em --
                  <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under
                  ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>,
                  they're nice to have around,
                  they're completely harmless -- but
                  when you blow this whistle...
                         (holds up a whistle)
                  ... then look out.


        A VICIOUS, SAVAGE KILLER DOG

        <u>LUNGING</u> directly AT THE CAMERA!  Snarling fiercely.

        This is the "product" under discussion -- attacking a Man
        who's wearing considerable protective, padded clothing.
        It's a simulated "mugging" demonstration.  The Man in the
        clothing and face mask is playing the part of the mugger,
        while a Woman Dog Trainer is the victim -- with a whistle
        in her mouth.

                  So this really does the trick, eh?

                                BERT
                  Friend, that animal will go after
                  whoever's approaching the sound
                  of that whistle.  And God help
                  whoever it is.  Because that dog
                  will not let up until there's dead
                  meat on the ground.  Put your
                  faith in that, pal.

        The padded Man is indeed on the ground, the Killer Dog
        attacking him viciously.

                  Can we keep him, Mom, oh, can we?
                  Can we keep him?

        Julie and Phil laugh.  They crouch down with the kids to
        pet the Killer Dog, too.  The Killer Dog is happy.

                                PHIL
                  Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come
                  from, huh?

                                NEIL
                  Can we keep him?

        The Killer Dog licks Phil's face.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. THE HOUSE - EVENING

        The kids are watching MTV in the living room.  The Killer
        Dog strolls out, wearing a collar.  In the dining room Phil
        is pacing nervously as he talks on the kitchen phone,
        stretched in here on the super-long flex cord.

                                PHIL
                  Sensational.  Wednesday is fine,
                  no problemo.  One o'clock at the
                  Somerset Grill -- yes, I know it
                  well.  Okay then -- looking
                  forward to it.  Ciao.
                         (again a double click)
                  Hello?  Hello?

        He goes into the kitchen to hang up, punching the air
        triumphantly.


        INT. KITCHEN

        Julie is preparing dinner.  The Killer Dog walks to the dog
        bowl to munch his chow.

                                PHIL
                  He wants to see me!

                                JULIE
                  Philip!  The senior partner?

                                PHIL
                  His secretary just confirmed.

                                JULIE
                  Oh baby.

        She hugs him, giving him a kiss.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        He presses the redial button on his phone extension.

                                HIDER
                  Oh, hi, this is Phil Dreyer again.
                  Stupidly, I just looked at my
                  calendar and I'm going to have to
                  cancel Wednesday.  Please
                  apologize to him for me and I'll
                  call back to reschedule -- is that
                  all right?  No problemo?
                  Sensational.  Thanks -- I'm really
                  sorry.  Ciao.


        INT. KITCHEN

        Julie and Phil hugging and kissing.  The MUSIC coming from
        the liVing room.  Julie starts dancing slowly with Phil --
        but he wants to break it up now.

                                PHIL
                  What -- what are you doing?

                                JULIE
                  I think you should feel like
                  dancing at a time like this.

                                PHIL
                         (trying to break away)
                  C'mon.

        Julie lets him go, pissed off now.

                                JULIE
                  You can never bring yourself to
                  do anything spontaneous or
                  romantic, can you?

        Now Phil is pissed off that she's pissed off.

                                PHIL
                  I bought the house, dear heart --
                  we took the vacation.  I deliver
                  your dreams from time to time.

        He starts walking out.

                                JULIE
                  A dance is for free.

        He's gone.  With a sigh she turns back to her cooking.

                                                   CUT TO;


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM - DAY

        He wakes up suddenly from sleep.  He hears something.  He
        smells something.  He sniffs.  He crawls over to look
        through the vent in the false wall.


        INT. THE ATTIC

        Neil and his friends are here.  The attic is full of all
        kinds of junk.  Neil and his friends are <u>playing with</u>
        <u>matches</u> -- melting a naked "G.I. Joe."

                                NEIL'S FRIEND #1
                  Oooh, look at him <u>burn</u>.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        The Hider is appalled by this sadistic game.  Suddenly, he
        almost hits the ceiling -- as his PHONE RINGS!  He
        instantly disconnects it, and waits with horror to see if
        it's given him away.


        INT. THE ATTIC

        The PHONES are still RINGING in the rest of the house.

                                NEIL'S FRIEND #2
                  You guys have a loud phone.


        INT. DINING ROOM

        Julie answers it.

                                JULIE
                  Hello?  Hi, Rita.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        He finishes writing a note to himself and posts it on his
        bulletin board:  "ALWAYS REMEMBER TO UNPLUG THE PHONE!!!"
        Then he turns over the phone to turn the "ring" dial to
        low.


        INT. DINING ROOM

        Julie on the phone with her friend.

                                JULIE
                  Uh huh... uh huh... You didn't
                  even have dinner with him first?


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        Keeping one eye on the antics of the kids in the attic, the
        Hider reconnects his phone so he can listen in on Julie's
        conversation, holding a cloth over the mouthpiece.


        INT. DINING ROOM

        Julie hears PHIL COMING HOME.  CAR DOOR SLAMMING.

                                JULIE
                  Uh huh... uh huh... Well, Rita,
                  if he's that big a slob, why are
                  you even bothering?

        Phil comes in, head down, goes straight upstairs.

                                JULIE
                         (continuing)
                  Rita, I'm going to have to call
                  you back.


        INT. THE ATTIC

        Suddenly Neil or one of his idiot friends drops a match and
        accidentally sets on fire a roll of carpet lying against
        the Hider's wall.  The roll of carpet is wrapped in brown
        paper.

                                NEIL
                  Shit!

                                NEIL'S FRIEND #1
                  Put it out, man!

        The boys frantically try to put out the fire.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        Oh Christ, Oh God, Oh Jesus, Oh Christ, Oh God -- the Hider
        puts the phone down and pulls the ventilator lever shut and
        backs off as far as his terribly limited space allows.


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM

        Phil is lying on the bed as Julie comes in.

                                JULIE
                  Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't
                  call me.

                                PHIL
                  He wasn't there.

                                JULIE
                  What?

        She comes to sit on the bed.  She tries putting a hand on
        him, but it's like putting a hand on a corpse.

                                PHIL
                  I get to the restaurant and he's
                  not there. I waited for forty-
                  five minutes.  When I called his
                  office, his secretary said they
                  thought I had cancelled.  I had
                  cancelled!  Then I get back to my
                  office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for
                  me and he knows <u>everything</u>.

                                JULIE
                  Oh, honey.

                                PHIL
                  <u>Everything</u> -- that I've been
                  talking to other people behind his
                  back -- that's what he called me
                  -- a back-stabber and a deceiver.
                  To him and to the company.
                  He called me a traitor in front
                  of everybody and told me if I
                  wanted to be a VP over at
                  Lowenthal I might as well pack up
                  and go -- only <u>Lowenthal never</u>
                  <u>showed up for our lunch</u>!  It's
                  like everybody got an anonymous
                  poison-pen letter or some --
                         (sits up)
                  Do you smell smoke?


        INT. THE ATTIC

        Phil comes running up as Neil was rushing down.

                                NEIL
                  Dad!  Dad!

        The carpet is blazing!  Noxious smoke pouring off it!


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        He can't stop the smoke coming through his vent.  His
        little cell is quickly flooding with smoke.  Choking,
        gasping, he throws himself down on his mattress, sticking
        his face to the second vent in the street wall, sucking the
        real air from out there.


        INT. THE ATTIC

        Phil slaps at the fire with another rug.

                                PHIL
                  Neil, go get some water!  Now!


        EXT. THE HOUSE

        That small vent up by the attic -- smoke coming from it.
        UP CLOSE, a man's hideously distorted and desperate face
        pressed against it.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        He lies there gasping for air, more smoke filling his small
        space.


        INT. THE ATTIC

        Neil and Julie rush back up with buckets of water.  After
        a lot more screaming and yelling and exertion, the flames
        are put out.
                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL DOWNSTAIRS - DAY

        Phil shouts at Neil and his friends.

                                PHIL
                  What the <u>fuck</u> did you guys think
                  you were doing?!

        They all have their heads down.  Phil opens the front door
        to get rid of Neil's friends.

                                PHIL
                         (continuing)
                  You two get out of here, go on.
                  Your parents are going to be
                  hearing from me.

        He slams the door.  Neil glances embarrassedly at his
        little sister, who's crying fearfully in the next room.

                                NEIL
                  A <u>man</u> started the fire.

                                PHIL
                         (<u>hits</u> Neil)
                  Neil, goddamn it, you're not five
                  years old!

                                JULIE
                  Neil, you could have burned the
                  house down!

                                NEIL
                  I don't <u>know</u> how it started!

                                PHIL
                  You knew a second ago.  <u>Who</u>
                  started it?

                                NEIL
                  -- A man.

        WHAM!  He gets hit again.  Hard.  He holds his arm and
        looks about to cry.

                                PHIL
                  A man started it?  Oh really?  You
                  wanna show me, Neil?  Right, okay,
                  here we go, Neil's gonna show me
                  the man.

        He grabs Neil's arm roughly and starts pulling him toward
        the stairs.


        INT. THE ATTIC

        The Hider emerges with a cloud of smoke from under his
        secret panel in the floor.  He lies here, gasping
        desperately for air.


        INT. MAIN STAIRWAY

        Phil dragging Neil up.

                                PHIL
                  We're going to go see the man.
                  Here we go, Neil's gonna show his
                  dad the man.  Come on, let's go
                  see the man.


        INT. THE ATTIC

        The Hider has practically passed out from his ordeal.  But
        then he hears them coming back up.


        ATTIC STAIRWAY

        Phil drags Neil up, pushes him forward into the attic.


        THE HIDER

        Standing stiff in the shadows behind some old bookcases.
        He didn't have time to go back under his false wall.  He's
        here in the attic with them!


        PHIL

        spins Neil around the center of the floor a few times.

                                PHIL
                  Do you see a man?

                                NEIL
                  No.

                                PHIL
                  No man!
                         (WHAM!)
                  <u>Go to your room</u>.

        He pushes Neil back downstairs and turns with a sigh to
        look at the charred mess up here.  He goes closer to the
        burnt carpet and bends over it.


        THE HIDER

        Alone with the person he hates most in life.  His fists
        start to clench.


        PHIL

        gingerly touches bits of the carpet, making sure the fire
        is completely out.  SUDDENLY, he jumps -- the attic door
        has swung shut.  He turns toward it -- and a shadow moves
        somewhere behind him.  He opens the door again -- and
        there's a little CREAK.  He bends over again, putting
        something at the bottom of the door to keep it open.  Then
        he thinks he hears something -- turns around again -- but
        JULIE distracts him, CALLING from downstairs:

                                JULIE (O.S.)
                  Honey -- I can't find those large-
                  size Hefty trash bags!

                                PHIL
                         (goes downstairs)
                  There might be some extras in the
                  garage.


        INT. THE ATTIC - LATER

        Neil is pushed back in, followed by his parents.

                                NEIL
                  I thought I was supposed to stay
                  in my room.

                                PHIL
                         (pushing him)
                  Get on the other side of that.

        Holly comes up to watch, too.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        Hider has made it back in here.  As the last vestiges
        of smoke clear, he lies back on his mattress, breathing
        slowly.


        INT. THE ATTIC

        They're cleaning up the mess, trying to put trash bags over
        the burnt carpet roll.

                                JULIE
                  Neil, lift up your end.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        Here on the other side of the false wall.  Lying on his
        mattress.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. THE POOL - EVENING

        Phil is sitting in a deck chair, looking shell-shocked.
        Julie is still trying to comfort him.

                                JULIE
                  Honey, it's not the end of the
                  world.  You'll call Lowenthal
                  tomorrow and find out it was just
                  a mix-up.  And if he's not
                  interested anymore, then you'll
                  find another company to go to
                  maybe even your own.  You are free
                  now, you are independent.

                  I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is
                  that your idea of negotiating from
                  a position of strength?  Clearly
                  any potential employers have been
                  warned to back off!

                                JULIE
                  That's not the case.

                  Someone blew the whistle.  Someone
                  hates me.

        EXT. THE ROOF - DAWN

        The Hider looks at the sky, daylight about to break.  He
        goes aver the top.


        EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE

        Nearing the bottom, he slips and falls the rest of the way,
        hurting himself as he scrapes his hands and legs.  He picks
        himself up off the ground, brushing himself off, stumbling
        slightly again.  Looking around, worried in case his fall
        was heard, he sneaks away around the corner of the house...

        ... leaving behind the <u>dog whistle</u> that's fallen out of his
        pocket, that he accidentally stepped on and kicked to one
        side.  Dented slightly, but shining temptingly in the
        grass.

                                HIDER
                  Things are beginning to come to
                  a head.  I can feel it.  And I
                  want everything to be perfect.

                                THERAPIST
                  Who doesn't?

                                HIDER
                  I've cultivated her interests so
                  that now we have even more in
                  common than ever.

                                THERAPIST
                  Well, now, don't go creating some
                  artificial environment for
                  yourself.

                                HIDER
                  Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely
                  made me more fulfilled in many
                  ways -- and I hope eventually to
                  be able to teach her a few things,
                  too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm
                  still waiting for just that right
                  -- synthesis between us -- where
                  everything will be understood
                  between us without even the need
                  for words.

                                THERAPIST
                  It's not going to happen unless
                  you make it happen, my friend.
                  You're going to have to assert
                  yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u>
                  your affection.

                                HIDER
                  Yeah, maybe you're right.
                  Everything else is just an excuse.
                  I'm treating the situation with
                  kid gloves because I'm afraid of
                  losing her.

                                THERAPIST
                  <u>Ask</u> her how she feels.

                                HIDER
                  I should.

                                THERAPIST
                  You have to put yourself out there
                  a bit more.

                                HIDER
                  Right.

                                THERAPIST
                  Because life isn't about playing
                  it safe.  Life is about taking
                  risks.

                  Boy, you really buckle under a

        Phil comes out of the house, followed by Julie.  He stuffs
        his suitcase in his car.

                  You're even sadder and more burnt-

                  <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind,
                  what <u>you</u> think is for my own good.

        As he gets into his car he has a little fit, readjusting
        the seat.

        DOOR SLAMMING out there.

        It's Neil.  Looking unhappy as children do at such moments.
        He glances into the living room where Holly, too young to
        understand, is watching TV with the Killer Dog.  Neil looks
        forward again as he hears his DAD'S CAR DRIVING AWAY -- and
        his mother comes back inside.  She puts an arm around him.

                  Your daddy and I are kind of mad
                  at each other right now, so we
                  have to spend some time apart.

                                HOLLY
                  Why are you mad at each other?

                                JULIE
                  You know how sometimes Neil bugs
                  you and you just get up and walk
                  away from him?

                  Uh huh.

                  Well, that's what happens with

                  Hurry up now, you'll be late for
                  school.


        EXT. DRIVEWAY - MORNING

        The kids get in the back of Julie's car.  She helps Holly
        with her seatbelt, then shuts the door and goes to the
        front.  As she's about to get in, a CLANKING NOISE makes
        her jump.  She turns -- seeing the garbage cans of the
        Nasty Neighbor's house -- and then the Nasty Neighbor
        himself, standing up from behind one of them.  He looks at
        her.  She instantly looks away, getting into her oar.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL - MORNING

        As we HEAR Julie's CAR DRIVING AWAY outside...  The Hider
        appears at the top of the stairs.  He strolls down as if
        he owns the place.  The Killer comes wandering in.  The
        Hider crouches down to pet him.  The Hider looks around <u>his</u>
        house, and starts to laugh.


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

        The Hider comes in.  His euphoria is building.  He opens
        a drawer -- to check that Phil has cleared his stuff out
        and really gone.


        INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

        The Hider opens the medicine cabinet to see that there's
        no shaving gear.  He notes an empty towel rack -- and sees
        that there's only one toothbrush now.


        INT. JULIE'S CAR - MORNING

        Driving away from the house -- when suddenly Holly bursts
        out crying.

                  Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and

                  Holly -- that's not so.

        Holly has a plastic container of orange juice with a spill-
        proof lid.  In her hysteria she flings it, the lid coming
        off, juice splashing all over Julie.

                                JULIE
                         (continuing)
                  Oh, Holly!


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

        The Hider falls onto the bed, laughing, rolling over,
        pulling the comforter around him like a shroud.  It's all
        his now, he's the man.  He sits up with a start when he
        hears SOMEONE COMING up the stairs.

        The Hider is hiding in here.  Peeking out at her.  Watching
        her undress.


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM

        Julie goes into the adjoining bathroom, washing out the
        orange juice.  She comes out of the bathroom and goes to
        the closet.  She takes out another dress and starts to put
        it on.


        INT. DOWNSTAIRS - MORNING

        Julie comes back down to where her kids are waiting.  Holly
        isn't crying anymore, but looks sulky.

                  All right, now come on,

        Neil is sitting at an outdoor table, reading a comic book,
        when he hears an OMINOUS SOUND -- a kind of limping SHUFFLE
        coming toward him.  He dare not turn around, but he doesn't
        have to, because the Bully, walking with the help at a
        crutch, appears and sits down next to Neil.

                                BULLY
                         (very matter of fact)
                  My friends have been expelled.

                  <u>You're</u> gonna be my friend now.

        The Bully gets up awkwardly and we HEAR his limping SHUFFLE
        moving away.  Neil just sits here and wonders why God
        despises him.

        Julie is watering plants.  Moving deeper into the garden,
        reaching to spray water at out-of-the-way bushes, she comes
        upon a little hidden patch of flowerbed that she certainly
        never noticed before -- because now it boasts a lovely
        group of roses that have only recently bloomed.


        INT. THE HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY

        The washing machine is going.  Julie is folding clothes
        that are already done.  Abruptly the washing machine stops

        sure that the door is properly closed, but it seems to be
        broken.


        INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

        Julie looks sad.  She doesn't know what to do with herself.
        She pets the Killer Dog.  She hears a COMMOTION outside and
        goes to look out the window.


        JULIE'S POV

        She sees the Nasty Neighbor and his Wife shouting at each
        other -- and the Nasty Neighbor's Wife getting into a car
        with another man and driving off.  The Nasty Neighbor just
        makes some crude gesture at the departing car and goes back
        into his house.

        Julie opens the refrigerator, but the light doesn't come
        on.  She checks the plug.  The refrigerator is broken now,
        too.  She can't stand it.  She slams the door, having a
        fit, starting to cry,

                                HIDER
                  -- General handyman, yeah.  I do
                  carpentry, too, painting, almost
                  any odd job around the house.  I
                  do housesitting while the owners
                  are away.  In fact, that's why
                  I've been in the area.  I've been
                  living very close by.
                         (he stands up)
                  Here's the part that's giving you
                  trouble, but I won't be able to
                  get a replacement till the stores
                  open tomorrow morning.

                                JULIE
                  Oh, that's fine.

        The Hider puts the part in his toolbox.

                                HIDER
                  I'll call you when I have the
                  part.

        EXT. BACK PATIO - NIGHT

        Holly is playing with the Killer Dog.  Julie is reclining
        in a deck chair, talking to Rita on the phone.

                                JULIE
                  Well, of course I'm upset, Rita.
                  No, I <u>don't</u> want to go out.

        Neil climbs out of the swimming pool, notices something
        <u>glistening</u> in the grass not far away.  He goes toward it.

        Holly giggles as she twists the Killer Dog's face into
        various grotesque expressions.

                                HOLLY
                  Look, Mommy, look at Edgar.

        Neil picks up -- <u>the whistle</u>.

        Holly pulls the Killer Dog's gums apart.

                                HOLLY
                         (doing dog voice)
                  "Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"
                         (turns to Julie)
                  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt
                  him.

                                JULIE
                         (on phone)
                  Well, what do you want me to do,
                  Rita -- I can't just forget
                  fifteen years of marriage.  Well,
                  of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No,
                  Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh,
                  I thought I heard something on the
                  line.

        Neil starts cleaning the whistle on his towel.

                                NEIL
                  Look what I found.

        He puts it to his mouth.  Holly is spreading the Killer
        Dog's jaws playfully.  Neil's cheeks start to puff out as
        he blows.  Holly giggles.  Neil blows the whistle with all
        his might -- but nothing comes out but PHFFT.  The dent in
        it has ruined it.  Neil throws the whistle back down on the
        ground and goes to play with the dog, too.

                                                   CUT TO:


        EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

        The Hider returns home.  He notices the whistle on the
        ground.  He picks it up and looks at it, alarmed at himself
        for being so careless.  He puts it back in his pocket.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Julie is showing the Hider a section of the floor that
        seems to be damaged.

                                HIDER
                  Well, I'll tell you -- the only
                  way of making sure this doesn't
                  spread is to double-coat it with
                  sealant before putting the varnish
                  on top.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. KITCHEN - DAY

        Humming to himself, the Hider washes some rags in the sink.
        He rinses them and walks breezily out of the kitchen,
        bumping smack into --


        THE BULLY!

        Who's coming in with Neil.  The Bully almost loses his
        balance but the Hider catches him.

                                HIDER
                  Excuse me.


        THE HIDER

        Walking past -- his face suddenly covered with a film of
        sweat.  Jesus, <u>that kid</u> is the one person who's seen him
        before.


        THE BULLY

        continues into the kitchen with Neil.

                                BULLY
                  Was that your dad?

                                NEIL
                  Nah, that's some guy fixing the
                  living room floor.

        Something nags at the Bully.  He looks over his shoulder.


        EXT. FRONT DRIVEWAY

        Julie is pruning some hedges.  She's startled by the
        appearance of the Nasty Neighbor, carrying some flowers to
        present to her.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                  Hello there.

                                JULIE
                  Oh -- hi.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                         (handing her flowers)
                  I've been cleaning up my yard, too
                  -- I noticed you do some
                  gardening.  Thought you might like
                  these.

        (The flowers are not very nice.)

                                JULIE
                  Oh -- well -- thank you, Mr.
                  Stone.


        INT. LIVING ROOM

        The Hider works on the floor.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        Julie comes in, followed by the Nasty Neighbor.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                  Yeah, I've been meaning to drop
                  by -- just in case you needed
                  anything.


        INT. LIVING ROOM

        The Hider looks over his shoulder at the Nasty Neighbor.
        The Hider seethes with territorial jealousy.


        INT. DINING ROOM

        Julie reaches for a tall glass container on a high shelf.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                  Here, lemme get that.

        Damn it, thinks the Hider in the b.g., he's acting like a
        man.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                         (continuing)
                  Because, you know, I couldn't help
                  noticing that we have a lot in
                  common.

        He's leaning in the kitchen doorway while she fills the
        container with water.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                         (continuing)
                  Yeah, y'know, both of us with
                  recent spousal disappearance.

                                JULIE
                         (how can she get rid
                          of this guy?)
                  Ah.


        INT. LIVING ROOM

        The Hider turns away and hunches over the floor as he sees
        Neil and the Bully come back out of the kitchen, walking
        this way.  A chill runs through the Hider.

                                BULLY
                  So where are all your toys?

                                NEIL
                  Let's watch some TV.

                                BULLY
                  Where are these toys of yours?

                                NEIL
                  A lot of my stuff hasn't been
                  unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.

                                BULLY
                  What toys do you have?

        The Hider has to turn away even more.  The Bully keeps
        looking over at him.

                                NEIL
                         (turning on TV)
                  Hey, look -- the new Pretenders
                  video.

        The Bully glances over at the Hider.  Something preying on
        the Bully's mind.  He tries to get a better look.  The
        Hider tries to hunch out of the way even more, sweat
        breaking out again on his forehead.

        He feels the eyes of the Bully on his back.  Now it's his
        turn to be scared -- of this <u>kid</u>.  Also, he's anxious to
        keep track of what his <u>rival</u> from next door is doing with
        Julie.  It's a horrible situation from any angle.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        Julie tries to show the Nasty Neighbor to the door.

                                JULIE
                  Well, thanks again.

        But the Nasty Neighbor steps into the living room.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                  Say, this is a nice den.

        Without looking, he backs into the Hider's work area by the
        doorway, accidentally kicking the Hider.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                         (continuing)
                  Whoops.  Excuse me, pal.

        The Hider might as well be invisible.  He doesn't notice
        the Hider's look of hatred.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                         (continuing; coming
                          out to entrance hall
                          again)
                  Okay then, you have my number,
                  gimme me a call sometime.

                                JULIE
                  Yeah, right.

        She closes the door on him, sighs, and goes off into the
        kitchen.


        INT. LIVING ROOM

        The Bully, with his crutch, is struggling closer to the
        Hider.

                                BULLY
                  I don't wanna watch TV.

        He's trying to see the Hider's face.

                                NEIL
                  Hey, look what's on cable,
                  Bernard!

        The Bully turns to see a woman undress on TV.  This
        interests him.  The Hider, drenched in sweat, seizes the
        moment and stands up to walk out.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        The Hider comes out of the living room breathing a sigh of
        relief.  He keeps his back turned as Neil and the Bully now
        come out.

                                BULLY
                  Show me your room <u>now</u>.

        They go upstairs.  But now the Hider is scared by the front
        door suddenly opening!  Phil has come back.

                                PHIL
                  Oh, uh -- hi... I --

        The Hider just gestures Phil in and escapes through the
        dining room to the kitchen -- passing Julie, who's coming
        out again.  She's expecting to see the Nasty Neighbor
        again, doesn't know whether she's relieved to see her
        husband instead.

                                PHIL
                  Who was that?

                                JULIE
                  I'm having the floor fixed,

                                PHIL
                  And what was that neighbor guy
                  doing here?

                                JULIE
                  Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?

                                PHIL
                  Look, I think we should work
                  things out.


        INT. KITCHEN

        Hider has his back against a wall, breathing hard.  He
        can hear them.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        Julie folds her arms as she listens.

                                PHIL
                  I was having a bad day -- I lost
                  that job, I was dependent on other
                  people, I was let down --

                                JULIE
                  There's always an excuse, isn't
                  there?

                                PHIL
                  I think it's time I came home now.

                                JULIE
                  That's not a decision for you to
                  make on your own.


        INT. KITCHEN

        Yes!  Overhearing that brightens the Hider's spirits.  He
        hugs the Killer Dog.  Everything's going to be okay, after
        all.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        Phil pretends to be shocked.

                                PHIL
                  What?

                                JULIE
                  No, Philip, I don't want you
                  coming back here.  And if you want
                  to talk to me -- <u>call</u>.

                                PHIL
                         (storms out angrily)
                  This is my house.


        INT. KITCHEN

        As he hears the DOOR SLAM, the Hider leans back against the
        wall with a happy sigh.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

        Julie watches the Hider work.

                                JULIE
                  I apologize for that scene with
                  my husband.  You must have
                  overheard.

                                HIDER
                  An occupational hazard, I'm
                  afraid.

                                JULIE
                  I bet.  Going into people's homes.

                                HIDER
                  It's a living.

        Julie tilts her head slightly, studying him.  There's
        certainly something compelling about this quiet man.  He's
        leaning forward, muscles rippling in his strong arm.

                                JULIE
                  Do you have a family?

                                HIDER
                  Uh, no -- I've never really found
                  the time to settle down.

                                JULIE
                  You must value your independence.

                                HIDER
                  Yeah, I've always been able to
                  make my way in the world.  I don't
                  like having to rely on other
                  people.

                                JULIE
                  It's nice that you can make that
                  choice.

                                HIDER
                  I was alone a lot as a child.  No
                  one to compete with.  My parents
                  ensured that I found happiness in
                  the smallest things.  When you're
                  all alone it's your own world, you
                  don't have to take orders from
                  anybody.  You don't necessarily
                  believe the stories people tell

                         (laughs)
                  Not me, I fell for it right
                  down the line.  Be a good girl and
                  believe all the fairy tales.

                  pretty.

                                HIDER
                  Because you <u>were</u> pretty?

        She looks back at him.  Smiles at the compliment.  He looks
        back at her again and could almost die from the pleasure of
        her smile.

        The Therapist looks happy for the Hider.

                                THERAPIST
                  Well, these are good signs --
                  she's broken up with him and the
                  two of you seem to be developing
                  quite a rapport.

                                HIDER
                  I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the
                  relationship has reached that
                  delicate stage where the slightest
                  little thing could wreck the
                  careful groundwork I've laid up
                  till now.

                                THERAPIST
                  I can't help you if you don't help
                  yourself.  It's really up to you.
                  Brooding endlessly isn't going to
                  help matters any.

                                HIDER
                  There's so much I want to say to
                  her, it's all jumbled up in my
                  mind, and I don't want her to
                  misunderstand --

                                THERAPIST
                  Well, you'll just have to <u>make</u> her
                  understand.

        EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

        Lights off.  Street quiet.


        INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Julie is asleep.  Alone in her bed.  In the dark room.


        EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT

        The Hider approaches his special part of the wall.  In the
        shadows, his face is intense.  This is it.  He knows what
        he has to do.  He starts climbing the wall.  He's halfway
        up it -- when a FLASHLIGHT BEAM hits his face!!

                                VOICE
                  Come down here.

        The Hider climbs back down, shielding his eyes against the
        flashlight.  The voice laughs, the beam lowering.  It's the
        Nasty Neighbor.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                  Well now, what do we have here?
                         (chuckles nastily,
                          glancing up wall)
                  You got a pretty good deal goin'
                  here, buddy.

        The Hider is looking more desperate by the second.

                                NASTY NEIGHBOR
                         (continuing)
                  I believe I've seen you hanging
                  around here before, haven't I?
                  Correct me if I'm wrong.
                         (suddenly his eyes
                          bulge)
                  OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

        And the Hider's face is <u>wild</u> with madness -- as he jams
        something against the Nasty Neighbor's stomach -- again and
        again and again -- stab after stab -- the strength of the
        Hider's arm lifting the Nasty Neighbor up off his feet --
        as the Hider eviscerates him with -- a steel gardening
        trowel, the sharp point ripping the Nasty Neighbor's guts
        open, tearing upwards; the Nasty Neighbor's mouth gaping
        with the shock of it.

        INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

        The Hider stands over Julie's bed.  Watching her sleep.
        His eyes are completely crazy now, completely obsessed.
        His clothes are splattered with blood.  He's snapped and
        their time together has come.

        And yet, for a moment, something still holds him back.
        She's so beautiful.  Tears come once more to the Hider's
        eyes.  We SEE that he's building to a kind of crescendo of
        emotion.  It's now or never.  He begins to breathe quicker,
        he begins to move, to reach for her -- but suddenly the
        bedroom door is pushed all the way open -- the Hider
        managing to dart behind it just in time -- as Neil comes
        rushing into his mother's bedside.

                                NEIL
                  Mom, Mom, wake up, Mom --

        Julie wakes up.  Neil is holding a baseball bat,

                                JULIE
                  Neil -- what --

                                NEIL
                  Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u>
                  <u>house</u>!

                                JULIE
                         (sitting up)
                  Honey --

                                NEIL
                  Mom, I heard someone downstairs!

        Julie quickly gets out of bed, reaching for the bedside
        phone and the emergency pad she keeps there.


        BLOODY HIDER BEHIND THE DOOR

        Horrified.  Frozen.  Not daring to breathe.


        JULIE

        speaks softly into the phone.

                                JULIE
                  Hello -- can you please help me
                  -- I think there's an intruder in
                  my house.  Yes, we heard someone
                  moving downstairs.  I live on
                  Coral Avenue -- number five
                  eleven.


        BLOODY HIDER BEHIND THE DOOR

        OhmyGod, OhmyGod, OhmyGod -- he tries to melt even more
        into the wall as he hears Julie HANG UP and grab Neil and
        move out of the room.


        INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

        Julie and Neil go into Holly's room -- and the Hider darts
        out -- and into Neil's room as he hears JULIE COMING OUT
        again.

                                JULIE
                         (quietly)
                  Edgar!  <u>Edgar</u>!


        INT. NEIL'S ROOM

        Edgar, the Killer Dog, moves placidly past the Hider in
        answer to Julie's call.  The Hider, desperate, is scared
        by his own reflection in Neil's mirror.  He brings a hand
        to his face, realizing -- Jesus, if she sees it's <u>me</u>!  He
        looks around -- and sees Neil's full-head mask of a bearded
        man.


        INT. HOLLY'S ROOM

        Holly sits up in bed.  Neil shushes her, staying by her
        side protectively with his baseball bat.  Julie ushers the
        Killer Dog into the room with them and shuts the door,
        though not all the way so she can still watch and listen.

                                JULIE
                         (holding Killer Dog)
                  You stay with us, Edgar.

        INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

        The Hider has the bearded-man mask stretched grotesquely
        over his head.  He peeks first, then darts out of Neil's
        room and straight downstairs.


        INT. HOLLY'S ROOM

        Julie couldn't see him from here, but she does hear the
        CREAKS on the stairs.


        INT. DOWNSTAIRS

        The Hider pauses at the bottom of the stairs, looking back
        up, then turns in the darkness toward the front door and
        -- HOLY SHIT! -- runs smack into <u>Phil</u>!  Phil was the
        intruder downstairs!  And he's just as shocked to run into
        the Hider.  Immediately, the Hider clamps a hand over
        Phil's mouth -- and Phil starts fighting for his life.


        INT. HOLLY'S ROOM

        Julie and the kids hear the COMMOTION downstairs, sounds
        that are all the more frightening because they don't know
        what they are.  For all they know it's one maniac down
        there destroying the house.  Then they hear a CRY in the
        night:

                                VOICE
                  <u>Get out of my house</u>!

        But is it the husband or the Hider?  The Killer Dog barks.


        INT. LIVING ROOM

        CRASH! -- the two men come tumbling in here -- and in the
        air above them, gripped by both of them in their struggle
        -- the shiny gardening trowel.  Phil's eyes are wild with
        fear as he battles his unknown assailant, the hideous
        expressionless bearded-man mask looming above him.


        INT. HOLLY'S ROOM

        The SAVAGE NOISES from downstairs continue.  Holly starts
        crying, Neil comforting her.

                                HOLLY
                  Mommy!

                                JULIE
                         (joins them in a
                          scared huddle)
                  It's okay, baby, the police are
                  coming.


        EXT. THE STREET

        Distant SIRENS pierce the quiet of the neighborhood.


        INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

        The Hider's fingers lose the gardening trowel.  Phil
        manages to keep hold of it, ramming it against the Hider's
        rib cage.  The Hider <u>shrieks</u> in pain -- then slams his fist
        across Phil's head.  The gardening trowel goes skittling
        across the floor.  The Hider is out of control, on the
        rampage, insane with fury -- he punches off the mantelpiece
        the second green vase, SMASHING it into a million pieces.


        INT. HOLLY'S ROOM

        Julie and the kids jump at the scary NOISE from downstairs.


        INT. LIVING ROOM

        The Hider advances on Phil, who's groggily trying to get
        up, shaking his head.


        EXT. THE STREET

        The police car comes around the corner.


        INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

        The Hider is <u>kicking</u> Phil.  The gardening trowel is on the
        floor near Phil's hand.  The Hider looks up as the FLASHING
        RED LIGHT of the police car starts swirling around the room
        from the street outside, and he hears the STATIC CRACKLE
        of the POLICE RADIO.

        Phil grabs the trowel and slams it into the Hider's leg,
        With a groan muffled by his mask, the Hider staggers out
        of the living room.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        Limping, the Hider stumbles through to the dining room.
        Phil comes after him, throwing open the front door and
        punching the appropriate button on the security box that
        sets off the ALARM BELL!


        INT. HOLLY'S ROOM

        Julie shoots to her feet at the SOUND of this.


        INT. KITCHEN

        The Hider runs in, heading for the laundry room and the
        back door there.  He's the intruder trying to escape now,
        Suddenly, he's hit on the head from behind.  He falls.
        It's Phil trying to stop him, clubbing him again with the
        phone.  The Hider wrestles it away from him, wrapping the
        super-long flex cord around Phil's neck, strangling him,
        wrapping it tighter, pull it harder, and Phil is choking
        and the masked Hider is out of his mind -- and then the
        SOUND of POLICE RADIOS -- and the Hider has to run again.
        Phil still trying to hold onto him, but the Hider gets hold
        of the phone and beats Phil's head with it.  Then the Hider
        escapes outside, still staggering.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        TWO COPS come in, guns drawn, looking around -- hearing the
        NOISE from the kitchen, running that way.


        INT. KITCHEN

        Getting rid of the cord around his neck, Phil stumbles
        onward in the darkness toward the back door -- as the Cops
        appear behind him, pointing their guns.

                                COP #1
                  Hold it!

                                PHIL

                  I'm the owner, I'm the owner!
                         (pointing outside)
                  He's out there -- he's out there!

        Cop #1 keeps his gun on Phil as his partner goes out.  Phil
        is shaking with fear and exhaustion.  He manages to extract
        his wallet from his pocket to show the Cop his ID.

                                PHIL
                         (continuing)
                  Look -- I live here -- I live
                  here.

                                COP #2 (O.S.)
                  Frank!

        Cop #1 and Phil go out.


        EXT. BACK PATIO

        Cop #2 is standing over the pool.  The body of the man in
        the bearded-man mask floats in the pool.

                                PHIL
                         (sinks to his knees)

        Neighborhood people have come out of their homes to see

        outside the house now -- and an ambulance.


        EXT. BACK OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT

        While the body in the pool is being fished in and pulled
        out, Phil and Julie talk with the police officers.  One of
        the police officers holds up the gardening trowel.  Phil
        is being tended to Paramedics.

                                PHIL
                  Yes, I used that first of all --
                  then I just kept hitting him.

                                COP #1
                  And you were upstairs the whole
                  time, ma'am?

                                JULIE
                  Yes -- I didn't know what was
                  going on.

        She looks at Phil.  He looks back at her with a little
        pleading look of understanding in his eyes.

                                PHIL
                  Yeah, <u>we</u> were upstairs when we
                  heard the intruder.  My wife
                  called the police and I went
                  downstairs.


        THE BODY IN THE POOL

        is now laid dripping on the ground.  Someone starts to peel
        off the mask.


        JULIE AND PHIL

        don't really want to look, but have to.

                                JULIE

                                PHIL
                  Yeah -- we know him.  He's been
                  hanging around the house.


        THE BODY

        It's the Nasty Neighbor, his face still looking shocked as
        it was when the Hider first killed him.

        come back to this room.

        The last of the police leave.

                                VOICE
                  Julie?

        Julie turns around.  It's the Hider.

                                HIDER
                         (breathless)
                  I was driving by -- I saw all the
                  cars.  Are you all right?

                                JULIE
                  Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long
                  night.

                                HIDER
                         (seeing all the mess)
                  What happened?

                                JULIE
                  Can I tell you tomorrow?  I think
                  I...

        She suddenly puts a trembling hand to her head.  The Hider
        grips her arms reassuringly.

                                HIDER
                  Look, you don't have to say
                  another word...  You should have
                  some tea, it'll make you feel
                  better.  And I'll clean up a bit.

        She nods -- as the Nice Neighbor Woman comes down the
        stairs with Neil.  Neil still holds his baseball bat.  He's
        clearly being the little man of the house.

                                NICE WOMAN
                  Holly is asleep.

                                JULIE
                  Oh, Audrey, thank you.

        Neil glances in the living room where the Hider is
        neatening up.

                                NEIL
                  Hi, Mr. Sykes.

                                HIDER
                  Hi, Neil -- you've had quite a
                  night.

                                NEIL
                  Yeah, but I'm okay.

                                JULIE
                  Honey, do you want some hot
                  chocolate?

                                NEIL
                  No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to
                  bed now.

                                JULIE
                  Do you want me to come up and tuck
                  you in?

                                NEIL
                         (brave)
                  That's okay, Mom.

        Julie realizes how protective Neil is being, gives him a
        hug and a kiss.

                                JULIE
                  You were very brave tonight.

        Neil, cool, turns to go back upstairs.

                                NEIL
                  'Night, Mr. Sykes.

                                HIDER
                  Goodbye, Neil.

        Julie shows the Nice Neighbor Woman to the door.

                                JULIE
                  Audrey...
                         (gives her a hug)
                  ... you've been wonderful.  Good
                  night.

        She leaves and Julie shuts the front door.

                                                   CUT TO:


        INT. KITCHEN

        Julie and the Hider are here.  Julie puts the kettle on.
        Then she gives the Killer Dog some food.

                                HIDER
                  I was thinking about our
                  conversation the other day -- what
                  you said about choices.

                                JULIE
                         (preoccupied)
                  Uh huh.

                                HIDER
                  Yeah, you know, that in life you
                  really have to choose what you
                  want to do.

                                JULIE
                         (sensing a big
                          discussion)
                  Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really
                  late -- you don't have to come
                  tomorrow to work on the floor.

                                HIDER
                  It is tomorrow.

        The kettle is starting to percolate.

                                JULIE
                  Yeah, right -- I really have to
                  go to bed.

                                HIDER
                  I think we should talk first.

        The water is starting to boil.  The cap of the kettle gives
        a little BLOW.  The jaws of the Killer Dog savagely munch
        his food.

                                JULIE
                  About what?

                                HIDER
                  About us.

                                JULIE
                  Mr. Sykes, I think you should go
                  home.

        The Hider gives a little smile, but doesn't move.

                                JULIE
                         (continuing)
                  I think you should leave.

        The Hider tenses.  Julie sees that he's had two totally
        different reactions to what she thought was the same
        statement in each case.

                                JULIE
                         (continuing)
                  Don't you understand?

        The Hider moves a step closer.

                                HIDER
                         (gently)
                  Yes, <u>I</u> do understand...
                         (beginning to repeat
                          himself)
                  ... I was thinking about our
                  conversation the other day -- what
                  you said about choices.

        The kettle begins a LOW WHISTLE.  The Killer Dog's ears
        perk up.  He's been activated.

                                HIDER
                         (continuing)
                  You decided that Philip should
                  stay away.  You made your choice.

        Julie, sensing real danger now, glances at the kettle of
        boiling water.  The WHISTLE continues to get HIGHER IN
        PITCH.

                                HIDER
                         (continuing; carried
                          away by his own
                          internal logic)
                  Now things are the way they're
                  supposed to be.  I <u>fixed</u> things
                  in this house.

        As the WHISTLE BUILDS the Killer Dog turns.  Nobody is
        approaching the kettle at the moment, so the Killer Dog
        doesn't know what to do.

                                JULIE
                  I don't know what's going on with
                  you --

        Now she notices -- <u>blood</u> starting to seep through his
        trouser leg.

                                JULIE
                         (continuing)
                  -- I don't know who you are, I
                  don't know anything about you.

        She measures the distance between her and the WHISTLING
        KETTLE.  The Killer Dog goes into a crouch.

                                HIDER
                  I have to show my feelings.  I
                  have to take action.


        THE KETTLE

        The WHISTLE reaches its HIGHEST PITCH.


        JULIE

        rushes toward it.


        THE KILLER DOG

        springs at Julie!


        THE HIDER

        throws himself in front of the Killer Dog.  As the dog
        starts to tear him apart --

                                HIDER
                  -- Julie --


        JULIE

        drops the kettle, starts backing out of the kitchen in
        terror.


        INT. DINING ROOM

        Julie comes backing out from the kitchen, the kitchen door
        swinging closed after her.  She keeps backing away, her
        hand to her mouth in horror as we HEAR the HORRIFIC
        MAULING, SNARLING, GROWLING from the kitchen.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        The AWFUL SOUNDS continue as Julie in a daze keeps backing
        further and further away.


        EXT. THE HOUSE

        The street is empty, the neighborhood quiet -- except for
        the SOUNDS we HEAR of the Hider in the house being torn to
        bits.

        And the CAMERA STARTS CRANING UP once more... up to the top
        of the house, moving in on that small vent up there.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        All his stuff still here.  And his PHONE... which starts
        to RING.


        INT. KITCHEN

        The PHONE RINGING in here, too, and OVER the savage MAULING
        SOUNDS the ANSWER MACHINE CLICKS on.


        INT. ENTRANCE HALL

        Julie backing away.

                                JULIE (V.O.)
                         (on machine)
                  Hi, we can't come to the phone
                  right now -- please leave your
                  message after the beep.

        BEEP.


        INT. KITCHEN

        There's blood splashed on the walls.  The SNARLING is
        starting to subside, CHEWING SOUNDS continuing.

                                PHIL (V.O.)
                         (on machine)
                  Hi, hon, I'm still at the
                  hospital, but everything's fine.


        INT. HIDER'S SECRET ROOM

        We PAN around the Hider's belongings, his shelf, his
        bulletin board...

                                PHIL (V.O.)
                  ... I really do think it's time
                  for me to come home.

        ... his sign that says:  "ALWAYS REMEMBER TO UNPLUG THE
        PHONE!!!"

                                PHIL (V.O.)
                  You and the kids should have a man
                  around the house.

        GROWL.

                                                   FADE OUT.


                                <u>THE END</u>
