Annie is hitting bottom: in Milwaukee, her bakery is shuttered, her boyfriend gone, her flatmates hideous, and she puts up with Ted, an uncaring occasional sex partner.
But she has Lillian, her best friend since childhood.
When Lillian gets engaged, she asks Annie to be her maid of honor and introduces her to the four bridesmaids, an eclectic group that includes Helen, Lillian's wealthy and beautiful new friend.
Helen instantly gets under Annie's skin, and competition for Lillian's affection and confidence ensues.
Helen undercuts Annie's ideas, and Annie is soon out of control.
Even Rhodes, a friendly attentive cop, can't calm her.
Will Annie lose Lillian's friendship and more?
