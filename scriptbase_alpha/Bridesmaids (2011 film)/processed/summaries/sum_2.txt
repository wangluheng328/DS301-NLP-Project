In Milwaukee, thirty-something Annie Walker's life is falling apart.
Despite her baking acumen, her retail cake store, Cake Baby, failed leaving her finances in rough shape.
By strings pulled by her mother, she now works in a low paying job as a jewelry store clerk, which she hates.
She is forced to share an apartment with socially inept siblings Gil and Brynn, who don't respect her personal boundaries.
And she is in a dysfunctional relationship with misogynistic Ted, who treats her solely as a third string sex partner only whenever it suits his mood.
The only bright light in her life is that her BFF Lillian has announced that she's getting married to her boyfriend Doug, and has asked Annie to be her maid of honor.
At the engagement party, Annie meets the other bridesmaids for the first time: Lillian's marriage cynical cousin Rita, Lillian's idealistic newlywed friend Becca, Doug's brash sister Megan, and Doug's boss' seemingly perfect and wealthy wife Helen.
Immediately, Annie and Helen are in open competition not only to organize Lillian's bridal festivities, but to be Lillian's BFF.
As Annie seems to be losing the competition at every turn, another bright light enters her life in the form of police officer Nathan Rhodes, his entry into her life which she resists due in part to the other failures in her life.
Officer Rhodes may only be able to take so much before giving up on Annie.
As Annie seems to be losing Lillian's friendship to perfect Helen, only truly understanding what each wants may bring all the parties closer together.
