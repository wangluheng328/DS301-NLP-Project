Amy is an architect who works for perfection.
She takes a vacation at a small town health spa where she meets Virgil, a blind masseur.
She falls in love with him for the senses he loves that she takes for granted.
They listen to the rain, they make love, and then she does research on restoring sight he hasn't had since he was one year old.
He joins her in New York and undergoes the treatment only to find that seeing doesn't mean comprehending what one sees.
The difficult road to understanding the visual world tests their relationship.
The strain is taken to the limits when Virgil begins to lose his sight once again.
