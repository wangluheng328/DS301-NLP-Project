Once again, New York cop John McClane is in the wrong place at the wrong time - this time he's waiting for his wife's plane to arrive at Washington's Dulles Airport when he uncovers a plot to sabotage the airport's landing system.
The criminals wish to free a drug baron being extradited to America for trial by holding the airport to ransom until they all safely escape on another plane.
However, if they'd known that Holly McClane was on a flight home to the very airport they were hijacking, they would have picked another day.
