It is the 23rd Century and vacationing Captain Kirk faces two challenges: climbing Yosemite's El Capitan and teaching campfire songs to Spock.
But vacations are cut short when a renegade Vulcan with a startling secret hijacks the Enterprise in order to find a mythical planet.
Kirk and his crew set out to stop this madman in an adventure that takes them to the center of the universe and, perhaps, before the face of God.
With the crew under Vulcan control, the captain must rely on an unlikely alliance to save the galaxy.
