The year is 1962.
USAF U-2 spy planes discover that the USSR is placing nuclear ballistic missiles in Cuba.
The Chiefs of Staff warn President Kennedy and his cabinet that the missiles have the potential to kill up to 80 million Americans, and destroy a large number of USAF bomber bases - thus crippling the Americans' ability to retaliate and leaving the country an easy target for Soviet invasion.
Fortunately, the missiles are not yet operational, and the President and his staff try to figure out how to get the missiles out of Cuba - whether by diplomatic means or by force.
Initially, diplomatic attempts fail as the Soviets lie and stonewall the President.
Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara comes up with a different plan - a naval blockade of Cuba to keep new missiles from reaching the country.
When the Russians ignore the blockade and try to run it, things quickly go from bad to worse.
Will the Americans & Soviets come to a peaceful settlement - or will nuclear war result?
