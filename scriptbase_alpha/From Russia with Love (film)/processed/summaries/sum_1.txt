The SPECTRE Number 1 assigns the SPECTRE Number 3, Rosa Klebb, an ex-SMERSH operative before defecting from Russia, and the SPECTRE Number 5 and expert planner Kronsteen to plot a scheme to steal the Russian's Lektor decoder and revenge on James Bond for killing Dr. No.
Rosa Klebb recruits the SPECTRE assassin Grant and lures the naive and loyal Russian Corporal State Security Tatiana Romanova, who works at the Soviet consulate in Istanbul and believes that Rosa Klebb still works for SMERSH.
Meanwhile M summons James Bond and tells that Tatiana wants to defect to London and has offered the Lektor as part of the bargain.
However, she wants to go to England with Bond.
Bond and M suspect that it might be a trap, but Bond sees Tatiana's photo and decides to go to Istanbul, where he has the support of the local operative Kerim Bey.
He meets Tatiana and they plot a plan to steal the Lektor and return to London.
But they do not know that they are actually pawns in the scheme plotted by SPECTRE.
