The evil SPECTRE organization has hatched a plan to steal a decoder that will access Russian state secrets and irrevocably unbalance the world order.
It is up to James Bond to seize the device first, but he must confront enemies that include Red Grant and the ruthless Rosa Klebb -- a former KGB agent with poison-tipped shoes.
Even as Bond romances a stunning Soviet defector, he realizes he is being lured into a deadly trap, and he will need all of his courage, ability and cutting-edge technology to triumph over the forces that seek to destroy him.
