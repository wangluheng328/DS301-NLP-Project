The Fellowship divides to conquer as Frodo and Sam, with the help and hindrance of Gollum, continue their way to Mount Doom.
Gandalf and Pippin ride to Minas Tirith to help defend Gondor while Merry remains with Eowyn and the other Rohan fighters.
Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli seek aid from those that live in the Cursed Mountains.
All these battles have one goal in mind: distract the Eye of Sauron and buy Frodo a little more time to destroy the ring.
