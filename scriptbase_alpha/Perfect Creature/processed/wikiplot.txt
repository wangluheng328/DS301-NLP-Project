In the slums 300 years ago, male children began to be born as vampires.
They have enhanced hearing, sight, agility, stamina and reflexes.
In this reality, vampires are considered a more perfect version of humans; i.e.
closer to God and constitute an elite.
They have created a church and are called "Brothers".
They wear unadorned, long black coats, and appear monk-like.
The Brothers state they exist only to serve humans; to protect and guide them.
Brothers live longer than humans; the oldest is over 300 years old and as yet none have died.
Vampires are removed from their mothers at birth, indoctrinated into the Brotherhood, and raised to believe they are evolved humans whose role is to serve.

Human churchgoers donate blood for the Brothers to drink, though Brothers never drink blood straight from the human body.
Churchgoers wear rosaries; however not all humans are churchgoers.
During rare ceremonies humans drink the Brothers' blood, which gives them visions and some may experience prescience.
The liturgy of the church states that mingling the blood of the two races makes one titular "Perfect Creature".

Brothers hold religious education classes for human children.
They are taught that Brothers are a step in human evolution, and learn that genetic research is banned because nothing but evil comes from it â€“ the deadly influenza which is rife in the city, included.
Genetic research is banned for humans as a method of control by the Brothers so that humans are prevented from getting rid of vampires or gaining independence.
It was mentioned that before the co-existence of human and vampire, vampires were killed, at birth.
