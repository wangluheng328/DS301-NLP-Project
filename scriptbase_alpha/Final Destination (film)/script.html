<b>"FINAL DESTINATION"   
</b>
Originally Called "FLIGHT 180"

By James Wong and Glen Morgan



January 15, 1999



Awaiting......each of us; a cold...dark...lonely place.
Deny its finality. Deride its totality. Dread the inescapable
inevitability......it will arrive.

The BLACK SILENT SCREEN senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary band's cover of Blood, Sweat, and Tears' campy, yet haunting, gospel, "And When I Die."

As the Introduction closes, RESONATES... A FLASH OF LIGHTING!
<b>A CRACK OF THUNDER!
</b>
<b>                                                CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - BED
</b>
An airline ticket is tossed INTO FRAME beside a suitcase; "EURO-AIR. FLIGHT #180. New York City (JFK) - Paris, Charles de Gaulle (CDG.) Departure: Thursday 13May. 16H25 - Arrival: Friday 14May. 05H40."

"And When I Die" Continues throughout the MAIN TITLES:

<b>AN OLD TABLE FAN
</b>
swivels beside and open window. Outside, a humid spring THUNDER STORM drops warm, ominous rain. The figure of a seventeen year old boy, ALEX BROWNING, packing for a trip, passing the fan...

<b>THE BED
</b>
A Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages.

<b>THE TABLE FAN
</b>
turns, head swiveling away from the bed.

<b>TIGHTER - THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES
</b>
stop flipping, REVEALING A GULLOTINE from the Reign of Terror.
As an American passport is dropped beside the guidebook...

<b>THE TABLE FAN
</b>
swivels, returning towards the guidebook on the bed.

<b>THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES
</b>
FLIP. FLIP. FLIP. Alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. The fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a Louvre masterpiece, Francisco de Zurbarans Lying-in-the State of St. Bonaventura.

CAMERA CREEPS IN, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. The pages begin to turn once again.

<b>TIGHTER, OMINOUS ANGLE - THE DESK FAN
</b>
There is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. The boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze.

<b>THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES
</b>
stop dead on... Jim Morrison's decorated tomb in the Cemetiere du Pere Lachaise. A pilgrim has spray painted "This is the End." Which in fact, it is... of the MAIN TITLE.

<b>                        BARBARA
</b>            Alex...

CAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school "everyman."

One the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant;
"Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!"
Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious.

                        BARABRA (Cont'd)
            Tod and George's dad just called,
            he's picking you up at 10 in the 
		morning. Bus leaves the high school 
		for JFK at noon.

Barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son.


<b>                        KEN
</b>            My suitcase workin' out for ya?

Alex nods and buckles it. Barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage I.D. ticket attached from the previous flight.

<b>                       ALEX
</b>            Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave
            that on. It's like... the tag
            made the last flight without
            crashin' or anything, right?
            So, it should stay on, or with,
            the bag for good luck.

<b>                        BARBARA
</b>            Where would you get a nutball
            idea like that?


<b>EXTREMELY CLOSE - THE AIRLINE BAGGAGE MARKER
</b>
is torn away from the suitcase handle.

<b>RETURN
</b>
As Barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor... a dozen old baggage I.D. tickets spill from the outer compartment. She looks at Ken, as if "you?" The guilty party shrugs.

<b>                        KEN
</b>            I'm still here.

Barbara shakes her head as Alex smiles at his dad.

                        KEN (Cont'd)
            Seventeen and on the loose. Ten 
		days in Paris. In the springtime! 
		Live it up, Alex...

CAMERA INCHES INTO KEN as he winks at his son...

                        KEN (Cont'd)
            Got your whole life ahead of you.

<b>ALEX
</b>
CAMERA CREEPS IN as, oddly, the words strike him portentously...

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
The storm has ceased. The room is QUIET.

As if itself a presence, CAMERA CREEPS across the dark and motionless room TOWARD Alex, sleeping soundly. CAMERA CRANES DOWN to the level of the bed until Alex is in the f.g. and the room is visible behind him.

On the rear wall, the Fighting Colonials pennant begins to flutter slightly, as if affected by the moving breeze. The path of which is continued toward the bed, rustling the sheets, subtly blowing Alex's hair and continuing OVER CAMERA.

Even in his sleep, Alex shivers from the passing cold. His eyes open surprised to be suddenly awakened. He considers for a beat, then looks toward...

<b>THE WINDOWS
</b>
which... are closed.

<b>ALEX
</b>
puzzled, checks...

<b>THE TABLE FAN
</b>
which is off.

<b>ALEX
</b>
perplexed, rolls over toward his digital clock. It's 1:00 a.m., however... the middle digit bar in the first zero faintly flickers so this time appears to read... 1:80.

<b>                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.)
</b>                 (overlapping)
            Attention airline travelers...


<b>                                                 CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. JOHN F. KENNEDY AIRPORT - MORNING - TELEVISION MONITOR
</b>
FLIGHT 180 departs 4:25. Gate 39.

<b>                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.)
</b>            This airport does not support 
		solicitors...

CAMERA ADJUSTS FROM the "Arrival-Departure Schedule" to REVEAL forty high school KIDS, four TEACHERS and several PARENTS are gathered inside the International terminal at J.F.K. Several of the students wear Fighting Colonial leterman's jackets or hats and shirts displaying "Mt. Abraham High, New York."

<b>                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            You are not required to give money 
		to solicitors.

Alex gathers his bags, as does his best friend TOD WAGGNER and his older brother GEORGE WAGGNER, standing before their father, JERRY WAGGNER. For Alex, any psychic tension from the night before seems forgotten in the fun and excitement of the trip.

<b>                        MR. WAGGNER
</b>            Alright, you guys got everything?

<b>                        TOD
</b>            Yeah, we're all set Dad.

MR. MURNAU, the French teacher (any further description necessary?) and leader of the class trip waves his arm.

<b>                        MR. MURNAU
</b>            Les estudients, allons en France!

<b>                        MR. WAGGNER
</b>            Does that mean "go?"

Tod shrugs, "I guess" as he moves to his father and gives him a warm hug goodbye. Mr. Waggner then gives his older son a hug.

<b>                        AIRPORT P.A. (V.O.
</b>             Atencion senores pasajeros. No
             es necesario contribuir...

<b>                        MR. WAGGNER
</b>             I'll miss you guys.

Tod and George gives a wave, as does Alex, who is slapped on the back by Mr. Waggner.

<b>                        MR. WAGGNER
</b>             Take care of those two, Alex.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>             I will. Don't worry.

The group begins down the airport toward the check-in counter. In the f.g., before the boys, strides a girl, CLEAR RIVERS, 17, reading the TROPIC OF CANCER. The loner in the group, Clear wears dark colors against the insecerity of her sex appeal. She appears aloof and more wordly then the other students.

Readying his ticket and documents, Tod flips open his passport, checking out his photo.

<b>                        TOD
</b>           I didn't think anything could
           worse than my yearbook picture.

<b>                        GEORGE
</b>           Now you know how I feel havin' to 
	     look at you all the time.

<b>                        AIRPORT P.A.  (V.O.)
</b>           Avis aux passagers...

Mr. Murnau stops the group. Excited, he cups an ear with one hand while raising a finger toward the public address system.

<b>                        MR. MURNAU
</b>            Entendez classe, qu'est ce que
            c'est l'announce?

Everyone begrudgingly stops to listen.

<b>                        AIRPORT P.A. (O.S. CONT'D)
</b>            Vous n'etes pas dans l'obligation
            de contribuer aux demandes des 
		quemandeurs.

<b>CARTER HORTON
</b>
is the class dickhead who mix and matches his role models in the most superficial manner. His hand is tucked into his girlfriend, TERRY CHANEY'S, waistband...

<b>                        CARTER
</b>                 (re: MURNAU)
            What the fuck's he want?

Terry, hot now, but with no idea what time will do to her in just five years, smiles obsequiously and mouths "shh."

<b>                        P.A. SYSTEM (O.S., CONT'D)
</b>            cher aeroport n'est responsable
            pour leurs activities.

Mr. Murnau scans the group, his expression looking for an answer. Clear Rivers keeps her head in her book as...

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            The airport doesn't endorse 
		solicitors.

<b>                        MR. MURNAU
</b>            Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit!

She doesn't react. Her expression remains cool as Murnau leads the 
procession forward. The boys continue. Alex sighs...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with 
		that shit the whole time?

A hand reaches out to gently detain Alex. He looks up to find a HARE KRISHANA, dressed in everyday clothes, but head shaved and a mark on his nose.

<b>                        HARE KRISHANA
</b>            Death is not the end.

CAMARA PUSHES IN ON ALEX... unsettled by the soft spoken, yet ominous, "Solicitation." The Krishana offers a small book, REALITY BEYOND THE MATTER: VAISHNAVA PHILOSOPHY.

As he hands the book to Alex, a female form ENTERS FRAME between them. The women is MISS VALERIE LEWTON, 30, a feisty English teacher whose figure inspires all the boys' fantasies.

<b>                        MS. LEWTON
</b>            It will be for you if you harass
            my students.

She places a hand on Alex's shoulder, herding him to the group.

<b>                        HARE KRISHANA
</b>                 (pissy)
            Hare Rama.

Ms. Lewton turns and, while walking backward, flashes a smile...

<b>                        MS. LEWTON
</b>                 (mouths)
            Fuck off.

As she turns her back and continues down the terminal...

<b>                                                  CUT TO:

Alex's passport and ticket are set INTO FRAME and picked up by a female TICKET CLERK. Alex waits as she busily types into the computer and checks his passport...

<b>                        TICKET CLERK
</b>            I have a few questions to ask you

Carter Horton and his girlfriend, Terry, take cuts in line with smug, bullying expressions. Unseen by the chaperones, no student, has the nerve to protest Carter's action. Alex, Tod, George and BILLY HITCHCOCK, heavyset with a New York Rangers jersey watches Carter and Terry with disgust.

A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds.

Dead students sit lifeless in their seats.

Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky.

Wind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare.

SCREAM, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the ENGINES DIE. The cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. Debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff.

Alex's wild eyes and expression convey "no fucking kidding there's a problem." The flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode.

Carter reaches for Alex, who pushes back, trying to get out. Carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant, Tod, and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee.

The Co-Pilot arrives to secure the situation. He grabs Alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle.

A male flight attendant choke holds Carter from the back. Carter struggles but the attendant's postioning has the advantage. He begins removing Carter from the plane as well.

She follows the attendant, hitting him to help her boyfriend.

Arriving SECURITY OFFICERS quickly have control of the situation. Alex is taken to a seat at the gate and dropped there by the co-pilot, who, winded, eyes the officers.

<b>                        CO-PILOT
</b>            You got this?

The officers nod. One moves toward Carter as he dropped in a seat away from Alex. Terry sits behind Carter.

The co-pilot and attendants start back toward the plane. Ms. Lewton hustles over to them and an airline representitive.

<b>                        CO-PILOT
</b>            No one gets back on board. That's my

</b>            PLEASE... I've got forty students 
		going to Paris...

During these negotiations... CAMERA MOVES PAST Ms. Lewton and the Co-Pilot to the boarding ramp door...

Clear Rivers exits and takes a seat away from the others, aware she is unnoticed in the confusion. CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up toward...

CAMERA MATCHES THE MOVE TO HIM AS TOD and Mr. Murnau attempt to calm him down.

Rattled, Alex attempts to compose himself. Ms. Lewton appears, hurriedly pulling aside Mr. Murnau.

<b>                        MS. LEWTON
</b>             Airline's not taking this very well.
             They'll let one of us back on and
             the rest can grab a six-ten flight.
             Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle.
             It's alright. It's not that big of a

		Get on the plane.

Murnau understands this point and takes off toward the boarding ramp door. Pleading his case, Billy follows Murnau.

<b>                        BILLY
</b>            I was in the bathroom. The lock was 
		stuck. I didn't fight with anyone!

Hustling toward the door. Mr. Murnau gestures toward Ms. Lewton as if "talk to her." He disappears down the ramp. CAMERA PUSHES IN as airline personnel CLOSE THE DOOR...with an ominous THUD.

Tod races out of the bathroom with a dampened paper towel. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he hands it to Ms. Lewton seated next to Alex. The teacher places it on Alex's forehead.

Alex looks at Tod, who nods. His friend's expression is soothing and open. With lowered tense tone, meant for only the two people beside him...

Ms. Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances.

<b>                        ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>            And then the cabin banged and the

            Exactly how everything goes.

<b>                         TOD

Good point. Alex looks away.

<b>                         MS. LEWTON

Carter scoffs while moving aggressively toward Alex.

Carter makes a quick move and grabs Alex. The two security guards rush in to break it up. Chaos erupts agian as the two boys wrestle in the terminal.

In the b.g. the 747 head and taillights suddenly, violently, ERUPT into a gigantic fireball of flame.

It takes a few seconds for the CONCUSSION to hit the terminal, but when it does... BOOM! A window SHATTERS! Chairs rock! People are knocked off their feet.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO ALEX... stunned as he turns to the window...

<b>ALEX'S POV - FLIGHT 180

The unceremonious speed of obliteration of hundreds of lives is cruel as flaming debris plummets from the early evening sky.

Billy Hitchcock walks backward from the window, shocked by shocked step. Ms. Lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out.

O.S., ALARMS BEGIN. The two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties. O.S., OUTSIDE, SIRENS WAIL as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy.

CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE toward ALEX... as Tod's head turns toward him, then Terry's... then Carter's. In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms. Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him.

CAMERA CONTINUES. SIRENS PIERCING. The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in TIGHT as he looks out, frozen with shock... upon the doomed FLIGHT 180.

<b>SILENCE

A pair of Airline REPRESENTATIVES sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe... each feels uneasy by Alex's presance.

The others sit away from Alex and Tod. Alex appears wrought with guilt. He checks the others out of the corner of his eye.

<b>ALEX'S POV - THE ROOM
</b>
Ms. Lewton, Carter and Billy glare at Alex. Terry averts her eyes from Alex to bury her face in Carter's shoulder.

<b>ALEX

frightened as anyone over what has happened, tenses, defensive and scared. With softspoken strength...

<b>WIDER
</b>
Causing a startle, the DOOR OPENS. Everyone's head whips reflexively toward the entrance. The strange event of the flickering lights is quickly forgotten.

A half dozen MEN and WOMEN enter the room, displaying official badges and passes. All but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being F.B.I. Special Agents WEINE and SCHRECK. HOWARD SEIGEL and DON HAWKS are representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board. EILEEN WHALE and JACK ARNOLD are members of the Euro-Air "Trauma Team."

The officials are sympathetic and calm, exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time.

<b>                        SEIGEL

            feel they need medical attention or
            spiritual counseling at this time?

Although the words are comforting, being in the position of having to hear them macabre. Ms. Lewton reacts, snapping...

<b>                        MS. LEWTON
</b>            Have they found any survivors?
            What's going on?

Seigel is calm, yet honest... carefully honest.

<b>                        SEIGEL
</b>            The cause of the explosion is 
		undetermined. Nassau county

	      search and rescue are en route.

He gestures... "and that's all we know." The group slips deeper into despair.

            today's events, while it's still
            fresh in your minds.

The survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience, yet collectively are ready to co-operate.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he looks up, nervous... not about suspicion toward him, but trying to explain what even he doesn't understand.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            No. I saw it. I saw it!

Tears well as he grows frustrated trying to convey the unique experience. Being trained, veteran officers, Schreck and Weine obsereve; allow him to talk.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Not like a dream... more than that.
		I experienced the plane exploding...

            anything to do with you saying
            you wished Carter Horton was on the
            plane... just before it exploded?

Alex looks up, stunned. He didn't even recall this until now.

<b>                        ALEX

<b>                        SCHRECK

Alex winces from Carter's breath...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Then maybe you should lay off the 
<b>		J.D.
</b>
Carter has an angry reflexive reaction, grabbing Alex threateningly by the forearm. Terry immediately tries to get Carter to release his hold.

<b>                        CARTER
</b>            Don't ever fucking again tell me 
		what to do. I control me. Not you.

Carter and Alex lock eyes, Alex refraining from showing any pain caused by Carter's grip. Terry finally gets him to release.

<b>                        CARTER
</b>            I'm never gonna die.

He moves off. Terry, however, holds a beat, eyes Alex and gently rubs the area of his arm, as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in Carter's presence. As Alex pats her arm, Terry quickly moves off.

Shaken, Alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial. He steps aside to let the others go ahead as Billy Hitchcock, who has finished paying his respects, spots Alex and heads back up the line.

<b>                        BILLY
</b>            I took my driver's test this week at
		the DMV...

Alex turns to him, increudlously..

<b>                        BILLY
</b>            Got a 70. Lowest score, but I 
		passed. When I was done with the 
		test, the guy who drives with you
		during the test, he goes, "Young 
		man, you're going to die at a 
		very young age."
                 (beat)
            That true?
<b>		
</b><b>                        ALEX
</b>            Not here, not now.
                 (beat)
            Not EVER!

Billy sighs, and moves OUT OF FRAME, only to quickly RE-ENTER...

<b>                        BILLY
</b>            If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will 
		she say "no?"

Alex flashes Billy an angry glare. He gets the message and moves off, for good. Alex returns in line, moving toward the memorial.

Valerie Lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her. Alex approaches, watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger, touching the etched names...

<b>CLOSE - MEMORIAL
</b>
Linda Krauss... Thomas Lewis... John McConnell.

<b>RETURN
</b>
Alex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain....

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Ms. Lewton...

Her eyes fill with tears and fear. Alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she reacts quickly, pulling away from him, her eyes piercing at him.

<b>                        MS. LEWTON
</b>            Don't talk to me. You scare the hell
            out of me.

Alex is shattered as the teacher moves away. Tod ENTERS and faces the memorial.

<b>                        TOD
</b>                 (a greeting)
            Hey.

Alex notices Tod is in line behind him. Alex looks around for Tod's father. He is not in line...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            I don't want to sound gay, or
            nothin, but... I miss you.

Tod subtly nods, reaching out to the memorial.

<b>CLOSE - MEMORIAL
</b>
Tod's hand moves across his brother's name... GEORGE WAGGNER.

<b>RETURN
</b>
As Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend.

<b>                        TOD
</b>            Me, too.
                  (beat)
            But my dad doesn't understand. When 
		he's better; you and me, road trip 
		to the City. Catch the Yanks.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            That's a plan.

Tod nods. The two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before Tod gestures to the podium.

<b>                        TOD
</b>            I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton
            showed me in her class, they're 
		gonna let me read it. It says what 
		I'm feeling.

Tod holds his friend's arm for strength as he passes. Clear Rivers appears in line, holding a rose. She looks at the memorial, before her startling eyes turn to Alex. Even away from these circumstances, Alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity. As he begins to step away, she thrusts the rose to him. He looks up, puzzled.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Because of you... I'm still alive. 
		Thank you.

Alex takes the rose and she walks away. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he eyes... feels... the red flower.

<b>                        TOD (V.O.)

<b>INT. LIVING ROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT

A lone light glows. Jerry Waggner has fallen asleep, perhaps passed out, reclined in "dad's chair." Tod's mother is asleep on the sofa, balls of tissue on the floor. Tod enters the room and stares sadly at his parents...

Tod picks up a glass and swigs the remainder of his father's scotch before moving off and climbing the stairs.

sits at his desk, dark circles beneath his eyes. Swamping the desk are printouts of Internet Web pages and newspaper articles concerning the crash of Flight 180, forensic engineering textbooks, NTSB reports on past airline disasters and... REALITY BEYOND MATTER: Vaishnava Philosophy.

Alex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed.

An O.S. paper FLUTTER draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan. He reaches out and grabs it. Headlines and photos report on the memorial service.

CAMERA PUSHES IN as he sighs, troubled...

<b>ALEX'S POV - NEWSPHOTO

Clear Rivers sits in her seat, legs crossed, alluring and sexy and 
mysterious.

<b>ALEX
</b>
closes the paper, puzzled by his reaction. He shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk. Alex considers for a beat, then pulls open a lower drawer. Digging through the mess inside, he finds his stash... the April 1997 issue of Penthouse.

Alight CLICKS on REVEALING an old, '20's built bathroom. The toilet is beside the bathtub/shower, with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat.

Tod puts the lid down and UNSNAPS his jeans. As he turns, pulls his pants down and sits, CAMERA MOVES to the CURTAINS... still... until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow. CAMERA FOLLOWS the wind as it CONTINUES into the room, rippling across shower curtains.

As the breeze passes Tod, he pauses... as if sensing, but not 
understanding... this is more than a wayward autumn breeze. He moves to close the window, however, CAMERA CONTINUES as the air makes ITS way to the door.

The door is softly pushed closed by the breeze.

<b>BACK OF THE TOILET TANK
</b>
Tod sits, back to CAMERA, which CRANES DOWN the tank, STOPPING behind the locking nut and water line pipe.

As the toilet FLUSHES O.S., CAMERA NOW MOVES INTO the locking nut, which begins to slightly rattle. Drips of water stream from the tank onto the floor.

A LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window!

<b>ALEX'S POV - WINDOW

An OWL has apparently smashed into the window, awkwardly flapping its large wings, then turns its head toward Alex, large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature.

Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor.

<b>                        ALEX

Alex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage.

<b>INT/EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY

Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Know what this is?

She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Like, um... you're mad about
            something?

She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            A piece of debris... from the plane.

            Shouldn't stop you.

Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Why were you there last night?

While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine...

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know
            the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen
            suicides. But they were there last 
		night, that means: one, they still 
		don't have a clue what caused the 
		crash. Two, they haven't ruled out 
		anything. And the fact that seven
            people got off the plane is probably 
		weird enough, not to mention, that 
		one of those people had a vision, or 
		whatever, of it exploding minutes 
		before it did explode, is highly
            suspicious. And it doesn't help that 
		the visionaries' friend just 
		committed suicide.

Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Why were you there last night?

Clear turns to Alex. The two couldn't appear more different. She moves to a sculpture, an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a white dot in the center.

<b>                         CLEAR
</b>            Know what this is?

Alex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, "a mess?" but tactfully shakes his head "no."

<b>                         CLEAR
</b>            It's you.

Remaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable.

<b>                         CLEAR
</b>            Not a likeness. It's how you make 
		me feel, Alex.

<b>                         ALEX

<b>                         CLEAR
</b>            Like you, the sculpture doesn't even
            know what, or why, it is. Reluctant
            to take form. And, yet, creating an
            absolute but incomprehansible

Uncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens.

<b>                         CLEAR (CONT'D)
</b>            Before that day, you were just 
		another suburban nothing that would 
		never have anything to do with my 
		life. And I'm sure you thought I was 
		some Marilyn Manson body-pierced 
		freak, or whatever.
                       (beat)
            But at that moment... on the plane... 
		I felt what you felt. I didn't know 
		where all those emotions were coming 
		from until you started freaking out.

Alex sighs, embarrassed.

<b>                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
</b>            I didn't see what you saw, but I
		felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that 
		X-Files bullshit... but it was a 
		psychic connection. Why to me? Why 
		to you?

Jarred, he eyes her, frightened.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            And you can still feel it, can't 
		you? Something from that day is 
		still with you. I know, because I 
		can still feel you.

Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone...

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            That's why I was there last night.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            I've never dealt with death before.
            I wasn't alive when my grandparents
            died. I wish I could know. I mean, 
		all this... could just be in our 
		heads. Now it feels like it's 
		everywhere.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            "It?"
<b>				
</b><b>                        ALEX
</b>            What if Tod... is just the first...
            of us?

The idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear.
<b>				
</b><b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Is that something you're "feeling?"

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            I don't know. I wish I could just see
            him... one more time, then, maybe... 
		I would know.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Then, let's go see him!

Alex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting...

<b>                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. FUNERAL HOME - FOYER - NIGHT
</b>
CAMERA is LOW, moving across the paisley carpet. Dim light, spilling through the stained glass windows, falls upon the creepy decor, appearing as if designed by a morose Laura Ashley, floor model coffins and urns. CAMERA CONTINUES, TILTING UP to the CEILING, REVEALING a stained glass skylight. Outside, on the roof, two silhouettes appear...

The skylight hinges CRACK open. Clear leads the way. lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window.

Alex is not as smooth as his socius criminus. Using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet.

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex and Clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels. A bronze plaque identifies: "MT. ABRAHAM FUNERAL HOME. THE JOURNEY'S END. WILLIAM BLUDWORTH - INTERMEDIARY."

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>                  (whispering)
            Gives me a rush...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            This place?!

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.

With a hot, mischievous smile, Clear proceeds toward the hallway. Alex anxiously sighs... then follows.

<b>INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT
</b>
An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME. Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor.

A faint light spills from beneath a doorway. Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand. From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Good call. Very "Quincy."

Alex tries the doorknob. Locked. He looks at her, defeated. Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart.

From it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle. He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. CLACK!

<b>INT. MORGUE - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT
</b>
A lone desk lamp shines. Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod. A sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red.

As Alex and Clear approach...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            That... him?

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            I think. But why'd they make him
            up like... Michael Jackson?

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            That's him, but... he's not here. 
		That... whatever... that whatever 
		made him Tod is gone.

Suddenly, Tod jerks; his hand lifting four inches...

<b>            ALEX                         CLEAR
</b>Ahhh! fuck! You fucking		 Ohmygod! OHMYGOD! OHMYGOD!
asshole. You think this        He's not dead? 
is funny, you fucking 
dick? Tod, if you're 
not dead I'm gonna
fucking kill you!

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH (O.S.)
</b>            Please don't yell...
<b>		
</b>Both are jolted again with shock, turning toward the voice...

<b>MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>
CAMERA PUSHES, LOW ANGLE, INTO WILLAIM BLUDWORTH, an African-American man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            You'll wake the dead.

He flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun. Alex and Clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address Bludworth..

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Why..?

Alex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding...

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            Chemicals in the vascular flush
            create cadaveric spasm.

As the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted. He nervously offers an explanation.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            I'm... a friend of his. His best
            friend. See, his father...

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>                  (ominous)
            I know who you are.
The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            They said he hung himself, but 
		there's no marks.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            I crafted a reconstruction of the 
		Laryngeal prominence region with 
		Velvetone Surgical Wax and 
		Permaseal.

Clear moves in for a closer look, then calls Alex over to the body. After a beat of reluctance, Alex looks at Tod's neck.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            What are all those tiny marks?

<b>ALEX'S POV - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK
</b>
The wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint. At this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH (V.O.)
</b>            Cuticle lacerations.
<b>				
</b><b>WIDER
</b>
<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Why would he pull at the wire if he 
		were committing suicide?
<b>				
</b><b>                         CLEAR
</b>            Why would they say it was a
            suicide... if it weren't?

Because of the supernatural "message" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer. He eyes Mr. Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            His father's pretty fucked up with 
		denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with 
		the thought of an other accident... 
		taking another son.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            In Death...

CAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician. In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            ... there are no accidents. No
            coincidencess. No mishaps.
                  (smiles)
            And no... escapes.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            You saying Tod did kill himself?

Bludworth moves to Tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What 
		does it matter? He was going to end 
		someday. From the minute you're cut 
		loose from the womb... it's a one 
		way ticket on a trip to the tomb.

Vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            You may not realize it, but we're
            all just a mouse that a cat has by
            its tail. Every single move we 
		make, from the mundane to the 
		monumental... the red light we stop 
		at, or run; the people we have sex 
		with, or won't with us; the airplane 
		we ride, or walk out of... is all a 
		part of Death's sadistic design
            leading to the grave.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Design?

The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work...

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            If Life is like a box of 
		chocolates... Death... Death is like 
		a big Milton Bradley game of "Mouse
		Trap." The day you're born is just 
		the boot, hanging from the 
		streetlamp, kicking the marble to 
		get things rolling. Growing up is 
		only the marble rolling down the 
		curving chute. You feel immortal 
		having survived school, sex, drugs 
		'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really
            only upset the big hand holding the 
		steel ball that falls into the 
		bathtub. Marriage and kids and 
		career seem to make it all worthwhile 
		until the ball hits the see-saw and 
		flips the diving man into the big 
		barrel. In the old folks home or the
            hospital you just see the big cage 
		rattling down until it captures... 
		the mouse.
                 (beat)
            Game over.

Alex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying "this guys's whacked!" Alex moves toward Bludworth...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Maybe there's no way to win... 
		but... if you figured out the 
		game... you knew where the "steel 
		ball was rolling" couldn't you 
		avoid the trap and extend the 
		playing time? Couldn't you... cheat 
		Death at Its own game?

Mr. Bludworth looks directly at Alex. CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH, 
INDIVIDUALLY... this between the two of them.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            You already did that by walking off
            the plane. Now you gotta out when 
		and how it'll come back at you.
                  (beat)
            Play your hunch, Alex. If you think
            you can get away from it.
                  (beat)
            But beware the risk of cheating the 
		plan, disrespecting the design... 
		could iniciate a horrifying fury that 
		would terrorize even the Grim Reaper.
                  (beat)
            And you don't even want to fuck with 
		that Mack Daddie.

Alex's eyes are locked on Bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile. The mortician yanks on a tube, REVEALING a foot long needle removed from Tod's spinal column. The horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to Alex.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            I'm sorry we broke in.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            No harm. No foul.

Alex grabs her arm, starting toward the door.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            We didn't find what we were looking
            for.

Alex looks at Bludworth...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Yeah, we did.

<b>MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>
CAMERA PUSHES INTO the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved.

<b>                        MR. BLUDWORTH
</b>            I'll see you soon.

<b>                                                      CUT TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
</b>
BRAKING LOUDLY, startlingly, a public bus PULLS INTO CAMERA and stops. The doors HISS open.

<b>                        CLEAR (O.S.)
</b>            The mortician was whacked.

CAMERA ADJUSTS as Alex and Clear step off the bus and onto the street.

<b>                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
</b>            He was trippin' on formaldehyde.

Clear starts up the street, but Alex grabs her arm and steps back, assuring the bus moves off... safely. He nods, "it's safe to go." Throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            He said Death has a design. Even
            before he said that I had been
            seeing patterns.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>                  (sarcastic)
            As in flannels and plaids?

Up ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored. O.S., HAMMERING and CONSTRUCTION WORK POUND from above. In the f.g., tools and metal spikes. After a "thumbs up" gesture, the rope is pulled UP AND OUT OF FRAME.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            How many died on Flight 180?
            From our group?

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Thirty-nine.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Remember the gate number?

As Clear takes a moment to consider, Alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move...

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            No.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Thirty-nine.

This is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Remember the departure time?

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Like... 4:25.

Reaching an intersection, Alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb.

<b>PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL
</b>
the halting red hand is lit.

<b>                        ALEX (V.O.)
</b>            Do you know when I was born?

<b>INTERSECTION
</b>
Clear sighs, growing impatient with Alex.

<b>                         CLEAR
</b><b>            4:25.
</b>
<b>                         ALEX
</b>            Right. April 25th.

<b>                         CLEAR
</b>            Wait. I thought you meant the time
            of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as
            in, month and day... that's a reach.

<b>PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL
</b>
the halting red hand turns to the little white walking man.

<b>INTERSECTION
</b>
Clear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street. Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            My birthday is the same as of the 
		time I was meant to die! That's a 
		reach!?

VROOM! A car indeed makes a right, TEARING through the intersection. Once past, Alex takes Clear by the arm and hustles them across the street.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            You're sounding like those people
            who, you know... "Oswald shot 
		Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in 
		a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in 
		a theatre and hid in a warehouse."

CAMERA HOLDS REVEALING an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a Starbucks with outdoor seating. Schreck and Weine sit in the car, eyes coolly locked on Alex and Clear.

<b>DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST
</b>
Billy Hitchcock rides toward the Starbucks on his bicycle.

<b>EXT. STARBUCKS - DAY
</b>
sitting outside, Alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious. Clear listens; expression skeptical.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            I'm not just layin' down a bunch
            of math here, with this. I'm talking
            about indications... omens... that
            day, that we were meant to die. That,
            if, we have been aware of... would 
		have saved everyone on the plane.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            That's total bullshit. You can find
            death omens anywhere you want to.

She picks up her paper coffee cup.

<b>                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
</b>            Hey, look! "Coffee" starts with a 
		"C" and ends with an "E." So does 
		the word "choke!" We're going to 
		choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was 
		a whaler. We're going to be 
		harpooned!

Alex angrily glares at Clear. Clear drops her tone.

<b>                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
</b>            You'll go nuts if you start with
            that shit.

Ms. Lewton appears from around the corner. She starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees Alex.

He cautiously flashes a greeting smile. The teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop. Alex sighs, guiltily. Clear sympathizes with both of them.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            She's leaving the school. Moving 
		away.

Alex studies, appealing to her...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Clear, how do we know that by
            just sitting here, breathing this
            air or sipping the coffee, having
            crossed the street... we haven't 
		started in motion the events that 
		will lead to our death? Fifty years 
		from now. Ten years. Tomorrow.
                 (beat)
            You don't unless... you're able to 
		open yourself to the signs I'm 
		willing to show you.

He leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket.

<b>CLOSE - ALEX'S HAND
</b>
slides across the table. Opening his hand REVEALS the piece of paper reading, "... Tod..." Clear's hand ENTER'S FRAME to take the paper. CAMERA FOLLOWS AS SHE raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. As she eyes Alex for an explanation, CAMERA CRANES DOWN QUICKLY to the empty paper cups on the table...

... a slight approaching BREEZE knocks them over.

<b>DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST
</b>
A somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks. Carter Horton is driving. Terry Chaney rides shotgun. Carter looks out the window.

<b>CARTER'S POV - MOVING - ALEX AND CLEAR
</b>
She holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story.

<b>CARTER'S CAR
</b>
CARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems.

<b>ALEX AND CLEAR
</b>
Her eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him...

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            I don't understand... did you see 
		Tod die? Did it happen again, like 		on the plane?

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            No, but it might as well be the
            same thing. This was a message...
            from someone, or something...
            hinting... at the design.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Alex, on the plane... you must have 
		experienced... some kind of hyper 
		awareness. But here... you're
            suggesting Tod's death... and maybe
            our own... will happen because of...
            an active Presence.

Alex nods, feeling she's understanding.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            The mortician said Death has a 
		design. Now... if you, me, Tod, 
		Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton 
		messed up that design, because, for 
		whatever reason, I was able to see 
		Death's plan... then we cheated it.
                  (beat)
            But what if it was our time, what if 
		we were not meant to get off that 
		plane? What if it is still is our 
		time? If... It... is still not 
		finished with us? We will all still

His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn.

<b>BILLY HITCHCOCK

barreling down towards him. The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the U-Turn.

<b>WIDER

Billy SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS!

Carter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs...

<b>                        TERRY
</b>            Baby, come on... not now.

But her boyfriend continues. She gets out and hustles after him.

<b>ALEX AND CLEAR
</b>
Their attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk.

<b>                        TERRY
</b>            Carter...

At that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself.

<b>                        CARTER

<b>                        TERRY

Carter steps before Ms. Lewton, blocking her exit...

<b>                        MS. LEWTON
</b>            A couple of weeks.

She can't wait to leave. While trying to walk around Carter...

<b>                        CARTER

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Alex...

Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt. He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict.

<b>            CARTER (CONT'D)              ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>Lived here her whole life.        This'll be hard to believe.

Ms. Lewton's eyes flash to Alex, afraid of him.

<b>            CARTER (CONT'D)               ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>And now she has to move.          Listen to me, we may all

<b>                        TERRY
</b>            Shut up! The both of you!

The two boys stop their heated exchange.

<b>                        TERRY (CONT'D)
</b>            They died! We lived!

Head and shoulders remaining angrily in Carter's direction, Terry takes a blind step off the curb and into the crosswalk, WITHOUT A CUT... a bus suddenly speeds INTO FRAME and, THUD! plows directly right into her...

Moving boxes are stacked in the living room; organized disarray of

Startled, Alex turns to find...

Special agents Schreck and Weine standing in the street, backlit in the strong headlights of their car.

She reaches up to reflexively pull the glass from her throat, creating a flood of spurting blood.

She drops the glass and quickly stumbles toward the kitchen, blindly banging the turntable as she passes. The needle skips, BUMPS... and settles... umercifully at the start of "Rocky Mountain High."

Valerie Lewton races in, desperately pressing her hand to her throat as she GURGLES and CHOKES on the blood from the wound. She leans over the now red sink. She turns pale from the blood loss.

the flaming stream shoots up the stove, lighting the burners.

Alex approaches the front of the house. From here, nothing appears to be wrong. As he catches his breath, sweating, visually examining the house.

From INSIDE, a hoarse, macabre SCREAM! CAMERA PUSHES IN ON ALEX, stunned, before he races off toward the house.

<b>INT. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON
</b>
DROPS INTO FRAME ON HER KITCHEN FLOOR, hair and sweatshirt aflame. She desperately rolls on the floor and manages to extinguish the flames.

On her back, on the floor, she is badly burned. Her open neck wound continues to bleed. Blood pools on the floor. In shock and moving on pure survial instincts, she reaches up...

the lower third of the towel dangles over the edge of the counter top. Her hand grabs it, and pulls.

Alex rushes across the threshold as Ms. Lewton pulls the knives over the counter.

<b>MS. LEWTON

a half dozen knives, from small, but sharp, cutting blades to large butcher knives, cascade into her body.

Her hand trembling, her expression horrified, Lewton grabs the handle of the largest blade, trying to pull it out. Alex quickly kneels next to her. She looks at him, in shock, her eyes pleading. Alex gathers his courage, places his hand on the handle of the largest blade. As he's about to remove it...

<b>THE STOVE
</b>
a gas line ERUPTS, creating a small EXPLOSION.

the cutlery block is knocked off of the counter...

Even as blood squirts on him from her open wound, he appears to realize she is "seeing" the moment of death.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            Ms. Lewton!

Flames leap from the stove to the curtains, which catch fire.

Alex grabs the knife and pulls it out. He quickly removes another and another... yet there is no reaction from the woman.

Knowing she is dead, Alex pauses with guilt. He looks at the knife in his hand, then realizes how incriminating this could appear. In that moment, another small EXPLOSION from the stove brings Alex quickly to his feet. He drops the knife to the floor and races from the house. CAMERA TILTS DOWN to the shoe prints left in the pool of blood.

Alex appears unaware as he simply runs past Billy, who curiously turns his head to watch Alex race up the street. O.S., the CRACKLING OF FIRE. CAMERA MOVES INTO Billy as he turns back, reacting with shock to Ms. Lewton's house.

<b>THE HOUSE

from inside, an intense EXPLOSION propels glass from the windows. Flames engulf the entire house.

<b>ALEX

even down the street, he is knocked to his feet by the blast. In the distance, SIRENS from approaching POLICE AND FIRE trucks are HEARD. He stands, looks to the now suspicious Billy... then opts to run off away from the scene. Escaping into the dark backyards of the neighborhood.

Agents Schreck and Weine stand before Clear in her garage.

She studies the men before averting her eyes.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Because I didn't believe him.

The agents study her. Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however...

<b>                        SCHRECK

Schreck hands his card. She takes it and nods. Schreck pauses, once again eyeing the painting before moving out of the garage on their way to their car.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Flight 180 Memorial, lit for dramatic effect at night, but only achieving an eeriness. Carter Horton and Billy Hitchcock ENTER FRAME, moving toward the monument. Billy is riding his bicycle, wearing a New York Rangers jersey with "Hitchcock" across the back of the shoulders. Nearing the shadows, the two boys stop looking at the monument.

Carter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone.

Clear Rivers appears from the shadows.

CAMERA, FACING the ocean, moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach, looking into the Atlantic.

The waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome. Numb, Alex Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea.

Behind him, O.S., approaching in the sand, SOFT FOOTSTEPS. He listens, notes them. Yet rather than turn around... he looks up into the sky.

<b>ALEX'S POV - THE SKY
</b>
The shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above.

<b>                        ALEX (O.S.)

            Somewhere... are they still safe?

Clear hasn't met eyes with Alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky.
<b>                        CLEAR

            Every night... it seemed.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Most kids never have it happen.

Alex hangs his head...

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            When I was ten... my dad went into a
            7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard
            somebody say "Don't turn around." So 
		on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was 
		jokin'... he did. And the guy blew 
		his head off.

She has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying...

<b>                        CLEAR (CONT'D)

		reason to worry before... because 
		life became shit. I don't blame her, 
		I guess, but my mom couldn't deal 
		with it at all. She married this 
		asshole, who my mom with my real 
		dad would cross the street to avoid

		anymore, I guess.
                  (beat)
            If that was the design for my

<b>                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
</b>            And so, anyway... I've thought of

		that place.

He looks at her.

<b>                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
</b>            Where my dad is still safe. Where he 
		had a full pack of cigerettes and 
		kept driving. A place where me and

		together....and have no idea about
            this second life, here.
                  (beat)
            A place where our friends are still
		in the sky... where everyone gets a 
		second chance.

She looks at him...

<b>                        CLEAR (CONT'D)
</b>            But that place might only exist in 
		my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I 
		haven't experienced too many second 
		chances in my life. I haven't seen 
		any. But because of all of this, I 
		believe... because of you... I will 
		get a second chance. Because of me, 
		you will. With you in my life... that 
		place, right now existing in our 
		hearts, will spring out... and become

Alex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clear's hair.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            And that is the only way we can beat 
		Death... by making something special 
		out of Life.

His eyes well with tears. Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become emotional... they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation...

They dive into a deep feverish kiss. Embracing, as if the tighter, the safer. She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            This won't be safe.

Clear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of Billy and Carter.

</b>                  (sadly)
            Nothing is... anymore.

Alex looks to Clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death. He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms. CAMERA CRANES UP as the young man and woman make love in the sand... consciously and defiantly oblivious, to anything around them... including the stars, possibly Flight 180, up above.

</b>                  (quietly)

            When she died... at that moment, I

The three others turn quiet, considering what it must be...

<b>                        CARTER

Red light. A car approaches with the greenlighted right of way. Carter's car TEARS INTO FRAME, just missing being T-boned in the intersection as the other car HITS THE BRAKES, fishtailing.

Carter takes his hands off the wheel and raises them in the air, like a terrorized child on a roller coaster...

The turning car HONKS, ROARING through the intersection as Carter's car nearly clips the rear end of the turning car.

<b>INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Cater hooks his elbow on the window and his right arm around the front seat, driving; no hands.

<b>EXT. BACKSTREET - NIGHT

In the backseat, Alex and Clear ease... just as a railroad crossing arm drops INTO FRAME in the REAR WINDOW. O.S., the CLANG CLANG CLANG of a RAILROAD CROSSING ALARM.

<b>OUT OF THE FRONT WINDOW
</b>
The front crossing arm drops INTO FRAME before the car. Carter turns and flashes a "that's why I stopped" smile.

Scared to death, Billy fumbles with the car door handle. From the front passenger seat, he looks up and to his left...

Billy opens the door and pours out. Clear and Alex are quickly behind him. Carter remains in the drivers seat.

The train WARNING WHISTLE BLOWS as Alex, Clear and Billy hustle away from the car, on the same side of the tracks. They quickly turn around, desperate to convince...

<b>INT. CARTER'S CAR - NIGHT

Arms crossed, Carter remains in the front seat. As the interior fills with light from the headlight of the oncoming train, Carter turns and looks at them with a smart ass smile, pleased that he's shown how brave he truly is. With a beam of cocky definace...

<b>                        CARTER
</b>            It ain't my time.

He cooly turns back to the ignition, grabs the key and turns it over... only to be met with the DULL CLACK of a dead engine.

CAMERA SWEEPS INTO HIM AS his EYES FLARE with tension...

As he turns away from them, Carter sees something in the rearview mirror...

<b>CARTER'S POV - REAR VIEW MIRROR
</b>
the passing shadow is darker than any surrounding darkness.

<b>CARTER
</b>
as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and CLACKS the button. He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move. He's strapped in.

He tries to open the door... it won't open. He pulls at the door handle... tugs at the seatbelt... panicked. Horrified, he whips towards the others.

<b>                        CARTER

Alex takes off toward...

Alex hustles around the drivers' side. CAMERA SWEEPS INTO THEM as Alex desperately tries freeing the seatbelt.

<b>THE TRAIN
</b>
the WHISTLES SCREAMS!

<b>CLEAR AND BILLY
</b>
tense, as the train nears...

<b>ALEX AND CARTER
</b>
Alex grabs Carter by the shoulders and strains with all his might to pull the much more muscular kid out of the driver's window.

<b>CLOSE - CARTER'S SEAT BELT
</b>
the shadowy presence is reflected by the chrome buckle, however, after it passes... the seat belt begins to TEAR.

<b>ALEX AND CARTER
</b>
As CAMERA SWEEPS IN to ALEX and he releases a deep GROAN...

<b>ACROSS THE TRACKS
</b>
The train TEARS THROUGH the front end of the muscular car! GLASS and METAL ERUPT as the locomotive THUNDERS THROUGH FRAME.

<b>CLEAR AND BILLY
</b>
must turn away from the shower of metal and broken glass.

<b>ALEX AND CARTER
</b>
Alex holds Carter by the shirt at the shoulders, dragging him away from the wreckage. The two boys collapse on the road as the trian continues to ROAR PAST...

</b>
as the heavy train wheels THUNDER and CLACK, a broken two foot long shard of the car's debris BOUNCES upon the tracks, kicked about by the train wheels.

<b>CLEAR AND BILLY

run to the two survivors.

<b>CLEAR
</b>
runs and falls into Alex's arms, holding him tight.

<b>ALEX, CLEAR, CARTER AND BILLY

Carter lies on the road, urine stains around his crotch, hyperventilating and near tears.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Scared now?

Carter looks at the piece of seatbelt.

the debris bounces directly on the track. With great power and force, a train wheel runs over the debris, cutting it in half. It catches in the wheel and is spun around until shot out with the force of a missile...

shoulders.

<b>ALEX, CLEAR AND CARTER
</b>
The ROAR of the TRAIN seems exaggerated as they are frozen in horrified shock.

<b>EXTREMELY WIDE - ACROSS THE TRACKS
</b>
The train CLEARS FRAME and is gone... REVEALING, across the tracks, Alex, Clear and Carter can do nothing but watch Billy's decapitated body macabrely wobbling on its two front feet before falling to the ground.

<b>                        CARTER
</b>            Jesus fucking Christ!

For a beat, there is SILENCE... until, in the distance, SIRENS can be heard, approaching. As Alex stands and Carter manages to rise on wobbly legs... none of them can remove their eyes from Billy's body.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>                  (to Carter)
            You should have been next. After

            But I saved him. I intervened. Just 
		like the plane. That's the design.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Police are coming.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            That's why It skipped Carter and
            went to the next one in the path
            of the explosion; Billy.

Alex looks at Clear as if expiriencing an intense epiphany.

<b>                        ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>            My intervention in the death of 180
            surviviors will cheat the design.

             now?!

<b>                          ALEX
</b>            Of course not! Gods aren't afraid to

<b>                          CLEAR

            here. We have to go to the cabin.
            You can hide there. Get your head

Alex considers, mind racing... then realizes...

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            After Billy... it's me. And then you.

Clear grabs Clear and touches her face.

<b>                        ALEX (CONT'D)
</b>                  (to Clear)
            Hey, I won't let it happen, okay.

Carter turns to them; it's as far as he will go to admit he believes... or will help...

<b>                        CARTER
</b>            Then, get out of here.

As she moves to Alex, Clear nods her acknowledgement and appreciation to Carter. She takes Alex by the hand and the pair begin running away, off into the woods.

In the DISTANCE, a TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS, eerie, as if Death was punctuating the moment.

<b>EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

The windows are boarded. The front steps are worn and dilapidated. In the early evening moonlight, the dwelling appears eerie and ghostly. CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD the house, a pre-storm breeze swaying branches and blowing leaves. In the distance... LIGHTNING...

<b>INT. CABIN - DAY - A SMALL TABLE
</b>
A final piece of duct tape is applied to the corner of the table, dulling any sharp edges. Even though it is sunny outside, all the shades are pulled. The room sits in dark shadows broken by occasional bright shafts of light.

CAMERA FOLLOWS a hand as it carefully picks up a Coleman lantern and sets it atop an empty can placed in the center and above the water line of a large metal tub; a fire protection moat.

<b>ALEX
</b>
finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach.

Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight.

He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can.

Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does.

Pause... he's alright. He takes the spoon. Scoops some more. And the process begins again.

The resulting THUNDER RUMBLES. A breeze blows beneath the door, carrying some Autumn leaves. CAMERA FOLLOWS the breeze across the floor to Alex's pant legs which slightly flutter.

CAMERA RISES TO ALEX, sitting in his safe chair. Paranoid and obsessively cautious, his eyes move towards the door, anticipating the consequential events. Following the path of the breeze, Alex turns around...

<b>ALEX'S POV - TRASH BAG
</b>
the brown shopping bag tips over. Amongst the trash spread on the floor, a can rolls out and across the floor.

<b>ALEX
</b>
tenses. He doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going.

<b>ALEX'S POV - CAN
</b>
rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole, propped in the corner. The pole teeters and falls over.

<b>FISHING HOOK
</b>
falls, hooking a closet door. The door begins to swing open.

<b>ALEX
</b>
is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards...

<b>THE DOOR
</b>
Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition.

Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.

<b>CLOSET FLOOR
</b>
a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. Alex bends down and examines them.

O.S., a sound. Like a THUMP near the cabin steps. He freezes, like an animal sensing danger. THUNDER RUMBLES. The light around him begins to flicker and sway.

a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure. The flame, dancing.

<b>CLOSE - AN OLD PHOTOGRAPH

A man, early thirties, holds a six year old girl in his arms, waving at the camera. Both appear happy and alive. They are standing before the cabin surrounded by the thick woods.

Distant THUNDER ECHOES. Alex kindles a fire in the fireplace, balling up old newspapers. He begins to crumble the local news... then pauses.

A headline catches his attention. CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM, tense, while THUNDER RUMBLES. As he unrolls the paper, his expression is rocked... anxious... he cocks his head to consider... recalling... as CAMERA PUSHES ALL THE WAY INTO...

<b>HEADLINE - CRUMPLED NEWSPAPER

"PARENTS TO ESTABLISH MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIPS." Besides the headline are two yearbook photos; Christa Marsh and Blake Dreyer.

his expression reflects a terrifying revelation...

The lightning STRIKES the top of the pole, SNAPPING two power lines, which whip in the wind.

The power goes out. The room turns dark. Outside, brilliant bluish white arc lights CRACKLE. Clear moves to the window.

She assesses the situation and moves to a pair of candles on the mantle, lightning them with a Bic. O.S., from the backyard, a DOG BARKS. Clear brings the candle through the small house.

Clear moves quickly to the kitchen, holding the candle. Outside, BLUE ARC LIGHT CRACKLES. She looks out the backyard.

An old circular clothesline turns like a pinwheel in the wind. In the center of the yard is an oblong, tarped above ground pool. In the furthest corner of the yard, her dog is chained to a tree, BARKING AND FREAKED OUT. An old tire swing rocks in the storm. From the manner in which the house is situated and the length of the snapped power lines, one is capable of reaching the backyard.

The power line STRIKES the ground, "closing in on" the dog.

Alex charges out the front door, leaping over the steps. O.S., SEVERAL CARS APPROACH, headlights pan across the trees. Alex stops dead in his tracks and runs off into the woods, just as the F.B.I umarked sedan and three Sheriff 4x4s THUNDER up to the cabin, siren lights swirling.

<b>INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Weine is driving, leading the other vehicles. Schreck points out the passenger window.

Full sprint, Alex disappears into the dark forest.

<b>WIDER
</b>
the cars BRAKE to a stop, SKIDDING in the dirt. Sheriffs leap out of their vehicles. High powered flashlights shoot beams in Alex's direction. The officers take after the suspect.

<b>THE DOG

Helpless, chain wrapped around the tree. THUNDER RUMBLES.

<b>CLEAR

continues to run...

<b>THE CIRCULAR CLOTHESLINE

is whipped by a power line. SPARKS FLY as the base pole snaps in two.

<b>CLEAR
</b>
the metal poles punge into the ground just before and behind her, inches from impaling her. She stumbles, but quickly steps aside and continues toward the tree.

<b>THE CIRCULAR CLOTHES-LINE FRAME

is rolled by the winds, across the yard toward...

<b>ABOVE GROUND POOL
</b>
the clothesline frame punctures the pool. Water streams from the rupture.

<b>CLEAR

reaches the tree and begins unfastening the dog's collar from the chain.

whipping, strike one another causing an angry FLASH!

<b>THE RIVETS

CAMERA MOVES WITH Alex, blindly running through the forest, sheriffs' flashlight beams crossing behind him... in pursuit.

Looing back to check the postition of the agents, Alex blindly runs over the lip of a downward slope...

<b>GULLY
</b>
He rolls and tumbles uncontrollably down the hillside. As he nears the base...

<b>ALEX
</b>
stops with a CRUNCHING THUD... his face an inch from being impaled by a sharp, thick protruding branch. No time to catch his breath, he's up and running.

water floods, pooling the backyard, cascading over Clear's feet. She looks down, in the reflection of the puddle, the dark shadow passes. Clear whips up, checking the position of...

<b>A POWER LINE
</b>
coils, like a cobra, ready to STRIKE!

<b>TREE
</b>
Clear drops the chain and hits the dog on its backside.

<b>                        CLEAR
</b>            Run!

The dog starts to tear off toward the house. Clear runs toward the hanging tire. Leaps...

<b>THE POWER LINE
</b>
whips, the frayed wires hitting the puddle of water...

<b>CLEAR
</b>
in mid-air, desperately grabs the tire, hanging on, literally for her life. O.S., the dog YELPS. Clear turns back...

<b>CLEAR'S POV - THE DOG

convulses in the small pool of water, burning from the overwhelming amounts of electricity.

<b>EXT. FOREST - NIGHT - SMALL CREEK

Distant flashlights reflect in a small stream, barely two inches deep. Alex's foot splashes in the water. THUNDER RUMBLES.

<b>ALEX
</b>
races along the path of the stream.

<b>SHERIFFS
</b>
continue their pursuit through the dark trees.

<b>ABOVE
</b>
Lightning CRACKS a tree branch.  SPARKS FLY! The tree tumbles down the branches.

<b>ALEX
</b>
The thick branch falls from above, landing on top of him. He's knocked to the ground and pinned... face down in the creek.

CAMERA MOVES IN... his nose and mouth, just below the water line, but he cannot move. His eyes flash with panic, as he struggles... battles to move and avoid drowning in two inches of water.

As he struggles in the f.g., Weine and a pair of Sheriffs appear ten yards beyond him. They pause, confused, panning their flashlights across the forest.

<b>WIENE'S POV - FOREST
</b>
the lights actually expose the area where Alex lies. From their postition, however, he is covered by the branch and out of sight.

<b>ALEX
</b>
struggles to raise his head above the water, chest bursting...

<b>WEINE AND SHERIFFS
</b>
believing Alex is not in the area, move ahead into the woods.

Clear pulls herself up to a tree branch. Lighting and THUNDER CONTINUE amongst the ARCING, CRACKLING POWER LINES. She searches for an escape.

straining in the storm, begins moving up the branch...

dart open. Taking a tenth of a second to gather all of his strength, all his courage, he arches his back, pushing with his hands, anything to lift his face out of the stream.

With a DEEP GASP, he does so. Drinking up the air. It appears to infuse him with another blast of adrenaline as he manages to push with his arms and free himself from the pinning tree branch.

He pauses only for a couple gulps of air... and is off.

Clear leaps from the end of the branch to her window, grabbing the sill awkwardly, she dangles outside the house. With a breath, she pulls herself inside, just as the power line bites, ARCING, at her feet.

Clear River's stands in her bedroom just as it fills with blinding blue light. Her television screen BLOWS OUT. Sparks jet across the room. Blasts of FLAME erupt from the electrical outlets. She quickly turns, racing toward the hallway.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA IS LOW, RACING WITH HER as SPARKS EXPLODE FROM the lamps and electrical outlets. She cuts and leaps three steps at a time down the staircase...

A mid-eighties Corolla is parked amongst Clear's artwork. A door, adjacent to the kitchen flies open. Clear hustles through, running to the car and entering via the passenger door, for the sake of expediency.

<b>EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The power lines WHACK angerily against the door.

<b>INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Clear scoots into the driver's seat. She CLICKS the automatic garage door opener...

<b>GARAGE DOOR OPENER MOTER

connected to a metal arm, attached to the door, remains motionless - there is no power.

<b>INT. COROLLA - NIGHT

Realizing the motor is dead, Clear takes a beat, STARTS THE ENGINE and SHIFTS INTO REVERSE...

<b>EXT. BACKYARD - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Alex reaches the backyard. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he quickly tries to deduce the deadly situation. HE RUNS OUT OF FRAME...

Clear guns the small car in reverse.

<b>THE METAL ARM
</b>of the garage door opener RIPS through the windshield, locking upon the windshield wiper grille. The other end remains attached to the garage roof interior, essentially acting as an anchor.

The Corolla lurches backward, freed from the grasp of the house.

<b>INT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
a chunk of the ceiling collapses upon Clear's artworks, including the canvas incorporating a jagged piece of debris from Flight 180. The metal SLAMS to the floor, on top of...

backs away, eyes locked with Clear's, assuring she's remaining in the car.

<b>                        ALEX
</b>            You know what to do. I'll always be

He reaches out and grabs the power line, falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car. The cable ARCS furiously.

<b>COROLLA

Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car EXPLODES.

<b>ALEX

Clear lifts her head up, still battling the pain of labor...

Barabra places a cool wet cloth on Clear's forehead...

<b>                        BARBARA

Cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket, the baby is placed in the mothers arms. The long retrospective harmonica of Neil Young's "Long May You Run" reprises as Clear looks at the I.D. braclet...

<b>WRIST BRACLET

"Alexander Chance Browning II."

<b>DELIVERY ROOM

CAMERA PULLS BACK. The birthing room is quiet; the people introspective. The doctors. The family. The mother and child. A room of new life, in which, each recalls a life lost.

As "Long May You Run" OVERLAPS...

A bright, colorful arrangment of flowers is carefully placed into a vase. CAMERA ADJUSTS to REVEAL Alex's bedroom is now lived in by Clear and the baby. Clear makes the final adjustment in the arrangement, then checks the sleeping baby in the bassinet.

Clear moves to her bed with a book. As she settles in, O.S., a faint RUSTLE. CAMERA INCHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks to...

A hand ENTERS FRAME, fingers hover in space before they gently trace over "Terry Chaney." CAMERA ADJUSTS TO REVEAL Carter Horton, staring at the name. Alone, he allows himself the moment to grieve. Carter glances up to find Clear approaching with the baby in the stroller.

Carter straightens and nods, then begins to walk away. He hesitates, then turns back to Clear.

<b>                        CARTER

Clear looks up.

<b>                        CARTER (CONT'D)

Clear holds baby Alex up to the monument, showing her son his father's name. Carter stands, watching. CAMERA WIDENS to REVEAL the entire monument against the deep blue sky. At the base in readable, but understandable lettering... "FLIGHT 180."

CAMERA HOLDS as "Long May You Run" CONTINUES... RETURNING each of us to the awaiting darkness.
