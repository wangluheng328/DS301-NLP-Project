Two mis-matched men, Arlo, an Ice Cream truck driver, and Tim a convenience store clerk, are forced to team up with each other, and get on each others nerves, when through a series of circumstances, they get possession of a top-secret, bio-warfare weapon, when heated to over 50 F, detonates and releases a lethal cloud of radioactivity in which a disgruntled, former U.S. Army officer and his team of alienated, former Army soldiers-turned-terrorists, want to use against the government for making them the scapegoats years earlier for their handling of the virus and covering up the existence of the weapon.
With time running out, and the outdoor temperature rising, Arlo and Tim must outwit their pursuers and try to find a way to dispose of the weapon before they both become dead meat.
