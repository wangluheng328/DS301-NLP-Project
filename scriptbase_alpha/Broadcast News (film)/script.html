<b>	FADE IN
</b>
<b>	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
	A restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small 
	restaurant.  GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back 
	door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common
	state for him.  He moves towards the cab of the truck and gets
	inside as we SUPER:

<b>		KANSAS CITY, MO. - 1963
</b>
<b>	INT. TRUCK - DAY
</b>
	As he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune... now we
	REVEAL his twelve-year-old son, TOM, seated quietly beside him. 
	He seems a bit down.  Gerald glances at his son.

<b>				GERALD
</b>		I don't know a recent Saturday I've
		sold more.  You didn't think I'd
		sell that health restaurant, did you?

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  Not even you.

<b>				GERALD
</b>		Why so glum?

<b>				TOM
</b>		I don't know.

<b>				GERALD
</b>			(a beat)
		Go ahead.

<b>				TOM
</b>		No, nothing.  I've got a problem,
		I guess.

<b>				GERALD
</b>		Were you bothering by those
		waitresses making a fuss?

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  But, honest.  What are you
		supposed to say when they keep
		talking about your looks?  I don't
		even know what they mean -- "Beat
		them off with a stick."

	Gerald stiffs a grin.

<b>				GERALD
</b>		You know, Tom, I feel a little
		proud when people comment on your
		looks.  Maybe you should feel that
		way.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that
		I like when they say those things.

<b>				GERALD
</b>		As long as that's your only problem
		you're...

<b>				TOM
</b>		It's not.

	He looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I got my report card.  Three Cs,
		two Ds and an incomplete.

<b>				GERALD
</b>		Oh my.  I see you studying so hard,
		Tom.  What do you think the problem is?

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'll just have to try harder.  I don't 
		know.  I will.
			(talking himself
			 into it)
		I will.  I will.  I will.

	He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep
	talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will 
		you sign it, please?

<b>				GERALD
</b>			(as he signs)
		Would it help if I got you a tutor?

<b>				TOM
</b>			(suddenly hopeful)
		That would be great.
			(worried)
		It better help.  What can you do with
		yourself if all you do is look good?

<b>	SUPER THE LEGEND -- "FUTURE NETWORK ANCHORMAN"
</b>
<b>							FADE OUT
</b>
<b>	FADE IN
</b>
<b>	BOSTON, MASS. - 1965
</b>
<b>	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
	AARON ALTMAN, looking almost preposterously young in his
	graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory.  He is a
	rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.

<b>				AARON
</b>		...and finally to the teachers of
		Whitman High School, I don't have the
		words to express my gratitude which
		may have more to say about the quality 
		of the English Department here than 
		my own limitations...

	He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
	discomfort.

<b>				AARON
</b>		...that was, of course, not meant to
		be taken seriously.  A personal note.  
		I am frequently asked what the special 
		difficulties are in being graduated 
		from High School two months shy of my 
		fifteenth birthday.  I sometimes 
		think it was the difficulties 
		themselves which enabled me to do it.
		If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated
		I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to
		graduate.  I hope the next student who
		comes along and is able to excel isn't
		made to feel so much an outcast.  But
		I'm looking forward to college; this is
		the happiest day I've had in a long
		time.  I thank you and I forgive you.

	This is very little applause.

<b>	ANGLE ON TEACHERS
</b>
<b>				MALE TEACHER
</b>		I'm always so confused by Aaron.
		Is he brave and earnest or just
		a conceited little dick-head?

<b>	BACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER: "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER"
</b>
<b>	ANGLE ON STAGE
</b>
	As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
	semi-literate high school graduates.

<b>				YOUTH #1
</b>		Later, Aaron.

<b>	EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
</b>
	Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
	yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
	cuff Aaron around.

<b>	CLOSER IN
</b>
	Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
	covered with blood...as he gets to his feet.  He is livid --
	something primal triggered by this brutality.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Go ahead, Stephen -- take your
		last licks.
			(points at his
			 face)
		But this will heal -- what I'm
		going to say to you will scar you
		forever.  Ready?  Here it is.

	He dodges as they come after him.  They catch him by the hair
	and hurl him to the ground.  As he gets up he hurls his
	devastating verbal blow.

<b>				AARON
</b>		You'll never make more than
		nineteen thousand dollars a year.
		Ha ha ha.

	They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
	concrete.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Okay, take this:  You'll never
		leave South Boston and I'm going
		to see the whole damn world.  You'll
		never know the pleasure of writing
		a graceful sentence or having an
		original thought.  Think about it.

	He's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground.  As the
	Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
	conversation.

<b>				YOUTH TOUGH
</b>		Nineteen thousand dollars...
		Not bad.

<b>	FADE IN
</b>
<b>	ATLANTA, GEORGIA - 1968
</b>
<b>	INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT
</b>
	JANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing.  Above the
	desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
	pictures tacked to each one.  Her desk has several file racks
	which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
	a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side.  Jane types
	very well in the glare of her desk lamp.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(voice over; as
			 she types)
		Dear Felatzia, it's truly amazing
		to me that we live a world apart
		and yet have the same favorite music.
		I loved the picture you sent and
		have it up on my bulletin board.
		You're growing so much faster than
		I am that I...

<b>	OTHER ANGLE
</b>
	SHOWING Jane's FATHER standing near the door.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(voice over)
		...am starting to get jealous.
		I read in the newspapers about
		the Italian strike and riots in
		Milan.  I hope you weren't...

<b>				FATHER
</b>			(softly)
		Honey?...

	Jane SCREAMS, and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles
	nervously at her Dad.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Oh God -- Daddy -- don't...don't...
		don't ever scare me like that --
		please.

	We SUPER:  "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER"

	Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction.
	Falling back towards the door:

<b>				FATHER
</b>		Jane -- For God's sake...
			(recovering)
		Look, it's time for you to go
		to sleep.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I just have two more pen pals and
		then I'm done.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		You don't have to finish tonight.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(he doesn't get in)
		Nooo.  This way the rotation stays
		the same.

<b>				FATHER
</b>		Finish quickly.  I don't want you
		getting obsessive about these 
		things.  Good night.

	We REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
	troubled.

<b>	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
	room where her Father reads the latest <u>Rolling Stone</u> of the
	mid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim
	Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Dad, you want me to choose my words
		so carefully and then you just throw
		a word like 'obsessive' at me.  Now,
		unless I'm wrong and...
			(enunciating)
		...please correct me if I am, 'obsession'
		is practically a psychiatric term...
		concerning people who don't have anything
		else but the object of their obsession --
		who can't stop and do anything else.  Well,
		Here I am stopping to tell you this.  Okay?
		So would you please try and be a little
		more precise instead of calling a person
		something like 'obsessive.'

	She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out,
	even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had
	enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
	the room.  She exits the room INTO BLACK.

	Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

<b>	OVER EXT. SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY
</b>
	Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
	twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
	jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind
	of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours.  The
	Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
	news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else
	yet never mention.  She stops running as she feeds quarters into
	the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
	different papers before moving on.

<b>	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
	As she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed.
	The sun is jus now rising.  She sits next to her phone.

<b>	INSERT:  JANE'S ROOM
</b>
	The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
	hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.  She flicks at a page --
	takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
	room number of her crew and reporter.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	As she dials one room number.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		Hi...It's me...

<b>	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
	ANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though
	essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens
	to Jane.

<b>				JANE'S VOICE
</b>			(voice over)
		It's thirty minutes before you have
		to meet me in the lobby -- nudge
		your wife.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>				JANE
</b>		There's probably no time to eat...
		but there's a cafeteria at the bus
		depot once we get down there.  I
		love working with you two...It 
		saves me a call.

	She dales.

<b>	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM
</b>
	Where Aaron is switching his TV from station to station,
	monitoring the early morning news.  His PHONE RINGS.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Hi.  Turn on your TV...
		<u>Good Morning America</u>, the
		<u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all
		about to talk to Arnold 
		Schwarzenegger and I think he's 
		live on at least two of them.

<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
<b>				JANE
</b>		At six o'clock on the wake-up
		news they used the wrong missile
		graphic.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(Austrian accent)
		Now listen, Arnold just said that
		he's been making three million a
		movie now.  But he's not ever 
		gonna change.  He's still the same
		person when he was making two 
		million dollars a movie.  He feels
		no different.  He also bought a brand-
		new condo with Maria, they gonna
		furnish tastefully.

<b>				JANE
</b>		A half hour in the lobby.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(Austrian accent)
		Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].

	She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
	bed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
	her legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
	waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
	redden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
	shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
	episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

<b>	INT. BUS STATION - DAY
</b>
	Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team
	as they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to 
	do a stand-up.  There is a DERELICT off to one side.  Aaron holds 
	his microphone at the ready.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Ready.
<b> 
</b><b>				CAMERAMAN
</b>		Your hair's a little funny.

<b>				AARON
</b>		It's an ethnic curl, I can't do
		anything about it.

<b>				CAMERAMAN
</b>		In front of a little -- it's a bit...
		You want a mirror?

<b>				AARON
</b>		No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's
		do this.

	Jane nods her assent.

<b>				CAMERAMAN
</b>		Okay.

<b>	AARON SEEN THROUGH CAMERA
</b>
<b>				AARON
</b>		In other times, for other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  He...

<b>				JANE
</b>			(interrupting)
		I'm sorry.  But look at how
		wonderful his face is.

	She points to the derelict.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Oh, you mean use him...That's
		nice.  Okay.

<b>				CAMERAMAN
</b>		I'll put him in the low corner of
		the frame -- good.

<b>				AARON
</b>		In other times, with other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  Last week he was
		decorated by a president for heroism
		in a war.  But it was the civil war --
		in Angola -- and he was in it for the
		money.

	He puts the microphone down.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Thanks.

	He passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair.

<b>	INT. GATE AREA - DAY
</b>
	Jane in the distant b.g. on the phone.  Aaron and crew shooting
	as the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled
	passengers exit the bus.  J.D. SINGER, strong, 9'6" figure
	emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him.
	He reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary.

<b>				J.D.
</b>		Go 'way.

	J.D. gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus.  The
	crew shooting.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Just a few questions?

<b>				J.D.
</b>		No.

	He starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him.

<b>				AARON
</b>		We came from Washington.

<b>				J.D.
</b>		Move away from me.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(holding out
			 microphone)
		How long has it been since you've
		been home.

<b>				J.D.
</b>			(moving)
		Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot...
		Fuckee.  You want to use that?

<b>				AARON
</b>		It depends on how big a news day it 
		is.

	They reach Jane.  She calls to him.

<b>				JANE
</b>		J.D.  I'm Jane Craig.  I spoke to
		you in Angola.  I gave you some
		sugarless gum and Handi-Wipes.

	As he reacts to her:

<b>	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she
	screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Where's where I asked him about
		being scared?
			(then)
		You should work on your speech.

<b>				JANE
</b>		No.  It makes me nervous to think
		about it.  Let's do this.

	She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(on tape)
		All this business of war -- do you
		get scared?

<b>				J.D.
</b>			(on tape; he smiles)
		Uh-uh.
			(then)
		I'm a little freaked right now about
		seeing my father though.

	He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I love that turn away.

<b>	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
	Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large
	monitors display some <u>taped news pieces</u> she has assembled.  On
	the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of
	Local Television News Broadcasters.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(in darkness)
		There's a point I'm trying to make
		about these pieces coming up.

	A WOMAN'S OUTLINE blacked out from behind -- her VOICE
<b>	ELECTRICALLY DISGUISED.
</b>
<b>				WOMAN
</b>			(o.s.; angrily)
		I don't think any client of mine
		makes less than fifty thousand dollars
		a year which means they can afford the
		best and you're damn right I feel good
		that that includes me.

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	ANOTHER ANGLE - ANOTHER WOMAN
</b>	in blackness, her VOICE DISGUISED.

<b>				WOMAN TWO
</b>			(o.s.)
		No.  You'd be surprised at who a
		working girl meets.  I've been a
		working girl for what? -- over a year
		anyway and that must be a thousand
		men and I don't think there's an age
		or type that hasn't been in there.

<b>				INTERVIEWER'S VOICE
</b>			(voice over)
		Policemen?  -- Doctor? -- Lawyer...?

<b>				WOMAN TWO
</b>			(o.s.)
		Oh, sure.  Television reporters.

	A laugh from the audience.  There is a:

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL FIGURE
</b>	A WOMAN in blackness.

<b>				WOMAN THREE
</b>			(o.s.)
		I'm seventeen now and I've been
		working the streets for two years
		and I guess to be honest -- I stopped
		thinking of it as temporary.

	The lights come up on the room.  The two screens go black...
	there is general APPLAUSE.  Jane blinks nervously.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Please don't applaud.

<b>	ON AUDIENCE
</b>
	Sitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country,
	remarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good
	looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
	or Hispanic.  They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
	sincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Please.  Don't!!
			(she yells)
		I gathered these pieces as an
		example of what's <u>WRONG</u> with local
		television news.

	The applause stops.

<b>				JANE
</b>		The excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
		SERIES on prostitution were
		SIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all
		stations in one city during sweeps
		week.  By what bend of either or
		suspension of duty is that broadcast
		news?

	She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none,
	she continues.  An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
	"gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh.

<b>				JANE
</b>		The legacy of Edward R. Murrow,
		Eric Sevareid, William Shirer,
		David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
		is being squandered in a desperate
		popularity contest.  Our profession
		is in danger:

<b>	TRACKING SHOT
</b>
	As Jane continues, REVEALING that the news team now have even
	more in common.  They do not like Jane.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yesterday's compliment has somehow
		managed to become today's kiss of
		death.  To be considered a serious
		journalist is no longer flattering.
		It presents the risk of being labeled
		ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, 
		right?

<b>	SHOT CONTINUES
</b>
	Women playing with their hair, young man bored...one
	middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	Briefly departing from text.

<b>				JANE
</b>		All of you know what I'm talking about.  
		We're all trying to act together than 
		we are.  But we care.  So, we're all 
		secretly terrified, aren't we?

	Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
	prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice
	begins to rasp.

<b>				JANE
</b>		We are being increasingly influenced
		by the star system.  The network
		anchormen are so powerful they 
		compromise our last best hope.  The 
		current group is clearly qualified, 
		tied still to our best traditions, but 
		who follows these men?

<b>	TRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK
</b>
	Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde
	woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking
	Hispanic.  Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just
	a speaker, she seems a savior.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Wow.

	His female colleague looks at him.

<b>				FEMALE COLLEAGUE
</b>		Oh, I've known so many women like
		that.  They don't like their looks
		so they're angry.

<b>	BACK TO JANE
</b>
	Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would
	wish.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I was going to talk about other
		trends but...
			(mumbling)
		...the magazine shows, news at
		profit, influence of
		<u>Entertainment Tonight</u>, the danger, the
		hope, the dream, the question...Oh, I
		was going to show you a tape -- a story
		that was carried by all networks on the
		same night -- the same night -- not one
		network noted a major policy change in
		Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...
		Here's what they ran instead...Go ahead. 
		Show the tape.

<b>	ON MONITORS
</b>
	Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all
	networks in the Spring of 1985.  It is quite spectacular -- the
	dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny
	bridges, setting off little fireworks.  JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds
	loudly and squeals with delight.

<b>	ON SCENE
</b>
	Jane between the two monitors.  She begins to speak loudly OVER
	the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(loudly)
		I know it's good film.  I know it's
		fun.  I like fun.  It's just not news.
			(as they continue
			 to applaud)
		Well, you're lucky you love it --
		you're going to get a lot more just
		like it.

<b>	STRAY VOICE - SHOUT "GOOD"
</b>
<b>	OTHER ANGLE
</b>
	Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event.
	Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart.  She takes
	some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.

<b>	WIDER
</b>
	Tom the last person remaining in the room.  He approaches her --
	she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually
	mounts the stage with an athletic leap.  It takes courage for
	Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:

<b>				TOM
</b>		Hello.

	She looks up at him.

<b>	ANGLE ON TOM
</b>
	Earnest, nervous -- handsome...Just when she needed a mirage
	there it is.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Hi.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I just wanted to tell you  how great 
		you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(dumbly)
		Thank you.
			(then)
		They hated me.  I don't hate them.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Well, they say if you can reach
		even one person, it means something...
		And you did that.

	Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then:

<b>				JANE
</b>		Would you like to have dinner
		with me?

<b>	INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
	Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.  She has attempted to dress
	up to the extent that  packing for a short-day trip allows.  She
	looks for Tom.  Tom rises from a table and is immediately at
	her side.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Hi.  I was worried I was early.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I was a lot earlier.

	They are lead to a table and sit down.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I kept thinking what a great break
		it was for me to get to see you
		tonight.  More than a great break,
		maybe just what I needed...just when
		I needed it...Angel of mercy --
		godsend...lifesaver...what?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(picking one)
		I like "godsend."

<b>				TOM
</b>		I haven't been in news that long.
		I've just been looking for the
		right person to talk to.  I have
		about two thousand questions for you.

	He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
	continues to rest.  He looks at her a beat.

<b>				TOM
</b>		It's possible now's not the right
		time.

	She lifts her head.

<b>				JANE
</b>		If we could just eat first.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Totally understood.  Totally
		wrong of me to talk shop after
		the day you've had.  Totally
		sorry.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Nooo.  If I could just have a
		roll, I'd be okay.

	She takes a roll from the roll plate.  He smiles at her.  She
	takes a bite.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Thank you.

<b>	EXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
	As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously.
	Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little
	adrift and temporarily free of obligations.  She is open to
	making a memorable mistake.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Another thing I can't stand --
		Is this dull?

	Tom shakes his head almost violently.

<b>				TOM
</b>		No, no, no, no...

	Jane looks at him curiously -- then:

<b>				JANE
</b>			(broadly)
		Another thing I can't stand is
		...when White House reporters
		bullshit with each other after
		a briefing and then one of them
		has a theory and the other quotes
		it in his story as "White House"
		sources say...

<b>				TOM
</b>		That actually goes on...

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yes.  My room is down here --
		I'm not tired.  Do you want to
		keep talking?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes, sure.

<b>	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
	evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
	notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
	Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
	and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
	enormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
	portable STEREO system.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Come on...Even I'm not that
		hard on myself.

<b>				TOM
</b>		No, I really got this job on a
		fluke and wait till you hear where
		it ends up.

	Jane smiles a calming smile.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I was doing sports at the station.
		The newspaper ran this untrue story
		that I was leaving and they got all
		these tons of protest mail.  So they
		made me anchor.

<b>				JANE
</b>		So great -- right?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Except I'm no good at what I'm being
		a success at.

<b>				JANE
</b>		How are you at back rubs?

	Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
	immobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
	than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
	experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
	briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
	from the pillow and munching it as she return to <u>his</u> agenda.

<b>				JANE
</b>		It's sort of normal -- the way you
		feel.  In graduate school everyone
		thought the only mistake the
		admission committee made was letting
		them in.

	He moves to the bed.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Listen to me.  You keep on thinking
		I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence.
		That's not it.  I know I can talk well
		enough and I'm not bad at making contact
		with people, but I don't like the 
		feeling that I'm pretending to be a 
		reporter.
			(cont'd)
		And half the time I don't really get 
		the news I'm talking about.  It isn't
		that I'm down on myself.  Trust me,
		I stink.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(levelly)
		I trust you.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I didn't even have the chance to get
		really good at sports.  I wasn't bad.
		I thought I was starting to do
		interesting features but hockey is
		big at the station and...

<b>				JANE
</b>			(interrupting)
		What about the obvious remedy?
		Reversing things.  Maybe getting a
		job on a newspaper.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I don't write.

	Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.

<b>				TOM
</b>		But that didn't stop me from
		sending out audition tapes to
		bigger stations and the networks.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, come on -- it is your life.
		Nobody is tying you to the fast
		track.  Did you go to college?

<b>				TOM
</b>		One year...almost one year.

<b>				JANE
</b>		So, you're not well educated and
		you have almost no experience and
		you can't write.

	He nods agreement.

<b>				TOM
</b>		And I'm making a fortune.

	Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
	her hands... He's making her feel a little crazy.  She gets off
	the bed.

<b>				JANE
</b>		It's hard for me to advise you
		since you personify something that
		I truly think is dangerous.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Uh-huh.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(holding it in)
		I agree with you -- you're not qualified.
			(letting it out)
		So get qualified.  You can insist on
		being better prepared.  You don't have
		to just leave it as...
			(mimicking him)
		'I don't write.  I'm not schooled.
		I don't understand the news I'm reading.
		But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

	A beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Whoa, this was a mistake.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Just what do you want from me, anyway?
		Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining
		and do something about it.

	He gets up to leave.  She follows him.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, you don't have to start right now.

	He turns to her.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I hated the way you talked to me just
		now...and it wasn't just because you
		were right.

	He exits.

<b>	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
	She is on the phone.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		No.  It wasn't just the speech --
		the same thing happened with this
		guy.  I have passed some line some
		place.  I am beginning to repel people
		I'm trying to seduce.

<b>	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	As he talks with Jane.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(agreeably)
		He must have been great-looking, right?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Why do you say that?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Because nobody invites a bad-
		looking idiot to their bedroom.

	She smiles.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Okay.  Let's do me.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Sure.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but
		do people who are actually slipping
		feel that way or is it always the
		really good people who are moving up
		who invariably think they're slipping
		because their standards are so high?

<b>				JANE
</b>		This conversation is not worthy of you.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'd give anything if that were true.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(laughing)
		Good night.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Wouldn't this be a great world if
		insecurity and desperation made us
		more attractive?  If needy were a
		turn-on?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Call if you get weird.

<b>	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
	She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed --
	on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes.  She doesn't 
	clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work.  
	The PHONE RINGS.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(answering)
		I was just thinking it was the
		shortest phone conversation we
		ever had.

<b>	EXT. PHONE BOOTH
</b>
	A deserted well-lit area.  Tom on the phone.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I never told you the reason I was
		telling you everything for.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(pleasantly surprised
			 it's him)
		Hey?

<b>	INTERCUT:
</b>
<b>	ON TOM
</b>
<b>				TOM
</b>		Those audition tapes I sent out...
		I've been hired by your network for
		the Washington bureau.  So I'll
		probably see you at work.  Sorry.

	Jane is rocked and soured.

<b>				JANE
</b>		What???

<b>	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - MORNING
</b>
	Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated.

<b>				AARON
</b>		They didn't hire Peter Stiller from
		the <u>Times</u> and he had a great
		audition tape.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You want to start going over who they
		could have gotten?  They can't take on
		people like this for network news.  For
		God's sake.  What's going on?

<b>	INT. NEWS BUILDING LOBBY - DAY
</b>
	Tom arrives for first day of work.

<b>	INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE
</b>
	ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief.  He
	is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years
	-- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
	a good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
	thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he
	holds dear.  As he hands Tom his credentials:

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Any particular area you feel
		strongest in?

<b>				TOM
</b>		To be honest, I was best at anchor.

	Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Why don't you take a few days observing
		the system?  Then we'll put you on
		general assignment.

<b>	EDITING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room.  Jane goes over her
	timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
	monitors.  BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
	Jane's bidding.  On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece
	which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline.  The
	PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
	which continuing to edit.  The pressure is palpable to begin
	with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting
	out of hand and threatening to bend lives.  Through it all, Jane
	remains remarkable calm.  Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(consulting notes)
		Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound
		bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I
		don't know how I'll feel...'

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		We could...

<b>				JANE
</b>			(interrupting)
		Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

	As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in
	the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
	Jane's eyes click to him briefly.  She makes not a move to
	welcome him.  He pauses, but is committed and tries to find
	a piece for himself against the wall.

<b>				TOM
</b>		They said I should observe the...

	Jane is distracted by the noise... Tom leaning over towards her.

<b>				TOM
</b>		They said it would be okay if...

<b>				JANE
</b>			(incredulous)
		We're working here!!  You can stand
		over in the uh, uh, uh...

	She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner.'  Then back
	to Bobbie:

<b>				JANE
</b>		Play back the last line...

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		He said something about...

<b>				JANE
</b>			(sharply)
		Let me hear it!

	Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing,
	yet still repressed resentment.

	The Assistant Director, BLAIR LITTON, enters the editing room.
	She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as
	Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		We'll need it in ten minutes.  We're
		putting it directly into...

	Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a
	ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		Craig, just a second --
			(to Bobbie)
		Let me hear it!

	Through much of this chaos we focus on:

<b>	TOM
</b>
	Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks --
	He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.  His eyes
	dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can,
	always returning with wonder to focus on Jane.

<b>				MERCENARY
</b>			(voice over)
		It's been a long time since I've seen
		my folks and all but...I don't expect
		any big-deal homecoming.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Stop there.
			(into phone she's
			 been holding)
		I want to shoot a picture from
		a book I have in the office.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		You don't have time.  Not a chance.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

	She crosses out.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		I've got to tell Ernie...because
		there isn't enough time.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yes, there is.

	Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes.  She charges out
	leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'm Tom Grunick.  I started on
		General Assignment today.

	Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
	Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		I don't think she's going to make it.

	Tom exits.

<b>	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM
</b>
	Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and
	JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer
	beauties in news.  She is well-schooled, bred, trained and
	known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and
	MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration --
	State Department correspondent for the network.

<b>				KLEIN
</b>		Okay, what about this?  Here's a
		tough ethical one.  Would you tell
		a source that you loved them just
		to get some information?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yes.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Me too.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Sure.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Jennifer didn't know there
		was an alternative.

	Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women
	will laugh when one says something funny.  Aaron smiles at her.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Here's one.  They allow us to have
		cameras at an execution in Florida.
		Do you broadcast tape of the guy  in
		the chair when they turn on the
		voltage?

<b>				KLEIN
</b>		Sure.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Why not?

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Absolutely.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		You bet.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Nothing like wrestling with a
		moral dilemma is there?

	Blair enters the scene, Tom trailing several feet behind,
	continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Excuse me, Ernie, we're several minutes
		to air and Jane's shooting an insert
		still for tonight's piece.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		She knows how much time she has.

	Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Okay.  I just wanted you to know.

<b>				AARON
</b>		What is she shooting?

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'

<b>				AARON
</b>			(thinks then)
		Oh, that's nice...
			(walking away)
		We'll need some new lines.

<b>	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Jane up against it now -- but still seemingly calm.  Tom
	watching, keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated,
	impressed.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second
		dissolve to the Rockwell.

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		Should I...

<b>				JANE
</b>			(interrupting)
		Just a two-second dissolve.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>			(hurting)
		Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...
		Why do you do this to me.  Is it
		because I won an award?

<b>	INT. RECORDING BOOTH - NIGHT
</b>
	Where Aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of
	paper even as he gets ready to record.  He times it with a
	stop watch.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait
		of a <u>Homecoming</u>  The return of a
		fighting man has always been one of
		the more moving ceremonies of war...
		Tearful women, proud men, excited
		children.  But J.D. Singer was right --
		his homecoming was no big deal.

<b>	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				BLAIR
</b>		We have a minute and a half.  It's my
		responsibility to tell them we won't
		be ready.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Uh-uh.  We're be ready.

	Blair glances frantically at her watch.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		In 84 seconds?

<b>	ON CLOCK
</b>
	Sweeping from 28 minutes to -- 84 seconds from deadline.  Aaron
	walks in, Jane looks up.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(hopefully)
		Nine seconds.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Eleven and a half.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?

<b>	ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DIALOGUE FOLLOWS.  IT BUILDS UNTIL IT
</b><b>	DUPLICATE THE SOUND OF LOUD AND BAWDY SEX.
</b>
<b>				BLAIR
</b>		You're saying 'Oh, God..."  They are
		going to go to up and the screen will
		be black -- they're going to go to black
		because we're not there.  How about
		careers, huh?  How about careers?

<b>	ON CLOCK
</b>
	42 seconds away.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		We're not going to make it.

	Bobbie makes a small bobble -- Jane giving the merest evidence
	of the strain, scratching her face repeatedly.

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		Whoops.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>			(unravelling)
		Whoops?!?  Whoops?!?  No, please...
		no, ooh, ahhh, ohhh.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Shit, shit, shit...

<b>				TOM
</b>			(caught up)
		You're almost there, you can do it --
		can do -- can do.

	And as the pitch reaches its zenith, 27 seconds left.  Bobbie
	hands the tape to Blair.

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		Ready.

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off.

<b>	VARIOUS SHOTS
</b>
	Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a
	chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight,
	the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
	elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps
	nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels
	down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
	arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is
	introduced on the air.

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the
	air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		I was a little nervous there for
		a minute.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Oh, come on -- tell us another.

<b>	ON MONITOR
</b>
	The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the
	mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait.  The 
	irony works nicely.  The network anchorman comes up for his close.  
	BILL RORISH, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses.  
	He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a 
	journalistic king.

<b>				BILL
</b>			(on monitor, smiling)
		Bill Rorish...Thank you...Good night.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Look at that smile.  Oh, that was
		good and oh my, Bill <u>smiled</u> -- he
		liked it.

<b>				AARON
</b>		He loved it.  Big smile.

	He gives Jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she
	returns -- Tom in the b.g. of the SHOT.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		I haven't seen Bill smile like that
		in weeks.

	Ernie has walked a few steps to the office.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Ernie, you missed his close... He smiled.
			(mimicking)
		Thank you...Good night.

	She smiles.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		I saw the smile -- good piece.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'm gonna go look at it again.

	They leave -- Aaron waving to Tom who stands in the b.g.  The
	others leave.  Tom approaches Jane.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It
		was totally impressive.  Great piece.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(somewhat formal)
		You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it
		feel being here?

<b>				TOM
</b>		I can't believe I'm really here.  No
		kidding.  If you're through work now --

<b>				JANE
</b>		No.  Aaron and I go to Central America
		on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I thought you were incredible in there.
		I know how much I have to learn.  I'd
		really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...

<b>				JANE
</b>		'Really a lot appreciate it...'

<b>				TOM
</b>		You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I
		can pick your brain --

	Jane grimaces at "pick your brain."

<b>				JANE
</b>		I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not
		here to teach remedial reporting.

<b>				TOM
</b>		And it has nothing to do with the fact
		I left your room instead of staying 
		there?

	Jane looks at him.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Oh, please.
			(then, almost gently)
		You're gonna have to understand
		something.  This isn't personal.

	She exits.

<b>	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING
</b>
	As Aaron, Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep
	in their own conversation.  Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS
	they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less
		and less air time.  They don't think
		I'm at all anchor material.

<b>				JANE
</b>		If we don't get to their camp soon,
		we won't be able to tape the supplies
		coming in.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Last time Paul was sick they gave
		Connie the weekend news instead of me.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You spend too much time -- much too
		much worrying about that crap...
			(suddenly reacting)
		Oh good.

	They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped,
	the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots
	inside.

<b>	ANGLE ON
</b>
	A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot.  A pair of new boots 
	sit alongside him.  Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in 
	Spanish, then English:

<b>				CAMERAMAN
</b>		Put on the boot.

	Jane rushes into the scene incensed.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Stop!  We are not here to stage the news.
		Wait and see what he does.

	Then to the totally confused soldier.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Sir, you do whatever you want.  It's
		your choice.

	By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as
	the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to
	what is expected.  He looks to Jane, who can offer no help
	save her own determination not to interfere.  Finally he puts
	on the boot.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.

	He shoots the scene.

<b>	INT. HAY ADAMS HOTEL
</b>
	Tom, in shirt and tie, is on the phone.  This is a big day.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Okay, I'll meet the crew there then.
		Could you give me that address again?
		Great.  Yes, it's good to finally be
		getting to work.  Okay that's
		17204?  1-7-2-0-4.  Thanks.

<b>	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
</b>
	As Tom gets directions from the CONCIERGE.

<b>				CONCIERGE
</b>		It's only ten minutes if you prefer
		to walk...
			(as he walks away)
		I'll look for you on the news tonight.

<b>	EXT. HOTEL - DAY
</b>
	Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived.  The
	strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off
	to cover his first story.  He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

<b>	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON
</b>
	Jane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
	to the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

				AARON (in Spanish)
		Are you guys kidding or do you really
		think you'll run into something...?
		I mean, do you feel that every time
		and it never happens?  Or is it the
		first time it felt that way and it's
		going to happen?... I mean, how bad
		can it be?... Are you nervous...?
		What's the chances on a scale of one
		to ten -- that we're going to be in
		a war within the next few hours?...
		Really?

	He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
	talking with calling after him with an added thought.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Thanks, you speak English very well
		too.
			(to Jane)
		Great news.  He says they've been
		engaging the Sandinistas pretty
		regularly and that he'd be really
		surprised if we didn't take fire 
		tonight.

	Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration.  Aaron is amazed at her
	attitude.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Look at her.
			(to Jane)
		If anything happens to me tell every
		woman I've ever dated I was talking
		about them at the end.  That way they'll
		have to reevaluate me.

	Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention.
	Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish.  The Guerrillas laugh.

<b>	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</b>
	Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas.  They HEAR A SHOT.
	The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men.  Aaron
	grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left.  As they run --
	more SHOTS.  Jane in work mode.  As soon as they settle.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Let's tape.

<b>				CAMERAMAN
</b>			(Spanish accent)
		Much too dark.  Black.

<b>				JANE
</b>		That's okay.

<b>	ON AARON BARELY DISCERNIBLE
</b>
	As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
	the nearly gunfire.

<b>				AARON
</b>		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.  The Contras feel they
		must be outnumbered this is so small
		a unit:  that's a given.  Still they
		hold their ground despite the fact
		that their weapons have been acting
		up -- misfiring or jamming.  A new
		shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow --
		all they got today were the shoes.

	There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.
			(to Aaron)
		Great line at the end.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Did you shoot their boots?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Of course.

<b>				AARON
</b>		We can cut back at the end.

<b>				JANE
</b>		To the pan of the supplies boxes --

<b>				AARON
</b>		Can you believe it?  I just risked my
		life for a network that tests my face
		with focus groups.

<b>	EXT. GOVERNMENT BLDG - AFTERNOON
</b>
	Tom, squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters... behind a
	police line.  He HEARS a reporter next to him say:

<b>				REPORTER
</b>		I think he's coming out now.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to his crew)
		They say he's coming out now.

	A surge.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to Reporter)
		Is that him?

<b>				TOM'S CAMERAMAN
</b>		Yes.

	Tom checks his notes.


<b>	INSERT - TOM'S BLACK BOOK
</b>
	The same model we've seen Jane use.  A list of questions
	written in big color highlighted letters.  As he looks down
	to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off.

<b>	TOM'S P.O.V.
</b>
	The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions.
	"Will you dispatch troops?" after the Ambassador they've been
	awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the
	movement of the vehicle.

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back.

<b>				CAMERAMAN
</b>			(observing Tom)
		What's wrong?

<b>				TOM
</b>		I had a lot of questions here.  I
		missed the story.

<b>				CAMERAMAN
</b>		Don't worry, it's okay.  I got
		a piece of his face.

<b>	EXT. GUERRILLAS CAMP - MORNING
</b>
	Jane is standing -- talking to her crew.  Others asleep
	in b.g. -- a drowsy, morning-after feeling.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Are you all packed and ready?

<b>				CAMERAMAN
</b>		The stuff in the dark is not good.
		Nobody wants news lit like that.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Will you just get packed?

	She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding
	a knapsack in her hand.  She takes off a brush and runs it
	through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
	toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
	from her canteen.  She puts everything back in place, then looks
	about, sobs for several beats.  One of the Guerrillas hears her
	sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
	away.  Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of
	explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

<b>	INT. WASHINGTON CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	The Washington Control Room.  Jennifer, Jane, Aaron, Blair stand
	watching the intro to the Central American piece.  Tom stands in
	the distant b.g.  There are over a dozen monitors -- including
	one which is constantly on the anchor man, Bill Rorish.

<b>	ON TELEVISION MONITORS
</b>
	Bill Rorish on camera -- an INSERT behind showing Aaron in
	blackness planted into a Central American map bordered by rifles.
	A separate monitor shows the INSERT alone.

				BILL (voice over)
		A fire fight along the Nicaraguan
		border...in one minute.

	The INSERT MOVES OUT AT US TO FILL THE SCREEN -- WE SEE Aaron's
	dim outline and HEAR him say:

				AARON (voice over; on camera)
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.

	The MUSICAL "EVENING NEWS" SIGNATURE COMES IN ever-so-briefly.
	The SCREEN GOES TO A COMMERCIAL -- as Blair screams
	enthusiastically.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Great graphic, great graphic.

	Ernie ENTERS THE  SCENE... He kisses Jane in greeting -- pats
	Aaron on the back.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		You finally got a piece in a few
		minutes early and I hear Bill loved it.

	Jennifer gives Jane a mock pat on the back.

				ERNIE (continuing)
		I have somebody downstairs who one of
		the clerks brought in and vouches for.
		He says he has something to say about
		gays getting promotions at State...
		It can't hurt to tape him.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	As she feels Tom staring at her -- turns and notices him
	for the first time.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Hi.

<b>				JANE
</b>		How's it going?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(thrown)
		I just got back -- I don't know
		which end is up.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Okay.

	In the b.g. WE MAY HAVE NOTICED Bill Rorish on one monitor as he
	picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial
	break.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Jane!  Bill Rorish wants to speak
		to you at the break.
			(as she hands it to her)
		I never heard of him handing over
		compliments in the middle of the
		show.

	There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the
	anchor man in New York who WE CAN VIEW on a monitor.

<b>	ON MONITOR
</b>
	We see Bill Rorish.

<b>				BILL
</b>			(into phone)
		Jane?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		Yes.

<b>				BILL
</b>			(into phone)
		Well, darling, if it gets any better than
		that, I'm going to have to bring you up
		here to New York.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first
		twenty seconds.

	Blair cringes at Jane's blunt reply.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		But thanks.

<b>				BILL
</b>			(over phone)
		Well, the visual with the boots at the
		end was just perfect.

	Jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to Aaron.

<b>				JANE
</b>		God, he loved the boots.

	Aaron reaches happily for the phone.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		Aaron should be hearing this so I
		have an extra witness.

<b>				BILL
</b>			(over phone)
		Well, you always want to give the 
		credit away, do you?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		No, I don't.  He happens to deserve
		the credit.  He's right here.

<b>				BILL
</b>			(over phone)
		I'll speak to you soon

	We see Rorish over the monitor.  He hangs up.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to Aaron)
		He had to read over some new copy.

	We see on the monitor that this is not so.  It's a very eggy moment
	Aaron.  Tom breaks the silence.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to the rescue)
		Okay if I watch you tape that interview
		downstairs?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yeah.

	As he passes Jane he leans next to her and WE HEAR him WHISPER.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Please laugh so they think I'm not
		dying inside but have so much style
		I just said something funny.

	Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...
	but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
	Blair wants desperately to be inside Aaron's joke.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		What did he say?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(as if still amused)
		I'll never tell.

<b>	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT
</b>
	BUDDY FELTON waits alone.  A CAMERA CREW watches him.  He is
	well dressed, exceedingly nervous.  He summons the courage to
	ask a question.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Could I see how I photograph?

<b>				CAMERAWOMAN
</b>		Huh?  Sorry?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		'Cause for the interview they're
		going to use a screen and disguise
		me to protect my anonymity so could
		I see myself before that?

<b>				CAMERAWOMAN
</b>		Sure.

	The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image
	comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor.  He's not
	happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
	gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it.  Aaron enters.
	Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
	But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush.  Buddy's
	internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up,
	fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
	thoughts.

	Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

<b>				AARON
</b>		It's Mr. Buddy Felton?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Yes.

<b>				AARON
</b>		That's your full name?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Yes.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I might as well ask you the questions
		on tape.  Is that all right?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Yes.

<b>				AARON
</b>		You worked at one time as 
		Foreign Service Trainee in the
		State Department.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		I was there two years and was promoted
		on merit nine times.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Eventually rising to...

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Office Bimbo. 
			(curbing his amusement) 
		No, I'm sorry.

	Aaron is having a hard enough day,  He is visibly annoyed.

<b>				AARON
</b>		You're saying the fact that you're
		gay had something directly to do with
		your promotions?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Eventually rising to?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>
		G.S.  I don't know.
			(scratches his head)
		I don't know numbers.

	Tom laughs.  Aaron shoots him a look.

<b>				AARON
</b>		You're saying the fact that you're gay had
		something directly to do with your promotions?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		I don't like the word gay.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Which would you prefer?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Ravenous homosexual.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it,
		Ellen.  Let's call security and
		get him out.

	As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy
	walking in small circles giving himself a talking to.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>			(self flagellating)
		Great time to act out, Buddy.  You
		won't be happy until you turn the
		whole world off.

	He notices Tom.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		They're not really going to call
		security are they?

<b>				TOM
</b>		No, I don't think so.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		How do I get out of here?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Follow me.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>			(dazzled)
		You talked me into it.

<b>	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</b>
	Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer.  Buddy
	self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable
	tension of romance and adventure.

<b>	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
	A Guard on duty -- a BLACK WOMAN.  She sees Buddy.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		Oh, you're the gay guy.  I was just
		coming to find you.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		I'm leaving.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to Guard)
		It's okay.

<b>	EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</b>
	Walking.  Buddy in step with him.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Sir?

	Tom turns.  Buddy talks rather quickly -- He cares very much
	about leaving Tom with the right impression.  The last words
	of his speech he hadn't expected to say.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		Thank you for not shunning me and
		all.
			(more)
		I really did have all that information
		but I thought I might just be being
		vindictive to get a little hunk of
		the ol' spotlight.  I know, horrible --
		but I didn't do it, so okay?  And
		thanks again and would you like to
		have a drink -- at a regular bar?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Oh, sure.  Okay.

	His heart racing, Buddy attempts casual matter-of-factness.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Is there a regular bar around here?

<b>	INT./ENT. REGULAR BAR - NIGHT
</b>
	Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.  For Tom, the last weeks have
	been humbling, antagonistic.  He's enjoying Buddy who listens
	attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I've been doing some morning show
		stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't
		bother me.  I'm in no rush for
		anything.  It's just the snotty
		attitude, even if I have it coming,
		it's still...

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Bad manners.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes.  That's right.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		I know...I mean you didn't do anything
		special for me tonight.  You just had
		what I think are good manners, decency.
		And it really makes me want to be nice
		back and it has nothing to do with any
		homosexual thing.
			(looks right at him)
		Honestly.
			(then away)
		Because I don't know if you've
		homosexual or not and -- you're not,
		are you?

<b>				TOM
</b>		No...no.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		One's enough.

	Tom signals for the check.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		I wasn't doing anything.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I really have to go.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Okay.  At least let me show my
		appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor
		is going to be indicted on Wednesday.
		For the graft thing he supposedly did
		before he was appointed.

<b>				TOM
</b>		What?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Yes, it's true.  They're going to
		make it public Wednesday but isn't
		it a big deal for you to have it a
		day and a half early?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes.  How do you know?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>			(shrugs)
		My roommate's very social -- somebody
		from Justice was over and...I always
		hear things before they happen.  Hey,
		and from now on, so do you.

<b>	INT. ERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	George Weln, the black correspondent and Tom are seated in the
	office with Ernie -- they are in mid-meeting.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I'm virtually certain it's not true.
		He may be indicted eventually, but I
		don't think it will be this month.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>			(to Tom)
		You want to be alone with me --
		tell me your source?

<b>				TOM
</b>		If I told you I'm not sure it would 
		totally convince you, but I totally 
		believe the guy.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>			(insufferable)
		Labor is my Department -- I can't
		conform it and my contacts go very
		deep.

<b>				TOM
</b>		So if it's true -- I'm terrific,
		right?

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		It's not even a close call.  Of
		course we can't go with it.

<b>	INT. EDITING ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY
</b>
	Jane is working with Bobbie the editor... Snatches of the tape
	make it obvious that the Labor Secretary has been indicted --
	George Weln stands behind Jane, who is dialing a number.

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		Do you want him all the way to the 
		car?

<b>				JANE
</b>		No stop where he's all besieged.

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		Because...

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to Bobbie)
		Right there, Bobbie.

	Tom enters.

<b>				TOM
</b>		So he was indicted?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		We were right not to go with it.

<b>				TOM
</b>		But I was right -- just somebody give
		it to me.  I had a good story.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to George)
		Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie
		and I serve anonymously.

	He pats Bobbie on the back... and exits.

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>			(pausing in his work)
		You know, I like Tom, because hi...

<b>				JANE
</b>		Bobbie, please.

<b>	INT. METRO BUS - DAY
</b>
	Crowded rush hour... Buddy and Tom stand next to each other.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		...and the White House is hoping to
		keep a lid on it for a few days till
		they figure out what to do.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Thanks a lot, Buddy.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>			(brushing it off)
		Oh, please.  So they were really
		impressed with you at work.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Not impressed exactly -- but a break
		in the clouds.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		I see the change in you -- I see it.

<b>	INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

	In the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed
	MARINE GUARD, standing at attention.

<b>				TOM

		So he bought this Peugeot sedan at
		a greatly reduced price while he was
		there in charge of the White House
		Advance Team.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		How come you're not chasing it down
		yourself?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Look, I'm junior man -- and it's
		your beat.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Boy, that's nice...I wish we could
		all deal with each other like this.
		I'll check it.  Anything I can do
		for you?

<b>				TOM
</b>		This is my first time at the White House.
		Is there any chance to look at where
		he works and the rest of it?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		I didn't have the guts to ask when
		I first came up.  I'll get you a

		Peugeot and new rules will put future
		bargain hunting off limits for
		Presidential Aides.  This is Jennifer Mack
		at the White House.

	Tom and Buddy smile at each other... energized -- up.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating
		being a news source.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Nobody else had it.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		I wish it were you giving the story.

<b>				TOM
</b>		That's okay.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		What if we just don't tell them
		anything anymore unless they let
		you do the story?

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  Really...don't worry about it.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Okay.  And look, in the future I can
		call you when I have news for you.
		Don't feel you have to spend time
		with me just to get the information.
			(a breath; then
			 to himself)
		Well, that wasn't as hard to say as
		you thought, was it, Buddy?

<b>				TOM
</b>		What do you mean?  You're one of the
		few people in this town I can talk
		to.

	Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF
<b>	RAPTURE.
</b>
<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Hoooo.

	The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.  Tom shifts
	with discomfort.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>			(simply)
		Okay.

<b>	INT. WASHINGTON BUREAU - NIGHT
</b>
	Jane waiting for an elevator... It comes and she steps on just
	as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office
	calling for her.  He goes to the stairs.

<b>	INT. WALKWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	He runs out and sees Jane in the lobby below, then takes off
	after her.

<b>	INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
</b>
	As he enters and runs outside, looking in both directions then
	running off to the right.  A BEAT -- REVEALING Jane has stopped
	to talk with Blair -- now she exits.

<b>	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT
</b>
	Tom on the street, ahead of her, thinking he's behind her...
	He runs another half a block and stops dejected... Turns to walk
	back to the office.  He keeps looking back to see if he missed
	her, so that his head is turned as Jane reaches him, says a
	fairly social:

<b>				JANE
</b>		Hi, how are you?

	She keeps moving -- Tom spinning after her.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Wait -- I need you.

	She stops.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I've got another story.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Some public official skipped a week
		on his Christmas Club?

<b>				TOM
</b>		The House Armed Service Committee
		has a secret report which says that
		the General Stillwell tank the Army
		has dumped a fortune into plain 
		won't work.  I have it cold,
		confirmed.  They have five million
		dollars in this thing already.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Billion.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Okay, billion...right, of course.
		They told me I could have any producer
		I wanted -- and I want you.

	As Tom savors the moment.

<b>	INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING
</b>
	Various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching Tom's
	piece being broadcast.  We SEE a TANK MISFIRING.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(voice over)
		One source referred to it as a
		five billion dollar metal sculpture
		to ugly to look at and too big to bury.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(to Jane)
		You write this?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I write for you sometimes.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Not because you have to.

<b>	ON MONITOR
</b>
	We SEE a General walking away from Tom.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(voice over)
		General Elton McGuire is in charge of
		the weapon system.

<b>	ON MONITOR - TWO SHOT
</b>
<b>				GENERAL
</b>		I've been in the Army twenty-seven
		years -- so I'll let the Army ask
		the questions, not you.

<b>				TOM
</b>		General, I don't want to bother you
		anymore or your family.  But tomorrow
		there will be a mob of me back here --
		so, if you have anything to say, why
		not say it now, sir, the way you want?

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	He is a study.

	Looking at himself -- and though it's far from his first time on
	television -- it's the first time he's seen himself doing serious
	work and, by all appearances, doing it well.  As the General
	answers in the b.g. --

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		I think it's great of us to have left
		in what you said -- just great of us.

	Tom smiles modestly.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yeah, let's never forget.  We're
		the real story.  Not them.

	Tom and Jane look over -- then Tom looks to Jane for a verdict.
	In the b.g., the news goes to a commercial.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yeah, I know, I went back and forth
		on it.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		I liked it.  He's not afraid to be
		human.

	Ernie ENTERS THE SCENE with his fourteen-year-old DAUGHTER
	in tow... He approaches Tom.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		My youngest wanted to meet you.
		This is Ellie.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Hi, Ellie.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		You should be honored -- she
		never cares about meeting
		anyone here.  But she liked you
		on television just now.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(entering scene)
		Hi, Ellie -- remember me?

<b>				ELLIE
</b>		I'm sorry -- from where?

<b>				AARON
</b>		I've been to your house a lot...

<b>				ERNIE
</b>			(helping)
		And Aaron went on that fourteen
		day raft trip with us last year.

<b>				ELLIE
</b>			(vaguely)
		Oh yes -- hi.

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT (LATE)
</b>
	Tom is on the phone.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(into phone)
		Hi, Dad...Did you see it?  Great --
		I'll send you a tape...I'm sorry I
		haven't called.  Things were a little
		bumpy for a while.  It's not important...
		I'm fine now.
			(what he's been
			 wanting to say aloud)
		Hey, Dad -- I just may be able to
		do this job...Well, I'm glad you
		were sure.

<b>	INT. ERNIE MARRIMAN'S VIRGINIA HOME - DAY
</b>
	Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand
	around drinking in small groups... Aaron is standing with Blair
	and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		I don't know why we have to feel
		defensive about it.  Newspapers
		are in business to make money --
		why not us?

	Aaron looks at her in amazement.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		They criticize us for supposedly
		pandering while they run WINGO
		Games.

<b>				GREY HAIRED MAN
</b>			(amused)
		Exactly right.  Excuse me.  I'm
		paid to mix.

	Blair and Aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another
	group.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Goodbye, Paul.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Take care, Paul.
			(back to Blair)
		It takes a certain kind of courage
		for you to say that in front of
		the President of the News Division.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		You think anyone who's proud of
		the work we do is an ass kisser.

<b>				AARON
</b>		No.  I think anyone who puckers their
		lips and presses it against his boss'
		buttocks and then smooches is an ass
		kisser.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		My gosh, and for a while there, I was
		attracted to you.

	She walks off.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Wait a minute -- that changes
		everything.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	At the bar getting a drink.

	Jennifer ENTERS THE SCENE... and leads Jane down the hall until
	they are standing alone.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		This is very awkward.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Go ahead -- what?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but
		I see Tom around you a lot and this
		is such a small office and I'd like
		to see him outside of work, unless
		there's some reason for you to mind...
		in which case I just won't do anything.

<b>				JANE
</b>		God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind?
		Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What
		a shock -- I don't have a right to...
		I don't think I like him.  I know
		I don't respect him...So what am
		I talking about -- what am I saying
		to you?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		You're saying stay away from him.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(stupefied)
		I can't be.

	She blinks in wonder.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		We don't have to settle this
		definitively right now.

	Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied
	by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle
	and scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she
	moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.  She takes a few
	breaths as she keeps walking.  We HEAR snatches of PARTY
	CONVERSATIONS, i.e:

<b>				GEORGE WELN
</b>		Tell me one person who ever left
		television news to work on a
		newspaper.

	She moves on; Tom still following.

<b>				ERNIE'S WIFE
</b>			(holding Paul's arm)
		I felt so proud when he turned
		down News Vice President so we
		could stay here.  Suddenly, after
		all these years, we have a life.

	Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few
	feet away.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(badly)
		Hi, Tom.

	She stands there, genuinely frightened.  She must deal with him
	now.  He crosses to her.

<b>				TOM
</b>		It's the firs time I've seen 
		you dressed like this.  You look
		so clean and pretty.

<b>				JANE
</b>		What do you mean clean?

<b>				TOM
</b>		At work there's always this
		sort of film over you.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, thumps like me leave appearance
		to guys like you.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You're great at taking the edge
		off a good time.

	Jane starts twitching.  She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on
	his arm to steady herself.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You okay?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yes.  Just don't say anything mean
		for a while.  Thanks.

	She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses
	control for the first time in her memory.  She looks strange as
	she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I've got to find someone.  It's
		important.  Excuse me.

	She walks away.

<b>	ON AARON AND ERNIE
</b>
<b>				ERNIE
</b>		I had the strangest thing happen
		yesterday.  Anne and I have been
		married what? -- Thirty-six years...
		Everything fine -- two days after the
		promotion came through, I was checking
		myself in the mirror and she was
		making a face at me behind my back.
		So yesterday I looked in the mirror
		and she was doing it again.

<b>				AARON
</b>		You didn't say anything to her?

	He shakes his head.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		My instincts tell me not to.

	Annie comes up.

<b>				ANNE
</b>		The office is phoning, honey.

	He EXITS SCENE as Anne watches him go.

<b>				ANNE
</b>		I hope he moves that fast when
		it's me on the line.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she
	picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled.  She
	sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a
	too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.

<b>	ON STAIRCASE
</b>
	Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Forget what I said -- you do
		whatever you want to with him.

	She pushes at Jennifer a little.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Well, there's nothing I'm going
		to do right this second.

	Jane pushes her again.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		But it's a party, right?

	Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back
	down the steps and crosses to Tom.

<b>	FULL SCENE
</b>
	Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
	Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
	and huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent...
	The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer.  We PICK UP just
	a few words:

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		This would be a good time to tap
		that source of yours.  He could
		have an angle or something.

<b>	AARON'S P.O.V.
</b>
	Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed
	looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie
	now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new
	energy in the area.  Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet
	them.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>			(to Jane)
		We want you to exec produce a
		Special Report...

<b>				JANE
</b>		What?

	Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		A Libyan plane shot up one of our
		bases in Egypt.  It's all still
		happening.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Let's figure out the field.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Unfortunately, since Paul's here,
		he's made out the assignments...
		Jennifer at the White House...
		George at the Pentagon...Martin
		at State...and we need an anchor
		since Rorish is in his boat, so we're
		gonna do the whole report this
		afternoon from here...with Tom.

<b>				AARON
</b>		That's it.  I resign as of now.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>			(to Aaron)
		Stop it.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if
		Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Ernie, as much as I like you, I
		think I have to tell Paul what I
		think, because this is really sort
		of obscenely stupid.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Jane, if you want to, go ahead.  I
		don't disagree with you.

	Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the
	big boss.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually
	catching up with Paul.  In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the
	"BEEP" of an ANSWERING MACHINE.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Hello, Buddy.  It's 1:35 -- and
		this is Tom.  You can reach me
		at the office.  It's important.
		I can use a little help.

	Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered
	intensity.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Tom isn't ready for the job
		you're about to hand him.  Not
		near ready.  Not by the longest
		shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks
		in Tripoli, he's interviewed
		Gaddafi -- he reported on the
		Eight-one story.  I think he's
		essential to do the job we're
		capable of and I think it's my
		responsibility to tell you that.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		Okay, that's your opinion.  I
		don't agree.

<b>				JANE
</b>		It's not opinion.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		You're just absolutely right
		and I'm absolutely wrong?

	She nods.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		It must be nice to always believe
		you know better.  To think you're
		always the smartest person in the
		room.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(from her depths)
		No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(turning to leave)
		We'd better get moving.

	As they move out... Jane goes to Aaron... He moves with her
	towards the door.

<b>				AARON
</b>		What happened?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I'll tell you later -- where
		you going to watch from?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Watch? --

<b>				JANE
</b>		I'll come by your place, right
		after...drink, take pills...
		Love you.

	She runs out the door.  Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's
	last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yeah, love you, too.

<b>	EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
</b>
	As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room.  Tom opens
	the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in.  It moves off.

<b>	INT. TOM'S CAR - DAY
</b>
	As it moves off.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Nervous?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Excited.

	Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told
	the truth.

<b>	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	In the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
	activity.  Tom closes the door.  He sits down behind his desk
	and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
	He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
	one.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
	off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
	of an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
	the authority figure we know he's now.

<b>	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR
</b>
	Jane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
	calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
	the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Tell George and Jessica to try
		and cover everything without
		Tom having to ask additional
		questions.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		And Bobbie says...

<b>				JANE
</b>		Did you hear what I just said --
		do you have that?  Take a breath.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>			(a breath, then)
		Yes.

	In the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about --
	waiting for some indication as to what to do next.

<b>				JANE
</b>		And the most important thing
		make sure his earpiece works,
		have back-ups ready.  That's
		never been more vital.  He
		must be able to hear me at
		every second and clearly.

	Jane sees him.  She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
	arm.

<b>				JANE
</b>		We have twenty minutes -- you can
		wait in the studio.

	Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a
	nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.

<b>	GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic
	representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force
	Mirage Fighter.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Put in the radar plane that spotted
		them to begin with.

<b>				GRAPHIC ARTIST
</b>		We have no pictures on file.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I can't draw -- but this is a
		rough idea.

	She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
	an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane.  Her work is
	stunning.

<b>	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
	bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.  He picks
	a French song -- looks at some of his books.  He might even
	read.  He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one.
	He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.

<b>	INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
	Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio --
	there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up.  Buddy
	is being stopped at the other end of the hallway.

<b>	ON BUDDY AND SECURITY GUARD
</b>
<b>				GUARD
</b>		I have to check first.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>			(a bit frantic)
		Well, then check -- but hurry --
		There he is!!!

	Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's
	gestures to slow down.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Is everything all right?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes.  You didn't have to come here.
		It's just that I'm going to anchor
		this special report on this Libyan
		thing...

<b>				BUDDY
</b>			(delighted)
		Anchor?

<b>				TOM
</b>			(amused despite
			 situation)
		Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could
		find out anything about what's
		happening.
			(on Buddy's reaction)
		What's wrong?

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		I broke up with my roommate --
		He was really the magnet for
		everyone who knew anything.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Oh.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Look, I can start up with him again
		if you really...

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

	Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Good.  He's on the world's longest
		ego trip, let him take it alone.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've 
		got to go to work.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>			(to Tom)
		...good-bye then.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'll speak to you.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Well, who knows.  Just let m tell
		you what my favorite teacher ever,
		told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be
		wonderful.'

	He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on
	the cheek.  Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
	his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.

<b>	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past
	the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
	two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
	wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
	table occupied by Blair.  Now she slips into the large well
	paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.

	Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
	immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State
	and the White House.  In front of her the bank of monitors, the
	Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at
	Anchor, a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy.

<b>	ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR
</b>
	As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus
	of minds and machines comprising the big time network news.
	And Jane Craig is at the helm.  Blair experiences a flash of 
	emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>			(sotto to Jane)
		Executive Producer -- wow.

	Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does
	a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
	graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT... We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	say, "This is a Special Report from..."

<b>	INSERT:  JANE'S CONTROL PANEL
</b>
	Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect
	her to Tom and the Field Reporters.  She presses the button
	marked "Tom."

<b>				JANE
</b>		You hear me, Tom?  Tom?  Tom?
		Damn it...He can't hear me...
			(to Blair)
		I told you if there was one thing...

	Tom's VOICE on speakers.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(voice over; relaxed)
		I can hear you.  I was just teasing.

	Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by
	the macho cool as:

	Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the
	Announcer's last words clear.

<b>				ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
</b>			(voice over)
		...in Washington, Tom Grunick.

	He begins his report.  He seems authoritative, compelling, even
	in a low key way.  We trust him.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Good afternoon.  A Libyan fighter
		plane attacked a United States
		Military Installation early this
		morning and was, itself, shot down
		by American F-14 Interceptors.

	Another monitor shows the Graphic running.  In the b.g. two
	men approaches Paul.  They look out of place, decidedly
	non-business like.

<b>				MAN ONE
</b>		Mr. Moore, I'm Marvin Usher and this 
		is my brother, Stuart.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		Not now!!!
			(gesturing)
		Look.

<b>				TOM
</b>		The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army
		Warehouse which, just thirty minutes
		earlier, had been crowded with 
		servicemen.  No one was injured.

<b>	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to MUSIC -- reading
	a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him.  He
	SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point
	providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.

<b>				AARON
</b><b>			(SINGING LOUDLY)
</b>		And I can read while I sing.

	He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the
	television on, the SOUND OFF.

<b>	ON TV
</b>
	We SEE the graphic of the Libyan plane's flight route, its
	missile firing -- the U.S. planes taking off and the shooting
	down of the Mirage jet... At one point Aaron lowering the MUSIC
	and raising the TV SOUND hearing Tom.

<b>				TOM'S VOICE
</b>			(voice over)
		The heat seeking missile virtually
		disintegrated the  plane on...

	Aaron turns down the TV SOUND and turns up the MUSIC.

<b>	INT. BOOTH
</b>
	Jane's hand flicks at the button marked "PENTAGON."

<b>				JANE
</b>		George, you're ready.

<b>	ON PENTAGON MONITOR
</b>
	We SEE George and HEAR him through Jane's voice box.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>			(voice over)
		Should I cover everything or should
		I save something for Tom to ask about?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Cover everything!

	George nods.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(hitting Tom's button)
		We're going to George.  Say 'the
		Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have
		George Weln at the Pentagon'.

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
<b>				TOM
</b>		George Weln is at the Pentagon where
		the attack launched by the lone
		Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
		movement of military might.

<b>	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
	Where he still balances STEREO and TV SOUND.

<b>				AARON
</b>		A lot of alliteration from anxious
		anchors placed in powerful posts.

	He picks up the phone.

<b>	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</b>
	As Blair hands it to Jane.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		It's Aaron.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yes?

<b>				AARON
</b>		I think the pilot that shot down the
		Libyan in 1981 is stationed right
		here.  Maybe you could get him --
		and maybe Tom should say that our F-14
		is one of the hardest planes to fly.
		They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Thanks.
			(to Tom)
		The F-14 is one of the most difficult
		planes to master.
			(remembering)
		Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in
		the 70's the first crop had a number
		of crashes.

<b>				TOM
</b>		George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat one of 
		the most difficult machines for a
		pilot to master?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I think you're right -- it's certainly
		one of our hottest planes.

<b>	INT. AARON'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>				AARON
</b>		I say it here -- it comes out there.

	He giggles.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(voice over)
		There was trouble with them in the
		early days -- back in the 70's.

	Aaron dials again... As we SEE Jennifer standing at the
	White House.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(into phone)
		Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't
		foam at the mouth or anything.  When
		you speak to him he's not at all nuts.
		He seems like a leader -- very
		impressive, self-control...that's
		what's so strange.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
<b>				JANE
</b>		Right and we have the '81
		pilot on the way in -- Nobody else
		will have him.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(voice over)
		You're welcome.  Sow how does it
		feel to...I know you gotta go --
		Me too.  We're very busy here.

	He hangs up -- LONG SHOT... Aaron with his remote controls.
	The picture switches back to Tom.  He turns UP the VOLUME.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(voice over)
		...outlaw nation but strangely those
		who have interviewed Gaddafi find
		him, in a phrase we like to use in
		this country, very 'presidential'.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Nice, Jane.

<b>	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Jane is on the phone.  The atmosphere buckling with strain.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		Just a minute.

	Her finger hits the "Tom" button.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to Tom)
		To State for the message from Libya,
		then you'll have the carrier pilot
		from the Sidra in time to...
			(a sudden shriek)
		What?  No!

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing.

<b>	BACK TO JANE
</b>
	As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she
	is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.

<b>				JANE
</b>		We only have ten minutes left --
		how can you talk to me about parking
		problems?  No, not you'll try...you'll
		do it -- do it or I'll fry your fat
		ass, Estelle.  Good-bye.

	As she BANGS the PHONE down.  Paul comments sotto to Ernie.

<b>				PAUL
</b>			(sotto)
		I had no idea she was this good.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(hitting Tom's button)
		Fill for a second.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(fluidly)
		The latest message seems to indicate
		that the Libyan pilot was acting on
		his own without authority from anyone
		else.
			(into camera directly)
		In other words, I think we're okay.

<b>	INT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER
</b>
	MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE,
	TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages,
	even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees
	the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a
	assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him,
	beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN
	TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN
	TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells
	him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.

<b>				TOM
</b>		...So, Commander, it must have been
		a bit tougher today -- shooting down
		the French-made Mirage Jet.  The one
		you got was a SU-22...etc...

	And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece
	and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract
	vision.

<b>	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</b>
<b>				TOM'S VOICE
</b>		...Once again:  The Libyan Government
		has disavowed any prior knowledge of
		the flight.  This has been Tom Grunick
		reporting from Washington.

	The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and
	Blair momentarily grasp hands.  The first talk concerns Tom.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		He was brilliant.  I've never been
		as proud of one of my decisions.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>			(calls back to Jane)
		Great work, Jane, really -- You know?
		Really.

	She nods... totally depleted.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, there were no major gaffs anyway.

	Ernie scoffs in her direction.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Thanks, everybody.

	She exits the scene.

<b>				PAUL
</b>			(to the Usher brothers)
		This was important for Tom -- there's
		that bonding thing that happens with
		the public and an anchorman during a
		crisis.  It's not the conventions
		anymore; it's this kind of moment.

	Tom enters.  He is exuberant.

<b>				PAUL
</b>			(to Tom)
		What a baptismal.  Congratulations.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Thanks.  With all the help you get,
		it's sure easier than local.

	Paul and Ernie exchange a glance.

				TOM (cont'd)
		Where's Jane?  I'm still juiced.

	Ernie points off... as Tom exits.  The Usher brothers hover.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>			(to the Usher brothers)
		Can I help you?

<b>				MARVIN
</b>		We're here to play the new news theme.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		New theme?  You don't need me for this.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		Stay.  Why should I be the only one
		to feel silly?

<b>				MAN ONE
</b>		We need a synthesizer -- but this
		will give you an idea.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		Go ahead.
			(to Ernie)
		Wasn't he great?

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		It worked.

	Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
	news theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering
	composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
	that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
</b>
	As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in... He
	enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win"
	the most noteworthy moment of his working life.

<b>	INT. JANE'S CUBBY - DAY
</b>
<b>				TOM
</b>		You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling
		having you inside my head.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(a bit thrown)
		Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Indescribable -- you knew just when to 
		feed me the next thing, just a split 
		second before I needed it.  There was a 
		rhythm we got into, like great sex.

	Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
	truthfulness.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You have to celebrate with me, don't
		you?  Everybody's going to that bar
		on the corner, 'Caps.'

<b>				JANE
</b>		I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll
		hoop up with all of you later.  How
		long do you think you'll be there?

	Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer.  They
	enters the elevator.

<b>	EXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT
</b>
	As several people cross the street towards the bar.  Tom has
	been holding back on one question.

<b>				TOM
</b>		It's tempting to ask you how you think
		I did.
			(she starts to reply)
		No.  I'm enjoying myself.  Take it easy.

	He starts across the street.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(trying to be casual)
		Maybe I'll see you over there.

	Indicates Bar.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You'll never show up.

	He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Jane?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yeah?

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'll wait for you till seven.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(shouting back)
		Okay.

	Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
	pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction.  Jane
	moving quickly along.

	SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
	through:

<b>	EXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING
</b>
	As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
	stoop outside.

<b>	ON AARON
</b>
	Happy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet.  He APPLAUDS
	as she comes toward him.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Really?  It was good.

	He nods and APPLAUDS some more.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Your calling in that information --
		you're the classiest guy I know.

	He waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.

<b>				AARON
</b>		It was strange to watch him.  What's
		the next step?  Lip synching?

	She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I've been doing some of the most
		important thinking of my life.  I
		wonder if this is the right time to
		tell you about it.

	She steals a glance at her watch.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, whatever you think.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I figured out exactly why it is I'm so
		hung up on getting a chance at weekend
		anchor...It's because if I do that well,
		they'll pay me more, treat me great and
		my life will be better.  That's why.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Sounds like you may be on to something.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Which means I'm at their mercy and who
		wants that?...I'm not going to tell
		you where this thought led me...
		Anyway, well, why not  tell you? --
		it's a happy thing.  In the middle of
		all this I start to think about something
		that does nothing but make me feel good
		and makes immediate sense and that's you
		...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give
		anything if you were two people so I could
		call up the one who's my friend and tell
		her about the one I'm in I...I don't think
		I should go any further.  Come on --
		I'll walk you to the corner.

	He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You know you've had a strange day...
		I'd sleep on all these things you've
		been thinking.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Absolutely...You go have a good time...
		You have some place to go?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Good.

	He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his
	hands and kisses her full on the lips.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Well, I felt something.

	He leaves her on the corner and walks back.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	As the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE...
	Jane moving quickly, hailing a cab.

<b>	INT. CAB - EVENING
</b>
<b>				JANE
</b>		We're going to Caps Bar at
		Seventeenth and Vermont;
		Connecticut is clear on Sunday...
		take that over to Fifteenth, then
		around Vermont and we'll bypass
		the circle that way...if you don't
		go over forty we should catch mostly
		green lights.

	ON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Come on -- don't take it the
		wrong way.  I just know about
		things.

	He hits the meter.

<b>	EXT. CAPS BAR - EVENING
</b>
	As the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him.

<b>				DRIVER
</b>		Great route.  I never made
		anywhere near that fast before.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Thanks -- good driving --

<b>				DRIVER
</b>		Thanks.  Coming from you I
		appreciate it.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Thanks.

	As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit.
	As they confront each other:

<b>				TOM
</b>		I didn't think you'd make it.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, I thought I'd check if all
		of you were still here.  I'll just
		go in and join the gang and you
		two go on.

<b>				TOM
</b>		There's no gang in there -- We
		were the last ones.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, I'll go in and have a bite.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to Jennifer)
		Jennifer, you want to have another
		drink?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Hey, I know how to have a burger by
		myself.  I feel like a little solitude.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			(as they move off)
		I sure know that feeling.  Terrific
		work today.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(too jock-like)
		Right back to you.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Thanks for getting me through.

	He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
	camaraderie.  She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps
	inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between
	the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.

<b>	ON TOM AND JENNIFER
</b>
	As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection
	over Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a
	look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

<b>	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT
</b>
	As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding
	clothes even as they enter.

<b>	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT
</b>
	We are aware of MOVING FORMS.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>			(intense shout)
		Damn all you sons-of-bitches.  Oh
		shit, you bastards...

	They finish.  A beat, then:

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Sorry.

<b>	ON TOM AND JENNIFER
</b>
	Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made
	love to.

<b>				TOM
</b>		No, it's okay...People say different
		things.  They do...the plural threw
		me.

	She laughs.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		The last time I was with someone we
		went through this awful mutual disease
		questionnaire but I guess it beats
		getting paranoid the next day.  Okay,
		I'll go first.  I haven't...

<b>				TOM
</b>			(stopping her)
		It would never occur to me to worry
		at all about you.

	Jennifer is touched...

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		You know something?  I'm deeply
		complimented.   Isn't it strange to
		be deeply complimented because the
		man you're with doesn't think you
		have a venereal disease?...

	Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
	one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty
	sort of motion punctuated by her comment:

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Give me some of that.

	He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid
	grin on his face.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Where's the bathroom?

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Through the closet.

	He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

<b>	INT. CLOSET - NIGHT
</b>
	It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
	shoes extraordinarily well organized.  Tom stands there agape.
	Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
	luggage.

	She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
	her.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		I converted a bedroom -- this
		stuff builds up.  Wait till
		you've been doing this sixteen
		years.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'm not knocking it.  It's a
		great solution.  Not only the
		storage but you can see everything
		you have.

	Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
	silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.

<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Do you do bunny rabbits?

	Tom is enjoying himself immensely.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Isn't this a great date?

	We HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we:

<b>	INT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING
</b>
	Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
	and SCRATCHING her arm.  She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
	STATESMEN move across the small screen.  She sighs and, without
	realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet
	to recognize in herself.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to herself)
		God help me.

	People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Jesus, Jane.  How long have you
		been here?

<b>				JANE
</b>		A long time.  I was restless.
		Will you crack my neck?

	He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings.  she lets it
	ring for a beat as Aaron works on her.  As she picks up the
	receiver we HEAR a CRACK.  She reacts to it at the same time
	she utters a greeting.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Aaah --
			(into phone)
		-- ello.  You sure they said the
		management meeting?
			(hangs up; then
			 to Aaron)
		They want me to be at the
		management meeting.

<b>				AARON
</b>		They're not that dumb, after all.

	He pats her on the back.

<b>	INT. WALKWAY - DAY
</b>
<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Do you know you're the second woman
		in network news history to produce?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(though distracted)
		No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
		Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks
		got that credit once on a U.N.
		special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

<b>	INT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY
</b>
	Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk.
	TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance.  As Paul
	discusses the more pressing problems of the network news
	division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
	her first moment at the seat of power.  She has the blues.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		Anyway, they seem to be very serious
		about making me out eight million from
		the budget and that means massive firings.
		I'm doing everything I can... It's too
		early to make up a 'death list' but I
		just wanted you to be aware of the
		situation... We're also going to cover
		the Alaskan serial killer trial on a
		continuing basis.  I'd like it done out
		of Washington which means we've got to
		get somebody on a plane for Anchorage.
		We can't fool around anymore...Jane...

	She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		This is going to be high-profile on
		the Evening News -- who do you think?
		George Weln or Jennifer?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(much, much too quickly)
		Jennifer.

	The men look at her curiously.  She repeats herself more
	rationally.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Jennifer.

<b>	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
	He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane
	appears in his doorway.  For the first time, we notice that
	she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
		There's a big thing over at the
		Italian embassy.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'm not sure I'd be good
		company tonight.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(self-conscious joke)
		I'll be the judge of that.

<b>	INT. ITALIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT
</b>
	As they walk in -- one MAN looks at Tom with a glint of
	recognition.  Then another -- a handshake -- A WOMAN introduces
	herself.  A small knot of people form.

<b>				JANE
</b>		It's much too soon for you to have
		this kind of buzz around you.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Do I have to stand here in the middle
		and meet them all?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I'll get you through.  Move and smile.
			(she pushes him
			 a little)
		And smile and move...

	They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
	But an EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN stops him.

<b>				EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN
</b>		Is it safe for me to fly home?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes.  We're fine now.

<b>				JANE
</b><b>		AND SMILE.
</b>
	He smiles -- people smile back.

<b>				JANE
</b><b>		AND MOVE.
</b>
<b>	ANGLE ON STAIR LANDING
</b>
	Where Aaron (Pimm's Cut in hand -- a cucumber sticking out)
	stands with Martin Klein.  Martin is eating from a huge platter
	of appetizers.

<b>				MARTIN KLEIN
</b>		The Italians serve the second best
		things right after the Chinese...I
		could do an article comparing Embassy
		food...Gourmet free-loading...sell it
		anyplace.  I'm sure not getting the
		assignments.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Who the heck could that be?

<b>	AARON'S P.O.V.
</b>
	From the excited group of people blocking his view,
	it's clear there is some personage in attendance.

<b>	ON AARON
</b>
	And now he sees that it's Tom.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Is God testing me or something?

<b>				MARTIN KLEIN
</b>		Paul loves him.  I heard him give
		him the most poetic compliment in
		his command.  'He's hot.'  Sometimes
		groups of executives get together just
		to say that work back and forth...'He's
		hot, oh, she's hot.  Oh, he's really
		hot.'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...
			(looking at Aaron)
		And here we are.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Martin, you're not allowed to use the
		word 'we' or I'm moving.

<b>				MARTIN KLEIN
</b>			(sudden thought)
		Maybe Jane would like my food idea as
		a spot...Try the one in the middle.

	He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is
	stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man
		who won three Overseas Press Awards
		pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

	A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:

<b>				TOM
</b>		You want to go out there --
			(indicating balcony)
		get out of this for a second?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Why don't you lead?  I'll just
		follow the flurry you cause.

	Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.

<b>				TOM
</b>		What did I do to you?

<b>				AARON
</b>		You've made my dreams silly.

	Tom decides not to deal with the remark.  He's jolted by the
	hostility.  He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
	terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men
	stare at the party.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(gesturing at the
  			 party)
		Heavy hitters.

	Aaron nods.

	They look inside.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(several beats; then)
		How <u>you</u> doing?

<b>				TOM
</b>			(warming)
		Great.  Network news, Washington...
		I love it.  What do you do when your
		real life exceeds your dreams?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Keep it to yourself.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You know the other day I really wanted
		your reaction to how we did with the
		Libyan report -- I was going to ask but
		I guess I feel a little intimidated with
		you.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Oh, stop it.

	On Tom's reaction.

<b>				AARON
</b>		You can't talk about feeling
		intimidated when you're on top of
		the world.  It's unseemly.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'm not buying into any of that.  I
		have a load to learn.  I'm not going
		to act as if...

<b>				AARON
</b>			(finishing for him)
		You have the job you have...

	The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too
	fast for him.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Shut up a second...

<b>				AARON
</b>			(amiably)
		Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't
		it, pal?

<b>				TOM
</b>			(picking his words)
		I made one rule for myself when this
		started and I realized I was going
		to take a lot from you people because
		of being from sports...

<b>				AARON
</b>		And the rule was...

<b>				TOM
</b>		Never to pretend to know more than
		I did.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Can you name all the members of the
		Cabinet?

<b>				TOM
</b>			(flustered)
		Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean
		I'd take a test for you -- I mean if
		that came up in conversation I'd...

<b>				AARON
</b>		We're conversing...Oh my, the names
		of the entire Cabinet has slipped my
		mind.  What are they?

	Tom is getting pissed.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(compromising)
		Don't name them.  Just tell me if
		you know.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of
		the Cabinet.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Okay.

	A beat.

				AARON (cont'd)
		All twelve?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes.

<b>				AARON
</b>		There are only ten.

	Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it
	isn't a little infectious.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You're feeling good, aren't you?

<b>				AARON
</b>			(sincerely)
		I'm starting to... We may do
		the capitols of the states.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(dry)
		Fifty, right?

	Aaron almost smiles.

	Tom enters the party leaving the door open.

<b>	LONG SHOT
</b>
	Aaron in the f.g. -- his BACK TO CAMERA... Beyond him
	Tom being approached... then joining Jane.

<b>	EXT. JANE'S STREET - NIGHT
</b>
	As Tom's car comes to a stop.

<b>	INT. TOM'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				TOM
</b>		I'm so exhausted.  Punchy.  Sick
		tired.  I can't think and I can't move.
		I'm just a dead lump of poured out
		flesh.
			(then)
		Would you like to come up?

	Tom thinks -- then:

<b>				TOM
</b>		Maybe we could just sit here --
		talk a little?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Too many smart people in one room --
		it's not healthy...

	Jane's confused by this.  She looks at him.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'm going to have to do a story
		from beginning to end on my own.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Eventually.  Does it have to be
		right now?

<b>				TOM
</b>			(nodding)
		Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this
		unless it was absolutely necessary.
		I have an idea for something.

<b>				JANE
</b>		What?

<b>				TOM
</b>		I just read about it in a magazine
		and it affected me.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, what is it?

<b>				TOM
</b>		If I tell you, can you manage not
		to put it down or tell me why it
		won't work or is in bad journalistic
		taste or anything like that?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(broadly)
		Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

	He turns towards her -- about to stick his chin out.  Hesitates.

				JANE (cont'd)
		I promise.

<b>				TOM
</b>		It's about women who are attacked
		by someone they know on a date...
		'Date-rape,' that's the piece...
		Well?

	Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Okay -- good move.  Keep it there.

	She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car,
	opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out.
	She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth.  Laughing from 
	behind her door and runs for it.

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	His spirits lifted.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.

<b>	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	The phone rings... Jane's hand bounces off her nightstand to
	turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio
	instead.  Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...
	Finally the light comes on.  Jane's voice is so thick with
	sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Hello.

<b>				TO
</b>			(uncertain)
		Hello?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Hello...Who is it?

<b>	INTERCUT:
</b>
<b>	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				TOM
</b>		I'm not sure I dialed right --
		Jane?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you?
		Is this Tom?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I had to sleep fast so I took two
		allergy pills to help me...I'm
		sorry...Hey, you called me.

<b>				TOM
</b>		It's not important.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha.
		I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't
		tell -- how embarrassing for me.
		Gosh.

<b>				TOM
</b>		What pills did you take?  You
		sound more like someone on a general
		anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak
		to you tomorrow.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Nooo.  Is it your story?

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  Are you going to the
		Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Why, you need me for the story?

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  Were you going to you?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Uh-huh.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like
		to go.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Oh, good.

<b>				TOM
</b>		We can go together.


<b>				JANE
</b>		So you like me, huh?

<b>				TOM
</b>		I like you as much as I can like
		anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

<b>	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Tom editing a piece with Bobby -- He also has a little typewriter
	table set up.  He is reading from the page in the typewriter as
	he looks at the piece he has written.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(reading)
		But cops on the street continue to
		view it as...
		Shit -- too long.  But street cops
		say...that fits.  That last cut work
		for you, Bobbie?

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		Yes, and thanks for asking.

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	As the regulars watch the Evening News, in particular the Date
	Rape piece which is now in progress.  Tom anxiously eyeing Jane
	out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor.  Her
	face impossible to read as she studies the screen.

<b>	ON MONITOR
</b>
<b>				UNIFORMED COP
</b>		What can you do?  If a woman invites
		a man in and he says they uh, had
		sex and she says he raped her and
		then you find out they've been out
		together two, three times...how can
		you prove a crime?

<b>	NEW SHOT ON MONITOR
</b>
	Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she
	looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
	of "Glass Menagerie."

<b>				YOUNG WOMAN
</b>		It will be a year next month since it
		happened...I never thought I'd talk
		about it outside of counseling...

<b>	ON NEWSROOM
</b>
	As Aaron enters the scene.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Hi.

	He is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes
	up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them.

<b>	ON MONITOR
</b>
<b>				YOUNG WOMAN
</b>		We'd gone out twice and I hadn't
		enjoyed myself that much but it gets
		to a point -- I don't know if you can
		appreciate this but where you don't
		want to sit home or be with your
		girlfriends and people had always been
		telling me that I was 'too picky.'
		I'm not.  It's just you want to meet
		a nice guy...So anyways, it was that
		'give-him-a-chance' thing.  No, it
		wasn't.  I was lonely.  So we went
		to a movie and when he brought me home
		he said could he just come up and have
		one beer and then he'd go.  How do you
		say 'no', to that?  So first it was
		this wrestling match which was awful
		enough because it got to be really
		a fight...because I'm a modest person...
		then he ripped my clothes and he 
		forced me to...make love.  He stayed in
		my apartment and forced me more times
		-- he didn't leave until...
			(she has started to cry)
		I promised myself I wouldn't cry...
		It's just hard not to --
			(ruefully)
		You sure have a sympathetic face.
			(she cries a bit more)
		...I was so sure I wouldn't do this --
		but the whole thing messed me up --
		maybe more than it should...

<b>	ON MONITOR
</b>
	As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear
	from his eyes.

<b>	ON NEWSROOM
</b>
	These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted.  Aaron
	is aghast.  Aaron approaches the set.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Can I turn on the news for a second?
		...Oh, wait a minute.  Sex -- Tears --
		This must be the news.

	Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the
	monitor.

<b>	ON MONITOR
</b>
<b>				PUBLIC OFFICIAL
</b>		I don't think you can overestimate it --
		on any given Saturday night tens of
		thousands of women are being attacked
		and there isn't much they or we can do
		about it...

<b>				TOM
</b>			(on monitor)
		The victims often remain too terrified
		to talk -- the police powerless and all
		the social welfare groups can finally do
		is monitor this epidemic of crime without
		punishment.  This is Tom Grunick in
		Annandale, Virginia.

	As his piece concludes.

<b>	NEWSROOM
</b>
	Tom continues to glare at Aaron.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.

<b>				TOM
</b>		What's wrong with it?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Nothing.  I think you really blew
		the lid off nookie.

	Blair moans with displeasure.  Aaron exits scene.  Others start
	to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the:

<b>	MONITOR
</b>
	We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps
	of people watching them work.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	Probing her own ambivalence -- or, to be more accurate, working
	towards a positive stance.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to Tom)
		Nice work...
			(checks watch)
		I've got to get a crew off the clock.

	She starts off -- Tom stopping her.

<b>	ON TOM AND JANE
</b>
	Now off a bit by themselves.

<b>				TOM
</b>		So what did you think?

<b>				JANE
</b>		It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I
		really did.  It was unusual for you to
		cut to yourself when you tear up -- and
		that might not have been my choice...but
		it's real and it got me...and I think a
		lot of the time I'm too conservative about
		that kind of stuff.  Okay?

<b>				TOM
</b>			(enormously pleased)
		Yeah.

	He walks back towards the area of the monitor.

<b>	ON MONITOR
</b>
<b>				JENNIFER
</b>		Tomorrow the jury returns to this
		site as each day brings more revelations
		of horror, four more bodies now taken
		from the frozen earth...This is Jennifer
		Mack in Wota Hamlet, Alaska.

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER (SPRING) - DAY
</b>
<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Ernie's been looking for you.

	As Aaron walks to his office.

<b>	INT. AARON'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	As he enters and finds Ernie bent over his desk.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Oh, I was just writing you a note.
		What do you say we take a walk?

<b>				AARON
</b>			(puzzled)
		Outside?

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Yeah --

<b>	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY
</b>
	Ernie is silent... He's having difficulty.  Aaron is feeling knots
	form.  Finally Ernie breaks his silence.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		I don't know if we have any
		younger man more respected in our
		operation than you.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Just tell me what's really going
		on.  I think we know each other
		well enough for me to expect that.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>			(agitated)
		We know each other well enough
		for me to care how I put something
		to you which could wipe you out.
		So I will phrase things the way I
		think they should be phrased.  All
		right?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Wipe me out?

	Ernie sits on a bench.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...

<b>				AARON
</b>		Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really
		appreciate bluntness.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Upper management thinks you're dull.

	Aaron deflates.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Aaron, I've never seen them like
		this -- I think Paul's nervous
		about his own job and for some
		reason he thinks you only appeal to...

<b>				AARON
</b>		Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm
		beginning to appreciate it.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		I'm no suggesting the worst will
		happen...but someone with your
		brilliance gets nibbles about other
		jobs and maybe, the next time that
		happens, down the road -- you should
		look into it.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(emotional)
		Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My,
		God.  They want to fire me.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		All I know is that they've got to
		fire a large number of people...
		and they're not going by seniority.
		There's a recklessness in the air.  
		They...

<b>				AARON
</b>			(interrupting)
		Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot
		at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've
		never seen me do it.  I think it could
		turn them around.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		I could do it this Saturday -- everyone
		wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.

	Aaron turns -- his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Do it then.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Please prepare carefully.  This
		couldn't come at a better time.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Prepare what?  You have Saturday's
		news handy?

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		It's been a while since you read
		the news -- I'll have somebody work
		with you.  Just on superficial
		performance things.

	Several beats.

				ERNIE (cont'd)
		Please.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Okay.  I think I'd better be alone
		for a while.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		I understand.  I'll go with you.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Thanks.

<b>	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT
</b>
	Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in
	his hand.  An unmanned camera is pointing at him.  Tom
	is standing a few feet further back studying him.

<b>				AARON
</b>		This is uncomfortable for me --
		because, well, I don't mean it as
		a knock, but we approach this
		differently.

<b>				TOM
</b>		We sure do.  I don't mean it as a
		knock either.
			(he smiles)
		Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think
		and you can disregard it if you want.

<b>				AARON
</b>		It just might not work for me because
		of our different approaches.

	Tom nods and gestures that he proceed.  Aaron begins reading
	the news.  Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Wait.

<b>				AARON
</b>		What?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Your coat jacket is rising up in 
		back.

	Aaron ignores the tip.

<b>				TOM
</b>		When you sit down -- sit on your
		jacket a little -- that gives you
		a good line.  Look at yourself in
		the monitor.

	Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news.
	Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves
	behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(very uncomfortable)
		I don't like being handled.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Just don't physically...
			(he sees himself in the
			 monitor and is suddenly
 			 enthusiastic)
		Fantastic tip -- fantastic.

	He starts to read again.

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  That's not going to tell us
		anything.  Let's get this prompter
		going.

<b>				AARON
</b>		It's not loaded.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'll find some copy.  Be right back.

	Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the
	genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy Tom derives from 
	helping out.  Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in 
	tow.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I got copy, I got Ellen to heat up
		the camera and I got Master Control
		taping so you can study it later.

	He puts the roll of copy in the prompter.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Hey, Tom...

	Tom turns.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'm very appreciative.

<b>	SAME SCENE - LATER
</b>
	Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from
	various angles.  He interrupts.  Aaron reading from the prompter.

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  No.

<b>				AARON
</b>		No?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Don't let your eyes go from the
		beginning of the sentence to the end
		like that.  You don't want to look
		shifty, do you?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Oh, God, no!

<b>				TOM
</b>		And the left side of your face is the
		good one.  Go again.  And try to punch
		one word or phrase in every sentence --
		punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come
		on --

	Aaron does same with the story he is reading...

<b>				TOM
</b>		Good...very nice.

	Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode.  Punching the
	first words.

<b>				AARON
</b>		<u>Thank you</u> for the compliment, Tom.

	He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the
	next story.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Try not to move your head or wrinkle
		your forehead...this is good, very
		good...

<b>	EXT. NEWS BUREAU - NIGHT
</b>
	Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom.  He is facing
	his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You were smokin' toward the end there.

<b>				AARON
</b>		The pointers were great.  I'll study
		the tape.

	Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker
	room pep talk:

<b>				TOM
</b>		And remember -- you're not just reading
		the news or narrating.  Everybody has to
		sell a little.  You're selling them this
		idea of you.  You know, what you're sort
		of saying is, 'trust me.  I'm, uh,
		credible.'  So whenever you catch yourself
		just reading...stop and start selling a
		little.  So long.

	He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly
	uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted.

<b>	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	Jane FLIES INTO FRAME, carrying her dress, two large shoulder
	pads clipped to her bra-straps.  She is obviously running a little
	late.  Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that
	it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal
	gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.  The DOORBELL
	RINGS... She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace...
	Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful
	of neckties.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I spilled some rum on the outfit you
		picked out.  Let me show you the
		alternates.

	She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(into phone)
		Tom...why don't I meet you there?
		I've got some last minute stuff I've
		got to take care of...Hey, how did
		you resolve your dilemma -- did you
		rent the tux or buy it...I knew it.
		How much?  Wow...Okay...See you
		there...

<b>				AARON
</b>		I didn't know you were going with him.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Did you bring your grey suit?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yes...I was thinking that way too...
		Which tie?

	She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that
	she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking
	over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie
	collection.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(the clasp in place)
		Thanks.  Try this one.

	She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag --
	puts it on and ties the tie... She reaches into a white paper bag
	full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a
	built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into
	the mist.  ON Aaron's reaction:

<b>				JANE
</b>		I read about it -- that's how you can
		make sure you don't put on too much
		perfume...

<b>				AARON
</b>		Could you at least pretend that this
		is an awkward situation for you --
		me showing up while you're getting
		ready for a date.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(flaring)
		It's not a date.  It's co-workers going
		to a professional conclave.

	Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box
	of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.

<b>	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT
</b>
	Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight
	of a taxi stand.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(on phone)
		How long will it tale you to send
		one?...

	She hangs up... paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You look terrific.

	Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core:

<b>				AARON
</b>		Really?

	Jane nods.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Because this is important -- so don't
		just be polite.  I'd really like to
		look...what's the word I'm looking for?...

<b>				JANE
</b>		As good as humanly possible.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yes.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, the line of the jacket -- No
		really....just very nice...just right.
		I wish I could be there.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little
		before 11:00, drop by the studio.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...

<b>				AARON
</b>		<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll
		wait for you at my apartment.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Okay, great -- good luck.

	Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You too.

	Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'd hug you, but why risk mussing
		either of us?

	She half-laughs... kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark
	from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her
	shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving
	his look while diminishing her own.  She gets in the cab.

<b>	AARON'S P.O.V.
</b>
	Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed
	instructions to the DRIVER as the cab pulls away... As Aaron
	turns and walks off.

<b>	INT. CAB - NIGHT
</b>
	Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date.

<b>	EXT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
	A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's
	men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where
	they can finally assert their own glamour.  Jane ENTERS THE SCENE.

<b>	INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - ATRIUM - NIGHT
</b>
	As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse,
	the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes.
	A bit of DIALOGUE OVERHEAD from TWO MEN in dinner jackets.

<b>				MAN ONE
</b>		The L.A. times is a great outfit.  Best
		severance pay in the business.

	Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another MAN, talking to
	his SHARP-LOOKING DATE.

<b>				MAN THREE
</b>		He was lecturing me and finally
		I just said -- I'm sorry, I refuse
		to look at it as a negative that
		I'm young and my news appeals to
		people my age.

<b>				WOMAN
</b>		And it's not like he just didn't
		hire a twenty-six-year-old producer
		himself.

<b>				MAN
</b>		No kidding, twenty-six.

	Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several
	people nervously.  More bits of DIALOGUE, leaking from
	conversations of both substance and expedience.

<b>				ANONYMOUS OLDER MAN
</b>		Remember Brinkley's great line
		-- "It's as irrevocable as a
		haircut."

	Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd.

<b>	JANE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	The floor below.  Tom in the world's best-fitting tux... Clusters
	of people from around him but he works his way easily through them
	as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed,
	women's pulses throb.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile
	and move."  Which is exactly what he's doing.  Then a contract
	with the gods.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to herself)
		If he doesn't see me soon, we're not
		supposed to be together.

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	Seeing her.  -- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the
	meaning of which is not lost on Jane.  He is acting like her
	boyfriend.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a
	joyous pretty young woman.

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(excitedly)
		It's incredible who's here.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Who?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Me!

	She laughs.  Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes
	his arm instead.

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing.  He
	takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over
	to the weekend news PRODUCER. (W.N.P.)

<b>				AARON
</b>		Want to look at this?

<b>				W.N.P.
</b>		Sure.

	George Weln appears...

<b>				GEORGE
</b>			(to Aaron)
		What are you doing here?

<b>				AARON
</b>			(feigning casualness)
		The weekend news...anchoring...
		anchoring the weekend news.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Way to go.

	Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy.

<b>				W.N.P.
</b>		This is terrific news, Aaron.  It's
		a pleasure to read.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Thanks.  Oh, there's water on the set,
		isn't there, in case I get an attack
		of cotton mouth.

<b>				W.N.P.
</b>		Sure.  You'll be fine.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(feeling patronized
  			 and repelling)
		I'll be fine!  Yes!!  I know!!!

<b>	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Bomb sniffing dogs, SECRET SERVICE MEN and D.C. POLICE monitoring
	the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass
	through the metal detector.  The line moves slowly -- Jane and
	Tom several couples back.

<b>				OFF-CAMERA VOICE
</b>			(o.s.)
		Can I have your autograph for my wife?

	Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul.

<b>				TOM
</b>		How you doing, Paul?

<b>				PAUL
</b>		So this is why you wouldn't do the
		Weekend New, you can't turn down
		a free meal.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes, born to party.

	Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within
	herself.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		I'll see you two inside -- I think
		we're all at the same table.
			(sotto to Jane)
		You're finally learning to be flexible.
		Glad you changed your mind about Tom.

	He passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it --
	she pulls him back.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I'm sorry.  I don't want to go in
		there and sit with everybody.
			(imagining it)
		I can't...why don't you go?

	He considers this option as she waits.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Suppose I go in for a little while and
		you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Good.  That's it...See you.

	She walks off.  He runs a few steps to stop her.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Jane.

	She turns.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You're not going to take off on
		me, are you?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Uh-uh.

	She steps on the escalator... Riding upwards, concern deepens,
	anxiety flows.

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing
	simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.

<b>	FULL SHOT
</b>
	Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him.  He moves
	past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I just want you to know that my
		giving up the Correspondents' Dinner
		puts tremendous pressure on you.

	Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
	threatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
	the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
	hand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

<b>	INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT
</b>
	WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around
	the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands
	ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter
	machine.

<b>				FLOOR MANAGER
</b>		Twenty seconds.

<b>	ON AARON
</b>
	Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
	at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN.  She starts
	off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
	footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
	on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of
	them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.

<b>				FLOOR MANAGER
</b>		Ten seconds.

<b>				AARON
</b>		How many?

<b>				FLOOR MANAGER
</b>		Ten.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Okay.

	He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens,
	resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has
	been denying him for years.  We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE
	in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Manager's earphones...
	"...with Aaron Altman."

<b>				AARON
</b>			(on TV)
		Good Evening...In mood and language
		better suited to an espionage novel
		than the delicate world of the Western
		Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary
		today pounced on what he termed, 'The
		nest of profession spies and amateur
		traitors who were turning NATO
		Headquarters into an instrument whose
		only true function is folly.'  We begin
		our coverage with Edward Towne in London.

	Aaron looks up -- takes a breath.  He's done well -- he's
	punched his words and his one thought for the story.  His gaze
	has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire.
	He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --
	brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... He
	beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs --
	then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms...

<b>				MAKEUP WOMAN
</b>		Gee whiz.

<b>				FLOOR MANAGER
</b>		Five seconds.

	She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her
	box and missing it... A graphic illustrating his next scripted
	section appears behind him.

<b>				AARON
</b>		...the sub-bases referred to are
		located in five countries...

	And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the
	Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter
	as they look at a large monitor.

<b>				AARON
</b>		France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
		Spain as...

	And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he
	pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat... The Makeup
	Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself...
	Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.

<b>				AARON
</b>		We well as Great Britain...Our own
		State Department was rocked not only
		by the revelation but from the highly
		unusual persistence from the State 
		Press Corps.  Martin Klein reports on 
		the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.

	Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now
	showing distinct sweat stains...

<b>				AARON
</b>		Help me.

	The Makeup Woman picks up her Kleenex box -- then thinks
	better of it...

<b>				MAKEUP WOMAN
</b>		Someone finds me some big towels.

<b>	ON AARON
</b>
	He blots his face -- some makeup streaked -- by the towel.

<b>				FLOOR MANAGER
</b>		Five seconds.

<b>	ON MAKEUP WOMAN
</b>
	As she scurries away, this time entering the control room
	trotting up one stair to look at the monitor... the Director
	talking to his Camera Operators.

<b>				DIRECTOR
</b>		I'd go looser but we wouldn't
		see the graphic.

<b>				TECHNICIAN
</b>			(to other Technician)
		No -- this is <u>more</u> than Nixon ever
		sweated.

	The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.

<b>				MAKEUP WOMAN
</b>		Can't you just die for him?

<b>	ON MONITOR
</b>
	Aaron's makeup-streaked face.

<b>	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT
</b>
	Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist.
	They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up
	and then sits next to her.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You okay?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Great.

<b>	FULL SHOT
</b>
	REVEALING that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete
	abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful
	night in our capitol.  He is still holding her hand -- and
	now he notes this.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(loudly to himself)
		Why can't I let go of this woman?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well...

	He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and
	swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid-
	air.  And then he does something he's thought about many times
	before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing
	to look at her.

<b>				JANE
</b>		At least kiss me when you do
		that.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(a grin)
		You just can't stop editing me.
		Huh?

<b>				JANE
</b>		This is hysterical.

	She laughs a little -- then kisses him.  They break --
	surprised and aroused and look at each other...

<b>				JANE
</b>		I was half hoping I wouldn't
		have a good time tonight.  You
		know why?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Because you're nuts.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Right, right -- Isn't she fun to
		tease?

	He leans forward and speaks softly and truly.

<b>				TOM
</b>		More and more lately when I've
		watched you in action -- seen all
		your energy -- I've been
		wondering what it would be like
		to be inside all that energy.

	She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat
	on her own cheek.  Then turns to him.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Right back at you.

	Several beats.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I don't remember saying anything
		like that -- exactly...I don't
		know why I just did.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(immediately at work)
		Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well,
		I can think of two reasons.

<b>				TOM
</b>		What?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Three...I just thought of a third...
		If you talk about it, you don't have
		to do it.

<b>				TOM
</b>		That's not it.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Good...Another is you're trying to
		make it all about sex and heat and
		nothing else.

	She looks at him -- he's thinking.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Or it's that great feeling that you
		don't want to hold anything back.
		You know, intimacy.

	She elbows him.  Tom takes in the choices -- then:

<b>				JANE
</b>			(suddenly)
		Oh, shit.  I'm a creep.

	She moves off the concrete wall.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I forgot all about Aaron.  I
		promised to stop by and see
		how he did.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'd like to know.  I'll go along.

<b>				JANE
</b>		No.  I'll see you at your apartment
		as soon as I can.

	She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when
	out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any
	of his actions has been tinged with fury.

<b>				TOM
</b><b>		JANE!
</b>
	Thrown, she stops and turns.  He walks to her.

<b>				JANE
</b>		What happened?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Don't run off --  like everything's
		settled the minute you make up your
		mind.

<b>				JANE
</b>		He might be weird -- he can talk more
		freely if I go alone -- why's that so
		hard to understand?

<b>				TOM
</b>		It's not that it's hard.  I just want you
		to give me a minute to catch up.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Okay.
			(she hugs him)
		Sorry.
			(another beat)
		Don't yell at me like that again,
		you scared the life out of me.

<b>	EXT. AARON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
	As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.

<b>	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
	It is at the top of a flight of steps.  She KNOCKS on the DOOR.
	RINGS.  KNOCKS.  Aaron opens it.  He is wearing a sweatshirt
	and cords.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I was in the shower.

	She enters.

<b>	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
<b>				JANE
</b>		How'd it go?

<b>				AARON
</b>		You didn't see it or speak to
		anybody?

<b>				JANE
</b>		No.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Then it went well.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Did it really go well?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Define your terms.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Do you feel good about it?

<b>				AARON
</b>		No.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Do others feel that you did well?

<b>				AARON
</b>		No.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Then what was good about it?

<b>				AARON
</b>		I lost six pounds...

<b>				JANE
</b>		Aaron, will you tell me?

<b>				AARON
</b>		It was great...writing my little
		first rate copy, sitting on my
		jacket, punching my one thought.
		But I had this historic attack of
		flop sweat so they'll never let
		me another again.  Oh, I lost one
		of your shoulder pads -- how was
		your evening anyway?

<b>				JANE
</b>		What do you mean, flop sweat? --
		you're making too much out of
		it...I'll bet you were the only
		one aware of it...

<b>				AARON
</b>		People phoned in.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Stop kidding.  I want to know
		what happened.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'm not kidding.

<b>				JANE
</b>		There were complaining phone calls
		because you were sweating?

<b>				AARON
</b>		No, nice ones worried that I was
		having a heart attack.

<b>				JANE
</b>		If all that happened, how come you're
		so chipper?

<b>				AARON
</b>		I don't know.  At a certain point
		it was so off the chart bad --
		it got funny.  My central nervous
		system was telling me something.
		Jane -- sweat running down my face --
		makeup falling into my eyes -- people
		turning this fusillade of blow dryers
		on me -- all so I could read
		introductions to other people who
		were covering stories which is
		what I like to do anyway.  And I'm
		chipper because you finally showed
		up.  I thought I'd cook for us.
		Tequila and eggs sound good?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I have to be somewhere.

	He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I told what's his name -- Tom --
		that I'd meet him.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Call him -- I mean it can wait, 
		right?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(now the plunge)
		I don't know.  I may be in love
		with him.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(as if he just burned
			 his hand)
		No!!!!!

	She starts for the door.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Don't go.

<b>				JANE
</b>		This is important to me.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yeah.  Well...I think it is
		important for you too.  Sit down.

	She sits.  He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... Silence.

<b>				JANE
</b>		What?

<b>				AARON
</b>			(looking at her)
		Let me think a second.  It's
		tough.

	A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock...
	it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching
	into himself.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Aaach...Jane...
			(glancing at note)
		Let's take the part that has
		nothing to do with me.  Let's let
		me be your most trusted friend,
		the one that gets to say awful
		things to you.  You know?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(testy and wary
			 but fair)
		Yes, I guess.  Yes.

<b>				AARON
</b>		You can't end up with Tom because
		it goes totally against everything
		you're about.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yeah -- being a basket case.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I know you care about him.  I've
		never seen you like this about
		anyone, so please don't take it
		wrong when I tell you that I believe
		that Tom, while a very nice guy, is
		the Devil.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(quickly)
		This isn't friendship.

<b>				AARON
</b>		What do you think the Devil is going
		to look like if he's around?  Nobody
		is going to be taken in if he has a
		long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm
		semi-serious here.  He will look
		attractive and he will be nice and
		helpful and he will get a job where
		he influences a great God-fearing
		nation and he will never do an evil
		thing...he will just bit by little bit
		lower standards where they are important.
		Just coax along flash over substance...
		Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about
		all of us really being salesmen.
			(seeing he's not
			 reaching her)
		And he'll get all the great women.

	She is getting pissed.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I think you're the Devil.

<b>				AARON
</b>		No.  You know that I'm not.

<b>				JANE
</b>		How?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Because we have the kind of
		relationship where if I were the
		Devil, you'd be the only one I
		told.

	She's briefly impressed.  He has a point.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You were quick enough to get
		Tom's help when...

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And
		if it had gone well for me tonight,
		maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all
		this...I grant you everything but
		give me this...he does personify
		everything you've been fighting
		against...And I'm in love with you.
			(realizing)
		How do you like that? -- I buried
		the lead.

	He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his
	nose.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(an aside)
		I've got to not say that aloud;
		it takes too much out of me.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(thawing)
		Sit down, stop.

	Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I've never fought for anyone before.
		Does anybody win one of these things?

<b>	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	A CAR DOOR SLAMS in the street below -- he goes towards the
	window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and
	looks out.

<b>	TOM'S P.O.V.
</b>
	A woman walking from a car.

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	Momentarily thinking it's Jane.  Elated.

<b>	TOM'S P.O.V.
</b>
	It is not Jane.  The PHONE RINGS.

<b>	INTERCUT:
</b>
<b>	BACK TO SCENE
</b>
	As he answers and we have the following conversation between
	Jane, who is using the phone, with Aaron seen just a few feet
	away.  Tom in his apartment.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Hi.  It's me.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Where are you?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I can't get away just yet.  I'm 
		at Aaron's.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Well, when?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I'm not sure.  It seems like he
		had sort of a mishap on the news.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I know.  I taped it.

<b>				JANE
</b>		It wasn't as bad as he think, was
		it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or
		anything?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Not if you count 'Singing in the
		Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't
		treat it like a tragedy.  You want
		me to talk to him?

	Her eyes meet Aaron's.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Uh-uh.
			(to Aaron)
		He says you could hardly notice it.

	Aaron beckons for the phone.  Jane hands it to him, as she does
	so:

<b>				JANE
</b>		Don't say anything about anything.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Hi.  Will I ever sing again?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Everybody has one like that.  I
		thought it was great when you
		started to laugh at the end.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying
		up Jane, I didn't realize you two
		would be going this late.  Sorry.

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  Don't worry about it.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'll put her on.

	She takes the phone.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Hi, again.  Sorry about...

<b>				TOM
</b>		No.  That sounds more important.
		Let's forget about tonight.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I don't know if that's absolutely
		necessary.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I've got my father coming through
		tomorrow anyway.  I should get
		some sleep.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(hampered by Aaron's
			 presence)
		Uh-huh.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

	Several beats of silence.  Finally:

<b>				TOM
</b>			(finally)
		Hello?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Okay.  Good night.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(aghast)
		Good night??!

<b>				TOM
</b>		Jane, I'm not some chore you have
		to finish so you can stay on schedule.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots
		now -- huh?  Good night.

 	She puts the phone down.  A beat -- she looks stricken.  Aaron
	looks at her.

<b>				JANE
</b>		He just cancelled.  He had a
		chance to think and he
		cancelled.

	She bows her head.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I can't breathe.
			(aghast)
		Over a guy?!?
			(then)
		But I can't -- I can't breathe.
		Damn it!

	She gulps a breath.  Her hands on her knees, leaning over --
	another deep breath.  Aaron takes in the specter.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Well, Jane, it was nice of you
		to drop by.

<b>	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.

<b>	ON PHONE...
</b>
	Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen
	one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc.
	Jane plays her answering tape.  It is silent -- no messages...
	She fast forwards to double-check.  Just the SOUND of blank
	tape.  She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick."  We
	HEAR a busy signal.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	She hangs up the phone.  Then compulsively hits the "Tom"
	button again.  Busy.  And again.  Busy.  She considers for
	a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(stopping herself)
		Be fair.

	She presses the button next to Tom's name.  Busy.  And again.
	Busy.

<b>	EXT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING
</b>
	As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the
	door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door.

<b>				WIFE
</b>		Ernie, they're calling from work.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Tell me I'm on the way in.

<b>				WIFE
</b>		It's Paul.

	Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the
	four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry.

<b>	INT. ERNIE'S HOUSE
</b>
	A phone in the immaculate living room.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>			(into phone)
		Hello.  Yes...

	He holds the phone down at his side for a beat, composing
	himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Would there be any point to my going	
		to New York and talking to them?  Would
		there be any point in going over it with
		you?  No, I'm still coming in.

	He hangs up.

<b>				WIFE
</b>		What?

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		They fired me.

	She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.

<b>				WIFE
</b>			(weeping)
		How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll
		be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll
		go for a drive, have some drinks, make
		happy plans.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		No.  They're firing even more people
		than they said.  Some will want to
		talk.  It could help.

<b>				WIFE
</b>			(timidly)
		I could use somebody to talk to on
		a day like this.
			(on his reaction)
		Sorry. Go ahead.

	He kisses her sad face.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		Bye, sweetie.

<b>				WIFE
</b>		Okay, sweetie.

	He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the
	tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start.

<b>	HIS P.O.V.
</b>
	In the mirror he SEES his wife making faces at him behind his
	back.  He EXITS his home without comment.

<b>	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon.  She
	rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office --
	the door is open, the room is empty.  Blair ENTERS carrying
	an armload of tapes.  She looks extraordinary.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		I've got four hours of French
		demonstrations --

	Jane waves it off.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Some of it they use water cannons.

	Jane takes the tape.

<b>				JANE
</b>		What are you dressed up for?  Oh,
		that's right -- because the Evening
		News is here this week.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		I spent a fortune on this.

	Blair EXITS... Jane pops the tape in, automatically making
	timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's
	door.

<b>	JANE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	The door now closed.

<b>	JANE
</b>
	She stops the tape -- summons herself.  She walks towards Tom's

	office and opens the door.  Tom is seated behind his desk.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(without passion)
		I kept trying to call you -- you
		never called me.  Were you just
		diddling me?  Is that it--?  I'm
		great if I'm helping your career.
			(mimicking)
		But when I'm a woman for a second, I
		get immediately fucked around by
		you.

	She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's
	answer.

<b>	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
<b>				TOM
</b>		Jane, this is my Dad.

	And, now OPENING the door a bit more -- Tom's father is REVEALED
	seated across from him.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(that quickly)
		Please forgive what I said.
			(to Tom)
		Sorry.

	As she retreats:

<b>				TOM
</b>		You just light up a room and leave,
		huh?

	She laughs nervously as she exits.

<b>	TOM AND HIS DAD
</b>
<b>				DAD
</b>		You want my opinion?

<b>				TOM
</b>		The thing that's easy to miss about
		Jane is...

<b>				DAD
</b>		You want my opinion?  And it's okay
		if you don't.

	Tom thinks a beat.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes, I would.

<b>				DAD
</b>		The way she just acted is not the
		way an affectionate person acts.

	Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought
	provoking.

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
</b>
	Paul arriving with Bill Rorish.  The first time we have seen
	the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh.  He has the grace
	and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on
	grace and dignity,

	He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation --
	muted and ominous.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Just when do you start, telling people?

<b>				PAUL
</b>		Almost immediately.

<b>				BILL
</b>		I'd like to take everyone out after
		the show.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		Bill...This is hard on all of us
		and it's no time for compliments.
		But I think it's extraordinary of
		you to come down here for this.

<b>				BILL
</b>		If we're not here for each other
		during the tough time, we're not a
		news organization.

	Blair ENTERS scene.  The smallest flicker of interest from Bill,
	but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the
	outfit.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Welcome back to Washington.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Thanks.

	A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone.

<b>				BILL
</b>		I've forgotten.  Was she on the list?

	Paul nods "yes."

<b>				BILL
</b>		This is a brutal layoff...And all
		because they couldn't program Wednesdays.

<b>				PAUL
</b>			(can't resist)
		You can make it a little less brutal
		by knocking a million dollars or so off
		your salary.

	AS Bill turns:

<b>				PAUL
</b>		Just a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  Awful.
		It's a miserable day and that was
		some kind of totally sick-joke
		defense mechanism which does not
		indicate any of my feelings -- not
		one -- but just shows the kind of
		stress this represents for all of us.

	Tom and his Father ENTER the scene from Tom's office.  Bill
	walks to Tom.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Hi.  It's about time.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Good to see you, Bill.

	AS they shake:

<b>	INSERT
</b>
	A great handshake.

<b>	ON MR. GRUNICK'S FACE
</b>
	touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist
	greet his son.

<b>				TOM
</b>		This is my father.

<b>				BILL
</b>		Good to meet you, sir.

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent
	journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.

<b>				MR. GRUNICK
</b>		Good-bye, Tom.

	He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat.  Then
	whispers in his ear.

<b>				MR. GRUNICK
</b>		I'm going to go back home and tell
		all your old teachers.

	Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's
	editing room.

<b>	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	AS Tom enters...

<b>				JANE
</b>		I feel terrible about what happened.
		What did he say?

<b>				TOM
</b>		He -- uh -- said he liked you because
		you looked like you had -- fire and
		honesty.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(enormously pleased)
		No.  Did he really?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes.  Then he said a really weird
		thing...

<b>				JANE
</b>			(so softly)
		What?

<b>				TOM
</b>			(he means this)
		That it would be a treat to make
		someone like you feel better...
		He gets like that sometimes.

<b>				JANE
</b>		That's so perfectly...It really
		makes me feel a little faint...
			(actually woozy)
		Whooo.

	Blair enters wildly into the scene.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		They canned me.  Well, my brother
		will feel great -- now he's not the
		only screw-up.

<b>				JANE
</b>		It's started.

	Bobbie sticks his head out of his office...

<b>				BOBBIE
</b>		Tom -- Paul wants to see you.

	AS Tom focuses and moves off:

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM AND HALLWAYS - DAY
</b>
	Moving with Tom.  Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he
	proceeds down the hallway.

<b>	INT. ERNIE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
</b>
<b>				SECRETARY
</b>		He'll just be a minute.

	Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place... A beat and the door
	opens.  Paul leads out Martin Klein.  They shake hands.

<b>				MARTIN KLEIN
</b>		You know I'm just old enough to be
		flattered by the term, 'early retirement.'

<b>				PAUL
</b>		That's wonderful...what a lovely line.
		If there's anything I can do.

	They shake.

<b>				MARTIN KLEIN
</b>			(evenly)
		I certainly hope you die soon.

	A little smile to Tom and he's off.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		Tom.

	Tom enters the room.  A nervous cough in evidence as he
	crosses to a seat.

<b>				PAUL
</b>		We're having a severe cutback, Tom --
		17 people in this bureau including
		technical personnel and we're going
		to reorganize at the same time.
		We're going to take you out of Washington
		for a while and assign you to London.

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
	Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People
	are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace --
	from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:

<b>				ANONYMOUS VOICE
</b>		No.  I won't keep my voice down.
		Those sons-of-bitches...They are
		worse than accountants -- they
		are bad accountants.

	Tom enters scene.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Have you guys seen Jane?

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		She's in there becoming the first
		woman bureau chief we've had here.

	Tom takes this in.

<b>				AARON
</b>		What did they do with you?

<b>				TOM
</b>		They booted me out of Washington.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Impossible.  There's no system that
		wouldn't value one of us.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Why?  What did they do to you?

<b>				ERNIE
</b>			(pointing at Aaron)
		It's what he did.  I'm proud of

<b>				AARON
</b>		They told me they'd keep me because
		they could plug me into any story
		and my salary was in line.

<b>				ERNIE
</b>		The cost-efficient reporter.

<b>				AARON
</b>		So I quit.

	A weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away.
	Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of
	the same sword.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You packing up tonight?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're
		sending you down for a while, but
		you'll make it back...Where they
		sending you?

<b>				TOM
</b>		London.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(incensed)
		London.  That's a promotion!

<b>				TOM
</b>			(defensively)
		I don't think so.

<b>				AARON
</b>		It is.  Yes -- that's where they
		had Rorish, for God's sake, before
		they made him anchor.  I can't stand
		it -- they're grooming you for it
		all and you don't even know it.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Hold it down, okay?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Can I ask you something?  You only
		had one crew on the date rape piece,
		right?

	He extends his hand.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes.  You're not going to stick
		around for the farewell party?

<b>				AARON
</b>		No.  I don't know how much fun it
		will be when Martin Klein and Ernie
		have to drop off their credentials
		with the security guard.

	Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a
	few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.

<b>				AARON
</b>		This story they won't cover.  And if
		the network doesn't cover it -- it
		must not be important so why worry.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(eyeing him)
		I'm going to miss you -- you're a
		prick in a great way...

	Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.

<b>				TOM
</b>		You know what I...

<b>				AARON
</b>		No, I liked the way it made me sound.
		Okay.  Be good.  So long.

	He exits.

<b>	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
	AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings.
	A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel
	mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting.  His desk clear --
	he writes on a clean piece of copy paper.  He centers it on his
	desk.

<b>	INSERT - PAPER
</b>
	"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."

<b>	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
</b>
	AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.  Tom
	moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full
	of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.

<b>	TOM'S P.O.V.
</b>
	Jane across the room hugging one person after another.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	AS she embraces an older secretary.

<b>				OLDER SECRETARY
</b>		You know what I always wanted to
		tell you -- that...

<b>				JANE
</b>		Shhh.  This isn't the last time
		we'll see each other.  It's not.

	A two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein.

<b>				JANE
</b>		We'll get them back -- it's going
		to change.

	Blair is at hand as they embrace.

<b>				BLAIR
</b>		Except for socially, you're my role
		model.

	And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London."
	She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a
	little.  He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can
	rendezvous.

<b>	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	AS Tom enters and waits for Jane.  When she enters he closes
	the door.

<b>				JANE
</b>		These people -- it's all so awful.
		It just hurts physically, doesn't
		it?  Like something's wrong with
		your bones, like your organs are
		shifting inside your body.

	She looks at him expectantly.  It's not what he's feeling.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Maybe I haven't been here long
		enough.
			(great)
		But, hey, congratulations on the
		promotion.

<b>				JANE
</b>		How can you say that to me?

<b>				TOM
</b>		Sorry.
			(a beat)
		I can't stand here feeing bad that
		I don't feel worse.  This has happened
		at every station I ever worked for.
		Look, I think it's crazy for you to
		come in here tomorrow and start a
		new job.  I have a week to get to
		my job.  Let's get the hell away to some
		island fast and find out how we are
		together away from this.

	A beat -- Jane takes it in.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, I just think that' an extraordinary 
		proposal.

<b>				TOM
</b>		That's yes?

<b>				JANE
</b>		That's more than 'yes' -- that's
		'you bet.'

	They kiss.

<b>	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
	The phone rings.  He answers.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Hello.

<b>	INT. JANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
	Jane -- still at the office -- it is quite late.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Bastard, sneak, quitter.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Speaking.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I just found out.  You didn't say
		anything to me?  You just resign?
		Will you meet me now? -- No, now!
		I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.

<b>	INT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
	Across the street from the bureau's building.  Aaron and Jane
	are having a beer.  They are in mid-conversation.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Why not try it for a few weeks?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too --
		he couldn't help.  My agent has a
		hot prospect -- the number two station
		in Portland.  The general manager says
		he wants to be every bit as good as the
		networks.  Personally, I think he should
		aim higher.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Tell me the God's honest truth --
		are you leaving because of me?
		Because if you are...

<b>				AARON
</b>		Ernie told this story.  How he used
		to write obits and when the people
		in town called him up with death
		notices, he cried.  He was till
		that way when they promoted him
		out of obits.  He says you're lucky
		if you can get out while you could
		still cry.
			(a beat)
		I should have quit this place  three
		years ago.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You're just trying to say all great
		stuff so I'll feel even worse that
		you're not around.

	He laughs.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Let's go...

<b>				JANE
</b>		I just want to sit here longer, I mean
		the feeling is powerful -- why's that?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Maybe the best part of your life is over
		and you don't want to get up and start
		the bad part.

	Jane looks at him levelly.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You are now required to sit here with
		me.
			(a beat; then)
		Come on...be smart for a second --
		what do you think will happen to us?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six
		years from now I'll be in town to
		collect an award representing the surge
		in foreign coverage by local stations.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(smile, it's like 
			 old times)
		Yes.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'll be walking with my wife and two
		children -- we'll bump into you on
		the street, my youngest son will say
		something and I'll tell him...
			(deliberately)
		...it's not nice to make fun of single,
		fat ladies.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You won't be able to stay mad at me,
		right?

<b>				AARON
</b>		I hope so...
			(on her look he relents)
		No.  I'm not really mad.
			(nodding head as if
			 reciting a catechism)
		I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always
		be friends...we'll get hot for each other
		every few years at dinner and never act
		on it, okay?

	Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises,
	walks away, then turns.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Jane, you know how Tom had tears in
		the piece the other night?  Ask
		yourself how we were able to see
		them when he only had one camera
		and that was pointing at the girl
		during the interview.
			(on her reaction)
		I'm fairly sure I was right to tell 
		you.

<b>	EXT. OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
	We LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW as Jane enters -- in a frenzy --
	searching the stacks.

<b>	INT. TAPE LIBRARY - NIGHT
</b>
	As she locates the cassette labelled "DATE-RAPE - 9/26 -
<b>	EVENING NEWS - OUTTAKES."
</b>
<b>	INT. TAPE CUBBY - NIGHT
</b>
	As she inserts the tape into the player.

<b>	ANGLE ON JANE... AND MONITOR
</b>
	As she watches... this is what she sees...

<b>				YOUNG WOMAN
</b>		...but the whole thing messed me
		up more than it should.

	She cries.  We HEAR Tom.

<b>				TOM'S VOICE
</b>		Okay, that will do it.  You okay?

	The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman
	continue to roll as they move towards their next shot --
	at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but
	the sound continues.  The crew chatting -- mentioning
	that the tape is still rolling.

<b>				TOM
</b>		That's enough.  That's enough.

<b>				YOUNG WOMAN
</b>		I'm sorry.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Are you okay?

<b>				YOUNG WOMAN
</b>		Yes, I'm sorry.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Don't be silly.  What are you sorry 
		about?

<b>				YOUNG WOMAN
</b>		The way you were looking at me, I just went.

	Tom moves through the SHOT.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I just need you for another minute now,
		so we can shoot from behind towards me,
		and, um...

<b>				YOUNG WOMAN
</b>		Uh-huh.

<b>				TOM
</b>		...that way we have someplace to go when 
		we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my 
		head and look nerdy.

	Young Woman chuckles.

	Jane chuckles.

<b>				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
</b>		Tom

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
</b>		It kills me we didn't have a second camera.  
		It was so powerful seeing your reaction.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Really?

<b>				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>		Yes, it is.

<b>				SOUND WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>		For a second there, I thought you were 
		gonna cry yourself.  That would have 
		been something.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(considering, then)
		Then give me a minute...

<b>				JANE
</b>			(fully realizing)
		You fucking...

	As Jane watches we SEE Tom work up the tears we saw in the
	Evening News piece -- as he does so:

<b>				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>		Oh, that's amazing.

	ON Jane's shocked reaction:

<b>	EXT. BWI AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
	Jane's cab pulls up to the curb.  She gets out -- she is
	carrying no luggage.  She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up
	to her.  Jane is fighting to maintain a calm.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Look who's the organized one.
		I've got everything.

	He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows
	her he has bought them each a bathing suit.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I'm not going.

	He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Why?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I saw the taped outtakes of the
		interview with the girl.  I know
		you 'acted' your reaction after
		the interview.

	Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench.  Jane close 
	behind, stalking him.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's
		verboten, huh?  I thought since I did
		it for real the first time -- but I get
		you.  That's not the reason you're not
		coming?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(raising her voice)
		Of course it's the reason.  It's
		terrible what you did.

<b>				TOM
</b>		We disagree on how God-awful it
		was.  Why don't you come with me
		and we can disagree and get a tan
		at the same time?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(livid)
		Jesus, if you're glib about this
		I'm going to lose it.  I was up
		all night and...

<b>				TOM
</b>			(calmly)
		Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

<b>				JANE
</b>		It made me ill.  You could get
		fired for things like that.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I got promoted for things like that.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Working up tears for a new piece
		cutaway...You totally crossed the
		line between...

<b>				TOM
</b>		It's hard not to cross it; they keep
		moving the little sucker, don't they?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(distaste)
		It just proves that the difference we 
		have are...

<b>				TOM
</b>		This is a one-way argument.  We've got
		six days; if you go and we fight and
		we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you
		don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger
		deal.  I go to London right after that.
		So, it'd be very big deal if you stay
		here.  The plane's boarding.  You're
		good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(taking ticket)
		It's amazing.  You commit this
		incredible breach of ethics and
		you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try
		and get this.  When you edited that...

<b>				TOM
</b>			(deliberately)
		I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.

	He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane
	stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack
	of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.

<b>	INT. TERMINAL - DAY
</b>
	On Tom moving past the metal detector.  He too is frustrated
	-- pissed off at her.

<b>	INT. OTHER TERMINAL AREA
</b>
	Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.

<b>	INT. METAL DETECTOR
</b>
	As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer.  She stands
	there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to
	stem the tears.  As others look on, she takes a huge key ring
	from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through
	without a buzzer and moves on.

<b>	INT. BOARDING RAMP - DAY
</b>
	Tom waiting while in the b.g.  "People Eater" busses ferry
	passengers to the plane.

	As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.

<b>				TICKET AGENT
</b>			(to Tom)
		This is the last one.

	Others start to board.  He sees Jane moving towards him.
	He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.

<b>				JANE
</b>		That's not going to be the way
		we say good-bye.  Even though I
		think what you did was rotten --
		it's not all impersonal.  You mean
		something to me.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(interrupting)
		You keep coming after me and
		looking down on me.  It's starting
		to make me batty.

	She looks at him.

				TOM (cont'd)
		I can't help it that they like me.
		And I like that they like me.  And
		I think there's a lot of this job that
		I do well.  What do you think it takes
		to do this job -- the way they have
		it now?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I don't wan to discuss work.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Well, let's do a special report on
		that...I mean that's news.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I knew what you meant.

<b>				TOM
</b>		What I don't know, I can learn and
		what I know, nobody can teach.
		Excuse me for saying it about myself,
		but I think it's true.
			(old habit)
		What do you think?
			(catching himself)
		Never mind what you think.

	They look at each other.

<b>				JANE
</b>		You're lucky I came after you so
		you got that off your...

<b>				TOM
</b>		Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.

<b>				JANE
</b>		It's okay.

<b>				TICKET AGENT
</b>		Sir?

	The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve.

<b>				JANE
</b>		So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?

<b>				TOM
</b>			(wary but hopeful)
		You want to come?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(totally open)
		It's just that one of the few things
		I'm not confused about is what I
		was saying downstairs, that...

<b>				TOM
</b>			(giving up -- sadly,
			 finally)
		Then you should stay here.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(softly)
		It's better when you let me say it.

	He hugs her.  Now that it's over, they can each openly care
	for each other.  While in the embrace:

<b>				TOM
</b>		Take it easy.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Why did I have to do this to
		myself?  Watch you take off.
			(then)
		Call me if you need anything.

	He kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:

<b>				TOM
</b>		Oh, honey.

	He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his
	paper bags of bathing suits.  The bus pulls away.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	Watching him go.

<b>	JANE'S P.O.V.
</b>
	Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very
	much as he is when on television.

<b>	INT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY
</b>
	Jane gets quickly into cab.

<b>				CABBIE
</b>		Good morning.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Good morning.
			(after collecting herself)
		Dupont Circle, please.

	The cab pulls away.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Don't take the beltway, because at this
		time of day there's gonna be a lot...
			(stops herself, then)
		...Go any way you want.

	She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and 
	quietly adding what she knows to be true:

<b>				JANE
</b>		But New York Avenue's faster.

<b>							FADE OUT:
</b>
<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
<b>	EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY
</b>
	Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The
	words "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.

	A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the
	Local Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M.  Tom Grunick
	will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism
	for the '90s."

<b>	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
	Much the same audience, though two members of the audience
	may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
	from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old.
	Tom is in mid-speech.

<b>				TOM
</b>		... when they told me Bill had decided
		to retire and offered me the Evening
		News, I thought it was the same kind
		of joke we used to pull back at the
		station -- turning off somebody's
		prompter in the middle of a show.

	Some good-natured laughter.

				TOM (cont'd)
		And then when they heard my reaction --
		they thought I was kidding.  I told them
		I'd be their anchor but I didn't want
		to be the Managing Editor -- that there
		were people better qualified than I to 
		control the content and if there 
		weren't we were all in trouble.

	The audience really enjoys this:

<b>	SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER
</b>
<b>	MOVING SHOT...
</b>
	The anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
	a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
	the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
	not unlike yourself.

<b>				TOM
</b>		And now to something more
		important... I'd like to introduce
		my bride.
			(gestures to a woman in
			 the front row)
		Lila?

	A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.

<b>	ON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...
</b>
	Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.

<b>	INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
	Tom and Lila shaking hand.  Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.

<b>	ON TOM
</b>
	As he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Holy shit, Aaron.

	He claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is
	uncomfortable with the attention.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Lila -- this is Aaron Altman.

<b>				LILA
</b>			(high British accent)
		Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's
		50 or so role models.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Hi.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Well, this kid couldn't possibly
		belong to anyone else.  What's
		your name?

<b>				BOY
</b>		Clifford...

<b>				AARON
</b>			(indicating Tom)
		Do you know who this is, Cliff?

<b>				BOY
</b>		The big joke?

	Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.

<b>				AARON
</b>		I'm just bringing him over to give
		Jane a look at him --

<b>				TOM
</b>		I thought she'd be here.  I'll
		go with you.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Okay.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to Lila)
		I'll see you back at the hotel.

<b>				LILA
</b>			(cool)
		All right.

	He starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.

<b>				LILA
</b>		Tom, the speech was magnificent.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Oh, I didn't say anything about
		your speech.

<b>				TOM
</b>		I appreciate it.

<b>	INT. WALKWAY - DAY
</b>
	Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff
	as they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a
	blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she
	has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.

	She HEARS her name being called.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As 
	they reach her.

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to herself)
		Well, why not?
			(as they arrive)
		Hey, what is this?  My life's
		rushing in front of my eyes.

<b>				TOM
</b>		A picnic?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I thought for ol' Cliff here --
		Look at you?  You're more adorable
		than your pictures.  Look what I
		got for you.

	She hands him a toy.

<b>				AARON
</b>		What do you say, Cliff?

	The boy kisses Jane's hand.

<b>				AARON
</b>		He excels at gratitude.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to Jane)
		Are you any closer to a decision?

<b>				JANE
</b>		I think so...They've been talking
		to me about being Tom's Managing
		Editor.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Really?

<b>				JANE
</b>			(to Tom)
		I'm going to take it.

<b>				TOM
</b>		What a great surprise.  I didn't
		think we had a chance.  I heard
		you wanted to stay in Washington.

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll
		fly up a lot.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Well, we should talk.  You going to
		have time for  dinner?  I'd like
		you to meet Lila.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I'm sorry because I was looking
		forward to that, but I' m going
		back in a few hours.

<b>				TOM
</b>		Okay...It's so good to see you.

	She gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to Aaron)
		It's nice to see you.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Congratulations on history's longest
		winning streak.

<b>				TOM
</b>		If you ever get restless in Portland,
		let me know.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Why?

	Tom shuffles uncomfortably.

<b>	ON JANE
</b>
	Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the
	powerful.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to Jane as he leaves)
		Bye...boss.

	Tom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up
	to see his son running after Tom.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(calling)
		Hey!  Cliff!  Cliff!

	Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.

<b>				TOM
</b>			(to Clifford)
		Go back to your daddy.

	The boy starts back.

<b>				AARON
</b>		Come on, Cliff.  Come on.

	As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.

<b>				AARON
</b>			(to Jane)
		So who's the guy?

<b>				JANE
</b>		Well, we met about three months ago.
		He works at the surgeon general office.
		He loves boating.  So, he's been 
		getting me into water skiing.

	Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure.
	Jane deliberately moves past this moment.

<b>				JANE
</b>		I like it!  So, doll, what about you
		lately?

<b>				AARON
</b>		Well -- my wife got this new job...

	He continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up,
	their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and
	the scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...

<b>							FADE OUT.
