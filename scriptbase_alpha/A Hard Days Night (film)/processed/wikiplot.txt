Halliwell encapsulates the plot as "harassed by their manager and Paul's grandpa, the Beatles embark from Liverpool by train for a London TV show.
"[4] Having escaped a horde of fans, once aboard the train and trying to relax, various interruptions begin to test their patience, prompting George to go to the goods van for some peace and quiet.
Paul, Ringo, George and John play are card game and sings to a schoolgirl before arriving at their destination.

On arrival in London, the Beatles are driven to a hotel where they feel trapped.
After a night out during which Paul's grandfather causes minor trouble at a casino, the group is taken to the theatre where their performance is to be filmed.
The preparations are lengthy so Ringo decides to spend some time alone reading a book.
Paul's grandfather, a "villain, a real mixer," convinces him that he should be outside experiencing life instead of reading books, so Ringo goes off by himself.
He tries to have a quiet drink in a pub, walks alongside a canal and at one point rides a bicycle along a railway station platform.
[5] Meanwhile, the rest of the band frantically (and unsuccessfully) attempts to find Ringo.
Finally, however, he returns, after being arrested by the police along with Paul's grandfather, and the concert goes ahead as planned.
