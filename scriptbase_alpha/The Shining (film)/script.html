            It's a 25 mile stretch of road -
            gets an average of 20 feet of snow
            during the winter, and there's just
            no way to make it economically
            feasible to keep it clear.  When
            the place was built in 1907, there
            was very little interest in winter
            sports, and this site was chosen
            for its seclusion and scenic beauty.
