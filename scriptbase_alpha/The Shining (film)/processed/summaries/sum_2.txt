Jack Torrance gets a job as the custodian of the Overlook Hotel, in the mountains of Colorado.
The place is closed down during winter, Torrance and his family will be the only occupants of the hotel for a long while.
When the snow storms block the Torrance family in the hotel, Jack's son Danny, who has some clairvoyance and telepathy powers, discovers that the hotel is haunted and that the spirits are slowly driving Jack crazy.
When Jack meets the ghost of Mr. Grady, the former custodian of the hotel who murdered his wife and his two daughters, things begin to get really nasty.
