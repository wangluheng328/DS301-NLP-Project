When a body is recovered at sea still alive, the mystery man (Damon) seems to have forgotten everything in life, including who he was.
Eventually he begins to remember smaller details in life and soon finds out that his name was Jason Bourne.
What he doesn't like is that a gun and fake passports also belong to him.
Now Bourne, and his new friend, Marie Helena Kreutz (Potente) travel from country to country in search of his new identity.
But, someone else is not happy to see him alive, and is frantically trying to track him down.
