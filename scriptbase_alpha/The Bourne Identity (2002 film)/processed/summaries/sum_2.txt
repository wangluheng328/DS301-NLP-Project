On a stormy night, a young man is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea by the crew of a fishing boat.
Thinking the young man is dead, a curious fisherman with a scalpel finds two bullets in his back and a miniature laser device in his hip.
The laser reveals a Swiss bank account number.
But our wet hero isn't dead, and soon finds himself in Zurich.
In the bank vault the young man discovers his name, Jason Bourne.
In addition, he finds a baffling pile of different passports, all with his picture, and a huge pile of cash.
In the U.S. Embassy, Jason Bourne discovers his love interest and travel partner, Marie, along with the fact that someone wants to kill him.
Armed with a bag of money and mysterious martial arts skills, with Marie by his side, Bourne scours Paris for clues about his identity and past life... and finds himself in the middle of two assassination plots masterminded by the CIA.
