Bean - the movie features Mr Bean in new adventures.
The painting "Whistler's Mother" has been acquired from the Musee d'Orsay in Paris by the Grierson Gallery in California.
As an attempt to get him out of the country, Mr Bean is sent to Los Angeles to unveil the painting and present it to everyone, even though he knows nothing about the painting.
