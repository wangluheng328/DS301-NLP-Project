Mr Bean works as a caretaker in a British gallery.
He is a very bad worker (keep sleeping at work), but his bosses are prevented from firing him because the head of the gallery wants him as his worker.
So his bosses send him to another gallery in Los Angeles, California.
But things in LA goes wrong.
An important painting arrives to his new gallery, and somehow Bean suppose to present it to a selected audience, and to protect it as well.
The thing is that Bean does not know anything about paints, and he is exactly the most unsuited man to protect the paint.
