This is a film about five men who are hauled into the New York police station because a crime was committed and they are the usual suspects.
They all agree to do a job together for a little revenge.
However, little do they know that someone else has the strings and that they are all the puppets--all because each of them crossed the wrong person at the wrong time.
After the big job, 27 people are dead, and there are two survivors.
But the question is...who's the one controlling everything?
