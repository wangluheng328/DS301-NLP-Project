Police investigating an exploded boat on a San Pedro pier discover 27 bodies and $91 million worth of drug money.
The only survivors are a severely burned and very scared Hungarian terrorist and Verbal Kint, a crippled con-man.
Reluctantly, Kint is pressured into explaining exactly what happened on the boat.
His story begins six weeks earlier with five criminals being dragged in by New York police desperate for suspects on a hijacked truck and ends with the possible identification of a criminal mastermind.
