After a waterfront explosion, Verbal, an eye-witness and participant tells the story of events leading up to the conflagration.
The story begins when five men are rounded up for a line-up, and grilled about a truck hijacking (the usual suspects).
Least pleased is Keaton a crooked cop - exposed, indicted, but now desperately trying to go straight.
The cops won't leave him alone, however, and as they wait for their lawyers to post bail, he is talked into doing one more job with the other four.
All goes tolerably well until the influence of the legendary, seemingly omnipotent "Keyser Soze" is felt.
Although set in the modern day, it has much of the texture of the forties, plus suspense, intrigue (a fairly high body count), and lots of twists in the plot.
