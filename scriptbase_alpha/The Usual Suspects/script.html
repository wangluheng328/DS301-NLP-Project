<b>SCRIPT DATE 5/25/94
</b>

<b>1 -BLACK
</b>
     The lonely sound of a buoy bell in the distance. Water
     slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm. The
     creaking of wood.

     Off in the very far distance, one can make out the sound of
     sirens.

     SUDDENLY, a single match ignites and invades the darkness. It
     quivers for a moment. A dimly lit hand brings the rest of the
     pack to the match. A plume of yellow-white flame flares and
     illuminates the battered face of DEAN KEATON, age forty. His
     salty-gray hair is wet and matted. His face drips with water
     or sweat. A large cut runs the length of his face from the
     corner of his eye to his chin. It bleeds freely. An un-lit
     cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth.

     In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of a
     large boat. A yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter. He sits
     with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house.
     His legs are twisted at odd, almost impossible angles. He
     looks down.

     A thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the
     darkness. Keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of
     matches before throwing them into the liquid.

     The liquid IGNITES with a poof.

     The flame runs up the stream, gaining in speed and intensity.
     It begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck
     towards the stern.                                                       

<b>2     EXT. BOAT - NIGHT - STERN                                             2'
</b>
     A stack of oil drums rests on the stern. They are stacked on
     a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge
     crane on the dock. One of the barrels has been punctured at
     it's base. Gasoline trickles freely from the hole.

     The flame is racing now towards the barrels. Keaton smiles
     weakly to himself.

     The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another
     stream of liquid splashes onto the gas. The flame fizzles out
     pitifully with a hiss.

     Two feet straddle the flame. A stream of urine flows onto the
     deck from between them.

<b>                                            BLUE 06/01/94
</b>
<b>                                                               2.
</b>
The sound of a fly zipping. Follow the feet as they move over
to where Keaton rests at the wheel house.

CRANE UP to the waist of the unknown man. He pulls a pack of
cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter
from the other. It is gold, with a clasp that folds down over
the flint. The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and
strikes it with his index finger. It is a fluid motion,

somewhat showy.
Keaton looks up at the man. A look of realization crosses his
face. It is followed by frustration, anger, and finally
resignation.

<b>                         VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           How are you, Keaton?

<b>                             KEATON
</b>           I'd have to say my spine was broken,
           Keyser.

He spits the name out like it was poison.

The man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under
his jacket. He produces a stainless .38 revolver.

<b>                         VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           Ready?

<b>                             KEATON
</b>           What time is it?

The hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on
its wrist upward.
The sound of sirens is closer now. Headed this way.

<b>                         VOICE (O.S.)
</b>           Twelve thirty.

Keaton grimaces bitterly and nods. He turns his head away and
takes another drag.
The hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy  
his last drag before pulling the trigger.

<b>GUNSHOT
</b>
The sound of Keaton's body slumping onto the deck.

<b>                                          YELLOW 06/11/94
</b>

<b>                                                             3.
</b>
MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK. Below is the stream of gasoline
still flowing freely.

The sound of the gasoline igniting. The flame runs in front
of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle
around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking
the spouting stream as it pours from the hole.

MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK, away from the boat.

The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD
BODIES. Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie
scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a
fierce fire-fight.

<b>A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW.                                             
</b>
On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders.          
The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon           
beneath its base.                                                    

<b>MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.
</b>
Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging
out of control.

<b>SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET
</b><b>POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.
</b>
<b>MOVE FURTHER, SLOWER, INTO THE DARKNESS
</b>
Voices yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding
darkness.

<b>SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION.
</b>
Then silence. TOTAL BLACKNESS.

We hear the voice of ROGER "VERBAL" KINT, whom we will soon
meet.

<b>                         VERBAL (V.O.)
</b>           New York. - six weeks ago. A truck loaded
           with stripped gun parts got jacked
           outside of Queens. The driver didn't see
           anybody, but somebody fucked up. He heard
           a voice. Sometimes, that's all you need.

</b>
      The black explodes with the opening of a door into a dark
      room. Outside, the hall is filled with blinding white light.
      Shadows in the shapes of men flood into the room. We can make
      out men in hoods with flashlights. They are laden with
      weapons.

</b>
      It is a blur of violent action and sound.'Beams of
      flashlights cut the darkness in all directions.

<b>      FINALLY:
</b>
      A dozen flashlights land on one man. He lies naked in bed,
      Merging from a deep sleep. He squints at the flood of
      blinding white light, more annoyed than frightened. He nearly
      laughs at the sound of countless guns cocking. He is
      McMANUS. Age twenty-eight.

<b>                               VOICE (O.S.)
</b>                 Mr. McManus?

      Two dozen black gloved hands grab him and yank him out of
      bed.

      Hockney withdraws a filthy towel and wipes grease and sweat
      from his forehead.

<b>S     EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - DAY
</b>
      FRED FENSTER, a tall, thin man in his thirties strolls
      casually down the street. He is dressed conspicuously in a
      loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching.
      He smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time.

      He happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown
      Ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb. He
      picks up his step a little. The Ford keeps up.

      He looks ahead at the corner. He tries to look as comfortable
      as he can, checking his watch as though remembering an
      appointment he is late for. The Ford stays right on him.

      SUDDENLY, he bolts. He gets no more than a few yards before
      cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny. Brakes
      are squealing, radios squawking, guns cocking. Fenster is
      surrounded instantly. He stops short and flaps his hands on
      his thighs in defeat.

The man is DEAN KEATON, a well dressed, sturdy looking man in
his forties with slightly graying hair. He looks much better
than he did in the opening scene. The woman with him is EDIE
FINNERAN, age thirty-three, poised and attractive - Easily
the calmer of the two.

     They come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant
     leading down to a dark room. Edie takes Keaton's arm and
     stops him.

</b>                Let me look at you.

     Keaton is uncomfortable in his suit, or perhaps the
     situation. Still, he smiles with genuine warmth.

     Edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections
     from his lapel.

                You owe it to them. Don't stare them down
                but don't look away either. Confidence.
                They are fools not to trust you. That's
                the attitude.

     Keaton blinks then stammers, looking for a response.

     She kisses him and runs down the steps with Keaton close
     behind. Keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly
     stumbles down the stairs.

     They come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing
     each other. Once off the stairs they instantly transform as
     though hit with cold air. They assume a cool, professional
     exterior and walk two feet apart. One would look at them and
     see only two business associates here to ply their trade.

     They walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the
     far corner where two men are already waiting. The first is
     MR. FORTIER, age thirty-five, the other is MR. RENAULT, age  

     sixty. Both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished
     air. They stand and smile.

     high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly.

     Her face is absolutely calm, giving no hint of what her hand
     is doing. Keaton smiles and clears his throat.

sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder.

      He looks out over the dozens of other faces in the

      surprise. If Keaton is humiliated by the whole affair, he
      hides it well.

      floor. The shoes are shabby and worn, as are the wrinkled
      pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs. The right
      foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp. It
      is clear that the knee does not extend fully.

      The sound of a steel door opening. The bottom corner of a
      steel cage comes into view. Another set of feet falls into
      step with the first. Another steel door and another set of
      feet. Another door, another and another. Five pairs of feet
      walk single file down the hall.

      The lame feet are in the front of the line. They come to
      another steel door, this one solid and covered with dents and
      rivets.

speaks in a complete dead-pan.

           Nobody asked you, workin'-man.

</b>           Fuck who did it. What I want to know is,
           who's the gimp?

ALL EYES suddenly turn on Verbal. He has been quietly
listening the whole time without uttering a word.

<b>                             KEATON
</b>           He's alright.

</b>           His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you
           guys knew him.

           Verbal?

</b>           Roger really. People say I talk too much.

<b>                            HOCKNEY
</b>           Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.

<b>                            KEATON
</b>           We've met once or twice. Last time was
           in...

<b>                            KEATON
</b>           You were waiting for a line-up then, too.
           What happened with that?

<b>                            VERBAL

</b>            To your mother's ass.

 Verbal looks away from Hockney, awaiting a violent response.
 Everyone slowly starts to laugh. Hockney looks as if he is
 about to boil in his own skin.

<b>                              KEATON
</b>                          (To Hockney)
            Let it go.

 Verbal smiles at Keaton appreciatively.

 McManus stands and walks to the toilet in the corner of
 the cell. He starts taking a leak;

                              McMANUS
            Look, we've all been put out by this, I
            figure we owe it to ourselves to salvage
            a little dignity. Now Fenster and I got
            wind of a possible job -

<b>                              KEATON
</b>            Why don't you just calm down'

<b>                             HOCKNEY
</b>            What do you care what he says?

                             McMANUS
           Yeah, I'm just talking here, and Hockney
           seems to want to hear me out. I know
           Fenster is with me -
                           (To Verbal)
           How about you, guy?

McManus finishes pissing.


<b>                            VERBAL
</b>           I'm interested, sure.


                             McMANUS
           There, so you see, I'm going to exercise
           my right to free assembly.

McManus taps the bars of his cell and the others LAUGH.

<b>                              KEATON
</b>           I'm not kidding. Shut your mouth.

                 Dean Keaton, gone the high road. What is
                 the world coming to?

     McManus and Keaton stare at one another for a long and tense
     moment. Finally McManus turns to the others.

                             McMANUS (CONT'D)
                 Forget him then.

                 Now I can't talk about this here in any
                 detail, but listen up...

     Everyone but Keaton gravitates toward McManus's cell as he
     begins to speak in low, hushed tones.

<b>                              VERBAL (V.O.)
</b>                 And that was how it began. The five of us
                 brought in on a trumped-up charge to be
                 leaned on by half-wits. What the cops
                 never figured out, and what I know now,
                 was that these men would never break,
                 never lie down, never bend over for
                 anybody. .. Anybody.

<b>19    EXT. PIER - DAY - SAN PEDRO - PRESENT DAY                          19
</b>     It is morning in the aftermath of the opening scene.
     Harsh sunlight shines on a line of body bags on the dock.

     Police swarm everywhere, photographers are taking pictures of
     the scene while a team of men in rolled up sleeves and
     plastic gloves pick at the remains.

     Two men on a fire boat operate a water cannon, dousing the
     smoldering remains of a burned-out ships hull.

     Watching this from the edge of the pier is a man in a dark
     suit. He is SPECIAL AGENT JACK BAER of the F.B.I. He is tall
     and fit, in his late thirties. He gazes out over the water
     thoughtfully.

<b>                                          YELLOW 06/11/94

</b>A UNIFORM COP trots up to him.
<b>                              COP
</b>           Who are you?


Baer holds up his badge without looking at the man.

<b>                              BAER
</b>           Agent Jack Baer, F.B.I. How many dead?

Before the cop can answer, Baer turns and walks along the
line of body bags.

<b>                              COP
</b>           Fifteen so far. We're still pulling some
           bodies out of the water.

Baer eyes the corpses on the dock, burned beyond recognition.

<b>                              COP
</b>           Looking for anyone in particular?

Baer looks at the cop for the first time, unamused.

<b>                              BAER
</b>           f don't want any of the bodies taken away
           until I've had a chance to go over this,
           understood?

<b>                              COP
</b>           I have to clear the scene. I've got word
           direct from the Chief

Baer lights a cigarette, only half listening.

<b>                              BAER
</b>                         (Unimpressed)
           Yes, the chief. Spooky stuff. Any
           survivors?

<b>                              COP
</b>           Two. There's a guy in county hospital,
           but he's in a coma. The D.A. has the
           other guy - A cripple - from New York I
           think. Listen, the Chief said -

<b>                              BAER
</b>           Excuse me.

Baer walks away from the cop, ignoring him completely. He
wanders through the carnage on the pier.

     A half mile out from the pier.

     The sea is choppy, stirred by the wind. An object floats into
     view a few feet away, bobbing in the water.

     It is A DEAD BODY - a man, face down, wearing a CHECKERED
     BATHROBE. He drifts quietly toward the open ocean.

     Verbal Kint sits in a chair in front of a microphone attached
     to a tape recorder, his brow beaded with sweat.

     On the wall behind him is the seal of the STATE OF CALIFORNIA

     He is cleaner, better kept, in a well-cut suit and neatly
     trimmed hair. He looks older than he did in New York - worn
     down.

     A flurry of voices banter off screen. Verbal's eyes follow
     the voices back and forth.

     Rabin's office can only be described as a disaster area. The        
     desk is cluttered with weeks, perhaps months or even years of       
     paperwork that could never conceivably be sorted out.               

     Above his desk is a bulletin board. It is a breathtaking
     catastrophe of papers, wanted posters, rap-sheets, memos and +
     post-its. This is in the neighborhood of decades. Rabin is a
     man with a system so cryptic, so far beyond the comprehension       
     of others, he himself is most likely baffled by it.

Baer is suddenly distracted by something Kovash has said. In
the middle of a long string of unintelligible dialect, he has
spouted two words that have gotten Baer's attention.

He turns and looks down at the tattered man in the bed.
Kovash realizes Baer is listening and says the two words
again.

           Ruby is well connected. He still has

           dropped his name to the D.A.?

contempt, knowing he is being shafted.

<b>                             KUJAN
</b>           I'11 get right to the point. I'm smarter

Kujan puts his hand on the transcript of Verbal's confession.
Rabin walks in with a cup of coffee. Verbal takes it with his
good hand and sips it with a relish.

     Keaton stops at the top of the front steps of the police

     fuming mad.

     talking by a newsstand. McManus is thumbing through
     magazines.

<b>                                   EDIE

     Keaton looks to his right and sees Hockney trying to hail a
     cab.

           from us. It's finished. I'm finished.

Just then, Verbal bumps into him on his way out the door. He
excuses himself and hobbles down the steps, oblivious to who
he has bumped into as he tries to navigate the stairs.

<b>                              EDIE

<b>                              EDIE

Verbal gets to the sidewalk and stops. He turns, realizing it
is Keaton on the steps.

<b>                         EDIE (CONT'D)
</b>           Let's just go to my place. We'll worry
           about this tomorrow.

Keaton and Verbal look at one another for a moment. Keaton
then looks over to the newsstand and sees Fenster looking at
him.

<b>                            KEATON
</b>           Huh?

McManus notices Fenster and glances up from his magazine to
see what he is looking at.                                             +

      Keaton looks at Hockney who has one foot in a cab. He is
      looking at Fenster and McManus who are looking at Keaton.
      This makes Hockney look up at Keaton as well.

      SUDDENLY, Edie tunes in to what is going on. She notices the
      others on the street. She reaches over and takes Keaton by
      the arm, pulling gently. She glares at the others.

<b>                                   EDIE

                Alright.

      Verbal looks at everyone else from where he stands on the
      street. Fenster, McManus and Hockney all look at him and then
      at each other. It is a strange moment of unspoken
      understanding.

      All eyes finally turn to Keaton, high on the front steps of
      the police station as he walks away with Edie.

      Verbal stands in front of an apartment door. He hesitates for
      a long moment before he knocks.

      After a moment, the door opens and Keaton stands on the other
      side of it. He is wearing a bathrobe and smoking a cigarette.

      He looks at Verbal without any expression whatsoever.

      in.

      furnished and decorated.

Edie shoots a look at Keaton on her way out of the room.
Keaton tries to hush his voice despite his anger.

Verbal.

Verbal drinks slowly. Edie stands over him, her face blank.

uncomfortable.

      brakes and skids to a halt. The white minivan rams them from
      behind.

      Strausz and Rizzi are stunned for a moment as two more vans
      screech up on either side of the cruiser, boxing it in with
      only a few inches between them.

      The cruiser is surrounded on all sides.

      SUDDENLY, SHOTGUN BARRELS come through the open windows. They
      come to rest, one on Strausz's left temple one on Rizzi's
      right. RIZZI looks out of the corner of his eye.

      He sees the driver of the van next to him holding the shotgun
      with one hand. A stocking is over the driver's head.

      Strausz looks straight ahead. The minivan in front of them is
      missing a back window. Another man with a stocking on his
      head aims a sub-machine gun at them from inside.

      By the twisted right hand holding the front of the gun, we

          five years in Sing Sing. He killed three

</b>                McManus' fence was this guy named
                Redfoot. He had a good reputation around
                L.A. Seemed like a good guy - Looked like
                a cowhide full of thumbtacks.

</b>     All five guys stand in a group. It is utterly quiet.
     An old but well kept Cadillac creeps into the lot from the
     far end and idles up to them. The windows are tinted too much
     to see in. The car passes within a few feet of them and
     drives on.

     A moment later, a chrome and leather monster of a Harley
     Davidson pulls into the lot. The rider is dressed in an
     almost comical array of leather, silver and suede.

     He waves to the Caddy as it parks a few yards from Keaton and
     the others. It sits quietly, almost menacing.

     As he gets closer, we can see he is wearing one black boot
     and one red. Keaton is still looking at them when the bike
     pulls up to them and stops.

     REDFOOT and McManus shake hands.

McManus holds up a briefcase.

Redfoot takes it and gets off the bike. He walks over to the
Caddy. The door of the Caddy opens. Redfoot hands the case to
Someone inside that we cannot see. The door closes.

notice.

     McManus walks along a line of cars. He comes across a black

     walks over to the next car, a green Honda. He pulls a slim-
     jim out of his jacket and pops the lock an the Honda. He
     reaches in and opens the hood. He walks around and sticks his
     head in the engine.

     around cautiously. The first is TUCCI, a big bellied, white
     haired menace. The other is HIGHAM, lean and bad skinned.
     They are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful
     move.

     They turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside.

     Out walks SAUL BERG, a slightly overweight man in his forties
     with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his
     hairy chest. He carries a LARGE ALUMINUM BRIEFCASE.

     He lets his guards do the worrying. He walks straight to his
     car.
     Saul passes McManus under the hood of the Honda. He takes out
     his keys and pushes a button on his key chain. The Mercedes
     beeps three times and tells Saul his alarm is off.

     Tucci keeps an eye on McManus. Higham watches Saul.

     McManus pretends to tinker with the car's engine. He has put  
     a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach.

     The van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out
     of the spot. It cruises over toward the Mercedes.

     Tucci sees the van. He and Higham are suddenly busy trying to
     keep track. They hear laughing behind them and turn around.

FENSTER and HOCKNEY are walking towards them. They are
sporting mustaches and sunglasses in addition to matching
suits, each with loud plaid sport coats, decades out of
style. Saul glances at Tucci and Higham.

<b>                            HIGHAM
</b>           Just get in the car Saul.

Under the hood of the Honda and out of sight, McManus pulls
on a black ski mask.

The van gets closer.

<b>                             HOCKNEY
</b>           I get out of the car, and man if the
           thing wasn't wrecked. And I see this
           broad in the back seat with nothing on.

Saul gets in the car quickly but calmly as Fenster and
Hockney laugh and talk louder. They look drunk - The desired
effect.

<b>                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm laughing so hard I can't breathe -

Tucci and Higham try to take it all in stride. Saul's reverse
lights come on and he begins to back out of the spot.

<b>                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
</b>           ...And the fat guy comes out of the car
           with his pants on backwards and says -

SUDDENLY, the van revs and screeches to a halt behind Saul's
Mercedes, blocking him in. Hockney and Fenster drop the drunk
act and snap to. They both pull out guns and start screaming.

<b>                       HOCKNEY (CONT'D)
</b><b>           DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.

</b>
McManus comes up from under the hood.                                  

Tucci and Higham throw their hands in the air. Hockney and
Fenster grab them and reach into their belts to get their
guns .

Keaton jumps out of the van and runs up to Saul's car, his
face covered in a ski mask. He yanks on the door handle but
it is locked. Saul sits in terror behind the wheel. Keaton
pulls out a pistol and smashes the window with it.

</b>
<b>                             KEATON

Saul reaches over for the case. Keaton trains the gun on him.

SUDDENLY, Saul comes up with a pistol and points it at
Keaton. Keaton sidesteps and grabs his wrist. The gun goes
off into the fender of the Honda.

Hockney and Fenster both look over at the sound of the gun.

Tucci and Higham seize the opportunity. Tucci grabs Hockney,
Higham grabs Fenster. The four men grapple for the guns.

Fenster's gun falls to the floor. McManus picks it up. He
trains a pistol on each bodyguard and takes a breath. They
are some ten feet apart and moving erratically. Hockney and
Fenster constantly fall in the line of fire.

McManus walks around the four men, keeping a pistol trained
on each of the guards. Finally he comes to an angle where
they are all in front of him. One guard is a few feet away,
the other is ten feet past him.

McMANUS' P.O.V.

The closer of the two moves in and out of the sights of the
pistol in McManus' right hand, the one farther away does the
same with the left.

Verbal gets out of the van and moves towards them to help.
<b>BOOM
</b>Both of McManus' guns go off like one shot. Tucci and Higham
collapse, each with a bullet in his head


<b>PAUSE
</b>
The only sound is Saul grappling with Keaton for the gun. His
arm is halfway out the window. His elbow rests in the door
frame.

Keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand. Finally, he pushes
down with all his weight. Saul's elbow breaks backwards on
the door frame. He screams in agony. The gun falls from his
hand.

</b>
      All five of the men look at each other for an impossibly long
      moment. The confusion is only aggravated by Saul's screaming.

      SLOWLY, Keaton raises his pistol and aims it at Saul. His
      hand trembles, his eyes squint to near slits. His finger
      tenses and slacks off over and over again on the trigger.

<b>      BOOM
</b>
      VERBAL SHOOTS SAUL. Keaton looks at him in surprise. Verbal
      trembles more than he does.

      The garage is silent.

      Keaton reaches into the car and grabs Saul's case. Everyone

      for the exit.

Fenster and Hockney draw guns and aim at the Caddy.
Keaton and Verbal grab McManus and hold him back.

similar looks.

</b>           In nineteen-eighty one, Mr. Keaton, you
           participated in the hijacking of a truck
           in Buffalo, New York. The cargo was raw
           steel. Steel that belonged to Mr. Soze
           and was destined for Pakistan to be used
           in a Nuclear reactor. A very profitable
           violation of U.N. Regulations. You had no
           way of knowing this, because the man
           shipping the steel was working for Mr.
           Sate without his knowledge.                               +

           Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus hijacked a
           twin-prop cargo flight earlier this year
           out of Newark airport. The plane was
           carrying platinum and gold wiring. Also
           set for Pakistan.

</b>           Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were                   
           not to be released until I came to see
           you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms.

           expediting his release. Holding the rest

           works with the same people for very long,
           and they never know who they're working
           for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no

           That you did not know you stole from him
           is the only reason you are still alive,

           purchase will revitalize the diminishing
           strength of their organization. Mr. Soze
           wants you to stop the deal. If you
           choose, you may wait until the buy.
           Whatever money changes hands is yours.
           The transaction will take place on a boat
           in San Pedro. Mr. Soze wants you to get
           to the boat and destroy the cocaine on

     he is in killing everyone on board.

     killing some men with his bare hands, shooting others,
     stabbing others still with a knife he has brought along.

For the first time, Verbal stands and tries to move away from
Kujan, but Kujan stays in his face, backing him into a
corner. Verbal shields himself with his hands and shuts his

eyes.

Verbal looks into Kujan's eyes with genuine terror. Kujan's
face is red, his body trembles. His locomotive breathing is
the only sound in the room.

     Verbal is hiding in the tangle of girders and cables on the
     barge.

<b>     VERBAL'S P.O.V.
</b>

     Keaton's body is completely obscured.
     The man in a suit strides across the deck over to Keaton,
     stopping to relieve himself on a small fire on the deck.
     He walks up and stands over Keaton. The two men exchange
     words and the man in the suit pulls out a pistol. He points
     it at Keaton.

<b>     RED AND BLUE LIGHTS FLASH BEHIND VERBAL
</b>
     Verbal turns. He can just make out police cars coming in the
     distance.

<b>     BANG
</b>
     Verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat. He turns in
     time to see the man in the suit running across the deck
     toward the gangway.

     Verbal can barely see the man from where he is now. The man
     in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the
     barge. Verbal strains to see but he cannot.

     The man in the suit stops long enough to pull out a lighter.
     He turns and walks back across the deck and out of sight.
     A moment later flames leap up from on the deck.
     The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon at
     its base.

</b>                His own people were selling him to a gang

                Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out
                back in Turkey. The money wasn't there
                for dope. The Hungarians were going to
                buy the one guy that could finger Soze

           he wanted it that way. It was his will.

     Verbal stands, mustering his shattered dignity and walks
     towards the door. Rabin opens it for him from outside.

     For once Kujan cannot bring himself to look at Verbal.
     Verbal turns to the door, stopping to look Rabin in the eye.

     Daniel Metzheiser comes out of Arkosh Kovash's room with a
     single sheet of 15x20 inch paper in his hand. He inspects the

     back to make it smaller.

     Verbal is downstairs in the depot of the police station
     picking up his personal belongings.

     A FAT, WHITE-HAIRED COP is checking off the items as he takes
     them out of the tray in which they are kept.

     Verbal collects his personal items and shuffles on his lame
     leg toward the exit.

     Rabin's coffee cup. Rabin sits at the desk, sifting through
     the mound of gapers as though considering organizing them

     Kujan is not listening. He has been staring at the bulletin
     board, lost in thought, his unfocused eyes drifting across
     the mess of papers, not looking at anything at all.

<b>147  EXT. STREET                                                         147
</b>
     Verbal steps out into the sunlight, putting on a pair of
     cheap sunglasses. He looks up and down the crowded street.
     People on their way to and from lunch, no doubt.

     Cars choke the street in front of the police department as
     they wait for pedestrians to clear the way.

     down.

</b>
     Kujan still stares at the bulletin board.

     SUDDENLY, Kujan's face changes. He leans in closer to the
     bulletin board and squints his eyes. His face changes again.

     First a look of puzzlement, then confusion - finally
     realization.

     The coffee cup tumbles from his hand. It hits the floor with
     the SMASH of cheap porcelain. Coffee splatters everywhere.

     Rabin snaps out of his droning and looks up in surprise.

<b>     KUJAN'S P.O.V.
</b>
     Kujan is staring not at what is on the bulletin board, but at
     the bulletin board itself.

     His eyes follow the aluminum frame, mounted firmly to the
     wall. One might note it's sturdy construction and it's
     convenient size. Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten
     and disregarded notes and facts. Years of police trivia that
     has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a
     use for it all someday. One might want such a bulletin board
     for one's self. One would look to see who makes such a               
     bulletin board.
     Kujan's eyes are locked on a metal plate bearing the
     manufacturer's name.

</b>      It reads: QUARTET - SKOKIE, ILLINOIS
      Kujan's eyes flash all' over the bulletin board. He finds a
      picture of Rabin in the far corner. He stands beside a scale
      in fishing gear. He proudly holds a hand out to his freshly
      caught marlin. His eyes skim quickly over and stop on an
      eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a
      THREE HUNDRED POUND BLACK MAN. Kujan glazes over his name, it
      is irrelevant. His aliases stand out.

      Slavin, BRICKS, Shank, REDFOOT, Thee, Rooster...

      KUJAN'S EYES WIDEN with sudden realization. He runs for the
      door.

      His foot crushes the broken pieces of Rabin's coffee cup. The
      cup that hovered over Verbal's head for two hours.

      Kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words
      printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the
      cheap mug.

      Verbal looks behind him and sees ANOTHER COP standing just          
      inside the doorway, lighting a cigarette. The cop notices
      Verbal and watches him in the way that cops look at people
      they cannot place in the category of idiot citizen, or stupid
      criminal.

      Verbal smiles politely, meekly at the cop and walks down the
      steps into the moving throng.

      Kujan runs up to the desk where Verbal had only moments
      before picked up his belongings. Rabin is right behind him, a
      look of absolute confusion on his face.

     Verbal limps his way carefully across the sidewalk, avoiding
     people as best as he can.

     He looks over his shoulder, getting farther away from the
     police station. He can see Rabin and the cop on the steps,
     looking around with strange, lost expressions on their faces.

     He does not notice the car creeping along the curb beside
     him.

     Verbal's feet emerge from the crowd on the far side. They
     hobble along the curb.

     SUDDENLY, the right foot seems to relax a little, the inward
     angle straightens itself out in a few paces and the limp
     ceases as though the leg has grown another inch.

           showy.

           Verbal lights a cigarette and smiles to himself. He turns and
           sees the car running alongside.

           over, revealing the composite sketch of Keyser SOZE.                  

           Though crude and distorted, one cannot help but notice how
           much it leaks like VERBAL KINT.

           IT IS KOBAYASHI, or the man we have come to know as such. He
           smiles to Verbal. Verbal steps off of the curb, returning the
           smile as he opens the passenger door and gets in.

           The man called Kobayashi gets in the driver's seat and pulls
           away .
           A moment later, Agent David Kujan of U.S. Customs wanders
           into the frame, looking around much in the way a child would
           when lost at the circus. He takes no notice of the car
           pulling out into traffic, blending in with the rest of the
           cars filled with people on their way back to work.
