When his harvest fails, the farmer has to sell Joey to the British cavalry and he is shipped to France where, after a disastrous offensive he is captured by the Germans and changes hands twice more before he is found, caught in the barbed wire in No Man's Land four years later and freed.
He is returned behind British lines where Albert, now a private, has been temporarily blinded by gas, but still recognizes his beloved Joey.
However, as the Armistice is declared Joey is set to be auctioned off.
After all they have been through will Albert and Joey return home together?
