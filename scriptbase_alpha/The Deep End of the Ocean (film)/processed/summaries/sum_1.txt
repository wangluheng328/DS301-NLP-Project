Pat Cappadora's neurotic wife Beth takes their two boys along on a class reunion annex photography mission in Chicago.
She makes 8 year-old Vincent 'watch and keep pinned down' 3 year-old Ben, the acts as the sole victim when Ben goes missing.
She neglects job and household utterly and keeps complaining, even over amazing neighborhood efforts to find Ben, all in vain.
In the process, neglected Vincent, who helped pa raise his youngest sibling in her place, embitters and starts going astray.
Nine years later, Pat moves them to Chicago to set up a new restaurant in Chicago.
By chance, a boy almost next door, Sam Karras, is identified as Ben, kidnapped by his late ma and lovingly raised by her husband George Karras.
Both families are now upset to the core repeatedly.
