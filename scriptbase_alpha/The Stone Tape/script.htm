<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">by Nigel Kneale </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><i>Producer: Innes
Lloyd  <br/>
Director: Peter Sasdy <br/>
Produced on BBC Television, December 25, 1972</i> </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">OUTSIDE TASKERLANDS
HOUSE — DAY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">A SMALL CAR, an
Austin 1300, is being carefully driven down the last of along drive and into the forecourt
of the house. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is much
evidence of the massive rebuilding this ugly la te-Victorian structure has undergone.
There are contractors I huts on the lawn, and a large caravan. There are piles of material
— - sand and reinforcing metal and heavy pipes. Some scaffolding clings to the centre
parts of the building. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The car pulls in
behind large motor vans. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">There are two vans,
both emblazoned with the name “Ryan Electric Products”. one has unloaded, the
other is just finishing. Men are shifting bulky apparatus onto trolleys and moving it
inside the house. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The car driver is
JILL GREELEY, aged about 30. There is a very feminine, strong directness about her, so
that what she is seems far more important than what she does. What she does is computer
programming. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She surveys the
house, oppressed by the sight of it. Her eyes go along the whole ugly length. One end of
it looks still untreated, smothered in ivy. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She is so absorbed
that she hardly notices that the vans are moving. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She looks round. One
of them is backing straight towards her, huge and blind. She blips her horn but it still
comes on. She glances to the side and sees the other van backing towards her from that
direction. She has moved in too close; neither of the unseen drivers has noticed her. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She frantically
starts her engine. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then, as if something
happens to her vision — - the two objects are suddenly no longer motor vans but two
huge, de-focussed shapes like standing stones in motion, slowly blundering and blending,
looming over her. And their engine rumble descends to something deeper, an irregular
grunting. Somehow obscene ... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then it passes. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill finds herself
sitting motionless, her car on the point of being crushed. She frantically throws her
gears into reverse and slams her foot down. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Austin shoots
wildly backwards out of danger, swaying and skidding in the loose gravel. She glances in
the rear mirror — - and sees a mass of builders’ equipment; piles of pipes and
scaffolding! She tugs at the wheel, hits the brakes. The car skids straight on in a spray
of gravel. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill screams. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Austin scrapes
past a pile of reinforcing metal with an ugly grinding — - and thuds into a huge pile
of sand. Jill is flung back in her seat. The engine stalls. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">For a moment she
hardly realises what has happened. She leans forward, head into hands. She shudders. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Fifty yards away the
caravan door opens and ROY COLLINSON looks out. He is a grey-haired man of 45 or so, his
face tight and strained. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Evidently he heard
the scream. But he sees only the two vans slowly turning into the drive. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the Austin, almost
lost to sight behind the builders’ equipment, Jill is still huddled over the wheel,
giving herself time to recover. She numbly watches the vans go ... then a yellow fastback
swinging in past them. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The fastback pulls up
in the forecourt and Collinson turns to greet the new arrival: PETER BROCK, aged 35,
Director of Research for Ryan Electrics. He is a man with a lot of drive, his temperament
all upswing and downbeat. At the moment, he is on a big upswing, arriving to take over his
new establishment. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Hello, Colly. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Peter. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: The big day. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Don’t
expect too much. It’s all a mess. If only we’d had another month — - </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Not a chance.
(They survey the house in silence) It looks good. I mean, it looks as terrible as ever but
— -stronger. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON (with
feeling): Why didn’t they tear it down! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Colly — -
</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: It would
have been better. They had to rip the floors out and the roof and even the window frames
— -there was nothing worth keeping. Just an ugly shell! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Colly, he
found it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Even so. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Himself. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: I can
understand about the park there — - at least it’s big — - but this! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: He liked the
style of it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: My God. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: One look,
that’s all he needed, and his mind was made up. He said it spoke to him. Spoke to
him, so it did. (This last comes in the mock brogue which is staff code for utterances of
the firm’s chairman) I know what it said. “Mr Ryan, for pity’s sake
don’t knock me down!”. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: He —
- he could have built it new! For half the cost! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The stridency in his
voice worries Brock. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: How long have
you been down here? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Three or
four months. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Got somebody
stashed away in the caravan? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Eh? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Why not? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Hardly. I
quite like it. It’s quite — - snug. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Horns blare in
cheerful chorus. Three more cars are approaching down the drive. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Here they
come. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Eddie
Holmes was a great help. He’s got most of your gear in position. I’m glad you
could spare him. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Good man,
Eddie. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">A battered estate car
pulls in, with the other two close behind. Hands wave from windows. Then they are
scrambling out. Most of Brock’s staff are under 30, stamped in general with a kind of
alert ingenuousness. EDDIE HOLMES, at 40, is the oldest, a dull-faced clever man.
HARGRAVES and MAUDSLEY, both 25, one serious and introverted, the other afflicted with an
adolescent sense of humour on top of basic cunning. CLIFF DOW is 30, a slow perfectionist.
</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">There are three or
four others, less noticeable characters. All of them are in high spirits. There has
clearly been a lot of laughter on the way. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Aye, aye,
Peter! Setting a good example. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: The
conscientious boss is always the first in! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He leads the
hammed-up dirty laugh. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: See what
I’ve got — - a bunch of kids. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VOICES: Where is he!
Mascot! Mascot! Mascot! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The rear of the
estate car is flung up. An extraordinary figure bounces out. Its head is covered by a
rubber Martian mask with bug eyes and sprouting wires. Its body is padded and covered with
the green undulating rubber foam that is used under carpets, belted into place. on its
chest hangs a control panel with flashing indicator lamps and a loud beeping noise. A sash
marked “Ryan Electric Products” — - a relic of some trade exhibition —
- is tied round its middle. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Stew! is that
Stewart? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Who else? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The figure bows as
the cheering research staff close in. They sweep it off its feet and swing it aloft. They
run with it beeping and flashing, in a wide circle. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the Austin, Jill
sits watching. Her nerves are steadying. She smiles slightly, moves to get out. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Martian figure
yells as he is swept towards the house and nearly crashes into the door lintel. They tip
him back and run him under it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">INSIDE THE ENTRANCE
HALL </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The figure is borne
triumphantly in and set down with a bump. Then they demolish him. He yelps as the Martian
mask is ripped off to reveal the thin face of STEWART JESSOP, 22, computer operator. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: Help! Take me
to your leader! I come in peace! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES:
You’re coming in pieces, mate! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">They yell like wild
animals. The control panel is battered into silence, the sash sent flying. Hands rip at
the cords and rubber foam. They fight for possession of the padding. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">An elaborately
uniformed “Sergeant” appears from the reception desk, worried about exercising
authority. Brock waves him back. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: They’ve
got to do it. Like dogs peeing on something. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Like what
— - ! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">As Jill comes in,
Stew is flung almost at her feet with the worrying pack on top of him, whooping and
yelling. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL (in genuine,
momentary horror): What are you doing to him! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: We’re
sacrificing a Martian! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: All right,
break it up. That’s enough. That’ll do! (He reaches Jill, puts his arm round
her) Just a bit of clowning. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: Innocent
clowning, sir. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Innocent? You
lot? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: You missed the
fun, Jill. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">DOW: You’re
late. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY:
Bride’s privilege. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock gives him a
hard look. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: We’ve
sacrificed a Martian! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Stew sits up,
grinning and sweating. He wipes his face. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock draws Jill
aside. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (quietly):
You’re shaking. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL (as quietly): I
was — - nearly in an accident. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: How? Where? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Outside here. I
had a sort of — - momentary — - I don’t know — - </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (his face
hardening): Blackout’s the usual word. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: It wasn’t
that. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (sighing): You
should have been with me. I should have been driving you. I’m sorry, I couldn’t
make last night. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Peter, please. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: So you’ll
get accident-prone. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Nothing
happened. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She turns, aware that
the others are watching them now. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The house is as
oppressive inside as out. Changes have only worsened it. The great curving staircase now
embraces a lift shaft. Air-conditioning ducts run everywhere and spare sections of ducting
lie stacked about the place. There are coils of cable and other debris. wires dangle
unconnected from the walls. A low-level reception desk shelters the sergeant. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Welcome to
Taskerlands. It doesn’t look much now but wait till it’s finished — - then
you’ll get the full horror. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Don’t
put them off. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Everybody know
Roy Collinson, house master and bunny mother? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Hold on. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Any problems
about the move — - getting digs in the area, housing wives and harems — - see
Colly. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Why is it
called that? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON:
Taskerlands? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Yes,
what’s it mean? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">DOW: Work! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: It was
built by a man called Tasker and these were his lands. He made a fortune out of iron
railings. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: It’s
not — - ancient? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Sorry to
disappoint. It was built about 1880. Mostly owned by the one family. Requisitioned during
World War Two — - the American forces had it. Derelict ever since. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Some laughter. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Right.
Let’s butter their paws. Come on — - (Leading the way briskly) Lift, soon to
operate, I hope. My office is up there. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Very palatial.
</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Of course, or
why be boss? Reception desk, with Sergeant Patterson. Sergeant, get to know these faces. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT (nodding and
grinning): I know some already, sir. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: From here on,
we’re secret. So no chums in, no parties in the canteen — - which by the way is
through there and extremely decent. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: And
working. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Loos that way,
also working. And now — - </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He opens the lab door
and leads the way in. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE LABORATORY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The laboratory is
large and well equipped. It is filled with benches and steel shelves holding all kinds of
equipment. Crates still unpacked stand round the walls. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">There are a couple of
TV cameras on roller tripods, large monitors, oscillographs, thermographs, a spectrum
analyser. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Separated off from
the rest by a glazed partition is the computer section. This is the territory of Jill and
Stew. There is the usual teleprinter for data communications-a plotter of automatic graphs
... a high-speed line printer. But only a couple of the conventional tape storage units
with their heavy tape spools visible through windows. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: This is Lab
One. Soon there’ll be two others like it to spread into. And if that’s not
enough there are five hundred acres outside to sit and think in. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: Who else is
coming here? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Nobody. Just
us. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: But
it’s enormous. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: We’ll get
bigger. I’ll expand the team with people I choose. Handpicked. The best. Same as
you’re the best. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: Flattery,
Pete.. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: Gets him a
lot of places. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">DOW: Yeah. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: This lot. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: Fantastic. </font></p>

Well — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (quietly): You
were here to solve them. (Controlling his anger) How far have they got with it? Colly, how
much have they done? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON (bluntly):
Nothing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock stares at him
in disbelief, then makes for the door. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Let me see! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He stamps off down
the passage. Collinson looks at Jill. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">They both follow. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE STORAGE ROOM </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock throws open a
massive door. There is still a notice screwed to it reading “U.S. ARMY. STORE
ROOM”. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The room is immense.
It could contain a small house. The walls go up 15 or 20 feet to meet the bare and rotting
beams of the roof. The walls are covered with wooden panelling that now hangs away from
them in sagging sheets. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is a single
window at one end, high up and half smothered by the ivy we saw outside. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Apart from a
workmen’s trestle table, standing in the rubble, it is completely bare. A few square
yards of the rotten panelling have been torn down and thrown on the floor. Then work seems
to have been abandoned. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock stands in the
middle of the room, unable to believe it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: It — it
simply isn’t – !Five months and not a single– ! Why didn’t you report
it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collinson joins him.
Jill stays in the doorway. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: I knew
there were reasons they had to finish the priority jobs. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Colly, this
was priority! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: To be
fair, it wasn’t in phase one. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Refacing and
air-conditioning and wiring — ! Did they just forget it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: No. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What then? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Problems
with the men. They claimed it was — I don It know — a dirty job. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: There’s
dry rot! Do they think it’s catching! Look at those panels — I could shift the
lot in half an hour! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He grabs a swathe of
distorted panelling and peels it back. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It splits, disclosing
shroud-like hangings of fungus. Dust scatters. Brock sneezes. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He pulls savagely at
another section and this too rips away. More fungus — and something else. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Stairs. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill comes to look.
The steps are little more than pegs the wall, scarcely a foot wide and very badly worn
— hollowed, sloping and uneven. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Yes, they
saw those. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: The men? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He tugs at the next
section of panelling. it is more resistant but it shows them enough. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: They don’t
lead anywhere. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The steps run from
ground level to about eight feet up and then stop. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Surely that
wasn’t what — ? (Sourly, as he releases the panel) What else did they find? A
skeleton? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: No-o. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Anything? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: As a
matter of fact, yes. About thirty tins of Spam. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Spam! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: And a
letter to Father Christmas. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He nods at the
trestle table. With a comic groan Brock goes to look. There is a pile of rusty tins. He
picks one up. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: U.S. Army
issue. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Doubt if
it’s fit now. They must have got forced in through the panelling. The Yanks used this
for a store. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Painted it
khaki! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Trying to
quell the rot. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Even then? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: It was
empty before the war. When the rot gets really going like this they call it weeping.
Weeping fungus. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock glares at the
membranes of rot with personal enmity. There is a piece of paper on the table — a
half disintegrated sheet that looks as if it was previously folded up in a tight wad. Jill
picks it up and tries to make out the faded scrawl. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: “Christmas
Eve...” </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Oh yes,
that’s it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: “What ...
I want for...Christmas ... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: A
kid’s writing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">His manner has
changed — tight and nervous. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock suddenly
attacks the wall, kicking out a great piece of panelling. Rot and dead wood and dust go
flying. He kicks at it again, hacking more away with his foot. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Even the
stone’s got it! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: It’s
just — very old. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: 1880? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Ah,
that’s when they panelled it in. These walls are a lot older than the rest of the
house. They’ve just been — built onto. In fact, they must have been knocked down
and rebuilt and generally messed about a lot in the last thousand years. (Brock stares at
him) Oh, yes. The foundations might be Saxon. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Saxon! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Just an
amateur opinion. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: My God —
! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Informed
amateur. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: If you’re
right, you see what it means? (in despair) They’ll be in here — the environment
boys, the conservationists — nailing their little notices on the door and writs and
— they could stop everything! If they get on to it — (Thinking furiously) —
what about the architect? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON (with
contempt): That architect! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Didn’t he
spot it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Not till
the day he quit. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (a tight
smile): Right! If we go ahead fast — get everything concreted over and the machines
in — while we can! Where are the men now? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Working on
the back. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Come on! (In
the doorway he turns a worry, love, you’ll get your storage room! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">They hurry off along
the passage. Jill shivers. It is cold here, the chill suddenly striking. She follows. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">As the men’s
footsteps fade they seem to echo inside the room. Curiously changed, though — this is
a rapid pattering. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The effect is so
startling that Jill spins round expecting to see another person. And finds nobody. She
forces calm on herself and makes for the door. As she reaches it the sense of another
presence behind her is overwhelming. She halts and steadies herself against the doorpost.
Quite deliberately, she turns to look. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">And sees a figure. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is standing high
up on the peg-like steps. The figure of a woman in black, its face hidden by arms raised
in front of it. It looks as if it is on the point of falling. Still and rigid. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the same moment
that the vision lasts — and it is only a moment — there is a shrill rasp in the
air. A human scream that has lost its humanity, denatured and dead. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then silence. The
steps empty. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill twists about and
clings to the doorpost, beyond crying out. She claws her way into the passage. In the
entrance hall she can see Brock and Collinson talking to one of the builders’ men. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL (hoarsely):
Peter </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He turns. As he
starts towards her she pitches forward... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK’S SUITE
— LIVING QUARTERS </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill is huddled on a
convertible bed. Her knees are drawn up beside her and her fists are bunched. She has come
out of the first shock into a paroxysm of violent, confused sobbing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock is trying to
calm her. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: All right now,
all right. Jill! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He pulls her crumpled
face round. Her eyes open but it takes her a moment to focus on him. She looks like a
child that can’t explain what hurts. Then panic rises again. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: I can’t
stay here, I’ve got to get away! Take me away! (wildly) Peter! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She sits up, tense
and trembling, her fists held tight against her breasts and her body rigid. She is on the
brink of hysteria. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He moves closer,
stroking her, soothing her. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Jill, Jill,
Jill. Easy now. (He kisses her but she stays rigid in his arms) I’m sorry. I
didn’t listen to you before. Tell me about it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: What? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: The accident. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: I — I hit
a pile of sand, that’s all. There were vans and — I couldn’t have been
watching. (Suddenly) I hate this place! I didn’t want to come here! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: No. You
didn’t. (His face sets a little. Now he feels he knows where he is. They are on old
ground. He sits back. Her fists are still pressed tight against her body like a barrier.
He gently eases them down) Here. Dump the moist hankie. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL (opening her
hand): Not — not a hankie. </font></p>

like it now? They’ve done a bit since we came down that time. All the shelving and

carpet, and back to her) I quite liked it even without the shelving. Didn’t you? (Her
face is unresponsive) You know what all this is about. You’re getting at me. (He
waits for a protest but there isn’t any) Mind you, I quite enjoyed your previous
ploys. “How are Christine and the kids? How are Timothy’s mumps? How’s the
dog’s toothache?” Oh my Jilly. You’re a very female one. (He sits on the
bed) I need you. I know you weren’t keen to transfer but I need you for your brain as
well — if that doesn’t sound crass but of course it does. If you’re in
doubt ask Eddie and the boys. (He strokes her forehead) What’s in there is so rare
and... valuable. (After a moment) Do it your own way. Commute home to old mummy or stay
here. Stay? (She says nothing) Sometimes, anyway. </font></p>

recollection) You know? It came to me the other day — about pollution. It’s the
modern rediscovery of sin. The only form it can take in a materialistic world! (He is
delighted with his notion) All the rubbish and mess — that’s the new wickedness!

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Well
— they’ve made a start, clearing the old panelling out. I’m just making a
report. (As Brock glances back at the house) I’d leave them to it. They were
decidedly tricky. </font></p>

One or two things I wanted to clear up about the house here — covenants and so on.
They’ve got boxes and boxes of stuff — passed over by the trustees, I suppose. I
brought one back. (Brock is still showing no attention. Collinson digs out an ancient
document box and squeaks it open) One or two curiosities in it. How d’you like this?

... the pattering, the cry, very faint. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">At the click of the
switch it all ceases. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He looks round the
storage room. He sees nothing move. A quantity of panelling has been ripped out by the
workmen and left on the floor. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then the sounds come
again. The pattering — and, curiously close, the cry: A short, denatured screech,
almost in his ear. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It comes again...and
again. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock backs away. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE LABORATORY —
DAY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Coloured indicator
lamps are flashing on a “breadboard” — a rough experimental lash-up of
electronic components and printed circuits. Maudsley is making adjustments to the controls
on a temporary panel, while Dow takes notes. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie Holmes has one
eye to an optical tube with many large-handled but delicate adjusters. It is supported in
a frame that is gripped tight in a vice. A couple of feet in front of him, clamped to the
same frame, is a kind of crystalline box, a thing of exquisite complexity. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie is peering into
the heart of the box. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Try going down
two nanoseconds. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: Down two. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie’s other
eye is open too but trained to ignore that it sees. It ignores the lab door opening and
Brock coming in, </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">followed by Jill. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: I’ve got
something to tell you all. (Eddie looks up with both eyes. He rubs them. Brock looks
deliberately round the room, waiting for faces to lift from apparatus) We’ve got a
ghost! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">For a moment, nobody
knows how to take the announcement. Whether he is expecting a laugh or not. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: I’m glad
to hear it, Peter. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: Every home
should have one. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: Every
stately home. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Had me
worried, the lack of class. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collinson comes in.
Brock turns to him. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Not a
chance. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Talk to them
yourself? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: I did.
Push it any further and there’ll be a general walk-out. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: That’s
it, then. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He turns to the
others. They are even more puzzled. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: What’s
this about, Peter? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: Did you say
ghost? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Silly word,
don’t be put off. We could call it a phenomenon or something. Anyway it’s real.
It’s got possession of the computer storage room and it’s stopped all work
there. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: The men
won’t go back. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: They were going
on about something in the canteen — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">DOW: Yes. I thought
it was the muck. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: I wondered. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Whatever it is
in there I’ve heard it. Colly’s heard it. And Jill’s seen it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Jill — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: That what got
you? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Yes. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: What did you
see? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: A woman. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: Oh, come
off it! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: She isn’t
kidding. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: None of us
are. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">They don’t know
how to react. Maudsley gives a nervous giggle. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: Let’s go
in there </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: Why not?
I’m ready — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: All right.
Thanks for the enthusiasm because I intend to use it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: Eh? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: What d1you
mean? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: They once had
a go at it with bell, book and candle. Well — we’re rather better equipped. (He
lets this sink in) I’m going to chuck the lot at it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Go after it
with — electronics and — and — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Find out
exactly what makes it — well, it doesn’t tick, it patters its feet and
screeches. Everything we get Jill’s going to program in the computer. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Analyse a
spook? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Say
it’s...a mass of data waiting for a correct interpretation. Nobody’s ever
managed it. I think we might. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collinson glances at
Jill’s tight, strained face. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Can you
spare the time? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: No choice,
Colly. It’s got us stuck... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">INSIDE THE STORAGE
ROOM — DAY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Something is hurled
through from the passage, to land twisting like a heavy snake on the floor. it is a heavy
cable with a multi-outlet head. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: Ta. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He plugs in a large
tape-recorder. Nearby, Dow is sorting out microphones, including a parabolic reflector. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">DOW: Which mike,
Pete? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Stereo. (To
Jill) Where did you see it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Near the top of
the steps. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The panelling has
been stripped from the end wall, exposing the steps, and from about half the remainder of
the room. It reveals a bare stone wall with a row of large joist holes about half-way up. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Where she fell
off. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: There must have
been an upper floor. Where those holes are. D’you think she was going up to it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: No. This
was a total ruin when Tasker bought. It’s all in the deeds. He just roofed it and
patched it and made it part of his house. A sort of folly. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Then —
where was she going? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Probably a big
aspidistra at the top and she had to water it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: And died. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Odd, that.
You’d have thought she’d just break a leg or something. It’s not high
enough. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: High enough for
poor Louisa. And then... they panelled the place over. To hide it all. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">They are all watching
her. Rational by temperament and training, they are nevertheless uneasy in this place.
There is something about its atmosphere that disturbs. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: There’s a
big echo in here. We ought to measure it. Something to make a loud noise with? (At the
table) What’s all this? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Spam. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Eh? Somebody
feeding the ghost? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He grins at her but
the idea isn’t funny. Tt hits her. Items click together in her mind. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL (almost a
whisper): Perhaps they were. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie thumps a rusty
tin on the table but rejects the idea. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He goes on testing
possible objects while Dow listens through his headphones. HARGRAVES points the parabolic
reflector hopefully at the steps and locks it off. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: Now we
wait. Think I’ll get my coat. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: Get mine,
will you? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW (giving them a
sour look): Oh spare us. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: What?
STEW: This act, the ghostly shivers. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: No act. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: It’s
just — chilly. Don’t you feel it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: Do you mind! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then he notices Jill.
She is trembling, tightening her arms round herself. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie has improvised
a clapper board out of two pieces of batten from a packing case. He smacks them sharply
together. The percussion echoes through the room. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: How’s
that? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">DOW: Okay, I’ll
take it. (He switches the recorder on and speaks into the microphone) Testing room
wavelength. Take one. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie produces
another clash of metal ... it echoes noticeably ... then, after a few seconds, another
percussion. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Stop it. Oh
stop it — ! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: That’s
enough, Eddie. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Through their very
voices comes the harsh rasping screech. It repeats several times in rapid succession. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is wild
excitement. The sound seems to break out in half a dozen places. They twist and turn to
locate it. Then it is gone — in a single rapid patter of footsteps. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">They are left staring
at each other. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: That was
it! That was it! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: It was by the
steps. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES (pointing
down the room): No, over that way. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: It was by the
door. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: No, it
wasn’t. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Distinctly. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">They are all arguing
and pointing; almost a nervous reaction. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: What did you
hear? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: It was over
there! I’m not crazy! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY: You could
hardly hear it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: It was
deafening! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: It wasn’t
loud. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Not loud? I
heard it! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Just close. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: Hi,
that’s right. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: No perspective
on it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW (to Maudsley):
What did you hear? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">MAUDSLEY (shrugging):
Not much. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: I didn’t
hear anything. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: I saw her.
Again. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">This stops the
argument. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Same place? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: No, there. (She
points to the middle of the room. Instinctively they turn to look at the spot) Black
clothes. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Solid? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Yes, quite
solid. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Was she
moving? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: I think so.
There was something the matter. The way she moved — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: How? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Sort of —
twisting. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock looks at the
others. Nobody has anything to add. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Let’s
hear it again. Cliff — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Dow turns the
recorder spools back and switches on. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">DOW’S VOICE
(recorded): Testing room wavelength. Take one. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">They hear the test
sounds Eddie made and the two other voices cutting in. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL’S VOICE:
Stop it. Oh stop it — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK’S VOICE:
That’s enough, Eddie. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then — silence,
apart from small human exclamations. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: She’s not
there. She didn’t record. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">DOW: I heard her in
my headphones. I don’t get this. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Let me check
that thing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He crouches by the
recorder. Uneasy glances are exchanged. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: She got
away... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE LABORATORY —
DAY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">More apparatus is
being wheeled out of the laboratory towards the storage room: A TV monitor, TV cameras,
thermographs. Jill slumps into her chair at the programming desk. Collinson is with her. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: It’s the
screaming. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Yes. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Could you hear
it from the caravan? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: No, only
if I went to the room. But I — well, I just can’t take a woman’s screams. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Soft-hearted. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: I was with
my wife in a car crash. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Killed? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: No. We
divorced. Might have had something to do with it. This is even worse in a way. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Worse? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: A living
person in that pain, you can try to help them. Here — you can’t. (Jill covers
her face) , — I’m going to be very old and stuffy and say drop the whole thing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: No. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: If you
really see something it must mean — extra sensitivity. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: I’m a

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: That makes
it sound — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Knocks on the

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: I’m
serious. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She sees the concern
in his face. Then Brock arrives with Stew. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (to Stew): Get

his teleprinter): Okay. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Jill, can you
start blocking something out? Heuristic stuff, really wild? (He glances at the tape
storage units) Those won’t touch it. Book time on the central computer. If you need

neatly typed notes) Full record of the first five years from 1890. Also the past six
months. </font></p>

the doorway of the storage room. He looks thoroughly bewildered. The room seems to be full
of apparatus. Blank monitor screens flicker. Eddie and the others are tending and
adjusting and improvising. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN: We made these
dares out of it, see? Old rats are dirty customers. They’ll go for you. We used to
fool about all over this house. Smash it up a bit you know. </font></p>

don’t get back. That old cow down there, she — (He breaks off, listening. The
others notice something too. Maudsley shivers. Dow tenses and makes a dive for the
parabolic reflector. All of them sense the chill: Brock ... Eddie...Alan) I reckon
I’ll just get along. </font></p>

at Brock. Suddenly he cracks. With a strangled exclamation he turns and bolts. He collides
with Maudsley. He pushes Dow out of his way, trips over a cable and falls against a
thermograph tripod. He goes down with it. Then he is crawling towards the doorway, frantic
with terror. </font></p>

eye and he look. half stunned —only driven on by animal fear. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">As he sways against
the wall Jill throws the lab door open. He jerks away from the sudden movement. He
stumbles past the reception desk and the pop-eyed sergeant — and drops to his knees,
trying to wipe the blood out of his eyes. As Jill catches him up he peers round to see who
or what it is. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN: Don’t want
to be — like Jackie — </font></p>

It’s over. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT: What
happened, sir? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Get some water

alone! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: You were
afraid of it. </font></p>

shouldn’t he be? It’s a normal human reaction. He’s the sane one!
We’re the freaks! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock turns quickly
down the passage. </font></p>

Brock): Nothing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Alan’s panic has
brought something to the surface in them all. He has acted out the secret fear they
suppress, and it needs more effort to keep a rational view of this unrecordable thing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The sergeant had

to Jackie? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN: Eh? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: You said just
now — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN: We never done
nothing to him. It was the door got stuck. That door. </font></p>

the room? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN (nodding): We

guilt) He’s all right, old Jackie. </font></p>

it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN (after a

Others? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN: Just his talk,

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: What happened
to him? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN: He’s all
right. Got this job, hasn’t he? </font></p>

</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN: What for? He
don’t remember. (She stares at him) They took him up the County. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Where? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">ALAN: The County. You
know. They put him right. They can do that. He don’t care a button, he just laughs.
All the time. He’s all right. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She can say nothing.
Seeing Brock returning, Alan moves off abruptly and heads for the outer door. </font></p>

a minute — I’ll get a car to take you — </font></p>

him go! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then Alan has gone.
They look at each other. Brock is showing the same strain as the rest of his team. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The phone rings on
the reception desk, grating raw nerves. </font></p>

it): Reception ... Yes, he is. (To Brock) Mr Ryan’s office. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is like a cold
douche. Brock takes the phone. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Brock ... Oh
... Helen, my love, how are you?...Yes, we’re settling in nicely... (Alarmed)
McAlister? But —that’s all been settled, there’s no question of —
there’s no room for him here!...(Alarm subsiding) Talk to him? Well ... I just
don’t want to see the man, I’m in the middle of an experiment. Look, is he
there? (He manages a grisly jocularity) Himself, th’ould grey widow maker? ... I see,

DAY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">A display screen

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: All right, her

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Yes. In vision,
about a tenth as many. </font></p>

peaks of the display. </font></p>

Everybody’s is different. One hears hardly at all. Why? </font></p>

Would — she — walk — for — him? </font></p>

ROOM </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Rapid footsteps
patter in the storage room. This time they seem to run the whole length of it. </font></p>

thermograph scanner wildly, trying to follow the sound. Eddie scrambles to help him. </font></p>

parabolic microphone in another direction. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock and HARGRAVES
are busy with more thermographs. But all the monitor screens fed by these machines remain
blank. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill comes into the
doorway with Stew. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">A harsh rasping
squeal. The footsteps break into half a dozen crossing patterns </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Suddenly Jill sees
it: A black figure at the foot of the steps, clawing its way up as if in slow motion,
somehow almost paralysed. </font></p>

sees it too. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES (pointing):
There it is! (Brock abandons his thermograph. He sees nothing. The steps are empty) It was
there! Right there! Sort of creeping! You must have seen her! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He runs to the spot
as if he expects to find some trace and turns to them, baffled. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Just you and
Jill. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE (bitterly): No
warning! (He snatches up one of his black boxes and breathes noisily, angrily, on the
element. It instantly lights up) Oh, it works now! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He shakes the thing
until the contents rattle. </font></p>

Stew is still standing in the doorway. Meeting Brock’s eyes, he shakes his head.
Brock turns to Jill. She is standing stiffly, controlling herself with an effort. </font></p>

over a drink. Brock is getting one for himself. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: She’s
running from something. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: The footsteps.
</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Always running.
</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Probably old
Tasker coming to pinch her bum. Three times round the table and the girl is mine, ha, ha. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL (emotionally):
She died! </font></p>

really getting to you. (That does it. She rubs and dabs at her face as tears start
streaming)...Jill. </font></p>

— to be afraid like that! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He sits and pulls her
to him. She is shaking. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Are you
afraid? Of all this? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: No. I
don’t think so — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What, then? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL (with
difficulty): It’s — the thought of it. Of there being nothing left of you but
— just enough to repeat the worst moment of your life over and over again! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: That
doesn’t happen. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: But if it did
— if she knew — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Look, love, we
talked about it. We all agreed — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Could there be
anything there that knows? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Not in my
book. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Just — a
dead mechanism? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: That’s
all that’s left. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: It’s
horrible. But it’s better than knowing. I couldn’t bear it if she knew! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He strokes her,
gentling her. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: All right,
love. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He kisses her but she
is still tense and obsessed. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: To be so alone
— </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She looks at him with
horror behind her eyes. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (firmly): All
right, that’s it. You’ve said it and got it over. Your moment of superstition. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: It wasn’t.
</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She is calmer now.
For a moment or two longer he keeps his arms round her. The tension is lessening, but
slowly. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What you need
is another drink. (He picks up her empty glass. As he goes to fill it the phone rings) Oh,
hell! (He tries to ignore it but it goes on ringing. He answers it) Hello? Christine,
darling, I meant to ring before but you know – problems. Well, something slightly
interesting for once. I’ll tell you all about it when I ... Probably tomorrow . (Jill
is on her feet. He flaps a detaining hand at her) Kids in bed are they? ... Is she? Give
her my biggest kiss ... A what? A drawing? I can’t wait. (Jill makes for the door.
His back is turned and he doesn’t notice) Listen, about Chuffy...was it inside the
hoof? ... What did the vet say... ? </font></p>

flicker of blank monitor screens. Keeping a self-imposed watch. </font></p>

Brock. (The hand he extends is, disturbingly, bright scarlet. So is his other one) Excuse
the red hands, I’ve been doing dye tests, in very inadequate conditions. (They shake,
very briefly) You’ve never been to my place at Slough. Hardly more than a shed. </font></p>

chair. McAlister sits — sinking down and down almost to floor level. </font></p>

The interview chair. </font></p>

yourself? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McALISTER (proudly):
I make it a rule. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (thoughtfully):
Held like that. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Old Patrick.
He was a...nuts-and-bolts man himself once. Started with electric irons. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McALISTER: I know. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Of course you
do. A good ploy. </font></p>

meaningful. Since we’re being fussy about words, that’s not one he uses. </font></p>

is being called. It has to do with who knows Ryan better. It is resolved by McAlister

He wouldn’t say that. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Stew taps keys. The
teleprinter re-runs. Brock studies its print, turns quickly to a display monitor nearby.
This shows a three-dimensional drawing of the room itself. Brock makes an adjustment and
the lines jump. . and jump again ... displaying a different perspective each time. Another
adjustment — and a spray of radiating lines is superimposed to denote the current
target area. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Back to the
steps. Laser plus sound </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The thin cherry-red
beam of a laser flicks back and forth across the steps, scanning them. Simultaneously
there is a strident intermittent buzz. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Cut them. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The sound stops.
White light floods the steps. They wait. Brock has a stopwatch in his hand. Nothing
happens. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Right. Run
number 17. Laser plus five second bursts. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Peter,
what’s the use? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: We’re on
the right track, just keep going. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: You’ve
had a — a response! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: No. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: We’ve
heard it twice tonight. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Not because of
anything we did. It didn’t relate. It’s got to relate, Eddie. (He looks round
the wearying faces) Okay, break for ten minutes. We’ll get more coffee up. Just
another hour, if we don I t get anything by then —Bear with me? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES (glumly):
You’re the captain. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock walks out into
the passage. Eddie glares after him </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">As Jill comes up he
nods after Brock — is there anything she can do, She goes doubtfully to see. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Ten minutes later the
team are downing coffee and microwaved snacks. They are too tired to talk. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie glowers down
the passage. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE ENTRANCE HALL
— NIGHT </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock is standing on
the stairs, leaning against the wall. Adrenalin and alcohol have left an odd,
inspirational effect. Jill is fighting her own weariness, trying to sound persuasive. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: I think
you’re right. It’s a vibration thing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: I know it is. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: But —
Peter, it’ll take huge programs to analyse it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Of course. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: I’d like
to develop them. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Fine. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Then why this
— tonight? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: I want to pull
the trigger, just once. Or what the hell are we into — a tape that only plays back
when it feels like it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The sheer
irrationality of it shocks her. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: You just
can’t say that — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: I’ve got
to know! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Peter, I
don’ t think any of us is quite — we I’ve all been under strain —
these days here — the more rational we’ve tried to be, the worse — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What are you
driving at? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: We’re all
past it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Not me, love. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Yes, you. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Don’t say
that. Don’t do it. I’ve got a feeling about this. You get this exact grip on a
thing this clarity —only once ever — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She is staring at
him. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: What have you
— promised Ryan? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE STORAGE ROOM
— NIGHT </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">An appalling screech
bursts from the horn of the sound projector, pounding at the walls as it is swung round.
The sound wobbles, changing frequency with the stridency of an air raid siren, but much
faster. Then it cuts. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock turns to the
others. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Nobody? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: What’s
the use? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Nerves
jangled? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: What do you
think? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: That may be
good. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Next — a beam of
bluish light swings rapidly across the area of the steps. Synchronised with it come sharp,
separate blasts of sound — with something of the effect of a dentist’s drill. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock watches. Like
the others, he now wears protective goggles. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Hold the U.V.
on the steps! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">At the teleprinter,
Stew has suddenly had all he can take. He covers his ears. Jill moves to take over ... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Now it is flashing
light, as rapid as a stroboscope, with sound to match. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock signals. The
sound cuts. The light is sane again. Eddie stares dazedly about. HARGRAVES has quietly
started to cry. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">But Brock ignores
them as he turns again to the computer. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It chatters out its
report. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Right. On the
next run we’ll try </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Stop it! You
don’t know what you’re doing any more </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Following a
logical line. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: It’s
insane! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Quit, then. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: What? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Get off the
project. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Peter </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Get off the
entire project! You can! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE (choking) :
Don’t talk to me like, that, Peter, not to me </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The teleprinter
chatters again, a line of delayed print-out. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock turns to read
it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What the hell
— ? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL (peering):
That’s not — computer language. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: It’s your
code number. You fed it in. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: No — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: You must have
done. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: There are
words. They might be words. See — “pray”. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW:
“Soul”. That’s “soul” there. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL:
“Pray.” “Prayer”. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">A deathly hush. Then
a terrified wail from the demoralised HARGRAVES. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: It’s
in the computer! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">For a moment the
thought has them all in its grip. They are past objective thinking, utterly exhausted. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock is the first to
recover. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: No — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">HARGRAVES: It is! It
is! It’s in there! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock grabs him and
shakes him like a rat. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: You bloody
fool! Jill picked up the words! You got words yourself — that’s how it works! I
told you. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is a familiar
pattering. This time it is fearful to them. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE (whispering):
There it is — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (after a
moment, insanely): Come when I tell you! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He lunges towards the
sound projector and switches it on. At full volume he swings the horn, blasting every part
of the room. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill claps her hands
to her ears. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">People stumble
towards the doorway to escape it. The sound goes on and on — and seems to change,
erupting into a vast grunting that makes the whole place shudder. For a moment it seems
completely out of control. Brock is shaken like a man on a pneumatic drill. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then — silence.
He stands panting, hardly knowing what he has done or why. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The others drift
back. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: It’s
different. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (numbed): Eh? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: She’s
gone. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What d1you
mean? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Completely. I
can tell. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie totters forward
in a kind of grotesque triumph. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: I’ll tell
you what he’s done! D’you know what he’s done? He’s wiped the tape! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock stares blankly
at them. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Maudsley gives a sick
snigger. otherwise nobody is laughing. They are incapable of it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (mumbling):
Thanks ... we’ll leave it at that. Might try ...another run tomorrow. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Run what?
She’s gone! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She has a horror of
him, as if she has just watched him commit a murder. Eddie takes her by the arm. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock crouches on the
floor. Listening and waiting... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Hours later Brock is
still there, watching by the flicker of the blank monitor screens. More and more anxiously
... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Dawn, and Brock is
still there. Still alone. He has dropped asleep, leaning awkwardly against a monitor. His
head droops a little more sideways — and wakes him. He pulls himself back to
consciousness, wondering what woke him. Expectant again. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">But there is
nothing... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE ENTRANCE HALL
— DAY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Coming in next day,
Jill finds the Sergeant looking his usual self, at least. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT: Morning,
Miss Greeley — or should I say good afternoon? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: It’s up to
you. (Monitors are being wheeled along the passage from the storage room. Collinson is in
charge. Jill’s look is a question. He shakes his head) ... He really did it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: I kept
away. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Where is he? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collinson indicates
the floor above... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">INSIDE BROCK’S
SUITE — OFFICE </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock is huddled in
his chair, looking too small for it. He is still wrapped in a dressing-gown and looks grey
and dishevelled. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (into phone,
wretchedly): Look, Patrick. I’m sorry if I gave the impression that we...Perhaps I
shouldn’t have, then ... No, not backing down at all, I just don’t want you to
waste your time coming here and. . .0h, I have! every confidence! I know we’re on the
track of it, we’ve only got to get the bugs out of it...as always ... What?...Of
course you’ve got a right to. It’s a ... mineral ... medium... Don’t pin me
down, I can’t be more specific at this moment of time ... Patrick, please!
(desperately) It — it’s a variant on Eddie Holmes’s digital crystal —
in fact that may turn out to be it after all. I just can’t give a technical
explanation right now... Of course I will, Patrick. Of course. Good bye. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He puts the phone
down in a sweat — and sees Jill watching, him from the doorway. For a moment or two
neither speaks. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Don’t say
— anything! It’s over, it’s finished! If I can just walk away from this one
— ! (worriedly) He Is a funny man, you never quite know ... you can’t tell from
his voice. Just so long as this doesn’t — doesn’t ... He’s devious of
course but what the hell. I’ve seen him be treacherous but not to anybody that —
anybody that...No. No. He wouldn’t... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Men from a Ryan

across the hall towards the reception desk. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE LABORATORY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">All the apparatus is
back in place. Brock, looking more or less himself again, is restoring confidence to his
team. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Whatever the
... effect was, it is obviously gone for good. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Obliterated. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Yes. (He looks
at Jill but she says nothing) Now we’ve had time to take it in — I’m glad.
It’s what I wanted to do in the first place. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Oh, Peter
— ! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Now, be fair
— I did. So let’s regard it as a bit of a nonsense, part of the house-warming.
It got out of hand. I plead guilty. But now — the room is clear, we can set it up for
computer storage, get on! I’ve been working out new schedules — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The sergeant looks
in. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT: Beg pardon,
Sir — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What is it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE ENTRANCE HALL </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock comes from the
lab with the others following curiously. The sergeant points to the canvas-covered object.
It looms there like a squat monolith. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT:
Where’s it to go, sir? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">With rising
apprehension Brock lifts a corner of the canvas cover. Then he throws it off. The thing
revealed is white and shining, with the unmistakable single eye of a washing machine. Its
top is monstrously swollen to accommodate a mass of special controls. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: McAlister!
(His stricken eyes meet Jill’s) The old bastard did it! He did do it! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE LABORATORY —
DAYS LATER </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie is peering
through his optical tube. His spare eye goes to Stew as he passes laden with used rolls of
computer paper. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Ready for my
data? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: Just clearing
the decks. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Get rid of it.
As things now are, get rid of it fast. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Stew moves on —

off steps. </font></p>

The others...! (She frowns, thinking back to what Alan said. Then she rips off the
print-out) I’m going to show him this. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Of course. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: No, love —
not today. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: What? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: The big
invasion. McAlister. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She hesitates. Then
she goes quickly out. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE STORAGE ROOM
— DAY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock is clutching a
large plan as he glowers round the storage room. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: At least
he’s not getting this. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: He’ll
be fine in the other wing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (with
satisfaction): It’s filthy damp. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Work on the room is
proceeding at last. Workmen are erecting scaffolding along the side wall, which has been
stripped, like all of them, of remaining panelling. The place has a bare, industrial look.
</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock turns to Jill
as she comes in. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Jill, look at
this. Location of the store-core units — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: I want to show
you something. From the other night — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (warding off
the print-out): Oh no. No! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: The words
— </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: I don’t
want to see. I don’t want to know! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He moves off quickly
to confer with the workmen. Collinson gives her a warning gesture and joins him. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then it happens. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill finds herself
shaken by a spasm of trembling — far more violent than any before. As if the strength
is being whipped out of her body. She grabs at a ladder to steady herself. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock and Collinson
are engaged in some joke with the workmen, all of them laughing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then — silence.
The men are still laughing and talking but without sound. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Instead, an instant
later, an obscene grunting roar. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is overpowering.
Through the continuing horror of it Jill can see the men talking and working on, evidently
oblivious of it. It simply does not reach them. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It ends suddenly too.
Brock’s laugh is heard again, and the small sounds of the scaffolding work. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collinson happens to
turn. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Jill! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock turns too and
sees the state she is in. Collinson is the first to reach her. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Get her out of
this — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: You didn’t
hear it! (Collinson almost carries her out into the passage) It was different — this
was different! It’s not her — it’s something else! Peter — ! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (firmly):
You’ll have to keep out of this room. It’s the associations. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: It isn’t </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Stay out of
it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Let me tell you
</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Things went
too far. My fault, I know it was. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: If you’ll
only — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Now
you’ve got to rest. Unwind. Go home and take it easy. We can’t have you cracking
up. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Peter — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Will you do
that for me? (He glances at his watch) Time! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He hurries towards
the entrance hall. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON (quietly):
He’s right, Jill. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">OUTSIDE TASKERLANDS
HOUSE — DAY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Two strange cars pull
in outside the front entrance. An old Rover and a viva. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">From the first
McAlister gets out. He looks twice as tall, swollen with triumph. One of his team is with
him, three others get out of the Viva — all of them grey, bullied men. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">As they turn in a
body to make their entrance, a lightweight motorbike sputters across the gravel. Its rider
kicks the stand down, beams at them and trots into the house ahead of them. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is the vicar. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">INSIDE THE ENTRANCE
HALL </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">As the vicar enters
he spots Brock standing by the reception desk with the air of a general forced to
ignominious parley. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR: Mr Brock!
There you are! (Brock stares at him blankly) I’ve tracked down that exorcism! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR: I went to the
museum! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (in horror):
Not now — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR: And there it
was! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (desperately):
Colly — cope, will you — cope, please! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collinson hurries
forward. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR: It wasn’t
easy to discover — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Very kind of
you, very helpful, but — just at the moment I’ve got business! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He turns to face the
invaders. McAlister leads them with eyes gleaming and a thin smile. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McALISTER: Well,
Brock? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: This way. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He leads them off
towards the spare wing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR (hurt): That
really was a little short — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: You said
— an exorcism? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR: Yes. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: He knows
about it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR: Oh. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: We had the
documents. 1892. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR: When? Oh, no. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: It was. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR: 1760. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill comes forward.
The vicar recognises her, nods and beams. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: 1760? The house
wasn’t built then. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VICAR: Indeed not.
There was just — some sort of ruin here. Nevertheless there’d been —
complaints, so — a service was performed. Quite useless, apparently —
that’s if you accept there had been anything there in the first place ... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE LABORATORY —

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill is working at

about tackling mine? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Give me a

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: What is this?
(He looks over her shoulder) For God’s sake! Don’t let Peter see that.
We’ve got work to do. JILL (promising): Soon, Eddie. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie goes sourly
off. Stew moves in. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: Well? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: It’s the
concept of a tape that’s wrong. It’s more like a great depth — a core
— </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: He erased her.
But she was only in the surface layer, the most recent. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: 1890 recent! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: There’d be
much older impressions underneath. Much deeper. </font></p>

have an office. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (unhelpfully):
Do what I can — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McALISTER: I have a
great deal of paper work. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (meanly):
Costing? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McAlister glares at

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Peter —
have you got a moment? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (quickly): This
is Jill Greeley, who programs our computer. Robert McAlister. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McAlister thrusts out
a bright blue hand. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McALISTER: I’ll
have need of you, lassie, and your wee machine. (He turns his back on her and the pair of
them move off rapidly towards the other wing) I got that crack about costing. Let me tell
you my machine is viable and I’m going to prove it... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill is left standing

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie and some of the
others are taking a break near the front entrance, idly watching McAlister and a couple of
his team unloading things from the van — wash drums, cables, etc. The last man
struggles under a burden of dazzlingly dyed sheets — orange, turquoise and cerise. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: What do they

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Whatever’s

what he’s done! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She turns — and
sees the secretary watching through a crack in the doorway. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Home and rest
now... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE LABORATORY —
NIGHT </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The lab is dark,
apart from the area of the computer where Jill is working alone. All round her are
discarded rolls of print-out paper. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collinson looks in,
an old mac pulled round him, wet with rain. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Jill! I
saw the light. What are you doing? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She looks at him as
if she hardly recognises him — then goes on tapping at the teleprinter keys. He comes
to her side and peers at what she is doing — but he can make nothing of it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: I think someone
else did know about this. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Who? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Louisa. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He watches her face
as she works feverishly on. In a moment she has forgotten he is there. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He turns and goes
quickly out. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The slight sound of
the door shutting seems to break her absorption. She sits back in her chair, covers her
face. when she looks again at the paper roll in the machine, the same result is still
there ... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE ENTRANCE HALL
— NIGHT </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill comes out of the
lab . She glances up the stairs — there are lights somewhere above — then turns
along the passage towards the storage room. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">A temporary notice
has been stuck on the door, crudely lettered: “Keep Out, Building Work in
Progress”. She opens the door. She switches the light on. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE STORAGE ROOM </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The storage room is
empty, lit by a couple of bare bulbs. Builders’ equipment lies everywhere and more
scaffolding has been erected. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill looks about,
tense. But everything is aggressively ordinary. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She crosses to the
stone steps and considers them. Ordinary, too, in the hard light. A workman has left a
battered bucket on one of the lower ones and she dislodges it — just to break the
silence. It clatters and rolls away... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK’S SUITE
— OFFICE, NIGHT </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collinson is facing a
dishevelled Brock, who has just pulled a dressing-gown over his nakedness. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK
(incredulously): At this hour? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON (quietly):
I think she’s having a breakdown. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Yes. (The
tousled, undressed secretary peers out of the darkened living quarters. He waves her back)
I sent her on leave. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: When? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Today. I told
her to go. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON (amazed):
Just like that? Just — go. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What else? If
you feel strongly about it — go with her! In fact I think you should, you’ve
been under a bit of strain here, all this extra work, you’re due for a — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Take Jill?
</font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: A spot of
leave’s what you both need, so why not, the pair of you? Get it all out of your
system— </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE STORAGE ROOM </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill is starting back
towards the passage when she feels the premonitory chill. But she keeps a grip on herself
and keeps moving. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The passage is dark,
as if the light in the entrance hall has gone out. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Oddly enough, there
are two tiny spots of red light — low down and flashing alternately like indicator
lamps. Then bo th glow evenly — and come rushing forward at incredible speed ,
swelling in an instant into two eyes, yet not eyes like those of any living creature, for
they keep twisting and moving on separate courses. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She stumbles back and
almost trips over a spade, sending it scraping across the concrete. It is the only sound. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The eyes have gone. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">More movement. She
turns — and sees shapes, or rather shapeless things moving towards her across the
open floor with the same incredible speed. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL (screams):
Peter! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">As if this served to
set it off, the grunting begins — the same huge, unearthly noise she heard here
earlier. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She starts across the
floor — in the only direction she can, towards the steps. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">They are hunting her.
Huge forms, terrifying in their very lack of definition, with here and there eye-like dots
of red light. They move across the ground with that dreadful speed, quartering it like
hounds. There is a brute male violence about every movement, a lust to bring down and tear
— </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then she is on the
steps, pressing herself against the wall. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JILL: Help me! Help
– ! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She glances up. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The steps lead to an
upper floor, with light pouring down from the opening. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">She claws her way up
to reach it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The steps beneath her
feet are unworn and strong. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Frantic, she reaches
the top of them. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">And there is nothing.
No upper floor, not even a roof above her — only the night sky. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The whole room has
vanished. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Instead of the walls
there are standing stones round a moonlit space. And there the shapeless things are
circling, closing in — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then she falls. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">It is a long way down
... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE ENTRANCE HALL </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Normal silence —
then Brock and Collinson come running down the stairs. They look into the lab, then make
for the storage room. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE STORAGE ROOM </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Jill is lying on the
concrete at the foot of the steps. Brock and Collinson run to her. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Her eyes are open.
She is dead... </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE ENTRANCE HALL
— A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock, Collinson,
Eddie and Stew come slowly in through the front door. Maudsley and HARGRAVES trail after
them. All are soberly dressed. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The sergeant is
missing from his place at the desk. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McAlister and one of
his team come down the stairs. McAlister already looks more like a senior executive than a
mechanic, and has acquired a plain-looking secretary who follows them holding some thick
folders. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McALISTER: What was
it? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: Accidental
death. McAlister gives a sour sniff. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McALISTER: By the by,
Brock — those environment boys were back, looking for you. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (dully): Oh. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">McALISTER: Clapping a
preservation order on that room, are they? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He goes on with his
followers towards his own wing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Pleased with
the verdict? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock says nothing. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Why did you
have to say all that? About her? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Her mental
state. They had to know. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: Did they? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Look, it
wasn’t just the fall that did it, they knew that. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: They said
shock. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Complete vagal
inhibition. That’s when-your whole system packs up. She brought it on herself. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie gives him a
look of disgust and turns away to the lab. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: I’ll just
get my coat, Stew. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: Okay. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON (quietly to
Brock): You were lucky. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Eddie reappears
indignantly in the lab doorway. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">EDDIE: What’s he
doing in there! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE LABORATORY </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The sergeant is
standing beside the computer, busy with a paper-shredding machine. He has turned most of
the used print out rolls into a huge mound of shreds. He is feeding in the last of them. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT: Just what I
was told, sir. Ask Mr Brock. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (entering with
the others): We had to get rid of it. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: That’s
— what she’d just been working on — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: It had to go.
Look, I Im not suppressing anything — not evidence — it’s all computer
language — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">STEW: All her work. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON (calmly as
ever): Leave it to me. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He motions Stew and
Eddie out and closes the door. The last of the paper is buzzed into shreds. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Mad stuff,
Colly. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">COLLINSON: It’s
gone now. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: You saw it?
Well, you wouldn’t understand it. Seven thousand years, it said! I mean — insane
stuff! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Collinson hits him as
hard as he can. it is an imperfectly aimed blow. It gets Brock in the throat, sending him
sprawling in the shredded paper. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He lies there,
choking and gasping while Collinson walks out. The sergeant is at a loss. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT (to
Collinson): Look here, sir! (He turns to help Brock) You all right, sir? Are you? What on
earth did he — ? Shocking behaviour, shocking! Mr Collinson, too! (He gets Brock to
his feet and brushes the clinging shreds off him) Er ... want I should do anything about
him, sir? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock shakes his
head. He rubs his bruised throat, breathing hoarsely. He makes for the door. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE ENTRANCE HALL </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The entrance hall is
deserted. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT (relieved) :
Made off, has he, sir? Disgraceful. Sure you’re all right, sir? (Brock nods) Oh,
before I forget, them conservation inspectors was here again. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Yes. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT: In there
along time, sir. They said there would be a summons. When they went one of ‘em said
did you know about the room. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Eh? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT: Just that,
sir. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: What did he
mean? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT: That’s
all, sir, just did you know about the room. (Brock looks along the passage) Feel okay now,
sir? </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK: Yes. Thanks.
You can go. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">SERGEANT: Thank you,
sir. Good night, sir. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock takes out his
keys. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Reaching the door,
from which the builders’ sign has been removed and a small official-looking notice
substituted, he puts a key into the newly fixed lock. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">THE STORAGE ROOM </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">The room looks much
the same. Builders’ equipment is still scattered about. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Brock shivers
slightly. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">As a rational man
rejecting any alternative explanation, he buttons his jacket. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">He walks across the
floor — </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">There is a sudden
scream in the air, close by. A woman’s voice, sharp and clear. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">VOICE: Help me —
! (He glances round but sees nothing) Peter! (He is stung by the unmistakable sound of his
name) Help me — Peter — ! </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">BROCK (whispers):
Jill. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Then it screams
again, and again, and again. And there is nothing he can do. </font></p>

<p align="LEFT"><font color="000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">Except stand there
stunned by the knowledge ... that there is a new voice on the stone tape ... </font></p>
