THE STONE TAPE 

by Nigel Kneale 

Producer: Innes
Lloyd  
Director: Peter Sasdy 
Produced on BBC Television, December 25, 1972 

OUTSIDE TASKERLANDS
HOUSE — DAY 

A SMALL CAR, an
Austin 1300, is being carefully driven down the last of along drive and into the forecourt
of the house. 

There is much
evidence of the massive rebuilding this ugly la te-Victorian structure has undergone.
There are contractors I huts on the lawn, and a large caravan. There are piles of material
— - sand and reinforcing metal and heavy pipes. Some scaffolding clings to the centre
parts of the building. 

The car pulls in
behind large motor vans. 

There are two vans,
both emblazoned with the name “Ryan Electric Products”. one has unloaded, the
other is just finishing. Men are shifting bulky apparatus onto trolleys and moving it
inside the house. 

The car driver is
JILL GREELEY, aged about 30. There is a very feminine, strong directness about her, so
that what she is seems far more important than what she does. What she does is computer
programming. 

She surveys the
house, oppressed by the sight of it. Her eyes go along the whole ugly length. One end of
it looks still untreated, smothered in ivy. 

She is so absorbed
that she hardly notices that the vans are moving. 

She looks round. One
of them is backing straight towards her, huge and blind. She blips her horn but it still
comes on. She glances to the side and sees the other van backing towards her from that
direction. She has moved in too close; neither of the unseen drivers has noticed her. 

She frantically
starts her engine. 

Then, as if something
happens to her vision — - the two objects are suddenly no longer motor vans but two
huge, de-focussed shapes like standing stones in motion, slowly blundering and blending,
looming over her. And their engine rumble descends to something deeper, an irregular
grunting. Somehow obscene ... 

Then it passes. 

Jill finds herself
sitting motionless, her car on the point of being crushed. She frantically throws her
gears into reverse and slams her foot down. 

The Austin shoots
wildly backwards out of danger, swaying and skidding in the loose gravel. She glances in
the rear mirror — - and sees a mass of builders’ equipment; piles of pipes and
scaffolding! She tugs at the wheel, hits the brakes. The car skids straight on in a spray
of gravel. 

Jill screams. 

The Austin scrapes
past a pile of reinforcing metal with an ugly grinding — - and thuds into a huge pile
of sand. Jill is flung back in her seat. The engine stalls. 

For a moment she
hardly realises what has happened. She leans forward, head into hands. She shudders. 

Fifty yards away the
caravan door opens and ROY COLLINSON looks out. He is a grey-haired man of 45 or so, his
face tight and strained. 

Evidently he heard
the scream. But he sees only the two vans slowly turning into the drive. 

In the Austin, almost
lost to sight behind the builders’ equipment, Jill is still huddled over the wheel,
giving herself time to recover. She numbly watches the vans go ... then a yellow fastback
swinging in past them. 

The fastback pulls up
in the forecourt and Collinson turns to greet the new arrival: PETER BROCK, aged 35,
Director of Research for Ryan Electrics. He is a man with a lot of drive, his temperament
all upswing and downbeat. At the moment, he is on a big upswing, arriving to take over his
new establishment. 

BROCK: Hello, Colly. 

COLLINSON: Peter. 

BROCK: The big day. 

COLLINSON: Don’t
expect too much. It’s all a mess. If only we’d had another month — - 

BROCK: Not a chance.
(They survey the house in silence) It looks good. I mean, it looks as terrible as ever but
— -stronger. 

COLLINSON (with
feeling): Why didn’t they tear it down! 

BROCK: Colly — -


COLLINSON: It would
have been better. They had to rip the floors out and the roof and even the window frames
— -there was nothing worth keeping. Just an ugly shell! 

BROCK: Colly, he
found it. 

COLLINSON: Even so. 

BROCK: Himself. 

COLLINSON: I can
understand about the park there — - at least it’s big — - but this! 

BROCK: He liked the
style of it. 

COLLINSON: My God. 

BROCK: One look,
that’s all he needed, and his mind was made up. He said it spoke to him. Spoke to
him, so it did. (This last comes in the mock brogue which is staff code for utterances of
the firm’s chairman) I know what it said. “Mr Ryan, for pity’s sake
don’t knock me down!”. 

COLLINSON: He —
- he could have built it new! For half the cost! 

The stridency in his
voice worries Brock. 

BROCK: How long have
you been down here? 

COLLINSON: Three or
four months. 

BROCK: Got somebody
stashed away in the caravan? 

COLLINSON: Eh? 

BROCK: Why not? 

COLLINSON: Hardly. I
quite like it. It’s quite — - snug. 

Horns blare in
cheerful chorus. Three more cars are approaching down the drive. 

BROCK: Here they
come. 

COLLINSON: Eddie
Holmes was a great help. He’s got most of your gear in position. I’m glad you
could spare him. 

BROCK: Good man,
Eddie. 

A battered estate car
pulls in, with the other two close behind. Hands wave from windows. Then they are
scrambling out. Most of Brock’s staff are under 30, stamped in general with a kind of
alert ingenuousness. EDDIE HOLMES, at 40, is the oldest, a dull-faced clever man.
HARGRAVES and MAUDSLEY, both 25, one serious and introverted, the other afflicted with an
adolescent sense of humour on top of basic cunning. CLIFF DOW is 30, a slow perfectionist.


There are three or
four others, less noticeable characters. All of them are in high spirits. There has
clearly been a lot of laughter on the way. 

EDDIE: Aye, aye,
Peter! Setting a good example. 

MAUDSLEY: The
conscientious boss is always the first in! 

He leads the
hammed-up dirty laugh. 

BROCK: See what
I’ve got — - a bunch of kids. 

VOICES: Where is he!
Mascot! Mascot! Mascot! 

The rear of the
estate car is flung up. An extraordinary figure bounces out. Its head is covered by a
rubber Martian mask with bug eyes and sprouting wires. Its body is padded and covered with
the green undulating rubber foam that is used under carpets, belted into place. on its
chest hangs a control panel with flashing indicator lamps and a loud beeping noise. A sash
marked “Ryan Electric Products” — - a relic of some trade exhibition —
- is tied round its middle. 

BROCK: Stew! is that
Stewart? 

EDDIE: Who else? 

The figure bows as
the cheering research staff close in. They sweep it off its feet and swing it aloft. They
run with it beeping and flashing, in a wide circle. 

In the Austin, Jill
sits watching. Her nerves are steadying. She smiles slightly, moves to get out. 

The Martian figure
yells as he is swept towards the house and nearly crashes into the door lintel. They tip
him back and run him under it. 

INSIDE THE ENTRANCE
HALL 

The figure is borne
triumphantly in and set down with a bump. Then they demolish him. He yelps as the Martian
mask is ripped off to reveal the thin face of STEWART JESSOP, 22, computer operator. 

STEW: Help! Take me
to your leader! I come in peace! 

HARGRAVES:
You’re coming in pieces, mate! 

They yell like wild
animals. The control panel is battered into silence, the sash sent flying. Hands rip at
the cords and rubber foam. They fight for possession of the padding. 

An elaborately
uniformed “Sergeant” appears from the reception desk, worried about exercising
authority. Brock waves him back. 

BROCK: They’ve
got to do it. Like dogs peeing on something. 

COLLINSON: Like what
— - ! 

As Jill comes in,
Stew is flung almost at her feet with the worrying pack on top of him, whooping and
yelling. 

JILL (in genuine,
momentary horror): What are you doing to him! 

MAUDSLEY: We’re
sacrificing a Martian! 

BROCK: All right,
break it up. That’s enough. That’ll do! (He reaches Jill, puts his arm round
her) Just a bit of clowning. 

MAUDSLEY: Innocent
clowning, sir. 

BROCK: Innocent? You
lot? 

EDDIE: You missed the
fun, Jill. 

DOW: You’re
late. 

MAUDSLEY:
Bride’s privilege. 

Brock gives him a
hard look. 

HARGRAVES: We’ve
sacrificed a Martian! 

Stew sits up,
grinning and sweating. He wipes his face. 

Brock draws Jill
aside. 

BROCK (quietly):
You’re shaking. 

JILL (as quietly): I
was — - nearly in an accident. 

BROCK: How? Where? 

JILL: Outside here. I
had a sort of — - momentary — - I don’t know — - 

BROCK (his face
hardening): Blackout’s the usual word. 

JILL: It wasn’t
that. 

BROCK (sighing): You
should have been with me. I should have been driving you. I’m sorry, I couldn’t
make last night. 

JILL: Peter, please. 

BROCK: So you’ll
get accident-prone. 

JILL: Nothing
happened. 

She turns, aware that
the others are watching them now. 

The house is as
oppressive inside as out. Changes have only worsened it. The great curving staircase now
embraces a lift shaft. Air-conditioning ducts run everywhere and spare sections of ducting
lie stacked about the place. There are coils of cable and other debris. wires dangle
unconnected from the walls. A low-level reception desk shelters the sergeant. 

BROCK: Welcome to
Taskerlands. It doesn’t look much now but wait till it’s finished — - then
you’ll get the full horror. 

COLLINSON: Don’t
put them off. 

BROCK: Everybody know
Roy Collinson, house master and bunny mother? 

COLLINSON: Hold on. 

BROCK: Any problems
about the move — - getting digs in the area, housing wives and harems — - see
Colly. 

EDDIE: Why is it
called that? 

COLLINSON:
Taskerlands? 

EDDIE: Yes,
what’s it mean? 

DOW: Work! 

COLLINSON: It was
built by a man called Tasker and these were his lands. He made a fortune out of iron
railings. 

HARGRAVES: It’s
not — - ancient? 

COLLINSON: Sorry to
disappoint. It was built about 1880. Mostly owned by the one family. Requisitioned during
World War Two — - the American forces had it. Derelict ever since. 

Some laughter. 

BROCK: Right.
Let’s butter their paws. Come on — - (Leading the way briskly) Lift, soon to
operate, I hope. My office is up there. 

EDDIE: Very palatial.


BROCK: Of course, or
why be boss? Reception desk, with Sergeant Patterson. Sergeant, get to know these faces. 

SERGEANT (nodding and
grinning): I know some already, sir. 

BROCK: From here on,
we’re secret. So no chums in, no parties in the canteen — - which by the way is
through there and extremely decent. 

COLLINSON: And
working. 

BROCK: Loos that way,
also working. And now — - 

He opens the lab door
and leads the way in. 

THE LABORATORY 

The laboratory is
large and well equipped. It is filled with benches and steel shelves holding all kinds of
equipment. Crates still unpacked stand round the walls. 

There are a couple of
TV cameras on roller tripods, large monitors, oscillographs, thermographs, a spectrum
analyser. 

Separated off from
the rest by a glazed partition is the computer section. This is the territory of Jill and
Stew. There is the usual teleprinter for data communications-a plotter of automatic graphs
... a high-speed line printer. But only a couple of the conventional tape storage units
with their heavy tape spools visible through windows. 

BROCK: This is Lab
One. Soon there’ll be two others like it to spread into. And if that’s not
enough there are five hundred acres outside to sit and think in. 

MAUDSLEY: Who else is
coming here? 

BROCK: Nobody. Just
us. 

HARGRAVES: But
it’s enormous. 

BROCK: We’ll get
bigger. I’ll expand the team with people I choose. Handpicked. The best. Same as
you’re the best. 

STEW: Flattery,
Pete.. 

MAUDSLEY: Gets him a
lot of places. 

DOW: Yeah. 

HARGRAVES: This lot. 

MAUDSLEY: Fantastic. 

DOW: Too good to be
true. 

HARGRAVES: After
North Acton, eh! 

STEW: What about the
other crowd? The washing machine? 

DOW: Here? 

BROCK: Forget it. 

DOW: That bunch in
here? 

BROCK: No! Can’t
you get it through your heads — - you’re special! Incredible as it may seem, you
are! I’ll spell it out. This — place — is — ours. It — is —
all — for — us. Because — we — are — on — the Big One! (He
surveys their faces) D’you want a pep talk? D’you really want that? 

DOW: About the Japs? 

STEW: He’s a bit
simple. Brilliant but simple. 

BROCK: Cliff —
it is always about the Japs. In ten years they are going to have us all by whatever part
of our anatomy they pick. There will be no electronics industry anywhere in the world but
theirs. Unless — 

EDDIE: I think
we’ve a good chance. 

BROCK: We’ve got
only a single chance. We’ve got to play a card so high they can’t top it. 

STEW (mock-Japanese):
Aah, so! 

BROCK: A completely
new recording medium. 

STEW: Already have in
honourable pocket. 

EDDIE: Shut up, Stew.


STEW (seriously):
What about tape, though? 

EDDIE: Tape’s
finished. 

STEW: They can still
improve — 

EDDIE: Its day is
done. 

BROCK: Stew. (He has
a spool in his hand) Magnetic tape is compact, responsive, all the sales chat-up says. (He
pulls some loose and crushes it in his fingers) Also delicate and prone to lose its
memory. 

MAUDSLEY: Like Cliff
here. 

BROCK: As you rightly
say. (He tosses the spool down) It’s time, gentlemen, for a breakthrough. Just record
me, say, the whole of Wagner’s Ring cycle inside a pin head — with instant
playback, of course — 

MAUDSLEY: Gimme till
lunchtime. 

BROCK: — and you
can name your royalties. 

EDDIE (hungrily): It
is royalties, then? 

BROCK: Forget about
bonuses, you’ll be right in there. I’ve got his word on it. 

EDDIE: Himself? 

BROCK: Yesterday.
“Just put the boot into ould Nippon!” is how he delicately phrased it. So —
if you want to be millionaires, it’s a crash programme. Find the medium and
everything else follows. 

DOW: The hardware? 

BROCK: We’d take
the lot. Computers — TV — home recording — satellites — they all
follow. Then Ryan Electrics becomes Ryan International becomes Ryan Interspatial. It I s
up to you. 

EDDIE: I love this
man’s modesty. 

BROCK: Thanks to
Eddie you’ll find all your junk in familiar order. 

EDDIE: Disorder. 

BROCK: Obviously.
Sorry. 

EDDIE: All that
string. 

BROCK: Now. Your pet
projects will go on as before — Eddie’s digital crystal and so on — but
we’re going to try something new. We’ll correlate all results together. 

MAUDSLEY: But Pete
— if there’s no connection — 

BROCK: The computer
might spot one. (Doubtful noises) Every clue counts. 

EDDIE: It puts a lot
on the computer. 

All eyes go to Jill.
She is standing by the computer, her 

expression strange,
as if she is still under the heavy apprehension that nearly made her crash the car. 

BROCK: Jill’s
ready. She’s going to try something very sophisticated. Projections —
extrapolations — a sort of randomised mix with an accelerated uncertainty principle.
How’s that? 

Jill seems to come to
herself. 

JILL: Something of
the sort. 

BROCK: You all right?


JILL: Yes, I —
(As if to take attention away from herself, she turns to the twin tape storage units) What
about data storage? Are those all we’ve got? 

BROCK: Colly.
Computer storage room. When do we get it? 

COLLINSON: Oh yes.
Well — 

BROCK: What? 

COLLINSON
(embarrassed): There’ve been — problems. 

BROCK (quietly): You
were here to solve them. (Controlling his anger) How far have they got with it? Colly, how
much have they done? 

COLLINSON (bluntly):
Nothing. 

Brock stares at him
in disbelief, then makes for the door. 

BROCK: Let me see! 

He stamps off down
the passage. Collinson looks at Jill. 

They both follow. 

THE STORAGE ROOM 

Brock throws open a
massive door. There is still a notice screwed to it reading “U.S. ARMY. STORE
ROOM”. 

The room is immense.
It could contain a small house. The walls go up 15 or 20 feet to meet the bare and rotting
beams of the roof. The walls are covered with wooden panelling that now hangs away from
them in sagging sheets. 

There is a single
window at one end, high up and half smothered by the ivy we saw outside. 

Apart from a
workmen’s trestle table, standing in the rubble, it is completely bare. A few square
yards of the rotten panelling have been torn down and thrown on the floor. Then work seems
to have been abandoned. 

Brock stands in the
middle of the room, unable to believe it. 

BROCK: It — it
simply isn’t – !Five months and not a single– ! Why didn’t you report
it? 

Collinson joins him.
Jill stays in the doorway. 

COLLINSON: I knew
there were reasons they had to finish the priority jobs. 

BROCK: Colly, this
was priority! 

COLLINSON: To be
fair, it wasn’t in phase one. 

BROCK: Refacing and
air-conditioning and wiring — ! Did they just forget it? 

COLLINSON: No. 

BROCK: What then? 

COLLINSON: Problems
with the men. They claimed it was — I don It know — a dirty job. 

BROCK: There’s
dry rot! Do they think it’s catching! Look at those panels — I could shift the
lot in half an hour! 

He grabs a swathe of
distorted panelling and peels it back. 

It splits, disclosing
shroud-like hangings of fungus. Dust scatters. Brock sneezes. 

He pulls savagely at
another section and this too rips away. More fungus — and something else. 

BROCK: Stairs. 

Jill comes to look.
The steps are little more than pegs the wall, scarcely a foot wide and very badly worn
— hollowed, sloping and uneven. 

COLLINSON: Yes, they
saw those. 

BROCK: The men? 

He tugs at the next
section of panelling. it is more resistant but it shows them enough. 

JILL: They don’t
lead anywhere. 

The steps run from
ground level to about eight feet up and then stop. 

BROCK: Surely that
wasn’t what — ? (Sourly, as he releases the panel) What else did they find? A
skeleton? 

COLLINSON: No-o. 

BROCK: Anything? 

COLLINSON: As a
matter of fact, yes. About thirty tins of Spam. 

BROCK: Spam! 

COLLINSON: And a
letter to Father Christmas. 

He nods at the
trestle table. With a comic groan Brock goes to look. There is a pile of rusty tins. He
picks one up. 

BROCK: U.S. Army
issue. 

COLLINSON: Doubt if
it’s fit now. They must have got forced in through the panelling. The Yanks used this
for a store. 

BROCK: Painted it
khaki! 

COLLINSON: Trying to
quell the rot. 

BROCK: Even then? 

COLLINSON: It was
empty before the war. When the rot gets really going like this they call it weeping.
Weeping fungus. 

Brock glares at the
membranes of rot with personal enmity. There is a piece of paper on the table — a
half disintegrated sheet that looks as if it was previously folded up in a tight wad. Jill
picks it up and tries to make out the faded scrawl. 

JILL: “Christmas
Eve...” 

COLLINSON: Oh yes,
that’s it. 

JILL: “What ...
I want for...Christmas ... 

COLLINSON: A
kid’s writing. 

His manner has
changed — tight and nervous. 

Brock suddenly
attacks the wall, kicking out a great piece of panelling. Rot and dead wood and dust go
flying. He kicks at it again, hacking more away with his foot. 

BROCK: Even the
stone’s got it! 

COLLINSON: It’s
just — very old. 

BROCK: 1880? 

COLLINSON: Ah,
that’s when they panelled it in. These walls are a lot older than the rest of the
house. They’ve just been — built onto. In fact, they must have been knocked down
and rebuilt and generally messed about a lot in the last thousand years. (Brock stares at
him) Oh, yes. The foundations might be Saxon. 

BROCK: Saxon! 

COLLINSON: Just an
amateur opinion. 

BROCK: My God —
! 

COLLINSON: Informed
amateur. 

BROCK: If you’re
right, you see what it means? (in despair) They’ll be in here — the environment
boys, the conservationists — nailing their little notices on the door and writs and
— they could stop everything! If they get on to it — (Thinking furiously) —
what about the architect? 

COLLINSON (with
contempt): That architect! 

BROCK: Didn’t he
spot it? 

COLLINSON: Not till
the day he quit. 

BROCK (a tight
smile): Right! If we go ahead fast — get everything concreted over and the machines
in — while we can! Where are the men now? 

COLLINSON: Working on
the back. 

BROCK: Come on! (In
the doorway he turns a worry, love, you’ll get your storage room! 

They hurry off along
the passage. Jill shivers. It is cold here, the chill suddenly striking. She follows. 

As the men’s
footsteps fade they seem to echo inside the room. Curiously changed, though — this is
a rapid pattering. 

The effect is so
startling that Jill spins round expecting to see another person. And finds nobody. She
forces calm on herself and makes for the door. As she reaches it the sense of another
presence behind her is overwhelming. She halts and steadies herself against the doorpost.
Quite deliberately, she turns to look. 

And sees a figure. 

It is standing high
up on the peg-like steps. The figure of a woman in black, its face hidden by arms raised
in front of it. It looks as if it is on the point of falling. Still and rigid. 

In the same moment
that the vision lasts — and it is only a moment — there is a shrill rasp in the
air. A human scream that has lost its humanity, denatured and dead. 

Then silence. The
steps empty. 

Jill twists about and
clings to the doorpost, beyond crying out. She claws her way into the passage. In the
entrance hall she can see Brock and Collinson talking to one of the builders’ men. 

JILL (hoarsely):
Peter 

He turns. As he
starts towards her she pitches forward... 

BROCK’S SUITE
— LIVING QUARTERS 

Jill is huddled on a
convertible bed. Her knees are drawn up beside her and her fists are bunched. She has come
out of the first shock into a paroxysm of violent, confused sobbing. 

Brock is trying to
calm her. 

BROCK: All right now,
all right. Jill! 

He pulls her crumpled
face round. Her eyes open but it takes her a moment to focus on him. She looks like a
child that can’t explain what hurts. Then panic rises again. 

JILL: I can’t
stay here, I’ve got to get away! Take me away! (wildly) Peter! 

She sits up, tense
and trembling, her fists held tight against her breasts and her body rigid. She is on the
brink of hysteria. 

He moves closer,
stroking her, soothing her. 

BROCK: Jill, Jill,
Jill. Easy now. (He kisses her but she stays rigid in his arms) I’m sorry. I
didn’t listen to you before. Tell me about it. 

JILL: What? 

BROCK: The accident. 

JILL: It isn’t
that. 

BROCK: Tell me. 

JILL: I — I hit
a pile of sand, that’s all. There were vans and — I couldn’t have been
watching. (Suddenly) I hate this place! I didn’t want to come here! 

BROCK: No. You
didn’t. (His face sets a little. Now he feels he knows where he is. They are on old
ground. He sits back. Her fists are still pressed tight against her body like a barrier.
He gently eases them down) Here. Dump the moist hankie. 

JILL (opening her
hand): Not — not a hankie. 

Brock takes it. 

BROCK: Oh. Father
Christmas’s letter. 

She shakes her head. 

BROCK (reading):
“What I want ... for Christmas is ... please go away. Signed Martin Tasker”.
Well. 

JILL (whispering):
Not what you’d say. 

BROCK: I don’t
know. One of my kids is like that, hates the idea of him coming down the chimney. 

JILL: It wasn’t
to Father Christmas. 

BROCK: Who, then? 

JILL: I know. I think
I know! 

Again the rising note
of hysteria. Brock hardens himself against it. He gets up. 

The room is only half
finished. it will be very luxurious indeed but at present is still a mess of hanging wires
and unopened crates. 

BROCK: How do you
like it now? They’ve done a bit since we came down that time. All the shelving and
— (He looks into the adjoining office, where a huge desk stands in a sea of unsecured
carpet, and back to her) I quite liked it even without the shelving. Didn’t you? (Her
face is unresponsive) You know what all this is about. You’re getting at me. (He
waits for a protest but there isn’t any) Mind you, I quite enjoyed your previous
ploys. “How are Christine and the kids? How are Timothy’s mumps? How’s the
dog’s toothache?” Oh my Jilly. You’re a very female one. (He sits on the
bed) I need you. I know you weren’t keen to transfer but I need you for your brain as
well — if that doesn’t sound crass but of course it does. If you’re in
doubt ask Eddie and the boys. (He strokes her forehead) What’s in there is so rare
and... valuable. (After a moment) Do it your own way. Commute home to old mummy or stay
here. Stay? (She says nothing) Sometimes, anyway. 

Jill looks him
straight in the face. She is calmer, but only by her own effort. 

JILL: I saw a ghost. 

Just for a moment
Brock’s eyes soften — then the response dies and they are hard again. He gets up
briskly. 

BROCK: Let’s get
out of here for a while. Leave Colly to fight the labour relations. 

He helps her up. when
she is on her feet he kisses her. 

JILL: Let’s go
... 

A LOCAL PUBLIC HOUSE 

The brewers’
gimmick when they face-lifted this roadside pub was ‘motoring’ . The beer
handles are gaitered gear levers, and the whole bar looks like an accessory shop. Babycham
bottles peep through spokes and steering wheels. Muffled muzak throbs. 

Any jollity is
dispelled by the BAR LADY, a genteel harridan, who forks out cold meats and pickles for
Jill and Brock. Her helper, an ungainly little countrywoman, is allowed to work the beer
engine. 

HELPER (beaming): One
Danish draught, one Super-Strong. 

BROCK: One for
yourself. 

HELPER: Ta. 

BAR LADY: No, thank
you. Are they really making poison gas up there? 

BROCK: No — we
aren’t. 

BAR LADY: It’s
what I heard. 

BROCK: Not a whiff. 

BAR LADY (wearily): I
mean germs. You know what I mean. 

Feeling Jill’s
tension rise, he puts his hand over hers. 

JILL: Do you know the
place? 

BAR LADY: I’ve
only been here a month. That’ll be — with the bread — one pound eighty pee.
(As Brock pays) I mean, it won’t do us any good. These days people don’t like
that sort of thing. 

JILL: It’s
nothing bad! 

BAR LADY
(freezingly): We all know what secret means. 

She moves away to
attend more favoured customers. The helper grimaces and lifts her glass. 

HELPER: Cheers. I
believe it’s been made very nice. 

JILL: Do you know it?


HELPER: I used to.
Well, sort of. 

JILL: You went there?


HELPER: Not actually
in. It was during the war when the Yanks was there. (She leans forward with a grotesque
confidential giggle) I was a good-time girl! 

BROCK: Hooray for
you. 

HELPER (pleased) :
Yes, well — why not? They was nice boys. And the nylons! 

JILL: Did they talk
about the house? 

HELPER: Ooh — it
was all generals and people. Some headquarters Eisenhower was there once. 

JILL: I mean —
what was it like inside? 

HELPER (puzzled): No.
Very posh, I expect. There was one boy, though — (Fondness shows) — He was a
caution. He said — now lemme think — oh dear, he had all these funny words,
y’see, he was a coloured boy. I know — guppy. He said there was guppies in the
store — that’s where he worked — 

BROCK: Guppies are
fish. Tropical. 

HELPER: Oh dear.
Duppies? 

A man in his late
twenties moves along behind the bar, aproned and carrying a crate of bottles. 

MAN: He must have
meant rats. 

HELPER: You
don’t know, Alan. 

ALAN: Taskerlands is
full of rats. We used to play up there when I was a kid. 

HELPER: Oh yes —
you and that Jackie and — 

She breaks off in
some curious embarrassment. He gives her a hard look and goes on with emphasis, as if to
prove he doesn’t mind talking about it. 

ALAN: Yes, old
Jackie. We used to do dares. 

JILL: The end room
— you know it? 

ALAN (after a
moment): Yes. Stand there in the dark, after a bit you’d hear ‘em all noising
about and squealing. 

JILL: Did you see
them? 

ALAN: What was there
to see? If they was behind the woodwork? 

He moves off with his
crate. Brock glances at Jill. She is trembling. 

JILL: Who else would
know about it? About the house? 

THE VICARAGE LIBRARY 

The vicar is in his
sixties. He is a scholar gone completely to seed. He has opened an old glass-fronted
bookcase and is searching hopelessly through the mess inside. It is crammed to bursting
with tattered journals and folders and exercise books. Bundles fall, scattering dust. 

Brock and Jill are
with him. All her tension has returned. 

VICAR: You’ve
seen the parish registers. Not many Taskers there ... among the births and marriages
and... they were not ... statistically prominent. But apart from the registers I really
don’t know — 

BROCK: We’re
wasting your time. 

JILL: No, please
— 

VICAR: It’s
quite all right, if I can only — 

JILL: I just thought
there might be something more — personal. About the family and the house. 

VICAR (opening an
exercise book): Old sermons. Now who on earth would want to hear today about... about... ?


JILL: Did you know
them? The Taskers? 

VICAR: Eh? Oh ...
they’d all gone before I came. Died out. That last one was a recluse, I believe. Now
— there must be some odds and ends from my predecessor Is time. I fancy —
somewhere here — (He suddenly turns to them with eyes brightened by a vital
recollection) You know? It came to me the other day — about pollution. It’s the
modern rediscovery of sin. The only form it can take in a materialistic world! (He is
delighted with his notion) All the rubbish and mess — that’s the new wickedness!
And they can see it! The sudden conviction of — of — of non-returnable bottles!
Eh? 

BROCK
(uncomfortably): Yes, Jill, I think — 

VICAR: Then sackcloth
and ashes. Plenty of ashes! 

BROCK: I think
we’d better get back. 

VICAR: Oh dear. 

BROCK: This —
was just a thought. 

VICAR (moving with
them to the door): Yes, well I ... Come again and p1raps by then I — 

BROCK: Thanks anyway.


VICAR: They must have
been funny people. There was something about an exorcism once — 

JILL: Exorcism! 

VICAR (shaking his
head): Now I can’t approve of that. I know it’s in the prayer-book, but —
oh, dear, dear! 

JILL: You do mean
— laying a ghost? Her intensity catches at Brock. 

VICAR: It was either
there or ... now was it? Ah! (He seems to change his mind) I may be maligning them. 

JILL: When was it? 

VICAR: Oh —
long, long ago. (Then he brightens out of his vagueness and happily remounts his
hobby-horse. He beams) I feel I’m obsolete but not sinful — I cause so little
pollution. Apart from tea-leaves — and my hens eat those up — 

OUTSIDE TASKERLANDS
HOUSE — DUSK 

Jill’s Austin
pulls out of the corner behind the building materials, backfiring repeatedly. Brock holds
up his hand to halt her and runs round behind the car to kick the sand out of her exhaust
pipe. He waves her on. Engine running more smoothly, she turns away down the drive. 

Brock watches her go.
His face is serious. He has sent her off early. The other cars still stand parked. After a
moment he starts towards the caravan. There is a light in its window. 

INSIDE THE CARAVAN 

Brock looks in and
finds Collinson at work with two fingers on a portable typewriter by the light of an angle
poise lamp. 

BROCK: How did it go?


COLLINSON: Well
— they’ve made a start, clearing the old panelling out. I’m just making a
report. (As Brock glances back at the house) I’d leave them to it. They were
decidedly tricky. 

BROCK: Any reason
given? 

COLLINSON: No. They
just don’t like it. Come in — have a drink. 

BROCK: Good idea. 

Collinson clears a
space for him. The whole caravan is tightly packed with files and office equipment as well
as personal things, but method keeps everything in place. He produces whisky and glasses
from a tiny cupboard, ice from an equally tiny fridge. 

COLLINSON: How’s
Jill now? 

BROCK: —
I’ve sent her home. 

COLLINSON: Just as
well. A nasty shake-up. 

BROCK: It wasn’t
just the car. 

COLLINSON: Oh? 

BROCK (after a
moment): Bloody woman! 

He sits frowning.
Collinson watches him. 

COLLINSON
(carefully): I’ve only admired her from afar but... I’d say she’s the type
that ... hurts easily. 

Brock seems not to
hear him. So he goes on pouring out the drinks. 

BROCK: Colly —
were there any rats? 

COLLINSON: Where? 

BROCK: In the end
room? 

COLLINSON: No. 

BROCK: No sign
there’d been any? 

COLLINSON: Rats
wouldn’t have left that Spam. They’d have chewed those tins open in no time. 

BROCK: They could do
that? 

COLLINSON: The teeth
of a hungry rat Here — 

He passes Brock his
glass. 

BROCK: Cheers. (He
glances at Collinson’s report) I’ve got some work to finish too. I might stop
over tonight. 

COLLINSON: Break in
the Director’s suite a bit? (Brock nods absently. Collinson drinks and watches him,
noticing his quietness) I was up in town last week. Dropped in on the legal department.
One or two things I wanted to clear up about the house here — covenants and so on.
They’ve got boxes and boxes of stuff — passed over by the trustees, I suppose. I
brought one back. (Brock is still showing no attention. Collinson digs out an ancient
document box and squeaks it open) One or two curiosities in it. How d’you like this?
(He takes out a document) Application for the holding of a service of exorcism. 

BROCK: What! 

COLLINSON: August
1892. 

BROCK: Let me see
— 

He grabs the
document. Collinson follows it with a thin ledger. 

COLLINSON: Full
record of the alleged haunting. Evidence, I suppose. 

BROCK: Louisa Hanks
— 

COLLINSON: That was
her. There’s even a report of her death. 

He passes Brock a
newspaper cutting. 

BROCK: 1890 — 

COLLINSON: Two years
before. 

BROCK: “Sad
mishap at Taskerlands. Louisa Hanks, an under maid in the employ of Mr Horace Tasker,
yesterday fell to her death from a flight of steps while engaged about her duties”.
That’s all. 

COLLINSON: Pretty
good press for an under-maid in those days. 

Brock stares at him. 

BROCK: And they
thought that she — ? 

COLLINSON: More than
thought. They kept a note of all the times and dates, went on doing it for ages
afterwards. You see, the ghost-laying didn’t take. 

Brock looks from the
ledger to the document. to the cutting ... back to Collinson’s steady face. 

BROCK: Have you seen
it? 

Collinson shakes his
head. 

COLLINSON: Only
heard. 

BROCK’S SUITE
— OFFICE, NIGHT 

Brock is walking
uneasily about his office. Everything in him resists the idea. on the other hand — 

He goes to the window
and looks down into the dark forecourt. He can see the lighted windows of the caravan.
more by way of fidgeting than from any urgent need to communicate, he picks up the phone
and presses buttons. 

BROCK: Christine ...
look, honey, I’m still at this place, I won’t be home...Oh, the move, various
buffooneries. It’s all right, I’ve eaten. All I should. How’s whatsisname,
the horse ... Yes, Chuffy... it was that hoof? Aha... Oh, good. Love to the kids, then. 

He puts the phone
down. And sits frowning. And comes to a decision. He pulls his jacket on and hurries out. 

ENTRANCE HALL AND
PASSAGE 

The stairway that
descends beside the lift shaft is narrow, lit by temporary fixtures. 

Brock comes down. At
the foot of the stairs he stands by the deserted reception desk and listens. Not a sound. 

He moves slowly along
the dim passage, putting his feet down as quietly as he can without making a performance
of it. The door of the storage room is shut. He stands by it and listens again. 

For a few seconds
there is no sound ... then the same rapid pattering Jill heard, that might come from the
feet of a very small human or a very large rat. 

He puts his hand to
the doorknob. In the same instant there is a cry — again the same that Jill
experienced, a hoarse rasp. It is almost as if he had caused it. 

He instinctively
takes his hand from the knob for a moment. Then he grips it firmly. . no sound ... and
throws the door open. As he fumbles for the light switch there is a little rush of noises
... the pattering, the cry, very faint. 

At the click of the
switch it all ceases. 

He looks round the
storage room. He sees nothing move. A quantity of panelling has been ripped out by the
workmen and left on the floor. 

Then the sounds come
again. The pattering — and, curiously close, the cry: A short, denatured screech,
almost in his ear. 

It comes again...and
again. 

Brock backs away. 

THE LABORATORY —
DAY 

Coloured indicator
lamps are flashing on a “breadboard” — a rough experimental lash-up of
electronic components and printed circuits. Maudsley is making adjustments to the controls
on a temporary panel, while Dow takes notes. 

Eddie Holmes has one
eye to an optical tube with many large-handled but delicate adjusters. It is supported in
a frame that is gripped tight in a vice. A couple of feet in front of him, clamped to the
same frame, is a kind of crystalline box, a thing of exquisite complexity. 

Eddie is peering into
the heart of the box. 

EDDIE: Try going down
two nanoseconds. 

MAUDSLEY: Down two. 

Eddie’s other
eye is open too but trained to ignore that it sees. It ignores the lab door opening and
Brock coming in, 

followed by Jill. 

BROCK: I’ve got
something to tell you all. (Eddie looks up with both eyes. He rubs them. Brock looks
deliberately round the room, waiting for faces to lift from apparatus) We’ve got a
ghost! 

For a moment, nobody
knows how to take the announcement. Whether he is expecting a laugh or not. 

EDDIE: I’m glad
to hear it, Peter. 

MAUDSLEY: Every home
should have one. 

HARGRAVES: Every
stately home. 

EDDIE: Had me
worried, the lack of class. 

Collinson comes in.
Brock turns to him. 

COLLINSON: Not a
chance. 

BROCK: Talk to them
yourself? 

COLLINSON: I did.
Push it any further and there’ll be a general walk-out. 

BROCK: That’s
it, then. 

He turns to the
others. They are even more puzzled. 

EDDIE: What’s
this about, Peter? 

STEW: Did you say
ghost? 

BROCK: Silly word,
don’t be put off. We could call it a phenomenon or something. Anyway it’s real.
It’s got possession of the computer storage room and it’s stopped all work
there. 

COLLINSON: The men
won’t go back. 

STEW: They were going
on about something in the canteen — 

DOW: Yes. I thought
it was the muck. 

STEW: I wondered. 

BROCK: Whatever it is
in there I’ve heard it. Colly’s heard it. And Jill’s seen it. 

EDDIE: Jill — 

STEW: That what got
you? 

JILL: Yes. 

STEW: What did you
see? 

JILL: A woman. 

MAUDSLEY: Oh, come
off it! 

EDDIE: She isn’t
kidding. 

BROCK: None of us
are. 

They don’t know
how to react. Maudsley gives a nervous giggle. 

STEW: Let’s go
in there 

HARGRAVES: Why not?
I’m ready — 

BROCK: All right.
Thanks for the enthusiasm because I intend to use it. 

STEW: Eh? 

EDDIE: What d1you
mean? 

BROCK: They once had
a go at it with bell, book and candle. Well — we’re rather better equipped. (He
lets this sink in) I’m going to chuck the lot at it. 

EDDIE: Go after it
with — electronics and — and — 

BROCK: Find out
exactly what makes it — well, it doesn’t tick, it patters its feet and
screeches. Everything we get Jill’s going to program in the computer. 

EDDIE: Analyse a
spook? 

BROCK: Say
it’s...a mass of data waiting for a correct interpretation. Nobody’s ever
managed it. I think we might. 

Collinson glances at
Jill’s tight, strained face. 

COLLINSON: Can you
spare the time? 

BROCK: No choice,
Colly. It’s got us stuck... 

INSIDE THE STORAGE
ROOM — DAY 

Something is hurled
through from the passage, to land twisting like a heavy snake on the floor. it is a heavy
cable with a multi-outlet head. 

MAUDSLEY: Ta. 

He plugs in a large
tape-recorder. Nearby, Dow is sorting out microphones, including a parabolic reflector. 

DOW: Which mike,
Pete? 

BROCK: Stereo. (To
Jill) Where did you see it? 

JILL: Near the top of
the steps. 

The panelling has
been stripped from the end wall, exposing the steps, and from about half the remainder of
the room. It reveals a bare stone wall with a row of large joist holes about half-way up. 

BROCK: Where she fell
off. 

JILL: There must have
been an upper floor. Where those holes are. D’you think she was going up to it? 

COLLINSON: No. This
was a total ruin when Tasker bought. It’s all in the deeds. He just roofed it and
patched it and made it part of his house. A sort of folly. 

JILL: Then —
where was she going? 

BROCK: Probably a big
aspidistra at the top and she had to water it. 

JILL: And died. 

BROCK: Odd, that.
You’d have thought she’d just break a leg or something. It’s not high
enough. 

JILL: High enough for
poor Louisa. And then... they panelled the place over. To hide it all. 

They are all watching
her. Rational by temperament and training, they are nevertheless uneasy in this place.
There is something about its atmosphere that disturbs. 

EDDIE: There’s a
big echo in here. We ought to measure it. Something to make a loud noise with? (At the
table) What’s all this? 

JILL: Spam. 

EDDIE: Eh? Somebody
feeding the ghost? 

He grins at her but
the idea isn’t funny. Tt hits her. Items click together in her mind. 

JILL (almost a
whisper): Perhaps they were. 

Eddie thumps a rusty
tin on the table but rejects the idea. 

He goes on testing
possible objects while Dow listens through his headphones. HARGRAVES points the parabolic
reflector hopefully at the steps and locks it off. 

HARGRAVES: Now we
wait. Think I’ll get my coat. 

MAUDSLEY: Get mine,
will you? 

STEW (giving them a
sour look): Oh spare us. 

HARGRAVES: What?
STEW: This act, the ghostly shivers. 

HARGRAVES: No act. 

MAUDSLEY: It’s
just — chilly. Don’t you feel it? 

STEW: Do you mind! 

Then he notices Jill.
She is trembling, tightening her arms round herself. 

Eddie has improvised
a clapper board out of two pieces of batten from a packing case. He smacks them sharply
together. The percussion echoes through the room. 

EDDIE: How’s
that? 

DOW: Okay, I’ll
take it. (He switches the recorder on and speaks into the microphone) Testing room
wavelength. Take one. 

Eddie produces
another clash of metal ... it echoes noticeably ... then, after a few seconds, another
percussion. 

JILL: Stop it. Oh
stop it — ! 

BROCK: That’s
enough, Eddie. 

Through their very
voices comes the harsh rasping screech. It repeats several times in rapid succession. 

There is wild
excitement. The sound seems to break out in half a dozen places. They twist and turn to
locate it. Then it is gone — in a single rapid patter of footsteps. 

They are left staring
at each other. 

HARGRAVES: That was
it! That was it! 

BROCK: It was by the
steps. 

HARGRAVES (pointing
down the room): No, over that way. 

EDDIE: It was by the
door. 

MAUDSLEY: No, it
wasn’t. 

EDDIE: Distinctly. 

They are all arguing
and pointing; almost a nervous reaction. 

STEW: What did you
hear? 

EDDIE: It was over
there! I’m not crazy! 

MAUDSLEY: You could
hardly hear it. 

EDDIE: It was
deafening! 

BROCK: It wasn’t
loud. 

EDDIE: Not loud? I
heard it! 

BROCK: Just close. 

HARGRAVES: Hi,
that’s right. 

BROCK: No perspective
on it. 

STEW (to Maudsley):
What did you hear? 

MAUDSLEY (shrugging):
Not much. 

STEW: I didn’t
hear anything. 

JILL: I saw her.
Again. 

This stops the
argument. 

BROCK: Same place? 

JILL: No, there. (She
points to the middle of the room. Instinctively they turn to look at the spot) Black
clothes. 

EDDIE: Solid? 

JILL: Yes, quite
solid. 

BROCK: Was she
moving? 

JILL: I think so.
There was something the matter. The way she moved — 

BROCK: How? 

JILL: Sort of —
twisting. 

Brock looks at the
others. Nobody has anything to add. 

BROCK: Let’s
hear it again. Cliff — 

Dow turns the
recorder spools back and switches on. 

DOW’S VOICE
(recorded): Testing room wavelength. Take one. 

They hear the test
sounds Eddie made and the two other voices cutting in. 

JILL’S VOICE:
Stop it. Oh stop it — 

BROCK’S VOICE:
That’s enough, Eddie. 

Then — silence,
apart from small human exclamations. 

EDDIE: She’s not
there. She didn’t record. 

DOW: I heard her in
my headphones. I don’t get this. 

EDDIE: Let me check
that thing. 

He crouches by the
recorder. Uneasy glances are exchanged. 

HARGRAVES: She got
away... 

THE LABORATORY —
DAY 

More apparatus is
being wheeled out of the laboratory towards the storage room: A TV monitor, TV cameras,
thermographs. Jill slumps into her chair at the programming desk. Collinson is with her. 

JILL: It’s the
screaming. 

COLLINSON: Yes. 

JILL: Could you hear
it from the caravan? 

COLLINSON: No, only
if I went to the room. But I — well, I just can’t take a woman’s screams. 

JILL: Soft-hearted. 

COLLINSON: I was with
my wife in a car crash. 

JILL: Killed? 

COLLINSON: No. We
divorced. Might have had something to do with it. This is even worse in a way. 

JILL: Worse? 

COLLINSON: A living
person in that pain, you can try to help them. Here — you can’t. (Jill covers
her face) , — I’m going to be very old and stuffy and say drop the whole thing. 

JILL: No. 

COLLINSON: If you
really see something it must mean — extra sensitivity. 

JILL: I’m a
medium? 

COLLINSON: That makes
it sound — 

JILL: Knocks on the
table, one for yes, two for no. 

COLLINSON: I’m
serious. 

She sees the concern
in his face. Then Brock arrives with Stew. 

BROCK (to Stew): Get
all Colly’s data on file. And stand by to take real time from next door. 

STEW (switching on
his teleprinter): Okay. 

BROCK: Jill, can you
start blocking something out? Heuristic stuff, really wild? (He glances at the tape
storage units) Those won’t touch it. Book time on the central computer. If you need
it, go through to Chicago. All in code, Colly, it stays our little secret. 

COLLINSON: Who pays? 

BROCK: Himself. Sure
held love it if he knew! (Collinson passes Stew the old ledger and a plastic folder of
neatly typed notes) Full record of the first five years from 1890. Also the past six
months. 

STEW: What about the
bit in between? The odd eighty years? 

BROCK: We’ve got
a witness ... 

HALF AN HOUR LATER IN
THE STORAGE ROOM 

Alan is standing in
the doorway of the storage room. He looks thoroughly bewildered. The room seems to be full
of apparatus. Blank monitor screens flicker. Eddie and the others are tending and
adjusting and improvising. 

ALAN: Cameras?
What’s all this stuff? What’s it for? 

BROCK: I told you
— ignore it. 

ALAN: I didn’t
want to come. 

BROCK: A few simple
questions. That won’t take long. (Alan doesn’t move from the doorway) Remember
this room? 

ALAN: I was just a
kid. 

BROCK: YOU did come
in here? 

ALAN: I suppose so. 

BROCK: You’re
not sure? 

ALAN: Well, I did,
then 

As if to prove it, he
comes forward now. 

BROCK: How often? 

ALAN (evasively): We
— we knew we weren’t rightly meant — 

BROCK: How many
times? 

ALAN: I dunno. 

BROCK: In a year,
say? 

ALAN: Ten times. A
dozen. 

BROCK: You said
between 1952 and 1955. 

ALAN: Yes. 

BROCK: Maybe a total
of thirty visits? (Alan nods. Brock turns to the nearest microphone) Get that, Stew? 

INSIDE THE LABORATORY


Stew and Jill are
working at the computer. Stew leans across the teleprinter desk to a microphone. 

STEW: I got it. 

BROCK’S VOICE
(through speaker): Fills in the model a bit. 

The teleprinter keys
rattle beneath Stew’s fingers. 

INSIDE THE STORAGE
ROOM 

Brock turns back to
Alan. 

BROCK: And you heard
— rats? 

ALAN: Sometimes. 

BROCK: Only
sometimes? 

ALAN: Nearly every
time, if we waited. 

INSIDE THE LABORATORY


BROCK’S VOICE
(through speaker): Nearly every time. 

Jill looks at Stew.
He nods and keeps on typing it in. 

INSIDE THE STORAGE
ROOM 

ALAN: We made these
dares out of it, see? Old rats are dirty customers. They’ll go for you. We used to
fool about all over this house. Smash it up a bit you know. 

BROCK: You’re a
country lad. You know the sound rats make. 

ALAN (ignoring this):
I reckon we must have bust all the windows. Real bad, we were. Used to see who could find
a pane of glass still whole and — smash’ Cost you a lot to put tem back, did it?
(He is talking faster, suddenly urgent) I better go now. There’ll be trouble if l
don’t get back. That old cow down there, she — (He breaks off, listening. The
others notice something too. Maudsley shivers. Dow tenses and makes a dive for the
parabolic reflector. All of them sense the chill: Brock ... Eddie...Alan) I reckon
I’ll just get along. 

But he has hardly
turned to go when there is a rapid pattering ... a single rasping cry. 

INSIDE THE LABORATORY


No sound comes
through the speaker but Jill reacts. 

JILL (turning to
Stew): It’s there! Can’t you hear it? 

INSIDE THE STORAGE
ROOM 

The screech comes
again and again. 

Alan stands paralysed
as Eddie and the others try to bring their apparatus to bear. Cameras are swung on their
tripods. microphones scan the room. 

Alan stands staring
at Brock. Suddenly he cracks. With a strangled exclamation he turns and bolts. He collides
with Maudsley. He pushes Dow out of his way, trips over a cable and falls against a
thermograph tripod. He goes down with it. Then he is crawling towards the doorway, frantic
with terror. 

THE ENTRANCE HALL 

Alan drags himself
along the passage, trying to regain his feet But blood is spilling from a cut above one
eye and he look. half stunned —only driven on by animal fear. 

As he sways against
the wall Jill throws the lab door open. He jerks away from the sudden movement. He
stumbles past the reception desk and the pop-eyed sergeant — and drops to his knees,
trying to wipe the blood out of his eyes. As Jill catches him up he peers round to see who
or what it is. 

ALAN: Don’t want
to be — like Jackie — 

Brock appears in the
passage, to find Jill crouching by Alan and the sergeant running to help. 

BROCK: All right.
It’s over. 

SERGEANT: What
happened, sir? 

BROCK: Get some water
— whisky — anything — (As the sergeant hurries off, he makes for Alan) You
never went into that room. Did you? 

ALAN: I did. 

BROCK: You’re
lying. 

JILL: Peter — 

BROCK: You stayed at
the door and listened. You knew what it was. 

JILL: Leave him
alone! 

BROCK: You were
afraid of it. 

JILL: Why not? Why
shouldn’t he be? It’s a normal human reaction. He’s the sane one!
We’re the freaks! 

Brock turns quickly
down the passage. 

INSIDE THE STORAGE
ROOM 

Dow is playing a tape
recording back and getting only a confusion of bumps and scuffles and shouts. He looks up
as Brock returns, and shakes his head. 

Eddie is watching a
wildly swinging playback image on a monitor screen. 

EDDIE (turning to
Brock): Nothing. 

Alan’s panic has
brought something to the surface in them all. He has acted out the secret fear they
suppress, and it needs more effort to keep a rational view of this unrecordable thing. 

THE ENTRANCE HALL 

The sergeant had
brought water in a jug, and a glass. Alan has drunk some. Jill is washing the cut on his
face. 

JILL: What happened
to Jackie? 

ALAN: Eh? 

JILL: You said just
now — 

ALAN: We never done
nothing to him. It was the door got stuck. That door. 

JILL: He was inside
the room? 

ALAN (nodding): We
never meant — we couldn’t help it, could we? (His face is suddenly suffused with
guilt) He’s all right, old Jackie. 

JILL: Did he ... see
it? 

ALAN (after a
moment): He made out it spoke to him. And then ... the others come. 

JILL (chilled):
Others? 

ALAN: Just his talk,
see. 

JILL: What happened
to him? 

ALAN: He’s all
right. Got this job, hasn’t he? 

JILL: Can I meet him?


ALAN: What for? He
don’t remember. (She stares at him) They took him up the County. 

JILL: Where? 

ALAN: The County. You
know. They put him right. They can do that. He don’t care a button, he just laughs.
All the time. He’s all right. 

She can say nothing.
Seeing Brock returning, Alan moves off abruptly and heads for the outer door. 

BROCK (calling): Wait
a minute — I’ll get a car to take you — 

JILL (fiercely): Let
him go! 

Then Alan has gone.
They look at each other. Brock is showing the same strain as the rest of his team. 

The phone rings on
the reception desk, grating raw nerves. 

SERGEANT (answering
it): Reception ... Yes, he is. (To Brock) Mr Ryan’s office. 

It is like a cold
douche. Brock takes the phone. 

BROCK: Brock ... Oh
... Helen, my love, how are you?...Yes, we’re settling in nicely... (Alarmed)
McAlister? But —that’s all been settled, there’s no question of —
there’s no room for him here!...(Alarm subsiding) Talk to him? Well ... I just
don’t want to see the man, I’m in the middle of an experiment. Look, is he
there? (He manages a grisly jocularity) Himself, th’ould grey widow maker? ... I see,
when’s he back?...All right, then, under duress. Tomorrow. ‘Bye. (He puts the
phone down) Hell! 

JILL: Experiment... 

THE LABORATORY —
DAY 

A display screen
flickers. Tiny flicks of blue light jump up and hold, building into an irregular
graph-like pattern. 

JILL: I don’t
know what you’d call that. The time since she died. 

BROCK: Quasi-life. 

JILL: All right, her
quasi-life. During it she must have made eight thousand appearances, minimum. 

BROCK: Sound only? 

JILL: Yes. In vision,
about a tenth as many. 

Eddie and the others
are gathering round to watch. There is a curious tension growing in them, a sense of the
rational put under severe strain. 

EDDIE: Sounds a hell
of a lot. 

JILL: Spread over all
those years, it isn’t. And there’s a cyclic factor. Bursts of activity. 

She indicates the
peaks of the display. 

BROCK: 1905 looks a
good year. All round there. 

JILL: The time of the
letter. 

BROCK: Yes ... it
could have been. 

STEW: What letter? 

BROCK: One to Father
Christmas except that it wasn’t. 

JILL: From Martin
Tasker aged 8. Later to die a recluse. 

Brock moves aside for
the others to inspect the display. 

BROCK: See them?
Patches of concentrated haunting. 

EDDIE: Let’s
scrap that word. 

BROCK: Haunt? 

EDDIE: Yes. 

MAUDSLEY: It blows
Eddie’s mind. 

EDDIE: It gets in the
way. Like the jokey talk. 

MAUDSLEY: Saw a ghost
eating toast Halfway up a lamp post! 

EDDIE (rounding on
him): Shut up! 

The tension has
thickened. 

BROCK: Eddie’s
right. Let’s cut out all the loaded words. Ghost ... spook ... apparition ...
phantom. 

EDDIE: Supernatural. 

BROCK: Yes,
that’s a beauty. Spectre...wraith ... spirit. 

HARGRAVES: Like a
rollcall 

BROCK: This
isn’t a little shade that couldn’t get into heaven because the pearly gates were
shut. It’s something else, something interesting. 

A tiny silence. 

JILL: You don’t
want her to be alive. 

EDDIE: Do you think
it is? 

JILL: No. 

EDDIE: Well, then
— 

JILL: I might be
wrong. 

BROCK: Is anybody
religious? 

JILL: I don’t
mean that. Just — respect. For her, I suppose. 

MAUDSLEY: Old Louisa?


JILL: She wasn’t
old, she was nineteen. 

Brock gives her a
long hard look. 

BROCK: You’ve
demolished her! I know you, love, I know how your mind works. You’re on the track of
something that serves her up as a very dry dish indeed — and you feel funny about it.
Come on. Give! 

JILL (hesitantly):
It’s just the first rough model. (She flips a switch. A wide coil of paper chatters
and spills from the line printer) I took the sudden coldness as basic. A temperature drop
of at least three degrees or we wouldn’t notice it. 

EDDIE: Fair enough. 

JILL: Taking the
volume of air in that room — and varying times from ten to ninety seconds — what
we get is a power flow between 20 and 200 kilowatts a minute. 

EDDIE: A heat pump. 

STEW: A furnace in
reverse! 

Brock studies the
print-out. 

JILL: Peter you see
what’s coming out there? Heat drawn rapidly from the surroundings and concentrated. 

EDDIE: Ionisation? 

BROCK: Hot spots
forming in the air. 

EDDIE: Like —
fireballs. 

BROCK: Converting
into other forms of energy — sound waves — light ... (doubtfully) It’d be
quite a process. Crude energy forming itself into regular, recognisable patterns. I
don’t know.. . 

EDDIE: Let’s
make a practical start. Search for these — hot spots, see if they exist. 

STEW (amused): Hot
spots. 

MAUDSLEY: Ay, ay,
Eddie. 

DOW: Dirty old man. 

EDDIE (eagerly):
We’ve got heat sensors — we can do it. Two stages — a wide scan, then home
in. It’s the crossover stage — we can improvise there — (Already on the
move, he turns impatiently) Come on, then! 

DOW (as he follows):
Hot spots. 

MAUDSLEY: Carry me to
the Kasbah. 

Jill watches them go,


JILL: Well, Eddie
buys it ... 

INSIDE THE STORAGE
ROOM — DAY 

A thermograph
detector is being slowly panned on a tripod by Maudsley. Eddie and the others are setting
up black boxes improvised out of used canteen containers, with trailing wire and small
lamps sprouting. Eddie places one on the top step. 

EDDIE: Early warning.
Any quick temperature change — this lamp comes on. Half a dozen altogether, that
should cover the — 

Turning to point the
others out to Brock, standing below, he nearly slips off the worn steps. 

BROCK: Watch it! 

EDDIE (steadying
himself): Following in Louisa’s footsteps! 

BROCK: One’s
enough... 

INSIDE THE LABORATORY


Stew and Jill are
working slowly through a data routine. 

STEW: I don’t
buy it either. I’ve never felt cold in there. 

Jill breaks off and
swivels to face him. 

JILL: Never once? 

STEW: Not a
goose-pimple. 

JILL: But —
you’re skinny. You’re a natural shiverer. 

STEW: Yeah. Wrap up
warm, Stew, me mum always says. (He frowns at his work) Struck another bug. 

JILL: Okay. Re-run. 

Stew presses keys.
The teleprinter starts typing out its data so far. Brock comes in. 

BROCK: How’s it
going? Trying more variables? 

JILL: There are some
we missed. 

BROCK: Such as? 

JILL: The strength of
people’s reactions. 

BROCK: To it? 

JILL:
Everybody’s is different. One hears hardly at all. Why? 

BROCK: It’s what
you’d expect. Strength of eyesight or hearing. 

JILL: What about
Stew? 

STEW: I still
don’t get a thing. 

BROCK: Okay,
you’re ghostproof. Like colourblind. 

JILL: Good. I’m
running a fresh program. I’m going to put him in it. 

BROCK: What? 

JILL: I’m
running Stew in it as a parameter. 

STEW: Fame at last. 

BROCK: What’s
the idea? 

JILL: He’s
significant. 

BROCK: How? 

STEW: Don’t mind
me. 

But Jill’s
intensity grips Brock. 

JILL: Suppose ...
Stew was your only witness. In that case, would she ... walk? D’you see what I mean?
Would — she — walk — for — him? 

Brock begins to get
it ... 

INSIDE THE STORAGE
ROOM 

Rapid footsteps
patter in the storage room. This time they seem to run the whole length of it. 

Maudsley swings a
thermograph scanner wildly, trying to follow the sound. Eddie scrambles to help him. 

Dow is aiming the
parabolic microphone in another direction. 

Brock and HARGRAVES
are busy with more thermographs. But all the monitor screens fed by these machines remain
blank. 

Jill comes into the
doorway with Stew. 

A harsh rasping
squeal. The footsteps break into half a dozen crossing patterns 

Suddenly Jill sees
it: A black figure at the foot of the steps, clawing its way up as if in slow motion,
somehow almost paralysed. 

JILL: Look! HARGRAVES
sees it too. 

HARGRAVES (pointing):
There it is! (Brock abandons his thermograph. He sees nothing. The steps are empty) It was
there! Right there! Sort of creeping! You must have seen her! 

He runs to the spot
as if he expects to find some trace and turns to them, baffled. 

BROCK: Just you and
Jill. 

EDDIE (bitterly): No
warning! (He snatches up one of his black boxes and breathes noisily, angrily, on the
element. It instantly lights up) Oh, it works now! 

He shakes the thing
until the contents rattle. 

Brock looks round.
Stew is still standing in the doorway. Meeting Brock’s eyes, he shakes his head.
Brock turns to Jill. She is standing stiffly, controlling herself with an effort. 

JILL: I saw her face
this time. She’s frightened...! 

BROCK’S SUITE
— LIVING QUARTERS, NIGHT 

Jill sits hunched
over a drink. Brock is getting one for himself. 

JILL: She’s
running from something. 

BROCK: The footsteps.


JILL: Always running.


BROCK: Probably old
Tasker coming to pinch her bum. Three times round the table and the girl is mine, ha, ha. 

JILL (emotionally):
She died! 

BROCK: It’s
really getting to you. (That does it. She rubs and dabs at her face as tears start
streaming)...Jill. 

JILL: Oh, Peter
— to be afraid like that! 

He sits and pulls her
to him. She is shaking. 

BROCK: Are you
afraid? Of all this? 

JILL: No. I
don’t think so — 

BROCK: What, then? 

JILL (with
difficulty): It’s — the thought of it. Of there being nothing left of you but
— just enough to repeat the worst moment of your life over and over again! 

BROCK: That
doesn’t happen. 

JILL: But if it did
— if she knew — 

BROCK: Look, love, we
talked about it. We all agreed — 

JILL: Could there be
anything there that knows? 

BROCK: Not in my
book. 

JILL: Just — a
dead mechanism? 

BROCK: That’s
all that’s left. 

JILL: It’s
horrible. But it’s better than knowing. I couldn’t bear it if she knew! 

He strokes her,
gentling her. 

BROCK: All right,
love. 

He kisses her but she
is still tense and obsessed. 

JILL: To be so alone
— 

She looks at him with
horror behind her eyes. 

BROCK (firmly): All
right, that’s it. You’ve said it and got it over. Your moment of superstition. 

JILL: It wasn’t.


She is calmer now.
For a moment or two longer he keeps his arms round her. The tension is lessening, but
slowly. 

BROCK: What you need
is another drink. (He picks up her empty glass. As he goes to fill it the phone rings) Oh,
hell! (He tries to ignore it but it goes on ringing. He answers it) Hello? Christine,
darling, I meant to ring before but you know – problems. Well, something slightly
interesting for once. I’ll tell you all about it when I ... Probably tomorrow . (Jill
is on her feet. He flaps a detaining hand at her) Kids in bed are they? ... Is she? Give
her my biggest kiss ... A what? A drawing? I can’t wait. (Jill makes for the door.
His back is turned and he doesn’t notice) Listen, about Chuffy...was it inside the
hoof? ... What did the vet say... ? 

Jill slips out. 

THE STORAGE ROOM
— NIGHT 

Jill slowly opens the
door of the storage room. A face turns to her. It is Stew, sitting there alone by the dim
flicker of blank monitor screens. Keeping a self-imposed watch. 

He shrugs. 

JILL (after a
moment): She’s about. I can tell... 

BROCK’S SUITE
— OFFICE, NEXT DAY 

The Sergeant opens
the door. 

SERGEANT: Mr
McAlister, sir. 

McAlister comes in
— a tall, talentless mechanic of relentlessly honest demeanour. 

McALISTER: Hello,
Brock. (The hand he extends is, disturbingly, bright scarlet. So is his other one) Excuse
the red hands, I’ve been doing dye tests, in very inadequate conditions. (They shake,
very briefly) You’ve never been to my place at Slough. Hardly more than a shed. 

Brock indicates a
chair. McAlister sits — sinking down and down almost to floor level. 

McALISTER (cannily):
The interview chair. 

BROCK: Do the tests
yourself? 

McALISTER: All of
them. 

BROCK: Is that so? 

McALISTER (proudly):
I make it a rule. 

BROCK: Never
delegate? 

McALISTER:
Responsibility? Never. 

BROCK: No. 

McALISTER: I’m a
plain nuts-and-bolts man. 

BROCK: A what? 

McALISTER: My own
hands. 

BROCK (thoughtfully):
Held like that. 

McALISTER: Who? 

BROCK: Old Patrick.
He was a...nuts-and-bolts man himself once. Started with electric irons. 

McALISTER: I know. 

BROCK: Of course you
do. A good ploy. 

McALISTER: I
don’t like that word. 

BROCK: Gambit, then. 

MCALISTER
(guardedly): He said we should have a talk. 

BROCK: We’re
having it. 

McALISTER:
Meaningful. 

BROCK: No. 

McALISTER: Eh? 

BROCK: Not
meaningful. Since we’re being fussy about words, that’s not one he uses. 

A tiny unstated bluff
is being called. It has to do with who knows Ryan better. It is resolved by McAlister
suddenly 

looking humbler. 

McALISTER: Brock
— I need more working space. This place is enormous. Now if I could just look round
it — 

BROCK (stiffening):
I’m sorry. 

McALISTER: Some rooms
you’re not using — 

BROCK: Not a chance. 

McALISTER: Look
— let me tell you about my project, then you’ll see — 

BROCK: I know. The
world’s machine. 

McALISTER: Domestic
— 

BROCK: Domestic. The
first to sort its own wash and program itself. The first to sniff out items with nonfast
dye and reject ’em. Etcetera, etcetera. 

McALISTER (red hands
raised): It’ll do all that! 

BROCK: When it works.


McALISTER: It will! 

BROCK: When it does
... that triumph of over-sophistication will cost nine hundred nicker per machine! Just to
make! 

McALISTER:
That’s a lie! 

BROCK: I’ve seen
the costings. 

McALISTER: Where? Who
showed them to you? 

BROCK: Guess.
(Brogue) Ah, we’ll not beat ould Nippon with the like of this, at all, at all! 

McALISTER (choking):
He wouldn’t say that. 

BROCK: He did. He saw
the point. This place is for fundamental research, not for patching duds. 

McALISTER: He —
he wouldn’t have sent me down here — 

BROCK: For me to tell
you. Yes, he would. He’s got a kind heart. I haven’t. Right — chat over. 

He goes to the door. 

McALISTER: No, listen
to me — 

BROCK: No more time. 

McALISTER: Please
— 

He follows Brock out.


THE ENTRANCE HALL 

McAlister follows
Brock down the stairs. 

McALISTER: You
can’t possibly use all this — 

BROCK: I can. I need
every inch. 

McALISTER: It’s
like Buckingham Palace — 

BROCK: For a
top-class research team. You see, I’ll delegate everything to them. They’ll
carry out all tests. That’s the right way. (He glances down the passage. The door of
the storage room is shut and Eddie is on guard outside it, ostensibly unpacking something)
Now, you’ll excuse me if I don’t show you to your car. Sergeant, will you please
— 

As if under escort,
the glowering McAlister makes for the front door with the sergeant. Brock turns to the
lab. Eddie joins him. 

THE LABORATORY 

An expectant group is
already gathered round the computer, where Jill is completing her first model of the new
program. 

JILL: The nature of
observed reality. That’s what this program takes in. 

MAUDSLEY: Old
philosophy stuff. 

JILL: It might apply
to her. 

BROCK: How does that
rhyme go ... ? 

“There once was
a man who said, God 

Must think it
exceedingly odd 

That the sycamore
tree 

Continues to be 

When there’s no
one about in the Quad.” 

EDDIE: Does she walk
when there’s nobody there? 

BROCK: That’s
it. 

EDDIE: Makes a hell
of a difference to the number of times. All those years when the house was empty. 

Jill flips the switch
of the line printer. It spills out its high-speed report. 

STEW: Version with
added Stewart. 

Brock and Jill study
it. Almost immediately something strikes him. He points it out to her, then relates it to
a 

second item. 

JILL: Oh no. (Brock
rips the roll off I to study it on his own) — I didn’t spot that. I should have
done. I just didn’t spot the connection. 

EDDIE: Let’s
have it. 

BROCK (excitedly): If
this means anything — 

JILL: Let’s
start again. 

BROCK: Why? 

JILL: It’s
wrong. 

BROCK: Why? 

JILL: It must be. 

BROCK: No. I like
this. It’s got the makings. It has. (To Jill) It’s what you really wanted. You
shaped it this way. 

JILL: I didn’t
— 

BROCK: You
couldn’t help it, love. The old intuition — right on the button. 

EDDIE: For
pity’s sake — 

BROCK: Beautifully
simple. 

JILL: I’ll run
it again. 

EDDIE: Peter! 

BROCK: It’s the
room. 

EDDIE: What? 

BROCK: Just the room
itself, nothing else. Yes, this is better, it has to be right. 

EDDIE: Peter,
d’you mind telling — 

BROCK: There is no
... ghost. 

A small burst of
surprise, even indignation. 

THE OTHERS: But
it’s there! I heard it! I saw it! What’s he mean? 

BROCK: Try this for
size. It holds an image — and when people go in there they pick it up. What you hear
or what you see is inside your own brain! 

EDDIE (frowning): Oh
no — 

BROCK: That’d be
why the sounds don’t echo and we can’t locate them. That’ d be why they don
‘t record. No machine hears them. 

DOW: I got them in my
headphones. 

BROCK: You got them
in your head. 

EDDIE: What about the
hot spots? 

BROCK: Forget them,
Eddie. 

EDDIE: I mean, the
whole temperature thing — 

BROCK: There
isn’t any. 

EDDIE: Look, I know
when I’m cold — 

BROCK: The
body’s reaction — like allergy, and just as quick. Your whole physiology’s
affected. 

HARGRAVES: By what? 

BROCK: By what’s
in there. 

EDDIE: But I thought
you said — 

BROCK: Don’t you
get it yet? It must work like ... a recording. Fixed in the floor and the walls, right in
the substance of them. A trace ... of what happened in there. And we pick it up. We act as
detectors — decoders — amplifiers. 

EDDIE: A recording. 

BROCK: It’d have
to be in the stone. 

EDDIE: I wonder. 

HARGRAVES: Some kind
of natural process? 

DOW: But freaky. 

BROCK: Perhaps it
only occurs under extreme conditions. Some kind of — extreme human output. Emotion.
Terror. And that prints off. 

MAUDSLEY: Like —
the shadows of people from the big bomb blasts. 

DOW: Yes. 

EDDIE: And we’re
— sensitive to it. 

STEW: What about me? 

BROCK: You?
You’ve got no playback, that’s all. Some transistors missing. You’re the
exception to prove the rule, thank God. (His grin grows wider) I’m waiting for the
new penny to drop. If I’m right — this could be it. The Big One! 

JILL (quietly): A new
recording medium. 

BROCK: The boot in
the guts for ould Nippon! 

JILL: If it’s
true — 

BROCK: If it’s
true, you found it! 

He kisses her. It
sets off something like a goal-scoring reaction. Cowboy yippees. Cheers. Suddenly
everybody is trying to kiss Jill... 

BROCK’S SUITE
— OFFICE — DAY 

Hospitality glasses
are clashed in a toast. Hospitality drinks are being downed. A lot of noise. 

Brock pushes a glass
into the hands of the bemused Collinson, who has just joined them. 

BROCK: Colly —
we’re wetting the head of an idea! It could be the Big One! 

COLLINSON: My God! 

Brock has had several
drinks and they seem only to have increased his excitement. He grabs Jill. 

BROCK: I’m
certain of it, love! The more I kick it around! Direct injection into the human brain of
both sound and vision — no intervening apparatus! 

JILL: I read about
some research — 

BROCK: The Japs, of
course. But blind end — they got nowhere! It’s going to be ours! Television
without the telly set! No box — not even a visor in front of your eyes — 

HARGRAVES: Just a
sort of clip — 

BROCK: Costume
jewellery — the 13-channel earring! 

Stew and Maudsley
loom in, gibbering Jap-English through protruding paper teeth. 

STEW: Honourable
Nippon have met great defeat! 

MAUDSLEY: Go now to
cut honourable belly! 

STEW: Berry! (taking
teeth out) He couldn’t say belly — ~ 

DOW: But when it goes
wrong the repairman’d have to operate on your head 

BROCK: Don’t
mention that — not in the sales brochure! Keep it positive. (He has his arm round
Jill. He taps, an imaginary control on her temple) Coronation Street! (tap) Double Your
Money! (tap) Come Dancing! (tap) War and Peace~! (tap) Porn Channel One! (tap) Porn
Channel Two’ 

JILL: I’m going
mad 

BROCK: That’s
all right — (tap) — Channel 10, Home Doctor! (tap) Political Laugh-In! (tap) The
Hard-Core Show! (tap) Urban Guerilla’s Do-It-Yourself — 

HARGRAVES: Hi, listen
— 

BROCK: Come on,
let’s have it! 

HARGRAVES: No, the
phone — it’s ringing — 

It is, almost drowned
by their noise. Brock makes his way to the desk and answers it. 

BROCK: Hello? Who?
Yes, Brock speaking!...Helen — just a second. (Pressing a hold button, he turns to
the others) Shut up a bit. 

He makes for the
other room. They quieten. The door shuts. 

He picks up the
extension phone. 

BROCK: Okay, put him
on ... Hello, Patrick ... Fine, fine. I’ve been meaning to ring you. I told McAlister
the facts of life this morning, as I gathered you wanted me to ... Oh, has he? . . . Give
him time, it’ll sink in. Yes. . . yes ... it’s what you’ve always said,
fundamental research or nothing. (A pause. He suddenly looks grey) But surely ... we
settled all that. Patrick. . But look here — (He suddenly has no choice. He has to
play the card) Patrick, the proof of it ... listen, though ... Please will you listen to
me! I think we’ve got it! Well — the Big One! (Delighted exclamations at the
other end. He grins, confidence coming back fast) Yes! Yes! 

THE STORAGE ROOM
— LATER THAT DAY 

Brock and Collinson
are peering at a patch of stonework in the lower part of the wall. 

COLLINSON: It’s
called Kentish rag. 

BROCK: Kentish what? 

COLLINSON: Rag. 

BROCK: Joke
time’s over. 

COLLINSON: All right,
ragstone. It’s a kind of greensand. 

He picks up a crowbar
and starts prising at it. The other members of the team sit watching with a kind of greed.
All awe of the place has gone. 

BROCK: Is it rare? 

COLLINSON: Good
grief, no. It’s been quarried since Roman times. Used all over the south of England.
Most of medieval London was built of this stuff. 

BROCK: Better and
better! 

COLLINSON: How? 

BROCK: It might
explain a lot of — ghost stories. 

COLLINSON: See what
you mean. 

BROCK: Colly, it all
keeps clicking together! 

THE LABORATORY 

Jill is checking back
the program with furious concentration. 

STEW: Found the snag
yet? 

JILL: No. 

STEW: Think there is
one? 

JILL: It’s
beginning to look... as if he’s right. 

THE STORAGE ROOM 

Collinson’s
crowbar dislodges a piece of stone. He shows it to Brock. 

COLLINSON: Crumbly
stuff. That’s why they stopped using it in the end. This was well weathered. 

BROCK: Penetrated. 

COLLINSON: Deeply.
Algae — moulds — bacterial action. They all come into it. 

BROCK: The protein
medium, Eddie? 

EDDIE: Maybe. 

BROCK: We chased that
for a long time too. 

He stiffens. 

The others notice it
too but this time they wait with a new kind of expectation. Quite calmly. Eddie takes his
own pulse. Then — the rapid pattering. A rasping screech. 

THE LABORATORY 

There is no sound
here but the soft clatter of Stew’s teleprinter. But Jill breaks off, listening. 

THE STORAGE ROOM 

The sound dies away.
They look at each other, detached observers. 

HARGRAVES: I saw it
again. A fraction of a second. 

COLLINSON: I seemed
to be getting words. 

BROCK: Words — 

HARGRAVES: Yes, I
wondered too. 

COLLINSON:
Couldn’t make them out. 

Brock is strangely,
quietly exhilarated. He picks up the crowbar and taps it thoughtfully against the wall. 

BROCK: Vibration.
(turning) Are you game to go on? 

EDDIE: Now? Yes. 

BROCK: As long as it
takes. Jill? Stew? Shall we make a night of it? 

STEW’S VOICE
(through speaker): Okay, Pete. 

JILL’S VOICE
(through speaker): What do you want to do? 

BROCK: Get control. 

THE LABORATORY 

JILL (shaken): Not
yet — how could we possibly — ? 

BROCK’S VOICE
(through speaker): The essence of experiment, Jilly. Put it to the proof! 

THE STORAGE ROOM
— THAT NIGHT 

in a patch of light,
the crowbar creaks and grates as Brock levers a piece of stone out — just as
Collinson did. 

BROCK: Frequency? 

EDDIE’S VOICE:
Seven forty. 

BROCK: Right, give me
that. Ten secs. 

A droning sound hits
the ear at the same frequency as the scraping of the crowbar. The metal horn of a sound
projector is pointed at the spot by Maudsley. Eddie crouches over the amplifier controls. 

The sound cuts. They
wait. 

BROCK: ...And another
ten. 

Again the drone. Jill
and Stew are watching from the computer desk which has been set up nearby the doorway. The
noise cuts. Another wait. Brock comes hurrying across. 

BROCK: Well? 

JILL: We haven’t
enough data. 

BROCK: We’re
getting data all the time, and building. Stew — 

Stew taps keys. The
teleprinter re-runs. Brock studies its print, turns quickly to a display monitor nearby.
This shows a three-dimensional drawing of the room itself. Brock makes an adjustment and
the lines jump. . and jump again ... displaying a different perspective each time. Another
adjustment — and a spray of radiating lines is superimposed to denote the current
target area. 

BROCK: Back to the
steps. Laser plus sound 

The thin cherry-red
beam of a laser flicks back and forth across the steps, scanning them. Simultaneously
there is a strident intermittent buzz. 

BROCK: Cut them. 

The sound stops.
White light floods the steps. They wait. Brock has a stopwatch in his hand. Nothing
happens. 

BROCK: Right. Run
number 17. Laser plus five second bursts. 

EDDIE: Peter,
what’s the use? 

BROCK: We’re on
the right track, just keep going. 

EDDIE: You’ve
had a — a response! 

BROCK: No. 

EDDIE: We’ve
heard it twice tonight. 

BROCK: Not because of
anything we did. It didn’t relate. It’s got to relate, Eddie. (He looks round
the wearying faces) Okay, break for ten minutes. We’ll get more coffee up. Just
another hour, if we don I t get anything by then —Bear with me? 

HARGRAVES (glumly):
You’re the captain. 

Brock walks out into
the passage. Eddie glares after him 

As Jill comes up he
nods after Brock — is there anything she can do, She goes doubtfully to see. 

Ten minutes later the
team are downing coffee and microwaved snacks. They are too tired to talk. 

Eddie glowers down
the passage. 

THE ENTRANCE HALL
— NIGHT 

Brock is standing on
the stairs, leaning against the wall. Adrenalin and alcohol have left an odd,
inspirational effect. Jill is fighting her own weariness, trying to sound persuasive. 

JILL: I think
you’re right. It’s a vibration thing. 

BROCK: I know it is. 

JILL: But —
Peter, it’ll take huge programs to analyse it. 

BROCK: Of course. 

JILL: I’d like
to develop them. 

BROCK: Fine. 

JILL: Then why this
— tonight? 

BROCK: I want to pull
the trigger, just once. Or what the hell are we into — a tape that only plays back
when it feels like it? 

The sheer
irrationality of it shocks her. 

JILL: You just
can’t say that — 

BROCK: I’ve got
to know! 

JILL: Peter, I
don’ t think any of us is quite — we I’ve all been under strain —
these days here — the more rational we’ve tried to be, the worse — 

BROCK: What are you
driving at? 

JILL: We’re all
past it. 

BROCK: Not me, love. 

JILL: Yes, you. 

BROCK: Don’t say
that. Don’t do it. I’ve got a feeling about this. You get this exact grip on a
thing this clarity —only once ever — 

She is staring at
him. 

JILL: What have you
— promised Ryan? 

THE STORAGE ROOM
— NIGHT 

An appalling screech
bursts from the horn of the sound projector, pounding at the walls as it is swung round.
The sound wobbles, changing frequency with the stridency of an air raid siren, but much
faster. Then it cuts. 

Brock turns to the
others. 

BROCK: Nobody? 

EDDIE: What’s
the use? 

BROCK: Nerves
jangled? 

EDDIE: What do you
think? 

BROCK: That may be
good. 

Next — a beam of
bluish light swings rapidly across the area of the steps. Synchronised with it come sharp,
separate blasts of sound — with something of the effect of a dentist’s drill. 

Brock watches. Like
the others, he now wears protective goggles. 

BROCK: Hold the U.V.
on the steps! 

At the teleprinter,
Stew has suddenly had all he can take. He covers his ears. Jill moves to take over ... 

Now it is flashing
light, as rapid as a stroboscope, with sound to match. 

Brock signals. The
sound cuts. The light is sane again. Eddie stares dazedly about. HARGRAVES has quietly
started to cry. 

But Brock ignores
them as he turns again to the computer. 

It chatters out its
report. 

BROCK: Right. On the
next run we’ll try 

EDDIE: Stop it! You
don’t know what you’re doing any more 

BROCK: Following a
logical line. 

EDDIE: It’s
insane! 

BROCK: Quit, then. 

EDDIE: What? 

BROCK: Get off the
project. 

EDDIE: Peter 

BROCK: Get off the
entire project! You can! 

EDDIE (choking) :
Don’t talk to me like, that, Peter, not to me 

The teleprinter
chatters again, a line of delayed print-out. 

Brock turns to read
it. 

BROCK: What the hell
— ? 

JILL (peering):
That’s not — computer language. 

BROCK: It’s your
code number. You fed it in. 

JILL: No — 

BROCK: You must have
done. 

JILL: There are
words. They might be words. See — “pray”. 

STEW:
“Soul”. That’s “soul” there. 

JILL:
“Pray.” “Prayer”. 

A deathly hush. Then
a terrified wail from the demoralised HARGRAVES. 

HARGRAVES: It’s
in the computer! 

For a moment the
thought has them all in its grip. They are past objective thinking, utterly exhausted. 

Brock is the first to
recover. 

BROCK: No — 

HARGRAVES: It is! It
is! It’s in there! 

Brock grabs him and
shakes him like a rat. 

BROCK: You bloody
fool! Jill picked up the words! You got words yourself — that’s how it works! I
told you. 

There is a familiar
pattering. This time it is fearful to them. 

EDDIE (whispering):
There it is — 

BROCK (after a
moment, insanely): Come when I tell you! 

He lunges towards the
sound projector and switches it on. At full volume he swings the horn, blasting every part
of the room. 

Jill claps her hands
to her ears. 

People stumble
towards the doorway to escape it. The sound goes on and on — and seems to change,
erupting into a vast grunting that makes the whole place shudder. For a moment it seems
completely out of control. Brock is shaken like a man on a pneumatic drill. 

Then — silence.
He stands panting, hardly knowing what he has done or why. 

The others drift
back. 

JILL: It’s
different. 

BROCK (numbed): Eh? 

JILL: She’s
gone. 

BROCK: What d1you
mean? 

JILL: Completely. I
can tell. 

Eddie totters forward
in a kind of grotesque triumph. 

EDDIE: I’ll tell
you what he’s done! D’you know what he’s done? He’s wiped the tape! 

Brock stares blankly
at them. 

Maudsley gives a sick
snigger. otherwise nobody is laughing. They are incapable of it. 

BROCK (mumbling):
Thanks ... we’ll leave it at that. Might try ...another run tomorrow. 

JILL: Run what?
She’s gone! 

She has a horror of
him, as if she has just watched him commit a murder. Eddie takes her by the arm. 

Brock crouches on the
floor. Listening and waiting... 

Hours later Brock is
still there, watching by the flicker of the blank monitor screens. More and more anxiously
... 

Dawn, and Brock is
still there. Still alone. He has dropped asleep, leaning awkwardly against a monitor. His
head droops a little more sideways — and wakes him. He pulls himself back to
consciousness, wondering what woke him. Expectant again. 

But there is
nothing... 

THE ENTRANCE HALL
— DAY 

Coming in next day,
Jill finds the Sergeant looking his usual self, at least. 

SERGEANT: Morning,
Miss Greeley — or should I say good afternoon? 

JILL: It’s up to
you. (Monitors are being wheeled along the passage from the storage room. Collinson is in
charge. Jill’s look is a question. He shakes his head) ... He really did it. 

COLLINSON: I kept
away. 

JILL: Where is he? 

Collinson indicates
the floor above... 

INSIDE BROCK’S
SUITE — OFFICE 

Brock is huddled in
his chair, looking too small for it. He is still wrapped in a dressing-gown and looks grey
and dishevelled. 

BROCK (into phone,
wretchedly): Look, Patrick. I’m sorry if I gave the impression that we...Perhaps I
shouldn’t have, then ... No, not backing down at all, I just don’t want you to
waste your time coming here and. . .0h, I have! every confidence! I know we’re on the
track of it, we’ve only got to get the bugs out of it...as always ... What?...Of
course you’ve got a right to. It’s a ... mineral ... medium... Don’t pin me
down, I can’t be more specific at this moment of time ... Patrick, please!
(desperately) It — it’s a variant on Eddie Holmes’s digital crystal —
in fact that may turn out to be it after all. I just can’t give a technical
explanation right now... Of course I will, Patrick. Of course. Good bye. 

He puts the phone
down in a sweat — and sees Jill watching, him from the doorway. For a moment or two
neither speaks. 

BROCK: Don’t say
— anything! It’s over, it’s finished! If I can just walk away from this one
— ! (worriedly) He Is a funny man, you never quite know ... you can’t tell from
his voice. Just so long as this doesn’t — doesn’t ... He’s devious of
course but what the hell. I’ve seen him be treacherous but not to anybody that —
anybody that...No. No. He wouldn’t... 

THE ENTRANCE HALL 

Men from a Ryan
Electrics van which has drawn up outside trolley a large, square, canvas-covered object in
across the hall towards the reception desk. 

THE LABORATORY 

All the apparatus is
back in place. Brock, looking more or less himself again, is restoring confidence to his
team. 

BROCK: Whatever the
... effect was, it is obviously gone for good. 

EDDIE: Obliterated. 

BROCK: Yes. (He looks
at Jill but she says nothing) Now we’ve had time to take it in — I’m glad.
It’s what I wanted to do in the first place. 

EDDIE: Oh, Peter
— ! 

BROCK: Now, be fair
— I did. So let’s regard it as a bit of a nonsense, part of the house-warming.
It got out of hand. I plead guilty. But now — the room is clear, we can set it up for
computer storage, get on! I’ve been working out new schedules — 

The sergeant looks
in. 

SERGEANT: Beg pardon,
Sir — 

BROCK: What is it? 

THE ENTRANCE HALL 

Brock comes from the
lab with the others following curiously. The sergeant points to the canvas-covered object.
It looms there like a squat monolith. 

SERGEANT:
Where’s it to go, sir? 

With rising
apprehension Brock lifts a corner of the canvas cover. Then he throws it off. The thing
revealed is white and shining, with the unmistakable single eye of a washing machine. Its
top is monstrously swollen to accommodate a mass of special controls. 

BROCK: McAlister!
(His stricken eyes meet Jill’s) The old bastard did it! He did do it! 

THE LABORATORY —
DAYS LATER 

Eddie is peering
through his optical tube. His spare eye goes to Stew as he passes laden with used rolls of
computer paper. 

EDDIE: Ready for my
data? 

STEW: Just clearing
the decks. 

EDDIE: From the other
night? 

STEW: Yeah. 

EDDIE: Get rid of it.
As things now are, get rid of it fast. 

Stew moves on —
to where Jill stands poring over more paper print-out. 

JILL: Stew. If she
simply fell — 

STEW: What have you
got there? 

JILL: The words that
came through. Why these words? “Pray”. . . “soul”...”pray”
again ... “prayer” ... “save”. They’re nothing to do with falling
off steps. 

STEW: Jill, forget
it. 

JILL:
“Save” ... from what? 

STEW: Forget it. 

JILL (remembering):
The others...! (She frowns, thinking back to what Alan said. Then she rips off the
print-out) I’m going to show him this. 

STEW: Not Peter. 

JILL: Of course. 

STEW: No, love —
not today. 

JILL: What? 

STEW: The big
invasion. McAlister. 

She hesitates. Then
she goes quickly out. 

THE STORAGE ROOM
— DAY 

Brock is clutching a
large plan as he glowers round the storage room. 

BROCK: At least
he’s not getting this. 

COLLINSON: He’ll
be fine in the other wing. 

BROCK (with
satisfaction): It’s filthy damp. 

Work on the room is
proceeding at last. Workmen are erecting scaffolding along the side wall, which has been
stripped, like all of them, of remaining panelling. The place has a bare, industrial look.


Brock turns to Jill
as she comes in. 

BROCK: Jill, look at
this. Location of the store-core units — 

JILL: I want to show
you something. From the other night — 

BROCK (warding off
the print-out): Oh no. No! 

JILL: The words
— 

BROCK: I don’t
want to see. I don’t want to know! 

He moves off quickly
to confer with the workmen. Collinson gives her a warning gesture and joins him. 

Then it happens. 

Jill finds herself
shaken by a spasm of trembling — far more violent than any before. As if the strength
is being whipped out of her body. She grabs at a ladder to steady herself. 

Brock and Collinson
are engaged in some joke with the workmen, all of them laughing. 

Then — silence.
The men are still laughing and talking but without sound. 

Instead, an instant
later, an obscene grunting roar. 

It is overpowering.
Through the continuing horror of it Jill can see the men talking and working on, evidently
oblivious of it. It simply does not reach them. 

It ends suddenly too.
Brock’s laugh is heard again, and the small sounds of the scaffolding work. 

Collinson happens to
turn. 

COLLINSON: Jill! 

Brock turns too and
sees the state she is in. Collinson is the first to reach her. 

BROCK: Get her out of
this — 

JILL: You didn’t
hear it! (Collinson almost carries her out into the passage) It was different — this
was different! It’s not her — it’s something else! Peter — ! 

BROCK (firmly):
You’ll have to keep out of this room. It’s the associations. 

JILL: It isn’t 

BROCK: Stay out of
it. 

JILL: Let me tell you


BROCK: Things went
too far. My fault, I know it was. 

JILL: If you’ll
only — 

BROCK: Now
you’ve got to rest. Unwind. Go home and take it easy. We can’t have you cracking
up. 

JILL: Peter — 

BROCK: Will you do
that for me? (He glances at his watch) Time! 

He hurries towards
the entrance hall. 

COLLINSON (quietly):
He’s right, Jill. 

OUTSIDE TASKERLANDS
HOUSE — DAY 

Two strange cars pull
in outside the front entrance. An old Rover and a viva. 

From the first
McAlister gets out. He looks twice as tall, swollen with triumph. One of his team is with
him, three others get out of the Viva — all of them grey, bullied men. 

As they turn in a
body to make their entrance, a lightweight motorbike sputters across the gravel. Its rider
kicks the stand down, beams at them and trots into the house ahead of them. 

It is the vicar. 

INSIDE THE ENTRANCE
HALL 

As the vicar enters
he spots Brock standing by the reception desk with the air of a general forced to
ignominious parley. 

VICAR: Mr Brock!
There you are! (Brock stares at him blankly) I’ve tracked down that exorcism! 

BROCK: What? 

VICAR: I went to the
museum! 

BROCK (in horror):
Not now — 

VICAR: And there it
was! 

BROCK (desperately):
Colly — cope, will you — cope, please! 

Collinson hurries
forward. 

VICAR: It wasn’t
easy to discover — 

BROCK: Very kind of
you, very helpful, but — just at the moment I’ve got business! 

He turns to face the
invaders. McAlister leads them with eyes gleaming and a thin smile. 

McALISTER: Well,
Brock? 

BROCK: This way. 

He leads them off
towards the spare wing. 

VICAR (hurt): That
really was a little short — 

COLLINSON: You said
— an exorcism? 

VICAR: Yes. 

COLLINSON: He knows
about it. 

VICAR: Oh. 

COLLINSON: We had the
documents. 1892. 

VICAR: When? Oh, no. 

COLLINSON: It was. 

VICAR: 1760. 

Jill comes forward.
The vicar recognises her, nods and beams. 

JILL: 1760? The house
wasn’t built then. 

VICAR: Indeed not.
There was just — some sort of ruin here. Nevertheless there’d been —
complaints, so — a service was performed. Quite useless, apparently —
that’s if you accept there had been anything there in the first place ... 

THE LABORATORY —
DAY 

Jill is working at
the teleprinter with feverish concentration when Eddie comes up. 

EDDIE: Jill, what
about tackling mine? 

JILL: Give me a
chance. 

EDDIE: What is this?
(He looks over her shoulder) For God’s sake! Don’t let Peter see that.
We’ve got work to do. JILL (promising): Soon, Eddie. 

Eddie goes sourly
off. Stew moves in. 

STEW: Well? 

JILL: It’s the
concept of a tape that’s wrong. It’s more like a great depth — a core
— 

STEW: The stone. 

JILL: He erased her.
But she was only in the surface layer, the most recent. 

STEW: 1890 recent! 

JILL: There’d be
much older impressions underneath. Much deeper. 

STEW: How far are you
trying to go back? 

JILL: A long way... 

THE ENTRANCE HALL
— DAY 

Brock and McAlister
are coming down the stairs together as Jill appears from the lab. 

McALISTER: I must
have an office. 

BROCK (unhelpfully):
Do what I can — 

McALISTER: I have a
great deal of paper work. 

BROCK (meanly):
Costing? 

McAlister glares at
him. Jill takes advantage of the pause. 

JILL: Peter —
have you got a moment? 

BROCK (quickly): This
is Jill Greeley, who programs our computer. Robert McAlister. 

McAlister thrusts out
a bright blue hand. 

McALISTER: I’ll
have need of you, lassie, and your wee machine. (He turns his back on her and the pair of
them move off rapidly towards the other wing) I got that crack about costing. Let me tell
you my machine is viable and I’m going to prove it... 

Jill is left standing
... 

OUTSIDE TASKERLANDS
HOUSE — DAY 

Eddie and some of the
others are taking a break near the front entrance, idly watching McAlister and a couple of
his team unloading things from the van — wash drums, cables, etc. The last man
struggles under a burden of dazzlingly dyed sheets — orange, turquoise and cerise. 

EDDIE: What do they
think they’re doing! Colours like that! My wife’s old machine’d just spit
them out naturally! 

STEW: Those blokes
are curious. 

EDDIE: You’re
telling me! 

STEW: No, I mean
— one of them said what was this about a ghost. 

EDDIE: Oh, be careful
— 

STEW: Don’t
worry, I was. 

Jill comes from the
house, walking fast. Her face is set and desperate. 

EDDIE: Jill — 

He calls after her
but she goes straight on towards the caravan. 

INSIDE THE CARAVAN 

Collinson is working
on some papers when Jill throws the caravan door open. 

JILL: Colly —
they’re still working on that room! 

COLLINSON: I’m
glad to say. 

JILL: Nobody thinks
there’s anything wrong? 

COLLINSON: Not ...
now. (He gets up, disturbed by her expression) Jill — 

For whole seconds she
stares in front of her as if she is struggling to focus on something deep in her mind. 

JILL: There must be
a... decay. 

COLLINSON: Of what?
Jill, what decay? 

JILL: Whatever’s
... stored in the stone. The recording. Otherwise ... it’d be like perpetual motion,
an impossibility. It would have to ... corrode and lose definition-over long enough time
it would have to. But then if you boosted it —(shrilly) Colly, I think that’s
what he’s done! 

COLLINSON: Boosted? 

JILL: Some deep-level
record, much older. So old and...shapeless ... 

COLLINSON: Jill,
there’s nothing. 

JILL: I know there
is. 

Collinson shakes his
head. Then: 

COLLINSON: Remember
I’m on your side. 

JILL: You’re not
any longer! 

COLLINSON: Sit down
and let’s talk — 

JILL: Am I the only
one? Am I? 

COLLINSON: Jill
— 

She backs away from
the concern in his eyes. She throws the door open... 

INSIDE THE LABORATORY
— DAY 

Jill is working
feverishly at the computer. one by one the others stop the work they are doing, till they
are all watching her ... 

BROCK’S SUITE
— OFFICE, DAY 

Folder in hand, Jill
looks into’ Brock’s encounters an angry argument. 

Brock is sitting
hot-eyed at his desk. McAlister is shaking a bright green fist in his face. 

McALISTER: —
Full facilities! I’ll accept nothing less! And you can just stuff that up your —
up your — er — and —and — and — 

He shoots a doubtful
“presence-of-ladies” look at the newly imported girl secretary who sits nearby
with a shorthand pad on her knee. Then he blunders out past Jill with a snarl of apology
to her. 

Jill shuts the door.
Brock’s eyes are fixed on her. 

BROCK (to the
secretary): Get out. Make some coffee. 

The girl measures
Jill with a look and goes into the living quarters. 

JILL: I’ve got
to talk to you. 

BROCK: If it’s
what I think — 

JILL: Even if it is. 

Brock is out of his
chair in a moment. He Comes close, keeping his voice down to a furious whisper. 

BROCK: You won’t
give up, will you! You started this whole thing and you keep it going! You’re
determined to! You’re getting to enjoy it! 

JILL: Enjoy — ! 

BROCK: Oh, not
healthy yum-yum enjoy. Some people like to destroy people, Jilly, and you’re turning
into one. If you can’t take me from my family, it’s got to be destruction! 

JILL: It’s not
true! 

BROCK: That creature
that just went out of here — that baboon with the dyed hands — he’s got his
foot on my neck! Through you! 

JILL (desperately) :
Peter — you were right about the recording. (For a split second he seems to be
listening to her) There are more things on it. 

BROCK: Oh no. 

JILL: I can prove it.


BROCK: Sweetie,
you’re into fantasies. 

JILL: You’ve got
to listen! 

BROCK: Unless
we’re careful you could get very sick. You’re going on leave. For a month —
no, make it two months, starting now. 

JILL: I can’t
— 

BROCK: Stew can take
over, he knows the computer. And he’s — levelheaded. He’s up to it. 

JILL: Peter — 

She sees his eyes and
gives up. His mind is sealed against anything she can say. 

She turns — and
sees the secretary watching through a crack in the doorway. 

BROCK: Home and rest
now... 

THE LABORATORY —
NIGHT 

The lab is dark,
apart from the area of the computer where Jill is working alone. All round her are
discarded rolls of print-out paper. 

Collinson looks in,
an old mac pulled round him, wet with rain. 

COLLINSON: Jill! I
saw the light. What are you doing? 

She looks at him as
if she hardly recognises him — then goes on tapping at the teleprinter keys. He comes
to her side and peers at what she is doing — but he can make nothing of it. 

JILL: I think someone
else did know about this. 

COLLINSON: Who? 

JILL: Louisa. 

He watches her face
as she works feverishly on. In a moment she has forgotten he is there. 

He turns and goes
quickly out. 

The slight sound of
the door shutting seems to break her absorption. She sits back in her chair, covers her
face. when she looks again at the paper roll in the machine, the same result is still
there ... 

THE ENTRANCE HALL
— NIGHT 

Jill comes out of the
lab . She glances up the stairs — there are lights somewhere above — then turns
along the passage towards the storage room. 

A temporary notice
has been stuck on the door, crudely lettered: “Keep Out, Building Work in
Progress”. She opens the door. She switches the light on. 

THE STORAGE ROOM 

The storage room is
empty, lit by a couple of bare bulbs. Builders’ equipment lies everywhere and more
scaffolding has been erected. 

Jill looks about,
tense. But everything is aggressively ordinary. 

She crosses to the
stone steps and considers them. Ordinary, too, in the hard light. A workman has left a
battered bucket on one of the lower ones and she dislodges it — just to break the
silence. It clatters and rolls away... 

BROCK’S SUITE
— OFFICE, NIGHT 

Collinson is facing a
dishevelled Brock, who has just pulled a dressing-gown over his nakedness. 

BROCK
(incredulously): At this hour? 

COLLINSON (quietly):
I think she’s having a breakdown. 

BROCK: Yes. (The
tousled, undressed secretary peers out of the darkened living quarters. He waves her back)
I sent her on leave. 

COLLINSON: When? 

BROCK: Today. I told
her to go. 

COLLINSON (amazed):
Just like that? Just — go. 

BROCK: What else? If
you feel strongly about it — go with her! In fact I think you should, you’ve
been under a bit of strain here, all this extra work, you’re due for a — 

COLLINSON: Take Jill?


BROCK: A spot of
leave’s what you both need, so why not, the pair of you? Get it all out of your
system— 

THE STORAGE ROOM 

Jill is starting back
towards the passage when she feels the premonitory chill. But she keeps a grip on herself
and keeps moving. 

The passage is dark,
as if the light in the entrance hall has gone out. 

Oddly enough, there
are two tiny spots of red light — low down and flashing alternately like indicator
lamps. Then bo th glow evenly — and come rushing forward at incredible speed ,
swelling in an instant into two eyes, yet not eyes like those of any living creature, for
they keep twisting and moving on separate courses. 

She stumbles back and
almost trips over a spade, sending it scraping across the concrete. It is the only sound. 

The eyes have gone. 

More movement. She
turns — and sees shapes, or rather shapeless things moving towards her across the
open floor with the same incredible speed. 

JILL (screams):
Peter! 

As if this served to
set it off, the grunting begins — the same huge, unearthly noise she heard here
earlier. 

She starts across the
floor — in the only direction she can, towards the steps. 

They are hunting her.
Huge forms, terrifying in their very lack of definition, with here and there eye-like dots
of red light. They move across the ground with that dreadful speed, quartering it like
hounds. There is a brute male violence about every movement, a lust to bring down and tear
— 

Then she is on the
steps, pressing herself against the wall. 

JILL: Help me! Help
– ! 

She glances up. 

The steps lead to an
upper floor, with light pouring down from the opening. 

She claws her way up
to reach it. 

The steps beneath her
feet are unworn and strong. 

Frantic, she reaches
the top of them. 

And there is nothing.
No upper floor, not even a roof above her — only the night sky. 

The whole room has
vanished. 

Instead of the walls
there are standing stones round a moonlit space. And there the shapeless things are
circling, closing in — 

Then she falls. 

It is a long way down
... 

THE ENTRANCE HALL 

Normal silence —
then Brock and Collinson come running down the stairs. They look into the lab, then make
for the storage room. 

THE STORAGE ROOM 

Jill is lying on the
concrete at the foot of the steps. Brock and Collinson run to her. 

Her eyes are open.
She is dead... 

THE ENTRANCE HALL
— A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER 

Brock, Collinson,
Eddie and Stew come slowly in through the front door. Maudsley and HARGRAVES trail after
them. All are soberly dressed. 

The sergeant is
missing from his place at the desk. 

McAlister and one of
his team come down the stairs. McAlister already looks more like a senior executive than a
mechanic, and has acquired a plain-looking secretary who follows them holding some thick
folders. 

McALISTER: What was
it? 

COLLINSON: Accidental
death. McAlister gives a sour sniff. 

McALISTER: By the by,
Brock — those environment boys were back, looking for you. 

BROCK (dully): Oh. 

McALISTER: Clapping a
preservation order on that room, are they? 

He goes on with his
followers towards his own wing. 

EDDIE: Pleased with
the verdict? 

Brock says nothing. 

EDDIE: Why did you
have to say all that? About her? 

BROCK: Her mental
state. They had to know. 

EDDIE: Did they? 

BROCK: Look, it
wasn’t just the fall that did it, they knew that. 

STEW: They said
shock. 

BROCK: Complete vagal
inhibition. That’s when-your whole system packs up. She brought it on herself. 

Eddie gives him a
look of disgust and turns away to the lab. 

EDDIE: I’ll just
get my coat, Stew. 

STEW: Okay. 

COLLINSON (quietly to
Brock): You were lucky. 

Eddie reappears
indignantly in the lab doorway. 

EDDIE: What’s he
doing in there! 

THE LABORATORY 

The sergeant is
standing beside the computer, busy with a paper-shredding machine. He has turned most of
the used print out rolls into a huge mound of shreds. He is feeding in the last of them. 

SERGEANT: Just what I
was told, sir. Ask Mr Brock. 

BROCK (entering with
the others): We had to get rid of it. 

STEW: That’s
— what she’d just been working on — 

BROCK: It had to go.
Look, I Im not suppressing anything — not evidence — it’s all computer
language — 

STEW: All her work. 

COLLINSON (calmly as
ever): Leave it to me. 

He motions Stew and
Eddie out and closes the door. The last of the paper is buzzed into shreds. 

BROCK: Mad stuff,
Colly. 

COLLINSON: It’s
gone now. 

BROCK: You saw it?
Well, you wouldn’t understand it. Seven thousand years, it said! I mean — insane
stuff! 

Collinson hits him as
hard as he can. it is an imperfectly aimed blow. It gets Brock in the throat, sending him
sprawling in the shredded paper. 

He lies there,
choking and gasping while Collinson walks out. The sergeant is at a loss. 

SERGEANT (to
Collinson): Look here, sir! (He turns to help Brock) You all right, sir? Are you? What on
earth did he — ? Shocking behaviour, shocking! Mr Collinson, too! (He gets Brock to
his feet and brushes the clinging shreds off him) Er ... want I should do anything about
him, sir? 

Brock shakes his
head. He rubs his bruised throat, breathing hoarsely. He makes for the door. 

THE ENTRANCE HALL 

The entrance hall is
deserted. 

SERGEANT (relieved) :
Made off, has he, sir? Disgraceful. Sure you’re all right, sir? (Brock nods) Oh,
before I forget, them conservation inspectors was here again. 

BROCK: Yes. 

SERGEANT: In there
along time, sir. They said there would be a summons. When they went one of ‘em said
did you know about the room. 

BROCK: Eh? 

SERGEANT: Just that,
sir. 

BROCK: What did he
mean? 

SERGEANT: That’s
all, sir, just did you know about the room. (Brock looks along the passage) Feel okay now,
sir? 

BROCK: Yes. Thanks.
You can go. 

SERGEANT: Thank you,
sir. Good night, sir. 

Brock takes out his
keys. 

Reaching the door,
from which the builders’ sign has been removed and a small official-looking notice
substituted, he puts a key into the newly fixed lock. 

THE STORAGE ROOM 

The room looks much
the same. Builders’ equipment is still scattered about. 

Brock shivers
slightly. 

As a rational man
rejecting any alternative explanation, he buttons his jacket. 

He walks across the
floor — 

There is a sudden
scream in the air, close by. A woman’s voice, sharp and clear. 

VOICE: Help me —
! (He glances round but sees nothing) Peter! (He is stung by the unmistakable sound of his
name) Help me — Peter — ! 

BROCK (whispers):
Jill. 

Then it screams
again, and again, and again. And there is nothing he can do. 

Except stand there
stunned by the knowledge ... that there is a new voice on the stone tape ...
