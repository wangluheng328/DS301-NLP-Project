Vector Scope is one of the largest science corporations on the west coast of the U.S.
They have chosen Lieutenant Tuck Penelton, who is a free-spirited fighter pilot with no respect for life, for a miniaturization program developed by Vector Scope.
However, when group of hired thugs infiltrated Vector Scope, they stole a unique micro chip, making miniaturization possible.
Ozzie, a scientist, manages to escape with Tuck, in hand, miniaturized in a syringe.
Ozzie makes a last ditch effort to save Tuck's life by injecting him into a person named Jack Putter, an overly paranoid cashier at a local grocery store.
What Jack will soon realize that with Tuck floating inside his own body, he will embark on a journey to attempt to recover the chip before it falls into the hands of a technology smuggler, Victor Scrimshaw.
He intends to sell the chip to a nameless criminal known as "The Cowboy".
