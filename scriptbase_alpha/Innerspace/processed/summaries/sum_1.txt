Lt. Tuck Pendelton, an American pilot, takes part in an experiment where he is miniaturised inside a submarine-like craft and is to be injected into a rabbit.
The bad guys try to steal him, and the machine, while he is miniaturised, and eventually he ends up inside Jack Putter, a hypochondriac.
This film borrows ideas from the classic "Fantastic Voyage" and Steve Martins "All of Me".
