In 1941, three men reach India from Tibet, having walked 4000 miles after escaping a Siberian gulag.
The film tells their story and that of four others who escaped with them and a teenage girl who joins them in flight.
The group's natural leader is Janusz, a Pole condemned by accusations secured by torturing his wife; he knows how to live in the wilds.
They escape under cover of a snowstorm: a cynical American, a Russian thug, a comic accountant, a pastry chef who draws, a priest, and a Pole with night blindness.
They face freezing nights, lack of food and water, mosquitoes, an endless desert, the Himalayas, and moral questions of when to leave someone behind.
