The story is about a dying tribe called the Mohicans in which only two are left as well as one adopted white man.
These three men refuse to enter the militia for Britain in 1757 for they want freedom.
On their way to Kentucky, they intercept Indians attacking a small regiment of British including the two daughters of an British Colonel on their way to a fort.
The three men lead the survivors to the fort while two love stories take place but the French and Indian War continues.
