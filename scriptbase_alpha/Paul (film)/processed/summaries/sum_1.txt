Graeme and Clive are English sci-fi nerds, on holiday in the U.S. After Comic-Con in San Diego, then rent an RV and head for places where UFOs have been sighted.
Near Roswell, they witness a car crash and come face to face with a small green creature, who calls himself Paul.
He wants their help to escape the pursuit of government agents, who have held him captive for more than 60 years.
Thus begins an odyssey peppered with alien movie clich√©s; the story includes a one-eyed fundamentalist Christian and her gun-toting dad, inept FBI agents and their implacable supervisor - plus his control.
All roads lead to Wyoming where the story started in 1947.
