Roger Rabbit is a cartoon character who (along with many others) exists along side of real humans.
Eddy is a private eye who has seen better days and has been on the skids since the death of his brother at the hands of a Toon (cartoon character).
Rogers' boss hires Eddy to see if his sexy wife has other male interests, but things get out of hand as Roger is framed for murder with no one but the Toon hating Eddy to go to for help.
