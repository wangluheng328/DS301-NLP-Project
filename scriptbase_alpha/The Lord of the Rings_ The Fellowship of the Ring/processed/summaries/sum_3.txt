In ancient times, the Elven-smiths created the Rings of Power.
Then the Dark Lord Sauron created a Ring to rule the Lesser Rings.
But the Ring was stolen, and for a long time, he thought it to be lost.
But many years later, the Ring came to the hobbit, Bilbo Baggins.
In a land called the Shire, Frodo inherits the Ring from his uncle, Bilbo.
Now Frodo must take a journey across Middle-earth, and throw the Ring into the volcano, Mt.
Doom, the only place it can be destroyed.
