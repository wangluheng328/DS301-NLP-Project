<b>BLACK CONTINUES... ELVISH SINGING....A WOMAN'S VOICE IS
</b>whispering, tinged with SADNESS and REGRET:

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
</b>              (Elvish: subtitled)
          "I amar prestar sen: han mathon ne nen,
          han mathon ne chae...a han noston ned
          wilith."
              (English:)
          The world is changed: I feel it in the
          water, I feel it in the earth, I smell it
          in the air...Much that once was is lost,
          for none now live who remember it.

<b>SUPER: THE LORD OF THE RINGS

MOLTEN GOLD POURS from the lip of an IRON LADLE.

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
</b>          It began with the forging of the Great
          Rings.

IMAGE: THREE RINGS, each set with a single GEM, are received
by the HIGH ELVES-GALADRIEL, GIL-GALAD and CIRDAN.

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Three were given to the Elves, immortal,
          wisest...fairest of all beings.

IMAGE: SEVEN RINGS held aloft in triumph by the DWARF LORDS.

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great miners
          and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

IMAGE: NINE RINGS clutched tightly by the KINGS OF MEN...as
if holding-close a precious secret.

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And Nine...nine rings were gifted to the
          race of Men who, above all else, desire
          power.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b><b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

</b>
<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          But they were all of them deceived.

FADE UP: An ancient PARCHMENT MAP of MIDDLE EARTH...moving
slowly across the MAP as if drawn by an unseen force the
CAMERA closes in on a PLACE NAME...MORDOR.

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

<b>SAMMATH NAUR.
</b>
<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          In the land of Mordor, in the fires of
          Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged
          in secret a Master Ring to control all
          others.


IMAGE: The ONE RING reflecting FIERY LAVA!   FIRE WRITING
emerges on the plain BAND OF GOLD.

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          ...and into this Ring he poured his
          cruelty, his malice and his will to
          dominate all life.

IMAGE: THE ONE RING falls through SPACE and into flames...

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          One Ring to rule them all...

IMAGE: A GREAT SHADOW falls across the MAP...closing in
around the realm of GONDOR...

<b>IMAGE: SCREAMING VILLAGERS, MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, RUN
</b>
from their homes, pursued by ARMIES OF HIDEOUS ORCS.

<b>                    GALADRIEL
</b>          One by one the Free lands of Middle earth
          fell to the power of the ring.

FADE UP: ISILDUR, son of the KING OF GONDOR, leads an ARMY
ACROSS the PLAINS OF DAGORLAD...

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          A last alliance of Men and Elves marched
          against the armies of Mordor.

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          On the slopes of Mount Doom they fought
          for the freedom of Middle- Earth.

<b>TEASING SHOTS: THE BATTLE OF DAGORLAD...THE ELF LORD, ELROND,
</b>
commands rank after rank of ELVEN ARCHERS...ORCS RETREATING
before the ARMY of the LAST ALLIANCE...ELENDIL holds aloft
the great sword....NARSIL!

<b>                    GALADRIEL
</b>          Victory was near!

IMAGES: THE HUGE, DARK FIGURE OF SARURON, bearing the ONE
RING on his finger, looms over the field of battle...

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          But the power of the Ring could not be
          undone.

IMAGE: SAURON lays waste to the armies of the LAST ALLIANCE.
With desperate courage, ELENDIL leads a charge...THE BLACK
MACE OF SAURON LASHES OUT!! IMAGE: ELENDIL'S body falls like
a crumpled rag doll... IMAGE: ISILDUR cradles the body of his
father in his arms. The SHADOW OF SAURON falls over him...

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          It was in this moment..when all hope had
          faded, that Isildur, son of the king,
          took up his father's sword.

ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL..The BLADE
severs SAURON'S FINGERS... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his
body.

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples of
          Middle Earth, was defeated. SAURON'S
          ARMOR clatters to the ground. His body

GONE....VAPORIZED! CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED
FINGER and removes the ONE RING...transfixed!

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          The Ring passed to Isildur...who had this
          one chance to destroy evil forever.

through DARKENING WOODS...the ONE RING glinting on a CHAIN
around his neck.

<b>                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            But the hearts of Men are easily
            corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a
            will of its own.

SUDDENLY!    ARROWS FLY!   They are ambushed by ORCS...ISILDUR
<b>SCREAMS!
</b>
<b>                                                     FADE TO BLACK

FADE UP: ISILDUR MATERIALIZES UNDER WATER...as THE RING slips
slowly from his finger. Ripples of LIGHT play across
ISILDUR'S PALE FACE...he is DEAD.

<b>                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            It betrayed Isildur to his death.

IMAGE: THE RING falls through the MURKY WATERS of the RIVER
<b>ANDUIN.
</b>
<b>                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            And some things that should not have been

FADE UP: The waters of the ANDUIN RIVER lie dark and
undisturbed.

<b>                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            And for two and a half thousand years the
            Ring passed out of all knowledge.

IMAGE: SILT SWIRLS...A THIN WHITE HAND reaches
down...grasping the RING...

<b>                      GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>            Until, when chance came, it ensnared a

IMAGE: THE THIN WHITE HAND opens to reveal one ring.

<b>                      GOLLUM (V.O.)

<b>IMAGE: MIST SHROUDED MOUNTAINS...
</b>
<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
</b>          The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who
          took it deep into the tunnels of the
          Misty Mountains.

IMAGE: THE GLOOM of a MOUNTAIN CAVERN..a MURKY POOL of
WATER...in the DARKNESS the SHADOWY OUTLINE of an EMACIATED
<b>FIGURE.
</b>
<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And there, it consumed him. A RASPY VOICE
          mutters in the half light...

<b>                    GOLLUM
</b>          It came to me. My own.     My love...
              (ecstatic whisper)
          My preciousness.

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.)
</b>          The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long
          life. For five hundred years it poisoned
          his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's
          cave...

<b>                                                     FADE TO BLACK
</b>
<b>                       GALADRIEL (V.O.)   (CONT'D)
</b>          It waited.

FADE UP: Bathed in COLD MOONLIGHT, the WORLD lies DARK and
STILL...the unsettled quiet before the storm...

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          Darkness crept back into the forests of
          the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in the
          East...whispers of a nameless fear. And
          the Ring of Power perceived...its time
          had now come. It abandoned Gollum.

around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns,

from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned
faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and
drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the
tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories.
Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark
that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting
visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo
notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit,
Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away.

<b>                    FRODO
</b>          Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance.

<b>                     SAM
</b>               (horrified)
          I think I'll just have myself another
          ale.

<b>                    FRODO
</b>          Oh, no you don't. Go on.

Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of
his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing
throng of dancers.

Gandalf as he sets alight a particularly spectacular firework
that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests.

Close on: Bilbo is relating stories of his adventure to a
group of young hobbit children.

<b>                    BILBO
</b>              (melodramatic)
          So, there I was...at the mercy of three
          monstrous trolls...Have you ever heard of
          a troll? Do you know what a Troll is?
          Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly
          things..and they're arguing...arguing
          about how they were going to cook us!

upturned face...her eyes growing larger and larger.

          in a pie or whether they were going to
          sit on us one by one and squash us into
          jelly! But they spent so long arguing
          the whether-to's and why-for's that the
          sun's first light crept over the top of
          the trees...and turned them all to stone!

STUNNED GASPS from his young Audience greet his astonishing
feat! Close on: MERRY AND PIPPIN, two mischievous Young
Hobbits in their late teens. Pippin scrambles on to the back
of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework

Merry is holding out the big rocket...he looks aghast at the
fizzing fuse that Pippin has just lit.

<b>                    PIPPIN

Pippin attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to Merry.
WHOOSH! The two hobbits are suddenly blown off their feet in
a shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening
power. The ROCKET ZOOMS over the Party..It suddenly bursts
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden Dragon! Fire
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and Flies low
towards the startled crowd. Close on: Frodo watches the
Fireworks Dragon with alarm...but Bilbo is oblivious to the
Panicking crowd and impending danger!

As he hurriedly pulls Bilbo to the ground, just as the dragon
roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming express
train! Hobbits dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents
collapse, food flies everywhere. The fireworks dragon turns a
somersault and explodes over the hills with a deafening bang!
This gets the biggest Cheer of the night.

SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was
a compliment or not. CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to
themselves. CLOSE ON: Bilbo...a strange hum seems to fill his
head. A bead of sweat rolls down his brow.

Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and

          surprise.

<b>                    BILBO (CONT'D)

Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills

head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice:

blade shatters...the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist,
sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror,
throw themselves flat on the ground. THE RINGWRAITHS close in
on Frodo...a Venomous whisper dances in his head...

Frodo shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately resisting
the WRAITH'S WHISPERINGS... slow motion as his hand goes into
his pocket and pulls out the ring. The 5 Ringwraiths utter a
chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. Frodo is unable to resist any
longer, falls to his knees and slips on the ring. He
disappears.

Five Ghouls dressed in long Grey robes, with white hair, and
Pallid, ruthless faces. THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand
towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger. Frodo's
trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the
ring...he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away.
The witch king snarls and springs forward. He stabs at Frodo
with a wicked dagger! Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger
sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the
RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword in one hand, a flaming torch
in the other. He moves in slow motion, visible through a sea
of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint
image of a Ringwraith fleeing, his head engulfed in flames.

Elendil, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth.

to Strider, as if sensing a connection.

behind him.

backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo
winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps
in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him

Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo.

<b>                    BILBO
</b>          Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know.
          The blade glows blue when Orcs are
          close...and it's times like that, my lad,
          when you have to be extra careful.

Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail.

<b>                    BILBO (CONT'D)
</b>          Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light
          as a feather, and as hard as dragon
          scales. Let me see you put it on. Come
          on.

the Chain around his neck.

Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second
he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony,
groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes.
Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo
falters...his eyes filling with tears.

Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him.

Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws
down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to
the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a
distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying
smoke in the wind.

          never have come here.

<b>EXT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT
</b>
Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous
Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him
towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush
forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls
him to safety...Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20
more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils
as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the
creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is
flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature.
Aragorn hacks at a tentacle...Frodo is released, falling into
Boromir's arms.

<b>                    GANDALF
</b>          Into the mines!

<b>                     BOROMIR
</b>          Legolas!

Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a
few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of
the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from
the Creature... retreating into the Moria Chamber as many
Coiling arms seize the large doors.

<b>INT. MORIA GATE -- NIGHT
</b>
With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away,
creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face.
Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway... throwing the
Fellowship into Pitch Blackness.

They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf
cemetery. The graves are despoiled...dwarf skeletons are
strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in
dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister.

</b>          Yes...Smeagol he was once called...Before

         It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he
         had the chance.

<b>                   GANDALF
</b>         Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's
         hand. Many that live deserve death, and
         some that die deserve life. Can you give
         it to them, Frodo? Frodo frowns.

<b>                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
</b>         Do not be too eager to deal out death in
         judgment...even the very wise cannot see
         all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum
         has some part to play yet, for good or
         ill, before this is over. The pity of
         Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

<b>                   FRODO

<b>                   GANDALF
</b>         So do all who live to see such times, but
         that is not for them to decide. All we
         have to decide is what to do with the
         time that is given to us. There is a note
         of finality in Gandalf's voice.

<b>                   GANDALF (CONT'D)
</b>         There are other forces at work in this
         world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.
         Bilbo was meant to find the ring. In
         which case, you also were meant to have
         it...and that is an encouraging thought,
             (sudden brightness)
         Ah! That it's that way! Gandalf points

The Fellowship pass under an arched doorway into a black and
empty space. Gandalf pauses...

          taps his staff...for a brief moment a

blazes... like a silent Flash of Lightning.    Great shadows
spring up and flee...

<b>                    GANDALF

          of Dwarrowdelf! Frodo gasps at the brief
          sight of a vast roof, far above

their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone.
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls,
polished and smooth as glass.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Well, there's an eye opener and no
          mistake!

Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. Black arrows
are embedded in the timbers. Two goblin skeletons lie in the
doorway. Gimli rushes ahead...

Gimli rushes into another vast empty chamber... lit with a
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near
the roof. Dwarf and Goblin skeletons are piled high. In the
far corner sits a stone walled Well. A shaft of light falls
directly onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a
single oblong block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great
slab of white stone. Gimli falls to his knees...

<b>                    GIMLI

Gimli sobs.

Gandalf quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto
the white stone slab.

            feared.

Gandalf carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from
the white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed...and
appears to be covered in Dried Blood. The pages crack and
break as he opens it...

            are coming."

Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously...He stumbles against
the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton
tumbling in! Merry reaches out, Grabbing hold of Pippin
before he falls. The Fellowship freeze in stunned silence as
the armored skeleton clatters down the deep well...echoing
loudly!

catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in
his eyes.

and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave
troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in
2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of
Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into
Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits!
Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The
cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles
backwards...the huge club descends for the killing
blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword
slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back,
spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a
sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation
he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels
over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it
too, drops.

fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn
rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo
appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits

breath.

Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of
the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees,
taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the
mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of
the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east
of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale
gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land
appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away,
it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies
on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie

trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its
crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no
sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady
of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless,
unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn...

glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into     the water...

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo
reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror.

shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The
image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings
burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting
and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party
tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to
grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing
him entirely.

IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields
and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching
smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the
Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot-
stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell-
hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black
abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable
to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches
above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire
erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself
away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light
instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his
senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue,
unmoved, untouched by the horror.

Lurtz is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of Isengard..they run fast,
their powerful legs carrying them at speed.

<b>EXT. SILVERLODE RIVER BANK--DAWN
</b>
The Fellowship are in small elven boats. They row away from
the Lothlorien Shore into the Silverlode river. Elves
quietly watch them depart. Galadriel gives Frodo a small
Crystal Phial.

<b>                    GALADRIEL
</b>          Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the
          light of Earendil, our most beloved star.

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

As the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone,
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, Frodo
still hears her voice...

<b>                    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>          May it be a light for you in dark places,
          when all other lights go out.

<b>EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY
</b>
The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven
boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees
slowly give way to a brown and withered land.

<b>EXT. FOREST -- DAY
</b>
The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly
purpose.

<b>EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY
</b>
A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale
sky. Aragorn watches them with concern.

<b>EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN
</b>
The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky
gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly
paddling in the stern.

<b>                    ARAGORN
</b>              (quietly)
          Frodo.

Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide
on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot
pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of
Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power
and majesty.

<b>                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
</b>          The Argonath...

Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself.

</b>              (deeply moved)
          Long have I desired to look upon the
          kings of old...my kin.

The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes
them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet.

reveal a large lake only a mile down river...

As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded
shore.

<b>                    ARAGORN
</b>          We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the

          Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding
          our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable
          labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And
          after that gets even better...a
          festering, stinking marshland, far as the
          eye can see.

at Gimli's feet...

Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his
eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp
bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone!

<b>EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY
</b>
Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His
feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes
follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the
summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND!
Frodo freezes....

<b>                    BOROMIR

Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious.

<b>                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
</b>          I know why you seek solitude. You
          suffer, I see it day by day. Are you
          sure you do not suffer needlessly?

Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in
the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be
heard

<b>                    BOROMIR (CONT'D)
</b>          Let me help you. There are other ways,

Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself
up.

Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir.

<b>                     FRODO

Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring! Frodo
has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his
neck..and rams it on his finger.

<b>                    FRODO DISAPPEARS

shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind him, Boromir's
distraught voice carries from another dimension:

<b>                      BOROMIR (O.S.)
</b>            I'm sorry, Frodo...Frodo...

Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps...he clambers
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone
pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the
throne of mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around
him. Frodo peers out from the seat...the world seems to
shrink. In all directions, Views of far off lands telescope
towards him through the mist. IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of
holes in the misty mountains... flames rising from
Mirkwood...grim faced easterlings march to war...black ships
sailing into the south. All the power of the Dark Lord is in
motion. Frodo moves his gaze towards the east...fire explodes
against the smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills
Frodo's vision. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong,
tower of adamant: Barad-dur, FORTRESS OF SAURON!

<b>SUDDENLY!   SAURON'S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF

the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight,
seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring
off his finger...

Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen...below the
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.

Frodo uncurls his fist...in is palm lies the ring! It
glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun...Aragorn's
eyes are drawn to it.

<b>                    FRODO (CONT'D)

Amon Hen behind Aragorn!

Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he
brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as
others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside,
away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst
the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he
is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into
the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow.
Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe.

chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another
arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and
Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI.

charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock
into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races
towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI
arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI
lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven

</b>           They will look for his coming from the
           white tower...but he will not return.

<b>EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY
</b>
On the lakeshore Frodo stands in front of one of the Elvish
Boats, the ring in his palm. A distraught Sam...running as
hard as he can through the forest...

<b>                        SAM
</b>           Mr. Frodo!

Close on: Frodo looks to the far side of the river...the
camera moves in on the ring.

<b>                     FRODO (V.O.)
</b>           I wish the ring had never come to me..I
           wish none of this had happened...

Tears fall down Frodo's face...

<b>                     GANDALF (V.O.)
</b>           So do all who lie to see such times...but
           that is not for them to decide. All we
           have to decide is what to do with the
           time that is given us.

With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his
vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish
boat into the water... Sam bursts through the trees and runs
toward the lake...Frodo is already paddling away.

<b>                     SAM
</b>               (anguished)
           Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo! Frodo, in
           the boat, paddling steadfastly away from
           the

shore..tears in his eyes..the voice of Sam carried on the
wind. Frodo whispers to himself

<b>                        FRODO
</b>           No, Sam.

Sam looks at the water...then at the boat.

SPLASH!   FRODO turns to see Sam launching himself into the
water.



<b>                                                     (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                    FRODO (CONT'D)
</b>          Go back,Sam. I'm going to Mordor alone.

Sam splashes hopelessly toward the boat.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          Of course you are...and I'm coming with
          you!

<b>                    FRODO
</b>          You can't swim.

Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing...Frodo
drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat...

<b>                       FRODO (CONT'D)
</b>                 (frightened)
          Sam!

Sam is underwater...hands flailing helplessly as he sinks.
Close on: Frodo's hand grasping Sam's... Frodo pulls a
bedraggled and half drowned Sam into the boat. Frodo and Sam
look at each other, out of breath, tears and water streaming
down both their faces.

<b>                     SAM
</b>          I made a promise, Mr. Frodo...a promise.
              (fierce passion)
          "Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."
              (sobs)
          And I don't mean to...I don't mean to.

<b>                    FRODO
</b>              (crying)
          Oh, Sam!

Frodo starts to laugh through his tears...the two friends
hug.

<b>                    FRODO (CONT'D)
</b>          Come on then..

The two Hobbits row through the water...

<b>EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL -- DAY
</b>
Slow motion: Looking down on swiftly flowing
water...Boromir's body slides under camera.

He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his
chest..his broken horn at his side. Suddenly... the boat
drops away from camera...as it plunges over the massive falls
of Rauros, disappearing into the vapor below.

<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                    LEGOLAS
</b>          If we are quick, we will catch Frodo and
          Sam before nightfall.

Aragorn looks towards the far shore; Frodo and Sam's small
Boat can be seen lying on the distant Riverbank as Frodo and
Sam make off into the forest beyond. He doesn't react.
Legolas turns and looks at Aragorn.

<b>                    LEGOLAS (CONT'D)
</b>          You mean not to follow them...

<b>                    ARAGORN
</b>          Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

<b>                    GIMLI
</b>          Then it has all been in vain...the
          fellowship has failed.

<b>                    ARAGORN
</b>          Not if we hold true to each other. We
          will not abandon Merry and Pippin to
          torment and death, not while we have
          strength left.

Aragorn pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it
on.

<b>                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
</b>          Leave all that can be spared behind...
          CLOSE ON: ARAGORN..a steely light in his
          eye.

<b>                    ARAGORN (CONT'D)
</b>              (grimly)
          We travel light. Let's hunt some Orc.

<b>                       GIMLI
</b>          Yes!   Ha!

Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the Woods,
following the URUK-HAI trail.

<b>EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP -- DAY
</b>
Frodo and Sam scramble onto a high ridge.

A distant line of Saw toothed mountains below a dark,
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the
mountains....MORDOR!

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                     FRODO
</b>          Mordor!   I hope the others find a safer
          road.

<b>                    SAM
</b>              (simply)
          Strider'll look after them.

<b>                    FRODO
</b>          I don't suppose we'll ever see them
          again.

<b>                    SAM
</b>          We may yet, Mr. Frodo.   We may.

<b>                     FRODO
</b>          Sam?

Frodo looks at Sam with great affection..despite the grim
outlook, Sam is undeterred...

<b>                    FRODO (CONT'D)
</b>          I'm glad you're with me.
