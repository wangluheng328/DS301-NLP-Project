After the head of a Hessian horseman is stolen, the horseman returns from hell to take the heads of the people of Sleepy Hallow until its own is returned.
Constable Ichabod Crane is called in to investigate three murders.
Through his investigation he learns of the legend of the Headless Horseman, but he doesn't believe that the stories are true - until the horseman takes off the head of one of the elders right in front of his very eyes.
Now he must race to find out the origins of the horseman in order to send him back to his grave for good.
But the question remains...if the head was stolen once, how safe is it?
