Constable Ichabod Crane of the New York police arrives in the small village of Sleepy Hollow in 1799 to solve a mystery of murders.
With all the victims found with their heads missing, everybody in Sleepy Hollow is talking about the ghost of the "headless horseman".
He is supposedly out in the woods seeking revenge for his murder many years ago.
Crane, believing only in logic, refuses to believe the public's theory about the horseman and begins his investigations, only to find his faith shattered when he himself encounters the headless horseman.
A magical tale of sense against myth.
