Lake Placid - Well it would be, but; "somebody said that name was taken."
At least according to the local Sheriff.
When a man is eaten alive by an unknown creature, the local Game Warden (Pullman) teams up with a paleontologist (Fonda) from New York to find the beast.
Add to the mix an eccentric philanthropist with a penchant for "Crocs" (Platt), and here we go!
This quiet, remote lake is suddenly the focus of an intense search for a crocodile with a taste for live animals...and people!
