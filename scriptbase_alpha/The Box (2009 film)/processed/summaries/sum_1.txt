In the early morning of December 16, 1976, teacher Norma Lewis finds a box at the front door of the Virginia home she shares with her husband, Arthur, who opens the box to find a strange button unit, and a letter reading that a "Mr. Stewart" would visit them that evening.
That day, both Norma, who has a physical impairment, and Arthur, each receive devastating news in their respective workplaces.
In the evening, a creepy man with a deformed face appears at the home of Norma & Arthur, introducing himself as Arlington Stewart.
He gives the couple the key to open the button unit, along with an offer: If they press the button, they will receive $1 million.
However, a stranger somewhere in the world will have to die.
The Lewises are then told that they have 24 hours to make the decision.
The reluctant Norma & Arthur do not believe Stewart, so Norma presses the button... changing their lives forever.
