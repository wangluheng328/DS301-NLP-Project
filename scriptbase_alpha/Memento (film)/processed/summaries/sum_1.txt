A memory inside a memory, Memento is a complicated head spinning adventure.
Leonard is determined to avenge his wife's murder.
However, unable to remember anything that happens day-to-day due to a condition he sustained, short term memory loss, he has to write himself note after note that still don't mean anything after he falls asleep.
The film goes back in time to reveal each little bit of the puzzle as he tries to find out the person who killed his wife and makes the audience feel just as confused as he is.
The narrative closely follows a phone call Pearce has in which he talks about Sammy Jankis a former client of his who he believed had the same condition.
The film takes an unexpected twist as the two characters have a lot more in common than is initially put across.
