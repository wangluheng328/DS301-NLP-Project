A night in San Francisco, during our time: A young journalist follows a man through the streets and they end up in an anonymous room.
When the journalist starts to interview the man, the stranger tells him that he is a vampire, being over 200 years old.
The journalist doesn't believe him, but after the man proves it's true, he tells his story: His name is Louis and in 18th century New Orleans he was 24, by this time owner of an estate and a widower already.
One night, when he once again was destroying himself by drinking and other things, he was found by Lestat, a vampire, who bit him.
But even after becoming a vampire, life wasn't fun for Louis until one night he met a little girl, Claudia, who would change his existence forever.
