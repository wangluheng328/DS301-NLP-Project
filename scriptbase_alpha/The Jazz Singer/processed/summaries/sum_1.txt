In New York, the thirteen year-old Jewish Jakie is the son of the cantor Rabinowitz.
When Rabinowitz is informed by Moisha Yudelson that Jakie is singing ragtime in a club, he beats his son.
The traditional cantor expects that Jakie sings in the synagogue like his previous generations did, but the boy dreams on becoming a jazz singer.
Jakie leaves home pursuing his dreams.
Years later, Jakie is in London where his artistic name is Jack Robin.
When he meets the famous stage performer Mary Dale, she helps him in his career.
Sooner he travels to New York for the greatest chance of his life in an important show on Broadway and he visits his parents.
However, his father expels him from home.
On the opening day, the manipulative Moisha Yudelson invites him to sing in the Atonement Day since his father is very ill, but the emotional blackmail of the Jewish leader does not work.
When Jakie is ready to the rehearsal, Moisha brings Jakie's beloved mother to press him to sing in the Synagogue.
Now Jakie shall choose between his career and Mary Dale and the bonds with his family and religion.
