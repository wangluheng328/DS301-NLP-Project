Jakie Rabinowitz comes from a long line of cantors.
He has inherited the singing ability of the Rabinowitz men before him and has also inherited his place as cantor at the local synagogue following his father.
But Jakie instead wants a life as a jazz singer, something he has known since he was a young teen.
This move places a wedge between him and his father, who disowns his son.
A grown Jakie, choosing the stage name Jack Robin, does have some success as a jazz singer in touring musical revues after Mary Dale, an established musical performer, hears him sing.
When Mary gets her big break to star in a musical revue on Broadway, she decides to bring Jack with her.
But a chance at reconciliation with his father may come at the price of his Broadway debut.
