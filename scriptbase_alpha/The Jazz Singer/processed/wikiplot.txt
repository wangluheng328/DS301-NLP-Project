Cantor Rabinowitz wants his son to carry on the generations-old family tradition and become a cantor at the synagogue in the Jewish ghetto of Manhattan's Lower East Side.
But down at the beer garden, thirteen-year-old Jakie Rabinowitz is performing popular, so-called jazz, tunes.
Moisha Yudelson spots the boy and tells Jakie's father, who drags him home.
Jakie clings to his mother, Sara, as his father declares, "I'll teach him better than to debase the voice God gave him!"
Jakie threatens: "If you whip me again, I'll run away — and never come back!"
After the whipping, Jakie kisses his mother goodbye and, true to his word, runs away.
At the Yom Kippur service, Rabinowitz mournfully tells a fellow celebrant, "My son was to stand at my side and sing tonight – but now I have no son."
As the sacred Kol Nidre is sung, Jakie sneaks back home to retrieve a picture of his loving mother.

Approximately 10 years later, Jakie has changed his name to the more assimilated Jack Robin.
Jack is called up from his table at a cabaret to perform on stage.

Jack wows the crowd with his energized rendition.
Afterward, he is introduced to the beautiful Mary Dale, a musical theater dancer.
"There are lots of jazz singers, but you have a tear in your voice," she says, offering to help with his budding career.
With her help, Jack eventually gets his big break: a leading part in the new musical April Follies.

Back at the family home Jack left long ago, the elder Rabinowitz instructs a young student in the traditional cantorial art.
Jack appears and tries to explain his point of view, and his love of modern music, but the appalled cantor banishes him: "I never want to see you again — you jazz singer!"
As he leaves, Jack makes a prediction: "I came home with a heart full of love, but you don't want to understand.
Some day you'll understand, the same as Mama does."
