                                            by

                      Melvin Frank, Norman Krasna and Norman Panama

<b>                
</b>
<b>               FULL SHOT - REAR AREA - (DAY) - (GLASS)
</b>
               This is December 24, 1944, in the first safe area directly 
               behind the battle line, in the Italian theatre.

               In the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen 
               and artillery rumbles are heard.  The battered terrain shows 
               the effects of battle.

               In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with 
               camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage.  
               Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and 
               the ground.  A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is 
               nearby.

<b>               MED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA
</b>
               We can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep 
               with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's 
               car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation 
               area.  A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside 
               him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON.

<b>               JEEP - MED. CLOSE
</b>
               As it jounces along.  General Waverly is weather-beaten and 
               weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long 
               wear.  General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean 
               and fresh from the Pentagon.

               He is staring off at the recreation area.

<b>                                     GENERAL CARLTON
</b>                              (To Adjutant)
                         What's this all about, Colonel?

<b>                                     ADJUTANT
</b>                              (Turning)
                         A little entertainment for the men, 
                         sir.  Tonight's Christmas Eve.

<b>                                     GENERAL CARLTON
</b>                         These men are moving up tonight.  
                         They should be lined up for full 
                         inspection!

               The jeep has come to a halt.

<b>                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
</b>                              (Eyeing him)
                         You're absolutely right.
                              (To Adjutant)
                         There's no Christmas in the Army, 
                         Colonel.

<b>                                     ADJUTANT
</b>                         Yes, sir.

               Waverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep.

<b>                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
</b>                              (To Carlton)
                         There's always a slip-up or two during 
                         a change in command.  The men get a 
                         little loose.  But I know I'm leaving 
                         them in good hands.

<b>                                     GENERAL CARLTON
</b>                              (Stiffly)
                         Thank you.
                              (To Driver)
                         Sergeant, take me to headquarters 
                         immediately!  We'll have those men 
                         turned out on the double!

               The Sergeant looks at General Waverly.

<b>                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
</b>                         Goodbye, Sergeant.  Take the short 
                         cut.

<b>                                     SERGEANT
</b>                         Yes, sir!

               The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant 
               makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him.

<b>               TWO SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY AND ADJUTANT
</b>
               The Adjutant turns to him.

<b>                                     ADJUTANT
</b>                         That's not the way to headquarters!

<b>                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
</b>                         Joe, you know that, and I know that, 
                         but the new General doesn't know it.
                         Or he won't for about an hour and a 
                         half.

<b>                                     ADJUTANT
</b>                         That Sergeant'll be a private 
                         tomorrow!

<b>                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
</b>                         Yes... isn't he lucky?

               He takes the Adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the 
               recreation area.

<b>               RAISED PLATFORM - MED. SHOT
</b>
               CAPTAIN BOB WALLACE (BING CROSBY) is wearing a makeshift 
               beard and Santa Claus hat and PRIVATE PHILIP DAVIS (DONALD 
               O'CONNOR) is in combat clothes.  They are doing a number to 
               entertain the soldiers, WHAT DOES A SOLDIER WANT FOR 
               CHRISTMAS?  During introduction, we

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

               just starting to take seats, off to one side where they are 
               not noticed by the performers.

<b>               5B.
</b>
<b>               GROUP SHOT - ABOUT 6 SOLDIERS

               seated in audience.  They look off, see General, start to 
               rise.

<b>               5C.
</b>
<b>               TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT
</b>
               The General notices them - motions for them to sit down again, 
               indicating he doesn't want attention called to himself.

<b>               5D.
</b>
<b>               PLATFORM - FULL SHOT
</b>
               The number concludes to applause.  Bob holds up his hand for 
               silence.  He removes his beard.

<b>                                     BOB
</b>                         Thanks, fellows.  I guess by now you 
                         know the Old Man's being replaced by 
                         a new Commanding General fresh out 
                         of the Pentagon... this divisions's 
                         been awfully lucky so far, but tonight 
                         they're running a special on St. 
                         Christophers at the PX... The Old 
                         Man's heading back to the rear - 
                         he's never moved in that direction 
                         in his life.  All I can say is, we 
                         owe so much to General Waverly and 
                         the way --

<b>                                     WAVERLY'S VOICE

<b>                         ATTENTION!
</b>
               Automatically, Bob stiffens.  Phil does the same.

<b>               AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT
</b>
               Every man is at attention and every head has turned to where 
               General Waverly has taken up a position near the front of 
               the platform.

<b>                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
</b>                         Captain Wallace, button your shirt.
                         You're out of uniform!
                              (Bob, grinning, hastily 
                              buttons his shirt)
                         This division is now under the command 
                         of General Harold G. Carlton, and I 
                         don't want anyone to forget it -- 
                         not that he'll let you.  He's tough -- 
                         just what this sloppy outfit needs.  
                         You'll be standing inspection night 
                         and day -- you may even learn how to 
                         march.  And if you don't give him 
                         everything you got, I may come back 
                         and fight for the enemy.  Merry 
                         Christmas!

               The boys respond with "Merry Christmas".

               He turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat.  They play 
               THE OLD MAN, which is sung by the entire outfit.

               The General stands at attention through the first chorus, 
               visibly moved.  During the second chorus he starts up the 
               aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is 
               bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help.  
               Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns, 
               faces the men and salutes them.  The men return the salute.  
               (This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the 
               enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.)  There is a Red Cross 
               ambulance standing by.

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a hand lighting a candle on

               enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including 
               Bob and Phil.  One of the men looks at his wristwatch.  Now

               This is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing WHITE 
               CHRISTMAS.  Phil accompanies him on a harmonica.  Toward the 
               end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music.  A 
               shell BURSTS in the vicinity.

</b>
               Phil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel 
               burst.  This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which 
               he thinks is unnecessary.  Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, 
               brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song 
               left off.  Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him.

               The orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song.  (To 
               be decided upon.)  The vocal is shared by Bob, Betty, Judy 
               and Phil, individually.  Toward the end of the vocal Phil 
               dances Judy out to the terrace overlooking the water.  This 
               blends into their dance.  The staging of the number should 
               reunite the four principals by the end of the number.  The 
               audience applauds and they all go back to their booth.

               He straightens up, dusts off his hands, and as he turns to 
               take the letters, we see for the first time that he is General 
               Waverly.  He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast, 
               shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work.

               They are doing the number, SISTERS, on the floor.  THE CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK to reveal the scene.  There is a scant audience 
               distributed at several tables, totaling not more than fourteen 
               in number.  Not far from the kitchen entrance Bob and Phil 
               are sitting at one table.

               Martha is seen doing general overseeing, principally acting 
               as hostess.  Susan doubles between the cashier's desk and 
               helping out at table.

               They are admiring the performance.  Phil indicates for Bob 
               to look in this direction.  Bob does.

               They finish the number and are applauded enthusiastically, 
               but the few people in the audience don't make for much 
               clatter.  One set of hands seems to be applauding loudest 
               and clearest.

               He is the one doing the enthusiastic applauding.  He walks 
               toward the boys, still applauding.  They applaud too.  The 
               girls enter the scene, to sit with the boys.

               Martha is only applauding politely, until Waverly glares at 
               her.  Then her enthusiasm is boundless.

               The scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying 
               preparations for the show.  The little stage has been enlarged - 
               the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall 
               pushed back a little farther.  There is hammering and painting 
               going on in various parts of the room.  Trunks have been 
               unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks 
               arrive.  Girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around, 
               do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick 
               in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness 
               of the previous scene.

               THE CAMERA TRUCKS through all the activity, taking in our 
               group at the doorway, which features Bob and Phil, the girls 
               standing nearby.  Martha and Susan are amazed at the activity.

                         had six checkouts, and when they 
                         heard about this they decided to 
                         stay.

</b>                         Phil'd be more fun in a night club, 
                         but eventually a girl wants a pipe 
                         and slipper fellow.  That's Bob, 
                         smoking a pipe and petting a cocker 
                         spaniel.  Still, Phil could learn to 
                         smoke a pipe.  Breaking a fellow in 
                         to suit you is something every girl 
                         should go through.  I hear it's half 
                         the fun.  Which one do you like

                              eyes)

               Music has underscored this scene.  Betty is wide awake.

               She is looking toward the window.  As the curtains billow 
               outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence, 
               putting out his pipe.  This is followed by an equally diffused 
               figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture, 
               and joining Bob.  Bob takes her in his arms.  At this point 
               we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter.  
               This causes the diffusion to vanish, and Betty gets out of 
               bed and puts on her robe.

               He gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  His preoccupation 
               with the food will permit Betty's expression to be more 
               obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audience 
               of her regard for Bob,  since their significance must escape

               Bob begins to sing COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS, as he prepares the 
               warm milk and hands it to her.  She drinks it down.  As he

               table,  Betty, pretending to be sleepy, leans her head toward 
               Bob.

               He takes a pillow from a nearby chair and puts it between 
               her head and her chair.  She waits, eyes closed, expectantly.  
               But Bob gets to his feet, and carefully tiptoes to the door 
               and exits, closing it softly behind him.  After a moment, 
               Betty snaps on the light, throws the pillow on the floor, 
               and rests her chin in her hand, disappointed and wide awake.

               sitting around the room.  The orchestra is playing the 
               introduction to Phil's number, which will employ a line of 
               six girls who are just coming on the floor.

               Bob is on stage supervising the rehearsal.  Judy is standing 
               across from the piano.  Betty is seated on the sidelines 
               with her legs stretched over two chairs.

               She is knitting a loud colored argyle sock.  Phil, standing 
               close by, has just finished rolling up a ball of yarn.  He 
               looks at Betty's knitting, then at his feet.

               and high chair, where Albert is seated, not far from his

               From his position, Phil, in a series of leaps and turns, 
               reaches center floor and begins his solo.

               As Phil comes to a portion where he speeds up his steps she 
               unconsciously speeds up her knitting, Bob has seen her, and 
               he looks from her knitting and her look of admiration, which 
               he mistakes for affection, and then looks from the socks to 
               Phil's feet.  At the end of the number, which is applauded 
               by the witnesses, Judy runs to Phil and hugs and kisses him,

               This is the party later that evening.  Some people are 
               dancing.  Others are grouped about, and there is a general 
               home party atmosphere.  The General, Martha and Susan are 
               seen helping everyone to feel at home.

               The CAMERA STARTS ON A LONG SHOT and DOLLIES THROUGH THE 
               GROUP, passing Sylvia, where ad lib comments about the 
               impending baby are sketchily HEARD.  The CAMERA CONTINUES 
               toward the piano, where Bob and Betty are examining the music 
               sheet of A MAN CHASES A GIRL.

               Betty looks up and the CAMERA FOLLOWS her look to Phil, who 
               is dancing with Rita.  Rita nestles up close to Phil.  This 
               is seen by Bob and Betty.  Bob smiles.

               cuts in on Rita, who is displeased, but can do nothing but 
               yield.  Bob's reaction still implies that this is 
               understandable since Betty loves Phil.  He turns back toward 
               the piano, and other couples are between him and Betty and 
               Phil.

               In the background we see the General in the butler's pantry 
               getting some drinks for the guests.  He is not seen by Betty 
               who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few

               There is a pause, and Waverly, who has been watching each

                         I had to deliver the telegram.

               Something bothers Bob about this story.  He looks searchingly 
               at Betty, puzzled.  He does not notice Waverly, who watches 
               him watching Betty.

<b>               LONG SHOT - RAILROAD STATION - DAY
</b>
               Train about to leave.  The General is in the foreground 
               sitting in the buggy.  Betty is saying goodbye to him.

               Bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage.

<b>                                     GENERAL

                              of train)
                         Where are you going to be?

<b>                                     BETTY
</b>                         The Carousel.

               The General looks at her, questioningly.

<b>                                     BETTY
</b>                              (Whispering, during a 
                              lull in the noise)
                         I sent them a telegram this morning.

               The General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and crosses 
               to the train, starting up the steps.  The notion behind this 
               scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due 
               to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam.  The manner of 
               playing, though, indicates the sentiment.  To emphasize it: 
               Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully 
               realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, 
               consciously, her affection.  We hear Betty:

<b>                                     BETTY
</b>                         Take care of my little sister.

                         about the menfolk.  Now don't forget 
                         to write.

</b>                         I'll send you picture postcards.

               Not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their 
               spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watching 
               the scene with a whimsical look.  He, as does the audience, 
               realizes Bob's true feelings.  As the train starts to leave, 
               Betty and Bob shake hands.  She holds his handshake a little 
               longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with 
               the train.  Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after 
               the train, puzzled.

               Everybody is so engaged, except those actively helping Phil

               knitted sock, the one she knitted on previously.  He looks 
               through the box for its mate.

               There is none.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Bob, puzzled.

               applauds.  He can't believe it.  He reaches his table, 
               decorated with flowers, and recognizes he is the guest of 
               honor.  From the lobby we hear the outfit SINGING the opening 
               strains of THE OLD MAN.

               All eyes turn to the lobby entrance, through which the old 
               outfit marches, and continues to the stage, and then back to

               Through the window behind the General we have seen it begin 
               to SNOW.  The General notices it for the first time, and his

               Underneath all this we have been hearing the introductory 
               music to WHITE CHRISTMAS, which is the number now in progress 
               on the stage.  Waverly now turns and walks into the dining

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Waverly on his entrance.  As he passes Susan, 
               we see she is reacting to something on the stage.

               CAMERA PASSES Waverly and moves to:

<b>               STAGE - FULL SHOT - MOVING CAMERA

               Center stage, there is a large cutout of a decorated Christmas 
               tree.  Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe, 
               etc.  Bob and Betty are seen singing.  Throughout action of 
               this number Phil and Judy dance.  In addition there is staged 
               movement by the ensemble.  Bob and Betty are on each side of 
               the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is 
               preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating 
               with one hand behind the cutout tree.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Bob and Betty as their movement takes them 
               behind the tree.  It is now that we see very clearly that 
               the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has 
               opened; in b.g. we see the Vermont countryside being covered 
               by the falling snow.  Also, we see pine trees in the snow 
               that are decorated.

               Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of 
               mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock 
               she gave him in scene 110.  Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe 
               and the sock, and smiles at Betty.

               She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is 
               wearing the other sock.  They laugh and embrace.
