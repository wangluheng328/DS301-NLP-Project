He's Larry Crowne, unemployed after years as a Navy cook and then a job in big-box retail.
He enrolls in community college to be more employable, taking informal speaking, economics 101, and composition.
To save money, he parks his SUV and buys a motor scooter, which gains him entr√©e into a group of young students.
She's Mercy Tainot, dissatisfied with teaching and with her marriage to a writer turned blogger.
Larry's in Mercy's speech class: he's stiff, by the book, dull.
She's cranky and dismissive.
Can he find a new place in the world, and can she rediscover the rewards of teaching (and life)?
One night he sees her sitting at a bus stop; self-discovery begins.
