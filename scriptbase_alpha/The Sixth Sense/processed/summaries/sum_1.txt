Child psychologist Malcom Crowe is one night visited by an ex-patient named Vincent, angry, enraged.
He wounds Crowe, then kills himself.
A few months later, Crowe is visited by a 9-year old boy named Cole.
He sees dead people who do not know they are dead.
Because of this, he is called a freak in school.
Crowe, at first thinks he is seeing things, but after spending a lot of time with Cole (much to his wife's dismay), he discovers Cole may be seeing dead people after all.
