Child psychiatrist Malcolm Crowe is confronted one night by his former patient Vincent Gray who he failed to help.
After Vincent shoots Crowe in the stomach and kills himself, Crowe can't stop thinking about it.
A few months later he is hired to help a troubled boy named Cole Sear, who has many of the same problems Vincent had.
Crowe sees a chance to redeem himself, but doubts his ability to reach the boy, particularly when Cole claims to see ghosts who don't know they're dead.
