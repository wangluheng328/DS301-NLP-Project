When an informer, his family and two FBI agents are killed by an international gang of drug dealers, Detectives James 'Sonny' Crockett and Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs are assigned to work undercover for the FBI in a joint operation to disclose which agency leaked the information to the criminals.
They plot a scheme to approach with their team of agents to the manager José Yero and later to the druglord Arcángel de Jesús Montoya.
Along the mission, Sonny meets the accountant, investor and mistress of Montoya, Isabella, and after a romantic affair, they fall in love for each other, blurring his professional commitment with his personal feelings.
