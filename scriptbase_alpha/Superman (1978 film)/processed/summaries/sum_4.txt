The infant Kal-El, of the planet Krypton, makes his journey to Earth in a ship constructed by his father, Jor-El, just as the planet explodes.
Crashing down in the midwest United States, the boy is adopted by farmers Jonathan and Martha Kent.
After Jonathan's death several years later, Kal-El - now known as Clark Kent - learns of his true identity from the ghost of Jor-El.
He has great powers - he can fly, outrun a train, and lift up a 1-ton truck.
But it isn't until he gains a job at Metropolis' Daily Planet newspaper that things begin to come together.
One night, after leaving work, he sees a helicopter crash on the building's roof.
From this night on, he will be known by a new name...SUPERMAN!
His mission: "To fight for truth, justice and the American Way".
Lex Luthor, however, has other ideas - to sabotage a pair of nuclear missiles and use them to create an earthquake that will wipe out the California coastline.
Superman must race against time and stop a sinister plan by Luthor to eliminate him before millions of innocent people are killed.
