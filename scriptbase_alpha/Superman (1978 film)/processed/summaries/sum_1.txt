This movie begins on Krypton, where Superman's father sends him off to Earth as a young child.
He grows up to be a perfectly normal newspaper reporter named Clark Kent.
At least, he appears perfectly normal, until he transforms into Superman - flying around with his underpants over his tights, saving the day.
When the evil Lex Luthor plans to take over the world, Superman is the only one who can stop him.
