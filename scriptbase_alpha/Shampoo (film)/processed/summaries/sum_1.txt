George Roundy, is a Beverly Hills hairstylist who's uncontrolled libido stands between him and his ambitions.
He wants the security of a relationship.
He wants to be a hairdressing "star" and open his own salon.
But the fact that he beds down with the wife, daughter and mistress of a potential backer doesn't help.
It also does little for his relationship with his current girlfriend.
As this tongue-in-cheek look at the sexual revolution rolls on, the babe juggling, stress and lies all wear George down.
He wants so much.
But a hungry kid loose in a candy store easily gets sick.
