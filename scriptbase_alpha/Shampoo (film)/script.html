<title>Shampoo - by Robert Towne and Warren Beatty
</title>
<b>
</b><pre>	
	DARK SCREEN - NOVEMBER 4th, 1968
<b>	
</b>	A darkness where even outlines are not discernible. There is
	a dim point of light coming from a dot on the HI-FI which is
	PLAYING the BEACH BOYS: "When we could say good night and
	still stay together... wouldn't it be niiiice?... we could be
	married, then we could be happy, wouldn't it be niiiiice?"
<b>	
</b>	Through it there has been the SOUND of BANGING, distinct and
	rhythmic. It GROWS LOUDER as the MUSIC ENDS. There are also
	WHIMPERING SOUNDS from a woman.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     Oh, no.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     ... what?...
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     That headboard.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Nobody can hear it.
<b>	
</b>	It BANGS a couple of more times.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     I can. It makes me nervous.
<b>	
</b>	It continues to bang until Felicia screams, over the banging
	of the headboard. She follows the scream with a few yelps.
	Silence. Now the SOUND of the PHONE RINGING.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>	          (complimentary)
	     Oh my God... Jesus... Jesus
	     Christ... Jesus H. Christ.
<b>	
</b>	The PHONE CONTINUES TO RING.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>	          (a slightly different
	          tone)
	     You going to answer it?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	          (meaning no)
	     Uh-uh.
<b>	
</b>	It CONTINUES TO RING.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	          (being for her very
	          mischievous)
	     Want me to?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Let it ring.
<b>	
</b>	And it does. It CONTINUES TO RING, killing all other
	considerations.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     Boy, whoever she is, she doesn't
	     give up.
<b>	
</b>	After a moment's fumbling, George finally picks it up.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Hello...
	          (a little surprised)
	     Ah, hi.
<b>	
</b>	The GIRL'S VOICE on the other end of the phone can be HEARD
	only FITFULLY, when George holds the receiver loosely by his
	ear. It is TINA.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA'S VOICE
</b>	     What took you so long?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Wasn't sure it was you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA'S VOICE
</b>	          (muffled)
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     I... uh... I... uh... can't.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA'S VOICE
</b>	          (laughter, sizing it up
	          immediately)
	     All right, who're you with? Jill?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     No.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA'S VOICE
</b>	          (lively but muffled)
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     No.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA'S VOICE
</b>	          (she's heard Felicia)
	     Awww --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     I'll call you back.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA'S VOICE
</b>	     Come on by.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     I'll call you back...
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA'S VOICE
</b>	          (raucous laughter,
	          muffled)
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	          (to Tina)
	     Okay, okay...
<b>	
</b>	He hangs up. Felicia has fished for a cigarette, lit it and
	coughed.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     You're rude. I mean, you're very
	     rude.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Hey, I tried to get her off the
	     phone.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     You know what I'm talking about.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     No, baby. Now look, that girl that
	     called -- I have to talk to her,
	     she'll do something.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     Like what?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     I don't know, kill herself. She's
	     O.D.'d four times.
<b>	
</b>	This calms Felicia. A pause.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     Well, is she your girlfriend?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     No.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     Are you in love with her?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Her?
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     Are you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     No.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     Then it's not your problem.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     It isn't?
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     No. You know too many sick ladies.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     I guess so.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     How do you expect to get anything
	     done if you allow yourself to get
	     sidetracked? Particularly in your
	     business... you deal with women
	     every day...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     I guess so.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     Don't worry, honey, I'll protect
	     you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Okay.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE
</b>	     God, I adore you.
<b>	
</b>	She starts to kiss him, the SHEETS are RUSTLING. The PHONE
<b>	RINGS.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA'S VOICE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Shit.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Hello.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL'S VOICE
</b>	     You're home.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Yeah.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL'S VOICE
</b>	     I'm coming over.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     I'll call you back.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL'S VOICE
</b>	          (firm but frightened)
	     No you won't.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     What do you mean?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL'S VOICE
</b>	     I told you I get 'scared up here,
	     so if you're not coming right
	     now...
	          (muffled)
	     I'm not kidding.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Okay.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL'S VOICE
</b>	          (muffled)
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE'S VOICE
</b>	     Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
<b>	
</b>	George flips on the light.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Whoever she is, she doesn't give
	     up, does she?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No.
<b>	
</b>	Bare-assed, George swings out of bed, looking for something.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     What're you looking for?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     My keys.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     I thought you said you weren't
	     going anywhere.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this
	     friend of mine for a few minutes.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     You mean that girl, don't you?
<b>	
</b>	George finds his keys and has begun throwing on his clothes,
	a pair of crumpled levis, and a brightly-colored shirt. He
	leaves his shorts and socks on the floor. He's obviously in a
	hurry.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What girl, she's not a girl, she's
	     just a friend of mine.
<b>	
</b>	Felicia gives him a long hard look as he dresses.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     You son of a bitch.
<b>	
</b>	George sighs, shrugs, and heads toward the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>	     Wait, at least wait 'til I'm
	     dressed. I'm going.
<b>	
</b>	She starts to get out of bed.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>	     Oh, Christ -- do you have any
	     Kleenex?
<b>	
</b>	George is a little desperate now. He runs to the bathroom,
	tosses her the whole box.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>	     Thanks a lot.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (desperate)
	     Listen, baby, don't leave, really.

	     Yeah, I think so.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

</b><b>	               FELICIA

<b>

</b>	George on his bike threads through traffic on the Strip. OVER

	Monday." He pulls up to a signal beside a faded Eugene

	nightgown.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL (CONT'D)
</b>	     I've had these dumb dreams lately.

<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL

<b>

</b>	Jill laughs. George comes over to her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)

</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Nobody's gonna get you but me!
<b>	
</b>	He leaps after her and she screams, delighted. George chases
	her into the bedroom. Jill screams. He throws her on the bed
	and leaps on top of her, kissing her. She likes it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)

</b><b>	               GEORGE

</b>	     What?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm
	     gonna open the shop. I'm getting it
	     together.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     How?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (rising)
	     Right now -- I'm at the epitome of
	     my life.
	     Right now I feel so good I'm afraid
	     something's gonna happen.
<b>	
</b>	He gets off the bed. Jill is fascinated.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     When I was a little kid, I used to

	     Europe.
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I just came from a meeting... I
	     can't talk about it now, baby. But
	     in a few days -- see I'm disgusted
	     with my life.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I thought you said you were at the
	     epitome of your life.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I am, I am. But I've had it with

	     working for me... I'm gonna retire
	     or settle down or something.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     What about me?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

	     You're different.
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL

</b><b>	               GEORGE

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Why am I great?
<b>	
</b>	George is a little annoyed.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Jesus, I don't know. You're great.
<b>	
</b>	Jill looks a little perplexed.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Will we live together?

</b>	George in bed, beginning to sleep. Hubert Humphrey expresses
	opinion at his chances tomorrow on TV.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Maybe you don't even like children.
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (grumpy)
	     Okay, baby. Okay...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Jackie says she wouldn't bring

</b><b>	INT. BANK OF AMERICA - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	George sits talking, with MR. PETTIS, a bank vice president.
	He is perspiring a little. Somebody's breathing rather
	heavily. It's Mr. Pettis seated behind his desk now and
	opposite George. He's going over something.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS
</b>	          (looking up now)
	     Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

</b>	     She is.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS
</b>	     I went to school with her husband.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Great.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS
</b>	          (pleasantly affirmative)
	     So you want to go in business for
	     yourself?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Right.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS
</b>	     And you need money?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Right, that's right.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS
</b>	          (smiling)
	     You do know what money's like these
	     days.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (no)
	     Well, yeah... you know.
<b>	
</b>	Pettis grabs a sheet off his desk, one in plastic containing
	rates.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS
</b>	     Jesus, look at this. Nine, nine and
	     three quarters -- that's our prime
	     rate. And I'll tell you something
	     else: the big boys are going for
	     it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     They are?
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS
</b>	     After all, Mr. Roundy, we're paying
	     six percent. Six percent. FHA's at
	     eight and a half -- no, we won't be
	     going back to the old days.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I guess not...
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS
</b>	     It's got nothing to do with
	     inflation. Rates, for example, rise
	     independently of tight money if you
	     look at interest curves carefully.
	     Historically, that's always been
	     true, though most people don't
	     realize it.
<b>	
</b>	An uncomfortable pause.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS (CONT'D)
</b>	     What sort of references do you

<b>

<b>	
</b>	Jill looks at Jackie.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Well, he is.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	          (annoyed)
	     So what's your point?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Jill, I'm just trying to be
	     helpful.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I know, I'm sorry.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     I spent three years with him. I
	     just couldn't take it not knowing
	     who was gonna pay the rent... his
	     unemployment or mine. George was
	     adorable but it drove me crackers.
	     Now at least I'm comfortable.
	     Lester does what he says he'll do.
	     Maybe you're happy living like a
	     gypsy. Are you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     George is great but I know what you
	     mean.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Face it, you can go around with
	     cute guys and get hung up on their
	     sexy bodies and things like that
	     but sooner or later you've got to
	     find somebody. Face it, time isn't
	     on your side.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I guess not.

</b><b>	INT. BANK OF AMERICA - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	George and Mr. Pettis.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (giving it all he's got)
	     I've got the customers... that's my
	     point. I'm the one they want. If I
	     had my own shop, they'd leave and
	     come to me. I have a lot of
	     customers.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PETTIS
</b>	     Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you
	     make out a financial statement?
	     It'll save us both some time. Miss
	     Michaels here can show you... have
	     it notarized and we'll see where we
	     go from there. Miss Michaels, would
	     you get me a couple of forms?
<b>	
</b>	Pettis rises, shakes George's hand and disappears. George is
	left with MISS MICHAELS, who has been more or less within
	earshot of the whole conversation. George is very upset.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Jill thumbs through a Life magazine with Eldridge Cleaver on
	the cover, waiting for an interview in the outer office of
	the 9000 Building whose open window overlooks a smoggy chunk
	of the city.
<b>	
</b>	She's one of so many girls that at first she's not
	recognizable. All of them have composites which they carry in
	leather folders. They eye each other uneasily.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. INTERVIEW OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	There is the PRODUCER, Barry, and the director, JOHNNY POPE.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Egypt?
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     That's right.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL

<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     Well, that's where the pyramids are

	     ad.
<b>	
</b>	Jill nods.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PRODUCER
</b>	     You seem disappointed.

<b>	
</b><b>	               PRODUCER

<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Egypt?
<b>	
</b>	Pope, chagrined, shoots Jill a look. He's trying to get her
	the job.
<b>	
</b><b>	               PRODUCER
</b>	     Look, is there somewhere else you'd
	     rather go? Maybe we can change our

<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL

<b>

</b>	          (shaking his head)
	     This town...
<b>	
</b>	At the shop on Brighton Way in Beverly Hills. A FEW BARS OF
	SIMON AND GARFUNKEL'S "SOUNDS OF SILENCE" covers George
	pulling up on his bike.
<b>	
</b>	The street is empty of traffic except there are scores and
	scores of parked cars, a few parking lot attendants, and some
	meter maids. George starts toward the shop. A pair of women
	in colored smocks and huge curlers burst out of the shop.
	They look like Medusas. They hurtle down the sidewalk as if
	they're running from something.
	Then they find their respective cars and begin pouring
	pennies into the meters. CLINK, BUZZ, CLINK, BUZZ.
<b>	
</b>	George looks glum. He's walking along the street. A GIRL
	stops him. She's driving by in a 3.4 Jag.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GIRL
</b>	     Hi, George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Hey, baby, what's happening?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GIRL
</b>	     Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you
	     know, the guy I divorced last
	     summer.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Great, great. I hope you make it.
<b>	
</b>	Somebody HONKS in back of her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GIRL
</b>	     Call me!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I don't have your number, stop by
	     the shop.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GIRL
</b>	          (waving goodbye)
	     Okay!
<b>	
</b>	George looks after her, smiling. Then:
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (disgusted)
	     God damn it.
<b>	
</b>	He goes into the shop.
<b>	
</b>	A large gilt mirror on one wall of the shop. It covers most
	of the wall it leans against.
<b>	
</b>	An attractive young woman in her early thirties, everything
	matching, a real French garden, leans forward INTO SHOT and
	looks at herself in the mirror. She studies her image
	carefully. She moves closer to it. She seems uncertain at
	first. Then as she looks her conviction grows:
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA
</b>	     Great... great... great... great...
	     great!
<b>	
</b>	She turns back to DENNIS LOLLY, her hairdresser. She takes
	his hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA (CONT'D)
</b>	     Great, Dennis.
<b>	
</b>	With her other hand she touches her hair.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA (CONT'D)
</b>	     Do you think there's enough height?
	     I mean do you think there's enough
	     height?
<b>	
</b>	Now she and Dennis look into the mirror at her together.
	Dennis toys with the calico scarf around his neck. Felicia,
	in far corner, waits defiantly. George spots her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA (CONT'D)
</b>	     George, do you think there's enough
	     height?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (on way to Felicia)
	     Yeah, sure.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA
</b>	     Dennis doesn't think so.
<b>	
</b><b>	               DENNIS
</b>	     Man, I didn't say a word.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA
</b>	     Well, what do you think? Is there
	     enough height?
<b>	
</b>	Both Dennis and Tina turn back to the mirror for further
	deliberation.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     You're late, George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (taking her to his
	          cubicle)
	     I gotta talk to you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     I don't want to talk about it...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     But you don't know what happened.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     I don't care.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TINA
</b>	     George, do you think there's too
	     much height?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (seating her)
	     It's great. You don't know what
	     happened, this girl she almost got--
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	          (a little hysterical)
	     I don't care about that girl, I
	     don't care if she's dead.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Calm down, baby.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	          (calming down)
	     I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm
	     simply saying you have no respect
	     for me, that you're incapable of
	     distinguishing between me and one
	     of your average Hollywood...
	     mummers...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- What?
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Nummers.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What?
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     -- Numbers, and I don't need to
	     place myself in that kind of
	     position.
<b>	
</b>	GLORIA tugs on George's arm.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What're you here for?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GLORIA
</b>	          (as if giving away a
	          secret)
	     -- A wash and set.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GLORIA
</b>	     No?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     You need a cut.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GLORIA
</b>	     But Mr. Norman said --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Said what!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GLORIA
</b>	          (whispered)
	     I just needed a wash and set, a
	     wash and set, that's all.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Well, baby, I'm George and it needs
	     to be cut.
	          (to Felicia)
	     But I don't want to place you in
	     that position either.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     -- I like myself far too much, far
	     too much.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I don't want to place you in any
	     position --
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     -- to be put in that kind of
	     position...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (to Gloria)
	     I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARY
</b>	          (a schvar)
	     Yeah!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Wash her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARY
</b>	          (looking at Gloria)
	     What with?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (nudging her)
	     -- A brillo pad, I don't care,
	     anything.
<b>	
</b>	Mary has gone over to the shampoo stand above which are
	several photographs of models and one of a handsome young
	black Marine in fatigues. George has gone to pick up a razor,
	changes it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARY
</b>	     -- You takin' a lot of shit lately,
	     George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- Oh yeah.
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARY
</b>	          (mixing)
	     But then again you ask for it --
	     you just like my Otis -- can't keep
	     his hands outta ladies' hair
	     either.
<b>	
</b>	George laughs.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- White ladies?
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARY

<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA

	     George --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (calling back)
	     I'm coming, baby --

	     How's Otis doing, anyway?
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARY
</b>	     That boy always does great. He's a

	     something, just wrote me from some
	     place called Kwang Due?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     George!
<b>	
</b>	George winks at Mary, heads back.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>	          (going  right on)
	     I'm not used to that kind of

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What kind of treatment?
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA

</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been

</b><b>	               NORMAN
</b>	     Don't use that tone of voice with
	     me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
<b>	
</b>	George turns back to Felicia as RICCI comes by. He's near
	tears.
<b>	
</b><b>	               RICCI
</b>	     Do you know what that Lillian
	     Bercovici just did?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (working on Felicia)
	     No, man.
<b>	
</b><b>	               RICCI
</b>	     -- Right after I sprayed her?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What?
<b>	
</b><b>	               RICCI
</b>	          (losing control)
	     She touched it! Then she played in
	     it and got it all into something
	     else. Now I don't know what it is!
<b>	
</b>	He's waiting for George for sympathy. Jill steps away
	gathering patience.
<b>	
</b><b>	               RICCI (CONT'D)
</b>	     I can't even stand to talk to her
	     on the phone.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (sympathetic)
	     She's heavy.
	          (to Felicia)
	     See, Norman expects me to get in
	     here, take care of all the
	     customers and then do his show out
	     in Norwalk. I gotta have my own
	     shop, just out of self defense.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     I can see that.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     You're looking great, baby.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     What're you doing later?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (half kidding)
	     Whatever you say.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     We have this political thing
	     tonight. Could you comb me out at
	     the house?
<b>	
</b>	George is torn.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I don't know. I'm beginning to feel
	     guilty.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     What about?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     All I ever do is play. I should be
	     doing something to get my own shop
	     open.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Why don't you see Lester?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (a little alarmed)
	     Your husband?
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Yes.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (not sure what she's
	          driving at)
	     What about?
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     The shop. I think you're a good
	     investment, and I don't mind
	     telling him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
<b>	
</b>	Jill returns.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I already said hello.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Okay.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah, baby.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     When can I talk to you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I know but this is important. I
	     have to make a decision.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     About what?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Whether or not I'm going.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Going where?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Egypt.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Honey, have they offered you the
	     job?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     No, but I think they might.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (to Jill)
	     Just a second, I'll be right with
	     you...
<b>	
</b>	He turns back to Felicia. Jill moves away.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	          (interested)
	     Is she all right?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I don't know. Just a minute...
<b>	
</b>	George moves over to Jill.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     What do you want?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Your advice!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     They didn't offer you the job yet.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I want your feelings about it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Right now?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Look, either we have a meaningful
	     relationship or we don't, I've got
	     to know.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (really harassed)
	     Look, baby, can we talk about it
	     later?
<b>	
</b>	Felicia is watching them.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     When?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     When I get off work.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     When is that?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I'll call you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     When is that, George?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I'll call you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	          (really upset)
	     But I never know when you're
	     working and when you're not
	     working!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (half to himself)
	     Neither do I, baby.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     What?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     ... Okay...
<b>	
</b>	Back to Felicia. As Jill leaves.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- Anyway.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     I hope she's all right.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     She's fine. You really think I'd be
	     a good investment?
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No, I know.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     And I certainly wouldn't tell
	     Lester.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I know.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     That's great. You look great, baby,
	     great. Dennis, look at Felicia's
	     hair.
<b>	
</b>	Dennis stops. He's with the DESK GIRL. Both of them:
<b>	
</b><b>	               DENNIS &amp; DESK GIRL
</b>	     Great.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. SHOP - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Jill, in street, on verge of tears... moves to her car...
	gets in... sits for a long moment.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	George on bike pulls into office building. The MUSIC OVER is
<b>	JEFFERSON AIRPLANE'S "WHITE RABBIT."
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT. LESTER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	In his inner office.
<b>	
</b>	LESTER'S on the telephone, staring out the window.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Look, Kurt, I don't care where you
	     have to go. I want Beluga Caviar
	     there. Call Jurgenson's, call
	     Chasen's... I don't care how much
	     it costs... how much?... then spend
	     it. Just make sure it's there.
	     You've got all the money in the
	     world to buy it. You understand?
	     Just make sure it's there on the
	     table tonight.
	          (he hangs up)
	     Jesus.
	          (to George, to no one)
	     You've got to do everything
	     yourself. You know?
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly Lester gives George a steely look. It covers his
	hair, his clothes. George is acutely uncomfortable.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     Felicia says you're a very good
	     hairdresser.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Well, yeah.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     She says you're a fabulous
	     hairdresser.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Thank you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I didn't say it, she did. How'd you
	     happen to get in that line of work?
<b>	
</b>	George sort of knows what Lester's driving at.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Oh, well, I went to beauty
	     school... you know you go to beauty
	     school... and you get your
	     operator's license... and you
	     graduate... and you're a
	     hairdresser.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I see.
<b>	
</b>	Long pause. George hasn't told Lester what he wants to know.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     It's an unusual trade.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yes it is.
<b>	
</b>	An awkward pause.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     But the important thing is you're
	     successful at it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     In a way. But...
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     But what?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I'm better than the guy I work for.
<b>	
</b>	This seems to interest Lester.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Well, George, I invest for a lot of
	     people. I make a lot of money for
	     them. More than they could do for
	     themselves.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     After a while that hurts... doesn't
	     it?
<b>	
</b>	Lester smiles. He appreciates this.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     It's good you want to do something,
	     George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Thank you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     But personal services are not the
	     kind of thing I usually get into.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     They're not?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (suddenly direct, almost
	          enthusiastic)
	     No, they're a pain in the ass,
	     there's no way of keeping track of
	     anything. It's a cash business and
	     you've got to watch your operators
	     or they'll steal you blind, am I
	     right or am I right?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     You're right.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Who needs that kind of aggravation?
	     Who needs that kind of aggravation
	     at my age? When I finish work I
	     want to...
<b>	
</b>	The door bursts open. It's one of the SECRETARIES.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SECRETARY
</b>	     Mr. Karpf...
<b>	
</b>	Jackie is right behind her. She bounces in, not seeing
	George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     I'm sorry but I need an extra
	     garage key.
<b>	
</b>	In Lester's presence she seems distinctly younger than she
	did with Jill. She's startled when she sees George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     What for? What do you need the key
	     for?
<b>	
</b>	Jackie continues to stare at George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     The man from Sloan's is coming. I
	     called you about it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     How did you lose that key? Oh,
	     George, this is uh Miss -- this is
	     Jackie.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (a little suspiciously)
	     Is that right?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (almost immediately on the
	          defensive)
	     Well, yes, George is a wonderful
	     hairdresser.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Is that right?
<b>	
</b>	Awkward pause.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     So how's Norman?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Great. Who's been doing your hair?
<b>	
</b>	Jackie glances at Lester.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     I go to the blue'n gold barber shop
	     in Westwood. The guy in the third
	     chair's dynamite... nobody much.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     George is going to open a shop.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (really interested)
	     No kidding? Your own shop?
<b>	
</b>	George starts to say yes.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     George, could you -- excuse us for
	     a minute?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Sure.
<b>	
</b>	He leaves the office, shuts the door, leaving Jackie and
	Lester alone. Lester shuts the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I called to tell you I was sending
	     one over but the line was busy,
	     you're always on the phone.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     I am?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Who were you talking to?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Who do you think I was talking to?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     My secretary saw you with that boy.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Steve?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Whatever his name is, that actor.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie looks for a moment as if she's going to get very
	emotional.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.
	          (a touch bitter)
	     Steve couldn't get arrested as an
	     actor. He couldn't get arrested as
	     a boy.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Then you were talking to him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     I ran into him at the 76 station on
	     little Santa Monica, what was I
	     supposed to do, hide in the ladies
	     room? Yes, I was talking to him.
<b>	
</b>	Lester's a little chagrined now but not much.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	          (an outburst)
	     I'm always on the phone because you
	     never let me see anybody, I can't
	     even bring my girlfriends over to
	     the house because they might run
	     into you. You're driving me up the
	     wall, Lester. You're even jealous
	     of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have
	     somebody I can talk to.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I'm not jealous of the dogs.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie looks at him in disgust.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	          (very positive)
	     Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous
	     of anybody, I just can't afford to
	     get caught... off base.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     So I can't talk to some broken down
	     actor, what do you think, I'm going
	     to tell him I'm screwing Lester
	     Karpf!
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Of course not.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     That's not very logical, Lester.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. OFFICE - GEORGE AND SECRETARY
</b><b>	
</b>	picking up the tail end of this.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SECRETARY
</b>	     He thinks the room is soundproofed.
	     Don't tell him it's not.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     How come?
<b>	
</b><b>	               SECRETARY
</b>	     He'll have that awful construction
	     crew back again, and they can never

</b><b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (trying to think of why)
	     It's very logical, it's the most
	     logical thing in the world. You
	     wouldn't feel this confined if we
	     could go out with people and have
	     dinner, and a little conversation
	     and so forth...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Really? How about starting with
	     tonight?
<b>	
</b>	By her tone, Jackie indicates she's been saying all of this
	for months. Lester repeating it like it's just occurred to
	him genuinely upsets her. She's near tears and she's not the
	kind of girl who cries easily. Lester's sensitive to it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Sweetheart, I know it's rough but
	     at this point -- my business
	     involves handling money for some
	     very touchy people, politics and so
	     on... Felicia's at a very difficult
	     period in her life... any divorce
	     and settlement and so forth, my
	     finances would have to be looked
	     into.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie knows what he's talking about.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (quietly)
	     You and your touchy investors.

</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (finally)
	     Look... you do well for people,
	     they don't ask you to stop. Nobody
	     wants you to stop making money,
	     doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all
	     want their share.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie comes over to Lester.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     You're lying about one thing,
	     Lester.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     What's that?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     You're still jealous.
<b>	
</b>	She's said it provocatively and like the younger girl she can
	be with him. Lester smiles. He's almost benign.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     God, you're a doll.
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah, baby, how's it going?
<b>	
</b>	The PHONE RINGS. Norman brings it to George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               NORMAN
</b>	     George... Jackie Shawn.
<b>	
</b>	George seems really surprised to hear the voice on the other

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No, I'd like to but I've got too

	          (to shampoo girl)
	     Two caps, Mary, yeah, two.
	          (back to phone)
	     Okay, but I have to be in Bel Air

<b>	
</b><b>	               ANJANETTE

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

	     Look, would you argue with your

<b>	
</b><b>	               ANJANETTE
</b>	     No.
<b>	
</b>	Ricci comes up to him ready to cry.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (to Ricci)
	     Hey, what's happening?
	          (calling)
	     Mary! Telephone.
	          (to Ricci)
	     What's the matter?
<b>	
</b><b>	               RICCI

<b>

</b>	     Oh yeah?
<b>	
</b><b>	               RICCI
</b>	     You were supposed to handle that
	     bitch, she's always asking for you,
	     and she was furious you weren't
	     here.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah?...
<b>	
</b><b>	               RICCI
</b>	     She's murdered her hair... you do
	     something with her, I'm never going
	     to touch her again.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I'm busy, man.
<b>	
</b><b>	               RICCI
</b>	     If I have to touch her again, I'll
	     throw up!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

	     Don't talk like a child. You're a
	     pro, now get out there and cut!
<b>	
</b>	Ricci is stunned. He says under his breath, "I'll throw up"
	again and leaves. Mary, her back to George, sits holding the
	telephone to her ear.
<b>	
</b><b>	               ANJANETTE
</b>	     I thought you were in a good mood.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I am... except I've gotta do
	     somebody at their house.
<b>	
</b><b>	               ANJANETTE
</b>	     Don't you like her?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No, it's a very groovy girl.
<b>	
</b><b>	               ANJANETTE
</b>	     Then what's the problem?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (really worried)
	     She's a very groovy girl. That's
	     the problem.
<b>	
</b><b>	               ANJANETTE
</b>	     What're you talking about, George?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Well, it's a small town. Sooner or
	     later things catch up with you...
	     don't they?
<b>	
</b>	Mary runs out of the shop, tipping over a magazine rack.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Where's the caps, Mary?
<b>	
</b>	She's exiting front door in a hurry.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Mary? What's goin' on, Mary?
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. GEORGE ON HIS MOTORCYCLE - MOVING - DAY
</b><b>	
</b><b>	MUSIC, THE BYRDS, "TURN, TURN, TURN."
</b><b>	
</b>	He pulls up to a rustic house. He gets his little case off
	the bike and then hesitates. He walks to the door and rings
	the bell.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie answers the door. She seems distracted and, at the
	same time, a little wary. Much the same, in fact, as George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Hi. C'mon in.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie's wearing a robe. They walk into the living room, the
	dogs yelping.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Shut up, it's all right.
	          (to George, automatically)
	     Do you want a drink?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No, thanks.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Well, I do.
<b>	
</b>	She starts to mix herself a drink. She changes her mind,
	pours herself a shot of whiskey and hurls it back. She does
	it again. When she turns back to George he's looking at her
	noncommittally.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Where do you want to do this?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Probably the bathroom.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Can't you do it out here?
<b>	
</b>	George looks around.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Well, it depends. If you just
	     wanted a combout. I guess I could.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie turns to him, honestly uncertain.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Well, what do you think?
<b>	
</b>	George himself is tentative.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I don't know. Why don't you sit
	     down.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie looks around a little at a loss and finally sits down
	on the glass-topped coffee table.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (meaning her position)
	     Is this all right?
<b>	
</b>	George moves in. He draws the drapes back so light comes in
	from the backyard and the swimming pool can be seen.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah.
<b>	
</b>	He takes her hair in his hands. The contact makes them both
	nervous. She looks away. George continues to run his hands
	through her hair.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (a little nervous)
	     Well, what do you think?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I'd cut it...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     You would?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah, I think so...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (almost irritable)
	     You don't seem very sure.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No, I'm sure.
<b>	
</b>	There is a moment where Jackie is trying to decide whether
	she'll let George actually cut her hair.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (then)
	     Okay... but I want you to know one
	     thing.
	          (almost a threat)
	     I've got to look great tonight, I
	     mean I have to look great, okay?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Okay.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. FELICIA'S BEDROOM AND DRESSING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Felicia is throwing on a bandana and wraparound sunglasses.
	She seems in a hurry.
<b>	
</b>	She leaves the bathroom, moves quickly through the house to
	the kitchen. She passes Lorna's bedroom. LORNA is changing
	from her school clothes into a tennis dress. She watches her
	mother flash by.
<b>	
</b><b>	IN THE KITCHEN
</b><b>	
</b>	Felicia stops. She is holding a dangling pearl earring in her
	hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Mona, Mona!
<b>	
</b>	MONA comes out from the laundry room. Felicia has called a
	little too loud.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>	          (indicates earring)
	     Have you seen the other one of
	     these by any chance? I want to wear
	     them tonight.
	          (before Mona can answer)
	     Oh... when George gets here, tell
	     him to wait. I have to pick up a
	     dress and I may have to have it
	     fitted, but be sure...
<b>	
</b>	Lorna ambles into the kitchen, expressionless.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>	     ... to tell him to wait.
<b>	
</b><b>	               MONA
</b>	     Yes, ma'am. But I have to go to the
	     market...
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Just be sure he doesn't leave.
<b>	
</b>	Felicia flashes out the door and into the carport, visible
	through the kitchen. She takes off. Lorna slowly slips a
	white swetlet onto her slender wrist.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM AND BATH - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	which includes a sauna. Jackie's got on a terry-cloth robe.
	George has been wetting her hair in the basin. Her terry
	cloth robe is bulky and obviously in the way.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Jill's coming with us.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Great.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     She's incredible...
	          (after a moment)
	     She loves you, George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah... I mean great.
<b>	
</b>	George begins to cut. Jackie winces a little. George notices
	it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Getting my hair cut is always a
	     little nerve-wracking.
<b>	
</b>	The cutting goes on. The bathroom is very close. George has
	begun to perspire a little as has Jackie.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     ... I don't get it done often.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Whew.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     What's wrong?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     It's hot in here.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (after a moment)
	     It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on
	     and it makes the whole bathroom
	     hot.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah... wow.
<b>	
</b>	George stops and takes off his shirt. He's wearing a purple T
	shirt underneath. He goes back to cutting. Jackie's getting
	more and more edgy, partly because of George's proximity and
	partly because of her concern over what he's doing. George on
	the other hand is now less tentative, more focused on the job
	at hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (finally)
	     Not too much, don't cut too much.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Jackie, would you argue with your
	     doctor.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     The shrink? Many times.
<b>	
</b>	George stops and looks at her. Both are perspiring freely
	now.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Bernstein... seemed to think I
	     hated men.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Do you? You still see him?
<b>	
</b>	Jackie tries to look at her hair in the mirror. George gently
	pulls her back.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (with some feeling)
	     No.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Why not?
<b>	
</b>	Jackie doesn't answer.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Why not?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     ... he tried to... uh... make it
	     with me.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     And?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     And what?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Did you?
<b>	
</b>	Jackie looks up slowly. George is still cutting, not looking
	directly at her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     It was after you, baby. After you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (breathes deeply)
	     Boy, that sauna is really... can't
	     you turn it down or something?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     No... Lester likes it on all the
	     time in case he wants to use it.

	now as he works, his knee wedged between her legs, working
	very close.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Anyway, he offered me a silver
	     cloud. At least he should give me a
	     Ferrari and pay off my house and
	     give me a nine carat ring or
	     something...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (amused)
	     Did Lester know about him?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     There was nothing to know.
	     Anyway... if I can't have love I
	     have to at least have money. I have
	     to have some pride I can do
	     something.
<b>	
</b>	George has started to dry her hair. He stops. He picks up the
	scissors. Her hair is askew still so it's difficult to see
	what George has done.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	          (staring at the scissors,

<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Well, did you or didn't you?

</b><b>	               GEORGE

</b>	     You did, didn't you?
<b>	
</b>	They're very close and Jackie's moving closer. She's

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Baby...

</b>	     You just can't stand to miss one of

</b>	Lester pulls into it. He stops, reaches in the glove
	compartment and pulls out one of the little airline bottles
	of vodka. He pours it into a glass, drinks it. He notices
	George's bike in the driveway. Next to him on the seat is a
	prettily wrapped package.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JACKIE'S BEDROOM AND BATH - JACKIE AND GEORGE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	George sprays her. He turns her around in the chair to face
	the mirror so she can see herself for the first time. She
	should look really different, her hair significantly shorter,
	and modishly and beautifully cut to her face.

</b>	George is obsessed. He wraps his arms around her and she
	responds, passionately.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Oh, no.
<b>	
</b>	They are grappling, pushing and pulling with each other.
	George kicks away the stool by the mirror and tries to bend
	Jackie to the rug-covered bathroom floor.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	          (genuine)
	     No! Don't! Please!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (forcing her down)
	     I don't want to... I swear...
<b>	
</b>	She throws her arms around him, kissing him and shoving him
	away. George is tearing at his trousers. They are on the
	floor now , rolling around, bouncing gently off the ceramic
	molding from the sunken tub.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     It'll ruin everything.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I know... you don't know, I know.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Don't, don't, don't...
<b>	
</b>	They hit the sauna room door as they're rolling around and
	the door opens. Steam comes pouring over them, momentarily
	obscuring their struggles. George has trouble getting his
	pants down. At the last instant, Jackie gives them a helpful
	tug.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	          (moans)
	     Oh, no...
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly, the DOGS begin to BARK. There is the SOUND of the
	DOOR OPENING. Jackie sits up.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     It's Lester.
<b>	
</b>	She's frozen with fear.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER'S VOICE
</b>	          (muffled)
	     Hey, doll... Jackie... honey...
	     where are you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Get up, get up, get up.
<b>	
</b>	George is already trying to pull on his trousers. Jackie is
	up and clutching her robe, unable to move.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Oh God, oh God, oh God... do
	     something, please God, do
	     something.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER'S VOICE
</b>	          (nearer)
	     Hey, baby, are you sleeping?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Sit down.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (frantic)
	     What are you talking about?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (equally frantic, forcing
	          her)
	     Sit down!
<b>	
</b><b>	WITH LESTER
</b><b>	
</b>	He's moved into the bedroom, carrying the package obviously a
	gift for Jackie. He's been a little puzzled. His puzzlement
	is rapidly turning to suspicion.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Jackie?... Jackie?
<b>	
</b>	Lester opens the door. He's hit with a blast of steam and the
	sight of George stripped to the waist, ostensibly working
	over Jackie who is loosely wrapped with a towel. George has a
	comb in one hand and now turns on the dryer, blowing it with
	a somewhat exaggerated gesture.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Shut the door, shut the door!
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Oh, I'm sorry.
<b>	
</b>	He shuts the door. Then he thinks better of it. He opens the
	door again and takes a step into the bathroom.
<b>	
</b>	George waves the comb at Lester a little impatiently. It's
	wet and sprinkles Lester.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Look, either come in or stay out!
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Shut the door, Lester. What do you
	     think this is, a picnic?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (confused now)
	     Sorry, honey, I...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     That's okay, that's okay, just shut
	     the door.
<b>	
</b>	Lester shuts the door, feeling a little chagrined, and
	relieved. He sits on the bed and puts the present beside him.
	In a moment George emerges.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     ... she's very upset...
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     What about, tonight?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (seizing the opportunity)
	     That, and... I'll be done in a
	     minute.
<b>	
</b>	He goes back inside.
<b>	
</b><b>	IN THE BATHROOM GEORGE AND JACKIE
</b><b>	
</b>	just stare silently into mirror at each other.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER'S VOICE
</b>	     Jackie?... Hey, I brought you a
	     little something, doll.
<b>	
</b><b>	AT THE DOOR - LESTER AND GEORGE
</b><b>	
</b>	George has his case of comb and scissors, etc., and is
	standing with Lester. He's anxious to go.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     You look like you've had quite a
	     work-out.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     It's nerve wracking sometimes...
	     women can get you very upset.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I know it, I know it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     ... this doing hair it's...
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I know it, son. But tonight's going
	     to be even tougher.
<b>	
</b>	George just looks at him. Lester walks him to bike.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     George, I know you have to deal
	     with Felicia and you're caught in
	     the middle, and if you can just
	     bear with me tonight, well, I
	     appreciate the way you've handled
	     the situation.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Oh, hey...
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     It's a difficult situation, and I
	     want you to know I appreciate it.
	     Tonight's going to be real tough
	     for me --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Son, we'll do business, I can tell
	     you that.
<b>	
</b>	George roars off on bike.
<b>	
</b><b>	JACKIE AND LESTER IN KITCHEN
</b><b>	
</b>	Jackie is cleaning up some dog food. Lester stands there for
	a minute.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     I'd like a drink.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (looking up)
	     Just a second, I've gotta clean
	     this mess up or the dogs'll have it
	     all over the house.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     You ought to get rid of those dogs.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie looks up and then controls herself.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     They get hair all over the place.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     They're Yorkies and they don't
	     shed.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie goes into the living room and fixes Lester a drink.
	Lester follows.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	          (giving him a drink)
	     Here.
<b>

</b>	     Aren't you going to have one?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     No.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Why not?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Because I don't want one.
<b>	
</b>	Lester goes over to her to kiss her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     C'mon, doll, it's five o'clock,
	     have a drink.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie turns away and explodes.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     I don't want one! First you tell me
	     not to drink then you tell me to
	     drink, which is it? I don't want a
	     drink!
<b>	
</b>	Lester's now a little intimidated, but even more suspicious.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I called to tell you I was on my
	     way, but the line was busy, you're

<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. LESTER'S HOUSE IN BEL AIR - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	George pulls into the circular driveway. COVERED by a few
	bars of The Mama's and The Papa's "California Dreamin."
	There's only one car.
	George gets off the bike and goes to the door. Nobody
	answers. He hears the SOUND of a BALL BANGING. He looks
	toward the tennis court.
<b>	
</b><b>	ON THE COURT - LORNA
</b><b>	
</b>	is banging away on the backboard. There's a basket of balls
	nearby. She hits with considerable skill and power until she
	misses the backboard and the ball lodges in the steel mesh
	surrounding the court.
<b>	
</b>	George is standing there. Lorna looks at him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     You here to see my mother?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     She's out, but you're supposed to
	     wait.
<b>	
</b><b>	LORNA WALKING TO GEORGE
</b><b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA (CONT'D)
</b>	     Hungry?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     A little.
<b>	
</b><b>	AT THE KITCHEN TABLE
</b><b>	
</b>	They're eating silently. Lorna has hauled all kinds of food
	out of the refrigerators. She watches George as he eats with
	some relish. She gets up and goes to the steel-doored
	refrigerators.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	          (indicating refrigerators)
	     This is the one thing I like about
	     this house... want some lox?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No thanks.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     You're my mother's hairdresser?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (warily)
	     I do her hair, yeah.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Chopped liver?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No thanks.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Are you gay?... baked apple?...
	     they're cold but they're good.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No thanks.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Did you hear me?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Well, are you? Are you queer?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     ... yeah.

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (trying to avoid it)
	     Gee, this is great.
<b>	
</b>	He slices a piece of cheesecake. Lorna sits down, in the
	chair nearest him now.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Why do you wanna know so bad?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     See if you've been making it with
	     my mother.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (looking at her for a
	          minute, he changes his
	          tone)
	     What would my being a faggot have
	     to do with that?
<b>	
</b>	Lorna shrugs.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Nothing, I guess... have you ever
	     made it with a guy?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Have you ever made it with a girl?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     I asked you first.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
<b>	
</b>	Lorna smiles. A pause.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Well, are you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Am I what?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Making it with my mother?
<b>	
</b>	George wants to avoid this at all costs. He stares at Lorna
	intently.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I'd like to do your hair sometime.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Why?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     ... just, you could look very
	     heavy...
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Don't make conversation with me.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     You don't have to make conversation
	     with me, I'm not my mother... do
	     you have a thing about older
	     women... that's sort of faggoty
	     isn't it?
<b>	
</b>	George is weary and getting annoyed.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah, it is.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     I never get my hair done.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No kidding.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     In fact, I don't think I've ever

<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Then what do you think?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     That you're just like your mother.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     I am not like my mother!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     You are.

</b>	Lorna is furious.

</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     I am not!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	          (defiantly)
	     Yeah.
<b>	
</b>	George stops eating. He's not prepared for this.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (uneasily)
	     Right now?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	          (a little more tentative
	          now that the moment has
	          arrived)
	     Yeah.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. SOURCE RESTAURANT - JOHNNY POPE AND JILL - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A scraggly bearded WAITER with long stringy hair sets down
	two huge green salads before Jill and Johnny Pope.
<b>	
</b>	In so doing the Waiter drops a wooden menu he's been
	carrying. As he bends down to pick it up, he kneels beside
	Pope. Pope taps him on the shoulder.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE

	     Oh, scraves...
<b>	
</b><b>	               WAITER
</b>	     Yes?
<b>	
</b>	The Waiter looks up, and moves.
<b>

</b>	     Thank you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               WAITER
</b>	     What for?
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     Taking your hair out of my salad.
<b>	
</b><b>	               WAITER
</b>	     Oh, I'm sorry.
<b>	
</b>	Pope nods, Jill giggles. The Waiter goes off. Pope tosses out
	a few pieces of lettuce from the top of his salad.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Why don't you ask for another one?
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     Are you kidding? His hair's
	     probably the most nutritious thing
	     in here. See, you've reduced me to
	     eating weeds.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     ... my friend doesn't like it here
	     either.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     All right, forget this filth.
	     Continue about your friend.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Well he's not exactly a friend.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     Is he an enemy?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	          (laughing)
	     Of course not... he's sort of a
	     boyfriend.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE

</b>	     Sort of.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE

<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     My God, did I say that? I don't

	George's bike.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. THE KITCHEN
</b><b>	
</b>	She sees the food spread out.
<b>	
</b><b>	FELICIA
</b><b>	
</b>	moving through the house. She stops by Lorna's room. Lorna
	has a sliding door, which is closed. Felicia opens it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Lorna?
<b>	
</b><b>	LORNA'S BEDROOM
</b><b>	
</b>	Lorna is sitting on her bed, in her tennis dress but with her
	tennis shoes off. She's straightening a string in her racket.
	She looks to her mother, expressionless.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>	     Have you seen George?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     He's in the bathroom.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Your bathroom?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LORNA
</b>	     Yes.
<b>	
</b>	The toilet flushes. The sink runs, and George emerges. He's
	looking a little haggard.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Hi.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	          (coolly)
	     Hello, George.
<b>	
</b>	They walk out to the lanai together and George picks up his
	case. There is considerable tension from Felicia as they walk
	into her bedroom. Felicia slides the bedroom door shut, an
	action which George unhappily notices. She turns to George.
	She looks very hostile. She's trembling.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>	     I've missed you.
<b>	
</b>	George is taken aback. He gropes for a moment.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I've... missed you too.
<b>	
</b>	Felicia comes to him. She comes to him and touches his arm.
	George suddenly flings his case across the room and pounds
	his fist into a high-backed chair, turning away from Felicia.
	She clearly misunderstands the action.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	          (touched)
	     It's okay, honey... it's okay now.
<b>	
</b>	She moves to the door and quietly locks it. George winces.
	She comes back to him and kisses him gently. She kisses him
	again with more passion. George tries to respond.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA (CONT'D)
</b>	     Comb my hair out later, honey.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     No, baby... I'm glad you're coming
	     tonight.
<b>	
</b>	She gently tugs at him, leading him toward the bed. George is
	miserable.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (looking toward the door)
	     But aren't you...
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Right now, I just don't care.
<b>	
</b>	As they sink to the bed, Felicia switches on the HI-FI. The
	Tijuana Brass begin to play.
<b>	
</b><b>	GEORGE ON HIS BIKE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b><b>	
</b>	COVERED BY a few bars of Bob Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone".

</b>	Riding home. He turns down his street and pulls into his
	driveway. He gets off his bike and only as he starts up his
	walk does he see Jill. She's been quietly waiting on his
	front porch, hidden in the shadows of the overhang. She
	doesn't look happy. George stops cold.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL

</b>	They go inside. The living room is messy. George looks around
	in disgust.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     What business meeting?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I've been trying to reach you all

	     What is this thing tonight?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What do you mean, what is it? It's
	     some political bullshit.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't
	     you think you could call me and let
	     me know? Look at my hair.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you
	     think I want to go to some God
	     damned party? I'm trying to get
	     that God damned shop open. I'm
	     trying to get a little bread
	     together. That's all I'm doing.
<b>	
</b>	George's outburst has shocked Jill. George maniacally begins
	straightening the mess.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     I just wanna live like everybody
	     else, that's all. I want clothes in
	     the closet, and food in the
	     refrigerator, and I don't want shit
	     all over the house and running my

	     book... I want to get up in the
	     morning and go to bed at night... I
	     want a normal life like everybody

</b>	He collapses into a chair. She comes over to him and knee
	beside him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I know, honey.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

	black tie, posters of Nixon, Agnew, Reagan, and Murphy,
	vaguely familiar faces crossing back and forth, clustering,
	watching early returns on television sets that are blaring
	from various points around the room. An ORCHESTRA PLAYS Meyer
	Davis Society Jazz. Jackie and George hesitate. Pope and Jill
	are behind them. Pope jostles George as he stops, abruptly.
	George looks around. Pope smiles. He's holding Jill's hand.
	George notices. Jill disengages her hand casually, as though
	it were necessary only for the walk up the stairs. Jackie
	nudges George, forcing him to move into the room with her as

</b>	Felicia grabs George's other arm pulling him away from
	Kenneth. Kenneth looks a little shocked at the ferocity of
	Felicia's move.
<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA

	juggling the drinks.
<b>

	     You've got to keep the follicles
	     open. You lose hair and the skin
	     grows over the follicle and that's

	     -- I'd like to suck his cock.
<b>

	George is coughing badly. Jackie slaps his back.
<b>	
</b><b>	HEAD TABLE - FELICIA AND LESTER

	a little like the bear in the penny arcade that is shot and

	Jackie's vacant chair and George.

<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Yes, sweetheart, shh.
<b>	
</b>	He pats her hand. She gives him a look that could kill.

<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BISTRO - LESTER AND FELICIA
</b><b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (finally exasperated)
	     -- look, Felicia, this party
	     involves more than you and me, you

<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA

<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER

<b>	
</b><b>	THE SENATOR

</b><b>	               FELICIA

<b>	
</b><b>	               FELICIA
</b>	     Lester, you're a miserable man.
	     You're not helping anybody. You're
	     just twisting arms to raise money
	     for a lot of silly son of a bitches
	     that are out for themselves -- this
	     is just business, don't kid
	     yourself. And you know the worst
	     thing about it, even if it does
	     somebody some good somewhere which
	     I can't possibly imagine, you'll
	     never know the difference. You're

	     you think your new business partner
	     is going to keep his hands off that

</b><b>	               LESTER

</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     What are you talking about,
	     Felicia?
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly there's a rumble in the room and East has stopped
	chanting. Several men have stepped to the center of the room.
	One of them in a slate suit raising both hands.
<b>	
</b><b>	               DET. YOUNGER
</b>	     Excuse me, Senator. Ladies and
	     gentlemen, we're going to have to
	     evacuate this room as quietly and
	     quickly as possible. There's
	     nothing to worry about. We'd like
	     you to exit through the door here
	     on my left... down the steps into
	     the street, please!
<b>	
</b>	There are whisperings and rumblings of 'a bomb' and
	rejoinders to the effect that it's a hoax. Nevertheless the
	exodus begins and grows to bedlam. Waiters who had been
	fawning over jeweled ladies are now unceremoniously pushing
	them down the stairs, even going over them to make the
	entrance.
<b>	
</b><b>	OUTSIDE
</b><b>	
</b>	the emergency doesn't keep autograph hounds from inhibiting
	the exit as they try to hold up celebrities in the crowd that
	flows onto the street. Jill and Johnny Pope are caught up in
	the swirl of the crowd. Pope temporarily loses Jill. He looks
	around. Jill taps him on the shoulder.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     -- here I am. Now what?
<b>	
</b>	Pope turns.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     Well -- as I see it we've got two
	     choices. We can hang around here
	     and wait for the bomb to go off, or
	     we can go to my party.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Let's do that.
<b>	
</b>	Lester is with some security people, trying to find out what
	they're doing.
<b>	
</b>	B.G. are several police cars, a fire truck, and the fire
	truck ambulance. Lights are flashing.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     -- have they located it?
<b>	
</b>	Somebody shrugs. A CAR HONKS. Lester is pulled to the side.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	          (looking toward driver)
	     -- oh, sorry.
<b>	
</b>	Then he sees it's Felicia. She gives him the finger, and lays
	rubber nearly sideswiping him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               ONE OF THE SECURITY MEN
</b>	     What was that all about?
<b>	
</b>	Somebody else says 'who was that?' Lester shrugs.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE
</b><b>	
</b>	are dancing to a tape of 'Good Vibrations.' George's coat is
	off, his tie loose. They are near the entryway and sitting on
	a large staircase b.g. a young girl can be SEEN breast
	feeding her baby.
<b>	
</b>	George and Jackie are obviously enjoying themselves. The tape
	ends. George's silk shirt is clinging down the center of his
	back.
<b>	
</b>	He moves with Jackie, where she picks up a coke at the bar.
<b>	
</b>	A black in a caftan with a huge Afro offers Jackie a joint.
	She takes a drags, she and George move outside the living
	room. As they walk she hands the joint to George who hands
	the joint to a couple of girls lying on a low couch by the
	door -- all without really losing stride.
<b>	
</b><b>	OUTSIDE SAMMY'S - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	There's a long rolling lawn. The lights are soft coming from
	the living room, the MUSIC more muted. Jackie, nevertheless,
	is breathing rather heavily from the dancing. George is
	looking at her intently, too intently for her not to notice.
	She appears not to notice.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What are you looking at?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     The lawn -- it looks like it goes
	     on forever, doesn't it?
<b>	
</b>	She turns back to George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- yeah.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- look, you don't have to
	     entertain me...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (a slight laugh)
	     Am I entertaining you?
<b>

</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- well, if you feel like playing,
	     go play...
<b>	
</b>	Jackie looks past George into the living room.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     -- there's a lot of players in
	     there --
<b>	
</b>	The TWINS come up behind George, and Jackie, grabbing George.
	The move should be a little startling almost as if it were an
	attack.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TWIN ONE
</b>	     George!
<b>	
</b><b>	               TWIN TWO

<b>	
</b>	They grab George and spin him around, temporarily pushing
	Jackie OUT OF SHOT.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (pleasantly)
	     Hey, what's happening.
<b>

</b>	     Sure, why not?
<b>	
</b><b>	               TWIN ONE
</b>	     Come on, George --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No, later, maybe -- go ahead, I'll
	     catch up with you --
	          (they head off)
	     I've got --
<b>	
</b>	He turns back to Jackie to finish what he was going to say,
	and she's not there. Only a wisp of her cigarette smoke hangs
	in the air, and then it disappears.
<b>	
</b>	George looks surprised and disappointed.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. KITCHEN
</b><b>	
</b>	Several tall stringy types are eating out of the
	refrigerator, with a couple of dogs eagerly watching, others
	are eating hash cakes off the formica counter.
<b>	
</b>	RED DOG sits in a corner, sipping wine out of a measuring
	cup. He smiles and looks up to Jackie, who has her arm on his
	shoulder. Strobe lights from an adjacent room can be SEEN
<b>	PERIODICALLY.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	               RED DOG
</b>	     Where the fuck you been, Jackie?
	     London?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- no.
<b>	
</b><b>	               RED DOG
</b>	     Real good to see you, man.

</b><b>	INT. KITCHEN - JACKIE AND RED DOG
</b><b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     So what's been going on, Red Dog?
<b>	
</b><b>	               RED DOG
</b>	     Hey, it's the same old shit, ain't
	     it? No matter where you go, it's
	     the same old shit. Nothing ever
	     changes, nothing, man, nothing.
	          (with sudden intensity)
	     Hey -- you ever been to Cuuliacaan?
<b>	
</b>	George, a little hastily moves through the kitchen, spotting
	Jackie. He's nearly upended by a couple, tall man and woman
	at the refrigerator. They grab him and kiss him, and he
	shakes through them moving to Jackie.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- where'd you go?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- oh I thought you were --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- what?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Nothing.
<b>	
</b><b>	               RED DOG
</b>	     Hey, man, what's happening?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Nothing.
<b>	
</b><b>	               RED DOG
</b>	     That's right, man!
<b>	
</b>	And he laughs. George silently takes Jackie's hand and they
	move through the kitchen and out of doors toward the grounds
	in the rear of the house.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. BISTRO PARKING LOT - JOHNNY POPE
</b><b>	
</b>	The crowd has thinned out to a trickle, but Pope's red
	Porsche is hemmed in by the fire trucks and a couple of other
	cars.
<b>	
</b>	Pope is vainly trying to talk to firemen and policemen to
	move their trucks and they keep referring him to someone
	else.
<b>	
</b><b>	JILL AND LESTER
</b><b>	
</b>	Lester stands, swaying a little unsteadily in the lot. The
	Deputy secret service man seen twice earlier, comes on up to
	Lester.

</b><b>	               DEPUTY
</b>	     -- we can't find a thing, Mr.

<b>	
</b><b>	               DEPUTY

<b>

	hell of a time squirming into the back, but tries to be
	lighthearted about it. Jill gets into the front.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. PORSCHE
</b><b>	
</b>	The door on the driver's side is still open and Lester's feet
	are poked out it. His head is pushing on the canvas top.
<b>

</b>	     See, nothin' to it.
<b>	
</b>	Jill turns and smiles, but it's a mistake since Lester's
	upper body is almost leaning on her as it is. Lester puts his
	hand behind Jill's head, forcing her to hold the position,
	almost nose to nose with Lester.

</b>	     Well we'd love to, but we're going
	     to another party.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Well... that's wonderful -- I'll
	     stop by there for a drink.
<b>	
</b>	Pope is furious. He starts the car, backs it up quickly,
	jostling Lester around as he goes. Lester chuckles.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. FREEFORM SWIMMING POOL - JACKIE AND GEORGE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	lie side by side on deck chairs at the end of the pool. The
	house and upper grounds are obscured by neat rows of hedges
	and all sorts of random shrubbery. Jackie and George watch
	the Twins splash and flounce around in the jacuzzi with a
	couple of androgenous men. The Twins stand up in the jacuzzi,
	arm in arm and half move, half throw themselves to another
	end of the jacuzzi.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie smiles. She stretches, yawns.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (lazily)
	     -- very nice, very nice.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (yes)
	     -- mmm --
<b>	
</b>	A pause. She glances at George scarcely moving her head.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- but you never were much of a tit
	     man --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Mmmm --
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- ass and legs --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Look who's talking.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Me?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- yes, you --
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Well of course. Who loves a big
	     fanny on a man?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Not me, pal.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie laughs. The Twins have gotten onto some sort of
	splashing contest with the boys. Water hits George and
	Jackie. They're hit again. They shrug, George rises, takes
	Jackie's hand. They walk on around the pool, beside and along
	a maze of hedgerows.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. SAMMY'S - THROUGH PORSCHE WINDOW
</b><b>	
</b>	as the slow moving car catches the rolling lawn seen earlier
	and the neat hedgerows which wind around the property.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Whose place is this?
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. SAMMY'S FOYER
</b><b>	
</b>	by the open staircase. Pope is greeting Sammy. Introducing
	Jill. Sammy's a tall, Jesus figure with an Indian shirt that
	goes to the knees on his levi's.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SAMMY
</b>	     Sure I know Jill.
<b>	
</b>	Lester is staring in some wonder at the girl who is still
	sitting on the staircase, nursing her baby. She looks up,
	smiles at Lester, who manages a nod back, doesn't take his
	eyes off the sight.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	          (noticing)
	     -- the bar's in there, Les.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LES
</b>	          (embarrassed)
	     -- oh, fine.
<b>	
</b>	He strolls off toward the bar which is half visible through
	the open foyer.
<b>	
</b><b>	AT THE BAR
</b><b>	
</b>	where Jill and George were earlier. Lester's ordered a drink.
	The huge black in the Afro offers him a toke. Lester stares
	at it dumbly.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (a little lamely,
	          indicating drink)
	     ... I'm...
<b>	
</b>	He takes his drink and half toasts the black. He stops and
	his eyes PAN the room. Lester is virtually the only person on
	his feet. Everyone else is either on the floor or on deep
	sofas, side by side, head to feet, barely talking, barely
	moving. In fact the most mobile thing in the room in smoke
	from the joints.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - LESTER
</b><b>	
</b>	Lester shakes his head as if to clear it. He takes a drink
	and almost on cue the ACID ROCK MUSIC HITS and the strobe
	lights go on.
<b>	
</b>	Lester is momentarily alarmed, as if it had something to do
	with his drink. He manages to stagger out of the strobe light
	effect, hangs onto a railing in the next room.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. KITCHEN - JILL, RED DOG AND POPE
</b><b>	
</b>	Jill stands over Red Dog who hasn't moved an inch, his
	measuring cup of wine still half filled.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     -- so what's new, Red Dog?
<b>	
</b><b>	               RED DOG
</b>	     Nothing, man. Same old shit. It's
	     the same old shit wherever you go,
	     nothing ever changes.
<b>	
</b>	Pope looks up, sees Lester just outside the kitchen door.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     Jill, scraves is a --
<b>	
</b>	He points toward the kitchen door where Lester looks like
	he's about to enter.
<b>	
</b>	Pope takes Jill and they move out the back door in the
	direction of the rear grounds that Jackie and George had
	taken earlier.
<b>	
</b><b>	LESTER
</b><b>	
</b>	peers into the kitchen. It's filled mostly with unkempt
	beards. He decides against it, turns up a small staircase and
	continues up it until he finds himself in a den.
<b>	
</b>	Several people are seated on the floor, quietly smoking and
	watching television. They seem a shade better dressed than
	those in the kitchen.
<b>	
</b>	Lester squints at the set which is a little blurry and
	partially blocked, by someone sitting directly in front of
	it. He kneels by a fortyish man in a bush jacket smoking a
	pipe.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (whispering)
	     -- how's it going?
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. DEN
</b><b>	
</b><b>	               MAN WITH PIPE
</b>	          (quietly)
	     -- just fine.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (squinting to see)
	     -- is that Illinois?
<b>	
</b><b>	               MAN WITH PIPE
</b>	          (taking a good look at
	          Lester, then)
	     No, that's Sally.
<b>	
</b>	Lester looks at the screen. Sally, handled by bare arms, is
	being placed on a foam rubber cushion. She laughs.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (dumbly)
	     -- Sally?
<b>	
</b><b>	               MAN WITH PIPE
</b>	          (pointing with his pipe
	          stem to a girl by
	          Lester's ear, also
	          watching the set)
	     -- Sally.
<b>	
</b>	Lester looks at Sally. She looks at Lester, nods. Turns back
	to screen to watch herself. Lester turns from Sally to see a
	television camera and the foam rubber mattress, now
	abandoned. Lester shakes his head.
<b>	
</b><b>	OUTSIDE ON GROUNDS WITH JILL AND JOHNNY POPE
</b><b>	
</b>	They're walking through shrubbery and hedges that lead them
	to a pair of empty deck chairs by the jacuzzi end of the
	pool. One of the Twins is still in the jacuzzi.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     -- so when are you going to Egypt?
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     You mean when are you going to
	     Egypt?
<b>	
</b>	Jill laughs. She turns and shakes her finger at Pope.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     Two weeks from tomorrow.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     You're going?
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     You're going.
<b>	
</b>	Jill stops cold. She turns to Pope.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     You're kidding.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     Those Arabs won't be when they
	     start chasing you around the sand
	     dunes.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	          (laughing)
	     Johnny!
	          (she hugs him)
	     Why didn't you tell me before?
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     -- just before I ask you out? I
	     can't do that. Let's get out of
	     here before good old Les catches up
	     with us again.
<b>	
</b>	There's a flash of light from the poolhouse window. Jill
	turns toward it, then back to Pope, still making up her mind.
	ANGLE SHIFTS SLIGHTLY to HOLD on light from window.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. POOLHOUSE - GEORGE AND JACKIE
</b><b>	
</b>	George has pulled a pair of cokes out of the fridge. He's
	looking at Jackie, closes the refrigerator lamely. It opens
	again and he closes it again.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     What's wrong?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- do you want ice?
<b>	
</b>	Interior poolhouse lit now by lights from outside.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- no.
<b>	
</b>	George pops the tops of the cans, hands one to Jackie.
	Neither one of them drink. They're staring steadily at each
	other, their eyes shining from reflections from the tennis
	court lights which someone has turned on.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (finally)
	     -- we're kidding ourselves.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (staring right back)
	     -- we are?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- last night I dreamt I was fifty
	     years old and Mary told me I was
	     supposed to meet Jill at the shop.
	     It seared me shitless.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Why?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I can't imagine being with Jill
	     when she's fifty years old. I can't
	     imagine not being with you.
<b>	
</b>	George moves to her. Jackie is waiting for him. They kiss. It
	is long and lingering and deliberate. George breaks away and
	goes to the poolhouse door. There's no lock, only an eye
	latch on the screen door. He latches it, tests it. It gives
	slightly. Nevertheless he shuts the door and heads back to
	Jackie who stands waiting.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- but what about her? I don't want
	     to hurt Jill.
<b>	
</b>	George takes the coke out of her hand. She lets him.
<b>	
</b><b>	LESTER
</b><b>	
</b>	walks back in the foyer, holding a drink, swaying. The strobe
	lights are going again in the living room.
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly he sees a girl, at least half nude, her huge painted
	lavender tits flashing at him through the strobe lights. The
	vision disturbs him greatly.
<b>	
</b>	He carefully steps down into the room in an effort to get
	near her. She seems to move. He moves after her through the
	lights down the length of the room, going as quickly as
	prudence allows. Finally when they reach the end of the
	living room she's disappeared. Then he looks out and sees her
	poised at the top of the steps a few yards away by the hedged
	path that leads down to the pool.
<b>	
</b>	He lunges toward the vision, and bounces off a sliding glass
	door.
<b>	
</b><b>	JILL AND JOHNNY POPE
</b><b>	
</b>	have made it through the entrance and Pope's Porsche is in
	sight. Jill suddenly stops and looks at Pope.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     What's wrong?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     We can't really leave that poor man
	     here alone.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	     -- he'll never know the difference.
<b>	
</b>	Jill is clearly thinking about something else besides Lester.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     -- still -- at least we should tell
	     him we're going. C'mon.
<b>	
</b><b>	               POPE
</b>	          (going along with it,
	          protesting)
	     I'm telling you he won't know the
	     difference.
<b>	
</b><b>	BY THE POOL - LESTER
</b><b>	
</b>	now with a sizable bump on his head he moves with the care
	that only tightrope walkers and drunks can move: every step
	is a possible disaster.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TWIN
</b>	          (from Jacuzzi)
	     Hey.
<b>	
</b>	Lester looks down, sees one of the Twins. Her arm is
	outstretched, her breasts dripping water VISIBLE through the
	shrubbery spotlights. She's holding a joint.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TWIN (CONT'D)
</b>	     -- it's getting soggy.
<b>	
</b>	Lester takes it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               THE GUY WITH HER
</b>	     -- just put it on the bench over
	     there and come on in.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     -- in there?
<b>	
</b><b>	               THE GUY
</b>	     Sure.
<b>	
</b>	Lester takes the joint and with fierce concentration makes it
	over to the bench. He puts the joint down.
<b>	
</b>	Stares at it. He looks up and there's the other Twin standing
	beside him, nude, with her breasts visible through the towel
	loosely flung over her shoulders.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TWIN
</b>	          (meaning joint)
	     Could I have that?
<b>	
</b>	Lester silently hands it to her. Stares at the pool and the
	other Twin isn't there. He looks back and the one who had
	taken the joint is gone. He looks back to the pool and the
	other Twin surfaces with the force of Flipper, beside the Guy
	in the pool.
<b>	
</b>	Lester stares, then he sighs and pulls off his pants, almost
	falling down as he does.
<b>	
</b>	Carrying them, he walks over to the edge of the jacuzzi.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Say --
<b>	
</b><b>	               THE GUY
</b>	     -- what is it now, man?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Do you know where I can find a
	     towel?
<b>	
</b><b>	               THE GUY
</b>	     -- the poolhouse.
<b>	
</b>	Holding his trousers, his tux shirt hanging half down over
	his boxer shorts, Lester moves on over to the poolhouse. He
	tries the door. The latch creaks. He pulls at it again and
	the latch pops open. He starts to open the door, then hears
	the unmistakable sounds of a couple in the throes of intense
	love making. The girl is quite carried away.
<b>	
</b>	Lester hesitates. He listens as her sighs, interspersed with
	fetching little sobs begin to mount in intensity. He thinks
	better of it. He takes his hand off the door knob and quietly
	closes the screen door.
<b>	
</b>	He starts to walk away, then notices the window on the side.
	He can't resist. He moves to it. He can't see anything. He
	moves closer. The dim, dark but classical outline of a man
	mounted on a woman moving with ease but increasing intensity
	can be SEEN. Lester watches. The SOUNDS are not as loud from
	this angle, but gradually they can be HEARD as the woman's
	cries grow louder. Lester is glued to the window.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL'S VOICE
</b>	     -- there you are. Les. Les -- Les --
	     Les, we're leaving.
<b>	
</b>	The ANGLE has BROADENED to SHOW Lester holding his pants, not
	taking his face away from the window. Jill and Johnny Pope
	stand beside him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Shhh --
	          (with genuine awe)
	     -- now that's what I call fucking.
<b>	
</b>	Pope almost inadvertently tries to look in the window.
<b>	
</b>	As he does, a light begins to flood the room. It is the
	refrigerator door slowly opening, due in part to the rhythmic
	impact of the lovers transmitted through the sofa to an end
	table to another end table and to the refrigerator.
<b>	
</b>	It opens until the light shines on the upper body and face of
	George and Jackie.
<b>	
</b><b>	LESTER
</b><b>	
</b>	who has been smiling continues to smile until the enormity of
	the image hits him. His face freezes. It is harsh and
	determined. He turns slowly away from the window and walks
	past Jill without looking at her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     -- what --
<b>	
</b>	She turns to the window and sees George and Jackie herself.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL (CONT'D)
</b>	          (watching)
	     Oh my God. Oh no, oh no. Oh no.
<b>	
</b>	She turns and picks up a wrought iron end table and hurls it
	through the window, shattering the glass everywhere.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL (CONT'D)
</b>	          (screaming)
	     You son of a bitch! You bastard!
<b>	
</b><b>	WITH GEORGE AND JACKIE
</b><b>	
</b>	George has leapt up.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Honey? Where've you been? We've
	     been looking everywhere for you.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie doesn't move, only stares wide-eyed through the broken
	window at the screaming Jill.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (softly)
	     Oh God.
<b>	
</b>	An ashtray is hurled into the room, smashing against the
	wall, and Jill can be SEEN now storming off with Pope.
<b>	
</b>	George, with one leg in his pants, rushes over to a far
	window, pulls it open.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Jill! Jill! Jill, goddammit!
<b>	
</b>	He's got the pants on backwards. He turns back to Jackie who
	has already slipped into her dress, is stuffing pantyhose
	into a purse.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     -- Jesus --
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- well you better go after her.
<b>	
</b>	He bends down, turns his pants around, and is hopping into
	them.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- shit...
	          (he grabs his shirt)
	     ... wait here, honey --
<b>	
</b>	He runs out of the door, beside the pool, past the jacuzzi
	and into the maze of hedgerows. The Twins stand motionless
	side by side in the water.
<b>	
</b><b>	               TWIN ONE
</b>	     George?
	          (to Twin Two)
	     Who was that?
<b>	
</b><b>	               TWIN TWO
</b>	     Far out.
<b>	
</b>	George, searching wildly through hedgerows, is calling Jill.
	He can't find her. He finds himself next to a ten foot ivy
	covered wall. He can't reach the top. He moves along the
	wall... arrives at a wrought iron gate. It's locked. He peers
	through the gate calling frantically:
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEROGE
</b>	     Jill, honey?
<b>	
</b>	Inches from his face on the other side of the gate, the bare
	teeth of a huge German Sheperd GROWL at him viciously. George
	chooses to go up the hedgerows toward the living room of the
	house.
<b>	
</b>	He trips and falls.
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	               RED DOG
</b>	     She just went out the door, man.
<b>	
</b>	George charges out the door in time to see the red Porsche's
	taillights blink bright at the end of the driveway before it
	purrs off into the night.
<b>	
</b>	George turns and runs back into the house and through the
	strobe-lighting living room.
<b>	
</b><b>	AT THE POOLHOUSE
</b><b>	
</b>	George heaving deep breaths now runs on into the poolhouse.
	The refrigerator door still hangs open. Window glass is
	scattered on the floor, and George steps on it, cutting his
	foot, hopping a little, pulling out a shard. Jackie's gone.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Jackie?
<b>	
</b>	He opens the poolhouse bathroom door.

</b>	     You're a trip and a half, man.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. THE HOUSE
</b><b>	
</b>	George runs through the living room again and the strobe
	lights. Again he reaches the foyer. Red Dog is still there.
	George is heaving deeply now.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Hey... you seen... Jackie...
<b>	
</b><b>	               RED DOG
</b>	          (pointing)
	     -- out the door, man.
<b>	
</b>	GEORGE charges out the door, this time seeing Jackie's 230SL
	pulling away, tires screeching.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (shouting)
	     Jackie!
<b>	
</b>	He looks down defeated. His foot is bleeding on the pavement.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. HIGH ROAD - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	George on his motorbike, COVERED by a few bars of Buffalo
	Springfield's 'For What It's Worth,' has thrown on a peacoat
	but kept on his velvet trousers. He's riding up what should
	now be a familiar road to Jill's. The lights from the city
	below flash in and out of view.
<b>	
</b><b>	JILL'S GARAGE - GEORGE
</b><b>	
</b>	pulls in. Her slot in the three car garage is empty, only the
	oil slick stares at him.
<b>	
</b>	There's the SOUND of a CAR coming down the road. He looks up
	expectantly. As it comes by the morning newspaper is tossed
	at his feet.
<b>	
</b>	George turns and fishes in the hanging planter by the door.
	He pulls out a key, blows the dirt off it and goes inside.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JILL'S - GEORGE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (swaying in)
	     Jill... Jill... Jill.
<b>	
</b>	He looks in bedroom, then moves back to the phone and dials.
	It rings three times.
<b>	
</b><b>	               OPERATOR'S VOICE
</b>	     Jackie Shawn.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- yeah, this is --
<b>	
</b><b>	               OPERATOR'S VOICE
</b>	     -- yes, George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I guess you haven't heard from her
	     yet.
<b>	
</b><b>	               OPERATOR'S VOICE
</b>	     Not yet.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Okay... thanks...
<b>	
</b>	He hangs up. Stares around the room. Jill's apartment is, as
	usual, good-little-girl tidy. (A contrast with Jackie's
	particularly kitchen.)
<b>	
</b>	George walks over to the window and look's at the city. He
	walks out onto the deck and sits in a deck chair.
<b>	
</b><b>	                                   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	GRAY SCREEN
</b><b>	
</b>	There is the SOUND of a CAR IDLING.
<b>	
</b>	George opens his eyes. Above him is the carport and Jill's
	yellow Mustang has just pulled in. George rises. He walks
	into the living room as Jill comes down the steps to the
	kitchen, carrying the paper. The kitchen clock reads 4:44.
<b>	
</b>	George glances at it. Then back at Jill. She looks at him,
	frightened but not moving. Her hair is stringy and she's got
	no makeup on. There's a bruise on the inside of her upper arm
	and a small one on her neck, and one on her left thigh all of
	which George will note in the course of the scene.
<b>	
</b>	George looks her up and down.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I don't want to fight, George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I don't want to fight either.
	     Look... uh -- I love you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Bullshit.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (moving to her, taking her
	          arm)
	     I do, Jill.
<b>	
</b>	At this point he notes the arm bruise. Jill stares back at
	him unflinching. George smiles.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     How come you took your own car?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	          (getting a cigarette)
	     I didn't want him meeting me here.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Well that's something.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     What is.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     You didn't plan on fucking him
	     tonight.
<b>	
</b>	Jill doesn't answer.
<b>	
</b>	She walks into the bedroom, kicks off her shoes, starts to
	take off her dress, then changes her mind and puts on a robe
	over it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     You did fuck him, didn't you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I'm very tired, George.
<b>	
</b>	Jill goes into the living room. George grabs her arm again.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Didn't you, baby?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Let go of me.
<b>	
</b>	George doesn't.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL (CONT'D)
</b>	     Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll
	     call the police.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Oh, Christ.
<b>	
</b>	He lets go of her. The PHONE RINGS. Jill answers it. Her tone
	alters appreciably.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Oh, hi... listen, can I call you
	     back?... Yes... no, everything's
	     fine, really... bye.
<b>	
</b>	She hangs up.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     That was him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Yes.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     You told him I was here and he
	     wanted to know if I was beating you
	     up.
<b>	
</b>	Jill smiles thinly.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Yes.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Well, did you get a job out of it
	     at least?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I'd like you to leave now.
<b>	
</b>	George doesn't move. Jill goes over and fishes into a tote
	bag by the wall. She returns with Felicia's missing earring.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL (CONT'D)
</b>	     -- and take this with you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Where did this come from?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Who knows, I'm sure you don't --
	     but if it'll help any, I found it
	     in your bed.
<b>	
</b>	George nods. Jill's anger is growing and her hurt is
	beginning to surface now. Tears start welling in her eyes.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL (CONT'D)
</b>	          (unsteadily)
	     So who else was there besides
	     Jackie? Huh?... huh?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Obviously there were others,
	     weren't there?
<b>	
</b>	George stares at Jill. Then:
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Obviously.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     How many?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What do you wanna know for?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I just want to know, that's all.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What difference does it make?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I just want to know while we were
	     seeing each other... I just don't
	     want girls looking at me and
	     knowing and me not knowing...
<b>	
</b>	Jill is crying a little now and looks very vulnerable. George
	moves to her and tries to put his arms around her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Baby, please don't... I love you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	          (breaking away)
	     I don't want to be a fool!... I
	     want to look them in the eye and
	     say, I know!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (she's backing up, he's
	          trying to touch her)
	     Baby, don't do this --
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	          (fighting for control)
	     -- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- please, baby --
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     -- no, it'll help me, really --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     How?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I'll know you've lied to me... all
	     along. I'll know you're incapable
	     of... love... that'll help me...
	     not now, but eventually.
<b>	
</b>	It's been rising in him the last few exchanges. Now all
	George's restraints seem to leave him. He stops trying to
	touch her and stands his ground, exploding:
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     You dumb cunt, everybody fucks
	     everybody, grow up, for Christ's
	     sakes. You're an antique, you know
	     that? Look around you -- all of
	     'em, all these chicks they're all
	     fucking, they're getting their hair
	     done so they can go and fuck,
	     that's what it's all about. Come
	     into the shop tomorrow and I'll
	     show you -- I fucked her, and her,
	     and her, and her, and her -- I
	     fucked 'em all!... That's what I
	     do, I fuck. That's why I went to
	     beauty school, to fuck. I can't
	     help that, they're there and I do
	     their hair and sometimes I fuck
	     'em. I stick it in and I pull it
	     out and that's a fuck, it's not a
	     crime.
<b>	
</b>	George leans on a glass topped coffee table for support, not
	even bothering to look at Jill. Jill has been pulled together
	a little more by the speech.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     ... well I'm glad you told me.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (his eyes closed)
	     Jesus.
<b>	
</b>	His tone has indicated disbelief and disgust.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I am... I mean, you know, that's...
<b>	
</b>	She can't finish It.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What? What? What? What? What?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     ... honest. At least you're honest
	     with me.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Does it make you happy?
<b>	
</b>	Jill doesn't answer.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I wish you'd go now.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     That's all you've got to say?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     -- yes.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- tell me something -- did you
	     talk about me?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     George...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Did you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Please!... that's not like you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah, I know. Did you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     George, now cut this out.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Did you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Stop it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Did you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     Yes, yes, I did.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What did you say?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     George, if you keep this up I'm
	     going to scream.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What did you say?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     George...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What did you say?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JILL
</b>	     I said you were a loser!
<b>	
</b>	She starts to cry again. George smiles.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No, I'm not a loser, baby, I just
	     sort of break even.
<b>	
</b>	George turns and walks up the stairs and out the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE
</b><b>	
</b>	George shuffles up the steps to his front porch and into the
	living room.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM
</b><b>	
</b>	George finds himself facing Lester and two other MEN who look
	like hoods. Lester sits in the chair George sat in the other
	night. Before him is a bottle of J &amp; B, a paper bucket filled
	with melting ice. The other men rise when George walks into
	the room.
<b>	
</b>	Lester, glass in hand, stares silently at George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (to the other two)
	     Wait outside, would you?
<b>	
</b>	The two Men walk toward George and pass him on either side,
	coming very close. Both of them are much bigger than George.
	They stare through George as they pass him.
<b>	
</b>	George continues to stand there. Lester, drinking, continues
	to stare. Lester glances idly around the living room. Then
	back to George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     You live like a pig.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yeah.
	          (Lester doesn't answer)
	     How long have you been here?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (looking it)
	     All night.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Well... who are those guys?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     What do they look like?...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Look, Lester... are you unhappy
	     with me about something?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about
	     something.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Well, what?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Godammit, George...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Now wait a minute...
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Sit down.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     But...
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I said sit down!
<b>	
</b>	One of the men opens the door and peers through the screen.
<b>	
</b><b>	               MAN
</b>	     Everything all right?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I'll call you, it's okay.
<b>	
</b>	George site down. Lester has risen to his feet, a little
	unsteadily.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     Now, George, I want to hear it from
	     you. Either you admit it, man to
	     man, to my face or I'll have him
	     pound it out of you, and he does a
	     hell of a job, believe me.
<b>	
</b>	George nods.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I believe you...
<b>	
</b>	Lester waits, standing over George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I wanna hear about it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Oh Jesus Christ.
<b>	
</b>	Lester slaps him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I wanna hear about it, George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Hey, have 'em put me away, or
	     whatever you're gonna do, okay?...
	     I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired
	     to tell the truth... I'm too tired
	     for anything.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I wanna hear about it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What can I say!
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I wanna know your thinking, I wanna
	     know how someone like you thinks.
	     Did you think you could get away
	     with it, did you think you could
	     put something over on me? Does a
	     guy like you get his kicks sneaking
	     around behind people's backs and
	     taking advantage of them? Maybe
	     that's your idea of being anti
	     Establishment!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I'm not anti-Establishment.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     That's got nothing to do with it...
	     You're so beyond my comprehension I
	     can't even discuss it with you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Then don't... just have 'em beat me
	     up or whatever you're gonna do.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     No, not yet, not yet. You worry
	     about it for a while, I've been
	     worrying all night, now you can
	     worry.
<b>	
</b>	A pause. Lester freshens his drink.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     Was it me, did you have something
	     against me?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What, do you think I planned it?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Did they have something against me?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Didn't they tell you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I wanna hear it from you!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (agonized)
	     ... how am I gonna tell you what
	     they have against you?
	     I mean Jesus fucking Christ,
	     they're women, aren't they? Have
	     you ever listened to women talk,
	     man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til
	     it's fucking coming out of my ears.
	     I'm on my feet all day, every
	     fucking day, listening to women
	     talk and you know what they talk
	     about, don't you? Being fucked up
	     by some guy. That's all that's on
	     their minds. I'm sure you've done
	     something they could get pissed off
	     about, what's that got to do with
	     it? All women are pissed off, man,
	     all of 'em. They fucking hate us!
	     Don't you know that?
<b>	
</b>	Lester has listened to this with some alteration of his
	intensity.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     ... yes, I follow your thinking on
	     that.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     We're always trying to fuck them...
	     they know it and they like it and
	     they don't like it... that's just
	     how it is... look, it's got nothing
	     to do with you, man. It just
	     happened. Felicia's got nothing to
	     do but shop and get her hair done
	     and she knows she's getting
	     older... her daughter hates her,
	     what's she going to do, go to PTA
	     meetings?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Do you think Lorna hates her? I
	     don't think she hates her. I mean
	     she may resent her a little...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates
	     her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Why, why do you think that is?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I
	     know?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Well, I don't know.
<b>	
</b>	A pause. Lester goes to pour himself another drink.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	          (to George)
	     Want a drink?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No thanks.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Have a drink.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Okay, thanks.
<b>	
</b>	Lester gets up and goes to the kitchen.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     You don't have a clean glass in the
	     house.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I know.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (talking to himself)
	     I'll have to wash one out.
<b>	
</b>	He turns on the faucet in the kitchen. He brings the glass.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     Jesus, what a way to live. I never
	     lived like this, not even when I
	     was your age, not even when I never
	     had a dime.
<b>	
</b>	George takes the drink. Lester just shakes his head.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     Hell of a way to treat a business
	     partner, that's all I can say.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Who?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Me!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Hey, you were never going to give
	     me the money.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (after a moment)
	     I was gonna give you the money.
	     Probably I was. Shit, I don't know,
	     I don't know anything anymore.
<b>	
</b>	Lester sits and stares into his drink.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     I tell you, you never know... you
	     just never know... one minute
	     you're here and the next... I mean
	     a man at my age, how long have I
	     got -- ten years? Five years? I
	     wish I knew... what I was living
	     for.
<b>	
</b>	George looks at him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     ... You can lose it all; you can
	     lose it all no matter who you
	     are... I don't know, what's the
	     point of having it all. Look at me.
	     I don't have a goddam thing... the
	     market's terrible right now, went
	     down ten points last week, goddam
	     Lyndon Johnson!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Oh yeah...
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Yeah,, it goes up a little and then
	     it goes down, maybe Nixon will do
	     something. What's the difference,
	     they're all a bunch of jerks. I
	     wouldn't let 'em run my business, I
	     can tell you that much. Not if I
	     had any choice in the matter.
	          (after a moment)
	     I don't know what to do with you. I
	     don't know, I don't know what's
	     right or wrong anymore.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I don't either, Lester, I swear to
	     you I don't.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	          (suddenly)
	     What about Jackie?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What about her?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I mean, how did that happen?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Lester, it just happened.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     She's nothing but a whore.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No --
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Just a whore, I go over there, have
	     a few drinks and get my gun off.
	     I'm through with her, she's nothing
	     but a whore.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     No, man, no. You can say
	     everybody's a whore. She's okay. I
	     mean Jackie'll fuck around but not
	     that much. Somewhere she really
	     likes you, Lester, and it's not
	     just the bread. She's okay.
<b>	
</b>	Lester sits and thinks about that.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     You really think so?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Yes I do.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     I'm finished with her.
<b>	
</b>	Lester goes to the door. He turns as if he'd just thought of
	something.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     Oh, by the way, I think you oughta
	     know -- Lorna thinks she's got the
	     clap.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What?
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER
</b>	     Yeah, the clap. That's what she
	     thinks. But who knows -- I don't
	     know.
<b>	
</b>	George nods. Lester shakes his head.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     I don't know anything anymore.
<b>	
</b>	He opens the door and goes out. The two hoods are standing
	there. They look to Lester.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	          (to hoods)
	     Go easy on him, he's a nice boy.
<b>	
</b>	George looks shocked. Lester laughs, gives George a playful
	punch.
<b>	
</b><b>	               LESTER (CONT'D)
</b>	     Just having a little fun, George...
	          (to hoods)
	     Go on home.
	          (to George)
	     I'll call you later about the shop.
	     I'm beat. God, I'm beat.
<b>	
</b>	With that, Lester's off.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. SHOP - GEORGE - DAY

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you?
	     And if you don't reach her, keep

</b>	          (on desk)
	     Mrs. Shumann and Mrs. Young are

<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Where's Mary?
<b>	
</b><b>	               DEVRA

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

	     Norman!
	          (to Devra)
	     Devra, I asked you to call Jackie.
	     Call her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               DEVRA

<b>

</b>	     What!
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Somebody's going to have to wash
	     Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
<b>	
</b><b>	               NORMAN
</b>	     You do it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	          (he's had about enough)
	     Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo
	     girl.
<b>	
</b><b>	               NORMAN
</b>	     You are today.
<b>	
</b>	George starts to say something but he's tired. He goes to his
	corner, slams his jacket down.
<b>	
</b><b>	               MRS. SHUMANN
</b>	     Temper, temper, George.
<b>	
</b>	George fiddles around with the shampoos and rinses, knocks
	over one where the top was not on, and the shampoo spills all
	over the table top and starts to drip on the floor.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Oh, Jesus, that fucking goddam Mary-
<b>	
</b>	He starts to look for a rag and sees that Mary, wearing a
	cloth coat is coming into the shop.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Mary! Get over here!
<b>	
</b>	Mary moves very slowly, George waits, hands on hips. It
	should almost be a little faggy, his petulance as if,
	inevitably some of the shop must rub off on him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Mary, where were you yesterday?
	     Huh?
<b>	
</b>	Mary doesn't answer.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     You ran out on me and you left it
	     like a goddamn pig pen.
<b>	
</b>	Mary's swaying.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk?
	     Look, I've had a rough night, one
	     of the roughest I've ever had, now
	     I'm not in the mood for any sulking
	     bullshit, what's wrong? Are you
	     sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARY

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE

<b>	
</b>	She points to his picture on the wall.
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARY
</b>	     My son Otis. He was killed in
	     Vietnam. They done phoned me at the
	     shop yesterday.
<b>	
</b>	It's suddenly very quiet. The SOUND of the SHAMPOO DRIPPING
	on the floor can be HEARD.
<b>	
</b><b>	GEORGE AND MARY
</b><b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Oh, Mary.
<b>	
</b>	Mary starts to cry and like a little child buries her head on
	George's shoulder.
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARY
</b>	     -- you shouldn't talk to me like
	     that no matter what, George... you

<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. STREET - GEORGE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	on his cycle drives up Bowmont into Jackie's driveway. Her
	car is there.
<b>	
</b>	George jumps off his bike, fairly races to the door. It's
	open and he barges in. He's met by Jackie's Yorkies who bark
	furiously, jumping up and down, nipping his pantlegs for
	attention.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE'S VOICE
</b>	     -- just a minute, you're early --
<b>	
</b>	Jackie comes walking out. She's carrying a large cooking
	spoon and wears an apron over a travelling outfit, a
	pantsuit. She's wearing more makeup than usual. She stops
	when she sees George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- good afternoon --
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- you've got to leave.
<b>	
</b>	George is not prepared for this.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I've got to leave?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     -- yes, honey, you've got to get
	     out of here.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Why?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Lester's on his way.
<b>	
</b>	George stares at her then walks past her into the living
	room. Bags are packed, a coat thrown over them. The wire
	kennel carrying cages for the Yorkies are beside the bags.
<b>	
</b>	George looks into the kitchen where Jackie's been cooking
	some pasta.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Where are you going?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Please, we'll have to talk later --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Look about last night --
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (exasperated but not
	          unkind)
	     Forget about last night, it's okay,
	     we'll talk when I get back --
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     It's not okay, I mean we've got to
	     talk now. Where are you going?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Look -- either you leave or I leave
	     because I don't want the two of us
	     here when Lester arrives. I just
	     don't --
<b>	
</b>	The level of her nervousness has just risen about fifty
	decibels. There's the SOUND of a CAR outside.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     My God that's him --
<b>	
</b>	George looks out the window.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     -- It's Malone's.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     That's it, then I'm leaving.
<b>	
</b>	With that she tosses the spoon onto an end table and rushes
	out the door. George starts after her. The DRY CLEANER comes
	to the door, stopping George.
<b>	
</b><b>	               CLEANER
</b>	     Cleaners.
<b>	
</b>	George has to fumble with Jackie's cleaning and keep the dogs
	contained. He does, tosses the cleaning down and races
	outside to his bike.
<b>	
</b><b>	ON THE STREET
</b><b>	
</b>	he sees Jackie's car rounding the corner, going up the hill,
	winding around the curves. George guns his bike and takes off
	after her.
<b>	
</b><b>	AROUND WINDING CURVES - GEORGE
</b><b>	
</b>	almost sideswipes a car parked on a hairpin turn. Jackie's on
	the curve above him.
<b>	
</b><b>	AT THE NEXT CURVE - GEORGE
</b><b>	
</b>	catches up with her, pulls even to her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Pull over, pull over!
<b>	
</b>	He threatens to run her into the curb. She stops the car
	sharply and jumps out.
<b>	
</b><b>	AT THE TOP OF THE DRIVE
</b><b>	
</b>	They've reached a cul de sac where there's a parched 'view
	lot' not built on.
<b>	
</b>	Yellow October weeds cover it and there's a huge television
	antenna in its center which sways slightly in an afternoon
	wind.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie has run onto the lot, then slows to a walk. She grabs
	one of the rusty stays of the swaying antennas, stares down
	below her.
<b>	
</b>	Her house can be seen from this angle, the Malone's truck
	just pulling away.
<b>	
</b>	George comes up to her.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (looking below her)
	     You're going to kill me.

</b>	     No --
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	          (turning to him,
	          imploring)
	     Well then what are you trying to do-
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I want to marry you. I want to take
	     care of you and I want your
	     children, and I want you to be my
	     girl. That's all I want. That's all
	     I want out of my life, and it's a
	     lot.
<b>	
</b>	She stares at him in disbelief. She actually clutches her
	stomach.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Look, I don't know if I'll ever
	     make it. I mean I'm a fuckup, but
	     I'll take care of you, I'll make
	     you happy, I swear to God I will.
<b>	
</b>	Jackie doesn't answer. She slowly sinks to the ground. George
	sinks beside her. Her eyes are wet.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for
	     God's sake, answer me.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     If you knew how many times I wanted
	     to hear you say that...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     So I'm saying it...

<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What's too late about it? Look,

	     only thing that's too late.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE

	     flight. He's asked me to marry him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     So what? You don't love him, do
	     you? Answer me.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     What's that supposed to mean?
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I don't know... Jackie?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     What?
<b>	
</b>	George now is very near tears himself. What he says now he
	has to force out of himself, as if it's the biggest secret he
	holds.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     I don't trust... anyone... but
	     you...
<b>	
</b>	George lets his head fall on her shoulder. She's kneeling,
	supported by the television aerial, and George cries quietly
	on her shoulder. She has her arm around him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     Oh my baby...
<b>	
</b>	As she's holding George, and looking down the hill, Lester's
	silver Rolls pulls up. Lester gets out of the car, goes to
	the front door.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	     God, there's Lester...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Don't go, Jackie...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     I can't just let him stand by the
	     door...
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     Don't leave me...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     I've got to... I've got to tell him
	     where I am.
<b>	
</b><b>	               GEORGE
</b>	     What for?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JACKIE
</b>	     I don't know -- I've got to.
<b>	
</b>	She gets up and hurries over to her car, starts it and goes
	back down the hill. George sits under the television aerial
	and watches her car go down the hill, periodically flashing
<b>	INTO VIEW.
</b><b>	
</b>	Finally she pulls up while Lester is pacing back and forth.
	She hurries to him. He taxes her by the shoulders. They talk
	for a moment. The discussion looks like Jackie is giving
	Lester directions. She glances uneasily up toward George.
<b>	
</b>	George is watching them.
<b>	
</b>	He sees that Lester and Jackie have their backs to him, his
	arm around her shoulder, hers around his waist. They're going
	through the front door.

</b><b>	THE END
