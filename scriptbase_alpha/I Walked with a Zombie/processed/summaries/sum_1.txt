A young Canadian nurse, Betsy Connell, arrives in St. Sebastian in the West Indies to care for Jessica Holland, wife of wealthy sugar plantation owner Paul Holland.
For Betsy, she seems to be living in paradise, despite Paul's dim view of his surroundings.
His half-brother Wesley Rand is much cheerier.
When Betsy finally meets Jessica, she finds her walking in the garden late at night as though she were in a trance.
Dr. Maxwell explains that Jessica had a severe tropical fever that burned out portions of her spine, leaving her in a zombie-like state.
Maxwell and Betsy recommend insulin shock treatment.
Betsy also begins to wonder if voodoo might be able to cure her.
