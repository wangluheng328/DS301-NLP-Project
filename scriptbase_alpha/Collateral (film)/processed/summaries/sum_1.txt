Los Angeles cab driver Max Durocher lives an incredibly mundane life.
He drives a cab day in and day out - and has for the last twelve years.
His only escape from reality is a photo of a tropical island and the fact that he wants to start his own limo company.
All that changes when a government investigative attorney named Annie Ferrell gets in his cab from the airport.
Max is seemingly unaware of the case that Annie is involved in is about to have dire consequences for his very life.
Immediately after dropping Annie off downtown, he picks up a fare who's known only by his first name - Vincent.
Vincent offers Max a deal he can't refuse - $700 for making five stops, then getting him to the airport without making a run for it.
But at the first stop, a body drops from the sky and Max soon realizes that Vincent is someone he's probably better off not knowing.
Vincent is a calculating assassin hired by the very people being prosecuted by Annie - who's out to wipe out all the witnesses in the federal prosecution trial.
Will Max make it out alive and live to tell the tale?
Or will Vincent require more trunk space in the cab?
