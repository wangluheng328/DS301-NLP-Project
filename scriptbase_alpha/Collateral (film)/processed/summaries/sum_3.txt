One night in Los Angeles, cab driver Max Durocher picks up a gray-suited man named Vincent.
Vincent offers Max a large sum of money to drive him to five locations around LA before the night is up.
Max accepts, but realizes that Vincent is a hitman who has been hired to kill five people that night.
Max is forced to drive Vincent around the City of Angels, unsure if he'll live to see sunrise.
