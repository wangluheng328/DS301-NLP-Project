For Max, the dreams of his own limo company are what keep him afloat from the mundane reminder of his real job: taxi driver, which he has been doing for over a decade.
But one fateful night, Max has one cab fare that he would never expect named Vincent.
He's a smooth, charismatic fellow who is sharply dressed and apparently wealthy, offering Max an excellent tip if he'll bring him to five stops throughout Los Angeles.
But fate intervenes and Max soon finds out that Vincent isn't a businessman, but a contract hitman making his rounds.
As the night progresses, Max finds himself under the microscope of a coldblooded killer.
Meanwhile, the police and FBI are onto Max's cab while the two ultimately play a psychological cat and mouse game, that will lead to an inevitable climax neither would anticipate.
