Max Durocher is a night-shift cab driver in Los Angeles.
He's planning a limo company called Island Limos, but has been a cab driver for twelve years.
One night, he picks up a passenger named Vincent who seems like another ordinary passenger.
But when he drops Vincent off at his location and waits for him as asked, a body falls on his cab, and it becomes clear that Vincent is actually a hitman, and he's got four more stops to make.
