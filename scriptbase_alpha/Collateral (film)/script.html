<br/>     slide past in a 400mm lens. Then, entering a plane of focus is
<br/>     VINCENT. He walks towards us...an arriving passenger. Suit.
<br/>     Shirt. No tie. Sunglasses and expensive briefcase say
<br/>     "confident executive traveler." The suit's custom-made but not
<br/>     domestic. His hair and shades are current, but it would be
<br/>     difficult to describe his identifying specifics...grey suit,        *
<br/>     white shirt, medium height. And that's the idea...                  *
<br/>
<br/><b>     CLOSE BEHIND VINCENT
<br/></b>
<br/>     OVER his left shoulder, walking through milling travelers           *
<br/>     towards the distant wall of metal and glass, sunlight streaming
<br/>     at him...
<br/>
<br/><b>     ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN
<br/></b>
<br/>     - suit, blonde crew cut - walks to camera. Same sunlight, but
<br/>     it hits him from the side. His trajectory is from the left.
<br/>     His eyeline is slightly right. Just now, he looks down at a
<br/>     ticket in his hand...
<br/>
<br/><b>     OVER VINCENT'S LEFT SHOULDER...
<br/></b>
<br/>     right now something catches Vincent's eye.   And the two men bump
<br/>     into each other...
<br/>
<br/><b>     TWO-SHOT...
<br/></b>
<br/><b>                            VINCENT
<br/></b>                You okay?    Sorry...
<br/>
<br/>     Vincent puts down his briefcase.   The man has a similar
<br/>     briefcase.
<br/>
<br/><b>                          MAN

<br/><b>     VINCENT GRABS THE BRIEFCASE OF THE MAN
<br/></b>
<br/>     with the North London working-class accent. And continues
<br/>     towards the exit. Was it an accident? Was it a brush pass?
<br/>     The Man's accent signified nothing to us except one thing:

<br/>     Images wipe across the screen, kinetic and abstract, floating

<br/>
<br/>     Shades of yellow.   Ribbons of silver.    Shimmers of chrome.
<br/>
<br/>     Headlights sweeping past, flaring to white. Brake lights
<br/>     flashing, halating red. Reflections of overhead fluorescence
<br/>     flowing like liquid along windshield glass...
<br/>
<br/>     SOUNDS are dreamlike and abstract, reverberated and discordant,
<br/>     bouncing off concrete walls: car doors OPENING and CLOSING.
<br/>     Brakes. A BABBLE of multi-lingual crosstalk.

<br/>    A dream place. An endorphin-releasing groove. Limitless

<br/>      Max pulls himself up by the steering wheel, trying to get his
<br/>      butt off the seat to give the Young Man access. The White Guy
<br/>      #1 gropes for Max's back pocket, trying to get the wallet,
<br/>      pressing the gun to his face, the other guys down the alley,
<br/>      turn the corner.
<br/>
<br/>      White Guy #1 pulls Max's wallet, pockets it...
<br/>
<br/>      ...and pauses, seeing Vincent's briefcase on the back seat.
<br/>
<br/>      He yanks open the back door, grabs Vincent's briefcase, too, and
<br/>      walks off after his friends. White Guys #3 and #4 turned the
<br/>      corner. White Guy #2 lingers.
<br/>
<br/>      Max, still taped, is shaken. He can't believe what happened.
<br/>      He looks through the windshield at...

<br/>
<br/>      He closes on Vincent with the .380, held high and on the side.
<br/>      Vincent's left slams aside #1's .380. Draws and FIRES from the
<br/>      hip, putting TWO ROUNDS into #1. HAMMERS-ON TWO ROUNDS to the
<br/>      sternum, pivots. ONE to the head of #2. All in 1.6 seconds.
<br/>
<br/>      White Guy #2, falling backwards, is dead before he hits the
<br/>      ground. #1 never saw it coming. Vincent picks up his case,
<br/>      retrieves something from #1's pocket, puts one more into the            *
<br/>      head of #1 on the way back to the cab...

<br/>
<br/>      The rear door opens. Vincent hefts his briefcase into the back
<br/>      seat. He gets into the front.
<br/>
<br/>      Vincent sits for a moment, staring off, not looking at Max.
<br/>      Maybe ready to kill him.

<br/>      Vincent raises something into view.    Max's wallet.     He tosses it
<br/>      in Max's lap.

<br/>     THREE SMALL POPS. A different gun: .22 caliber Ruger with a

<br/>     falls forward. Vincent catches it, arranges Daniel's arms so

<br/>     Max is stunned beyond words, and powder-burned at such close

<br/>                But my children do. They are still

<br/>                even better than Santa Claus? His
<br/>                helper, Pedro Negro. Black Peter.
<br/>                There's an old Mexican tale that tells
<br/>                of how Santa Claus got so very busy
<br/>                looking out for the good children that
<br/>                he had to hire some help to look out
<br/>                for the bad children. So he hired
<br/>                Pedro. And Santa Claus gave him a
<br/>                list with all the names of all the bad
<br/>                children, and Pedro would come every
<br/>                night to check them out. And the
<br/>                people, the little kids that were
<br/>                misbehaving, that were not saying                        *
<br/>                their prayers, Pedro would leave a
<br/>                little wooden donkey on their windows.
<br/>                And he would come back and if the
<br/>                children were still misbehaving, he
<br/>                would take them away and nobody would
<br/>                ever see them again. Now, if I am
<br/>                Santa Claus and you are Pedro, how do
<br/>                you think jolly old Santa Claus would
<br/>                feel if one day Pedro came into his
<br/>                office and said, 'I lost the list.'?
<br/>                How FUCKING FURIOUS do you think Santa
<br/>                Claus would get?!

<br/>      looks to the right as...

<br/>      with ferocious force, slamming Bodyguard #1 into
<br/>      unconsciousness...
<br/>
<br/>      Bodyguard #2 intuits, turns. Vincent's foot slams his knee

<br/>       Vincent turns his head slightly, watching Max draw cautiously
<br/>       nearer. Max stares down, seeing the blood spreading across the
<br/>       floor beneath Vincent. Turning into quite a pool.
<br/>
<br/>       Vincent tries to speak, can't quite manage. Max sits across
<br/>       from him. Annie appears in b.g., watching them.
<br/>
<br/><b>       VINCENT + MAX
<br/></b>
<br/>       sit there, riding the train.   Softly:
<br/>
<br/><b>                            MAX
<br/></b>                  We're almost at the next station.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/><b>                                                            (CONTINUED)

<br/></b>                                  10/9/03 MM revs. (yellow)    112.
<br/><b>107    CONTINUED:                                                      107
<br/></b>
<br/>       Vincent smiles faintly. He leans his head toward Max as if
<br/>       conferring a secret. In a halting whisper:
<br/>
<br/><b>                              VINCENT
<br/></b>                    Guy. Gets on a subway. Dies.
<br/>                        (off Max's look)
<br/>                    Think anybody'll notice?
<br/>
<br/><b>       MAX
<br/></b>
<br/>       looks into Vincent's eyes. It means "I'm that guy" and "will
<br/>       anybody notice me when I'm gone?"
<br/>
<br/><b>       VINCENT
<br/></b>
<br/>       leans back, gazing straight ahead now.   Rocking gently with the
<br/>       motion of the train...
<br/>
<br/>       ...and with much effort and to Max's amazement, Vincent emits a
<br/>       soft, rasping wheeze, but it's a faint laugh all the same.
<br/>
<br/>       Max has no idea what's so funny to a dying man.    Vincent looks.
<br/>
<br/>       Max follows his gaze. There, right across the car, among all
<br/>       the ADVERTISEMENTS near the ceiling, is:
<br/>
<br/><b>       AN AD
<br/></b>
<br/>       The whitest sand and bluest sea you can imagine.   A dream place.
<br/>       Limitless horizon.                                                    *
<br/>
<br/><b>107A   INT. VINCENT'S CAR - MAX - DAWN                                107A
<br/></b>
<br/>       Vincent's no longer laughing.   In fact, Vincent's no longer
<br/>       doing anything. Ever.
<br/>
<br/>       Annie comes to Max and sits. She shivers. Max takes off his
<br/>       zippered, hooded sweatshirt and puts it around Annie. It's a
<br/>       small gesture. But it's a protective and confident act... She
<br/>       takes his hand. Dawn lightens the sky ahead. They ride the
<br/>       train together, side by side, neither saying a word. For now.
<br/>
<br/>       The train pulls in to a station...
<br/>
<br/><b>       WIDE ANGLE OF SUBWAY CAR
<br/></b>
<br/>       ...and Max pulls Annie to her feet. The doors open. They
<br/>       silently get off. The first sideways streams of yellow light
<br/>       shaft into the station.
<br/>
<br/>       The doors close again.   The train pulls out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>       WE HOLD ON Vincent for a while. Riding the train by himself,
<br/>       into the dawn, his head back as if sleeping, alone in the car,     *
<br/>       as the sun rises.
<br/>
<br/>       Another dead guy on the subway...riding into a new day.
<br/>
<br/>       And Max, in his Polo shirt and dirty pants, an arm around Annie,   *
<br/>       wearing his stained sweatshirt, rises to us up the                 *
<br/>       escalator...freeways, arteries of traffic behind them.             *
