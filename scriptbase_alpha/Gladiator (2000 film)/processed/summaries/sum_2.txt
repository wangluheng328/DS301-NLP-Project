Upon the sudden death of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, his trusted and successful general Maximus Meridas is unlawfully imprisoned and condemned to the gladiator games by Marcus' twisted son Commodus.
As the new emperor, Commodus fears Maximus could use his heroic stature to depose him and become leader himself.
But Maximus gains fame as a gladiator and uses his celebrity to cause further damage to Commodus' tenuous hold on the susceptible Roman people, hoping to inspire them to rediscover their lost values and overcome the corruption that is eating away at them.
These actions prompt Commodus to square off mano a mano with Maximus in the Colisseum with the fate of Rome at stake.
