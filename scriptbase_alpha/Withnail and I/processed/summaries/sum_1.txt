London: The Sixties.
Two down-on-their-luck actors (Withnail and Marwood) find solace in drink and other substances.
Seeking respite from their uneventful lives they escape up north to Penrith to Withnail's uncle's stone cottage.
Faced with no modern conveniences, a bunch of oddball locals, and a surprise visit from an amorous "Uncle Monty", their wits are tested, along with their friendship.
