</b>
<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS - NIGHT 1
</b>

<b>          SUPERIMPOSURE:
</b>
<b>          MANHATTAN. 10.30 P.M.
</b>          Park Avenue in mid-December. On the lampposts, Xmas lights
          sparkle over streets slick with slush and rain. Limousines
          line up for a public function.

<b>          2 EXT. BLACKWOOD BUILDING - NIGHT 2
</b>

<b>          SUPERIMPOSURE:
</b>
<b>          BLACKWOOD'S AUCTION HOUSE
</b>          Under black umbrellas, wealthy men and women exit the limos
          and enter a stately ten-story building. On the facade, a
          sign reads: TONIGHT - TREASURES OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EUROPE.
          A SHADOWY FIGURE lurks in an alley near the corner. His
          features are hidden by a broad-brimmed hat. He watches as-
          The guests present gleaming, golden invitations to the
          security people at the door.

<b>          SHADOWY FIGURE
</b>          (in Elvish, subtitled)
          I'll go up first. You'll enter from below-
          He addresses WINK, an eight-foot tall TROLL with grey skin
          and a huge scar over his left, empty, eye socket. His right
          hand is missing and he sports a heavy IRON MACE instead. A
          plume of breath escapes from his brutish mouth.

<b>          SHADOWY FIGURE (CONT'D)
</b>          And remember Wink-

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          Don't be shy.
          He extends his arms and with a swoop, he climbs the wall,
          up, up, like a bat. Five floors up...

</b>
<b>          AUCTIONEER
</b>          Pre-Celtic votive sculpture is in granite
          and has been dated circa 700 B.C.
          Like the guests, the AUCTIONEER is dressed in formal wear.
          TV MONITORS display the image of the statue so the bidders
          can have a closer look.

<b>          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
</b>          We'll open the bidding at two hundred
          thousand dollars.
          A DISTINGUISHED BUYER raises his hand-

<b>          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
</b>          Two hundred and seventy-five, and... we
          have three hundred, thank you Mr. Van
          Hausen - Three hundred thousand once-
          A FEMALE BIDDER raise her hand-

<b>          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
</b>          And Three hundred and fifty thousand,
          thank you Mrs. Bernstein-
          As the auction carries on, a STEWARD leaves the room and
          heads down -

<b>          4 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT 4
</b>
          -a darkened corridor where other STEWARDS wheel auction lots
          to and from the sales room.
          The STEWARD notices an open window at the end of the
          corridor. He leans out and looks down. Ten stories below - a
          snow-covered alley.
          Suddenly, he sees the SHADOWY FIGURE above the window frame,
          clinging to the smooth granite wall!!

<b>          STEWARD
</b>          What the h-
          Quick as lightning, the SHADOWY FIGURE covers the steward's
          mouth. When he withdraws his hand, the steward's mouth has

<b>          VANISHED!!!
</b>          The Shadowy Figure grabs the hapless man by the lapels,
          hauling him outside and dangling him over the void.
          Far below: a spiked wrought-iron fence.

</b>          A silent human- almost as good as a dead
          one...

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          Almost.
          He releases the STEWARD, who falls-

<b>          -DOWN-
</b>
<b>          -DOWN-
</b>          -down- TKKCT!!!
          Flailing in utter silence. All the way. Onto the fence.
          The Figure slips through the window and moves into the-

<b>          AUCTIONEER
</b>          And now, for our next item. Lot #777.
          Two STEWARDS wheel in an oaken box and open it. Nestled in
          maroon velvet is an eight-inch, ornately decorated arc of
          gold.

<b>          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
</b>          A once-in-lifetime opportunity. For the
          first time in auction. A piece of the
          Royal Crown of Bethmoora... A precious
          artifact dating from the Atrebatean
          period. Exquisite workmanship in 24 carat
          gold.
          The lights flicker briefly, provoking MURMURS from the
          audience.

<b>          AUCTIONEER (CONT'D)
</b>          Please- please- ladies and gentlemen...
          may I have your attention. As I was
          saying, observe the fanciful creatures
          adorning the outer surface, figures from
          a lost mythology...
          The lights go out completely. From the sudden darkness, the
          Shadowy Figure speaks up.

<b>          SHADOWY FIGURE
</b>          Lost- ? Not at all. Forgotten by you
          perhaps, but very much alive.

<b>          BELLBOY 2 4
</b>          A few emergency lights come on, revealing The Shadowy
          Figure, who walks down the aisle to confront the auctioneer.

<b>          AUCTIONEER
</b>          Sir, would you please identify yourself?
          I see no badge or-

<b>          SHADOWY FIGURE
</b>          Shall we just say that I am the rightful
          owner of this piece?
          He seizes the artifact. The auctioneer grabs a phone and
          hits a button.

<b>          AUCTIONEER
</b>          (to a Steward)
          Security- Call Security-
          This is an outrage- An-
          The SHADOWY FIGURE reaches into his pockets and throws a
          handful of seeds at the Auctioneer's feet.

<b>          AUCTIONEER
</b>          -Outrage of-
          KRRRRR-K the seeds sprout into massive, thick branches and
          roots and instantly engulfing the Auctioneer amidst coils of
          wooden branches, crushing him. They grow and grow until they
          crack the ceiling!!
          Soon the Auctioneer disappears, and in its place stands a
          compact, twisted tree. Tiny creatures emerge from its
          branches and crawl around the trunk.
          CRASH!!!!! Four SECURITY GUARDS come flying through the side
          doors and land in the aisles with a THUD!!! The spectators
          scream.
          WINK walks in. He carries two large IRON BOXES on his back.
          On the sides of the boxes A ROYAL SEAL, embossed in the
          metal.
          People cower in the corners, SCREAMING in terror and
          disbelief.
          WINK shrugs the iron boxes to the floor with a CLANG!!!!
          Inside them, little clawed THINGS are scrabbling - mewling,
          fast and hungry!!
          At the Shadowy Figure's signal, the troll opens the cages...
          and the people's SCREAMS redouble.

<b>          SHADOWY FIGURE
</b>          May this remind you all why you once
          feared the dark...
          A multitude of eyes glint in the darkness, rows and rows of
          tiny teeth shine greedily. They lunge at CAMERA.

<b>          6 EXT. BPRD HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 6

           Guards with German Shepherds patrol the fence line.
           Searchlights sweep the surrounding woods.
           Super: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

<b>           TRENTON, N.J. 10.08 P.M.
</b>
<b>          7 INT. BROOM'S LIBRARY - NIGHT 7
</b>
          A Christmas tree glows next to the fireplace; Mozart is
          playing on the aquarium's underwater speakers. Floating in
          warm water on a cloud of bubbles is ABE SAPIEN, lost in the
          music.
          A blurry figure approaches and raps a ring finger against
          the tank: It's TOM MANNING, chief FBI liaison to the BPRD.
          Looking dyspeptic, he presses a folder against the glass:

<b>          TOP SECRET.
</b>
<b>          MANNING
</b>          Hey, Fishstick- We gotta talk.

<b>          $ INT. FREAK CORRIDOR - NIGHT 8
</b>
          As they walk down the hall, manning shows Abe.

<b>          MANNING
</b>          Look at that- Each photo costs a fortune
          to suppress. And then, naturally, they
          pop up on the net.
          CAMERA moves in on Abe's breathing apparatus. It's sleek,
          more modern, fitting snugly to his gills and neck. His
          goggles are new, too.
          He examines a photo of Hellboy bounding down a city street,
          brandishing his mighty, high-caliber Samaritan. He's looking
          straight at the camera lens.

</b>          Oh, Lord- He's smiling in this one.

<b>          MANNING
</b>          I know- It's not just the money. It's the
          provocation. This is asking for trouble.
          His ego-
          Manning leans close to a voice-recognition security mike.

<b>          MANNING
</b>          "Man-ning..."
          He enunciates each syllable perfectly, then turns to Abe.

</b>
          The crowd is screaming. Half a dozen smoldering fairies
          climb out of the smoking crater and snarl at the crowd.
          People shrink back in horror. One of the hungry critters
          jumps at a woman but-
          BLAM!! Hellboy shoots it in mid-air, then calmly and
          efficiently shoots its fellows.
          Finally, he plucks one last creature off his coat. He holds
          it up by the tail, like a rodent.
          Manning hurries forward, witness to his worst nightmare. A
          sea of camera flashes explodes on a grinning Hellboy.

          Guard 1 watches TV. HB is on the screen, surrounded by press
          and TV.

<b>          GUARD 1
</b>          Check it out. That guy's make-up is so

<b>          GUARD 2
</b>          And what's with his forehead? Is that
          goggles?
          He looks out the window and sees the THE SHADOWY FIGURE
          standing by the gates.

<b>           GUARD 2 (CONT'D)
</b>           Hey, we got us a wino.

</b>          Hey- buddy- get the-
          The THE SHADOWY FIGURE whirls and drops his coat. He
          unsheathes a long, thin sword, slicing the air around the
          guard.
          The guard's shadow in the background is cut into three parts
          and collapses.

          Guard 1 tunes in a game show. Looks outside-
          -no sign of his buddy. Behind him, at the window, WINK
          appears. Its MASSIVE ARM punches through the wall and hauls
          off the GUARD and then slams his massive IRON MACE down!!!

</b>          THE SHADOWY FIGURE wipes off his sword over the crumpled

</b>          Effortlessly, the SHADOWY FIGURE vaults the chainlink fence
          and walks into the roundhouse. WINK smashes the fence and
          follows him through.

          A few pigeons flutter through a forest of steel pillars.
          Radiant fingers of moonlight shine on the old train tracks.
          THE SHADOWY FIGURE and WINK stop as a dozen ROYAL GUARDS in
          helmets and light armor march out from a tunnel.
          After a pause, a CHAMBERLAIN joins them. He bows low in a
          show of respect for the Shadowy Figure.

<b>          CHAMBERLAIN

          The Chamberlain leads the way down a tunnel lined with more
          guards. The armed men surround the Prince as they stop at an
          intersection.
          The Prince prepares to unsheathe his sword- WINK growls.

<b>          CHAMBERLAIN
</b>          I beg you, your majesty. Before entering
          the chamber you surrender your sword.

          A tense beat and then the Prince relents.
          The guards accept his weapon, carefully pat him down-

</b>          Mr. Wink however- cannot dispose of his
          weapon. He will wait here-

<b>          39 INT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT 39
</b>
          An abandoned machine shop functions as a council chamber.
          High-ranking heads of outlandish MAGICK FAMILIES are there:
          goblins, trolls, dwarves and elves.
          At the center sits KING BALOR The One-armed King of Elfland
          and, behind him, the willowy, beautiful PRINCESS NUALA, the
          Prince's sister.
          Both on the King's chest and her own, a large golden piece
          dangles from a chain.
          Nuala's resemblance to the Prince is uncanny, down to the
          fine scars marring their perfect faces. They're YING and
          YANG, almost the same being.
          The Prince eyes the doors closing behind him. The armed
          guards watch his every move.
          He bows his head and kneels.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          Father.
          (eyes the Princess)

<b>          SISTER-
</b>          The KING gestures for him to rise.

<b>          KING
</b>          Why have you done this??
          His voice trembles with anger.

<b>          KING (CONT'D)
</b>          Why? !
          The Prince looks at him, defiant.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          I have returned from exile to set us
          free. All of us, Father- And to reclaim
          what has been taken from our people. The
          land and the freedom that is rightfully
          ours.

<b>          KING
</b>          No- You have broken a truce that has

          for themselves, their Gods or the earth-

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          And they scorn us- every time they raise
          a dead, cold building, destroy a forest,
          or take more land-
          The PRINCESS then steps forward.

<b>          PRINCESS
</b>          What they do is in their nature. We must
          honor our side of the agreement-

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          Honor-?

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          Look at this place. Is this where you
          hold court??

<b>          (BEAT )
</b>          Is this how we are to live?? Amidst their
          filth, in their rubble??? Picking at
          scraps from their table??? Where is the
          honor in that??

<b>          KING
</b>          And what would your solution be-? War?
          Why?

<b>          (PAUSE)
</b>          It may just be that our days are ended...

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          It may be- but we will not go quiet. We
          will not fade like this. Better to burn
          than fade away... And for this...
          Prince Nuada looks around, locking eyes with the heads of
          the clans.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          .we'll need the help of the Good... the
          Bad... and the Worst-
          He brings out the gold artifact from the auction. Holds it
          high.
          The crowds GASPS. The King instinctively covers the
          companion piece hanging from his chest as a medallion.

<b>          KING
</b>          No- you cannot be that mad-

</b>          Yes. I am.

</b>          This is the path you wish to take?
          Knowing the cost?

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          Yes, Father- it is.
          The King takes the Princess' hand and mournfully lowers his
          head.

<b>          KING
</b>          Then, I am sorry my son- you leave me no
          choice.
          (looks at his guards)
          Death.
          His two PRAETORIAN GUARDS unsheathe their swords.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>
<b>          (GRIM)
</b>          I agree. Death it is-
          And the guards turn toward the king and stab him. The
          Princess screams. The Prince looks away as the old monarch
          tumbles from his throne, dead. The heads of the clans try to
          flee, but are kept at bay by the other guards.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          Hear me all!!! There are some amongst you
          that have already seen the light-
          (he nears the guards)
          Seen the future...
          The PRAETORIAN GUARDS cover his back as he leans forward to
          his Father"s corpse and snatches the medallion.

<b>          PRINCE (CONT'D)
</b>          As for you- You may join us in our quest
          or die now-
          His gaze is fierce, inspired. He joins the pieces together,
          they fuse and interconnect through the magical equivalent of
          NANOTECHNOLOGY. Minute gears and hooks join the pieces
          seamlessly into an almost complete CROWN. The Prince raises

<b>          IT-

          it's always been...

<b>          (BEAT)
</b>          And now, my sister-
          The Prince looks around and sees that his sister is gone.
          He pushes through the mob, pulling his guards to the door.

<b>           PRINCE (CONT'D)
</b>           Find her- Find her-
           His minions surge into the tunnels.

<b>          40 TNT. TUNNEL MAZE - NIGHT 40
</b>           Clutching the medallion on her chest , the Princess runs
          down a tunnel. A CROWD gathers behind her, chasing her as
          she zig-zags from tunnel to tunnel.
          With perfect calm, she ducks into a niche, then slides down
          a chute.
          She lands in a stone chamber lined with bookshelves.

<b>          41 INT. PRINCESS CHAMBER - DAY 41

          The Princess rushes to a small cabinet. She grabs an
          ancient, leather-bound tome.
          She turns to leave, but a horde of TROLLS rushes and quickly
          surrounds her. One of the beasts swings a heavy, rusty
          sword.
          It opens a gash in the princess' left arm-

          The Prince, rushing through the tunnel with the PRAETORIAN
          GUARDS, suddenly doubles over, cursing. Blood pours from a
          wound in his left arm.

</b>           (calling out)
           Yrdrig!!
          YRDRIG, a hellhound the size of a tank, jumps out from an
          alcove. He has multiple heads, all of them ferocious. In
          seconds, he's upon the TROLLS.
          Each of his many mouths tears into green flesh, lifting and
          shaking the helpless monsters like rag dolls.
          The Princess slips through a secret door.

<b>          44 INT. TUNNEL 2 -- SAME 44

          The Prince and his guards rush through the tunnels, as troll
          screams echo off the walls.
          When they finally-

</b>
          -reach the Princess' chamber, it's too late.
          Dead and dying TROLLS lie in a heap on the floor.

          JOHANN KRAUS: about 6' tall, dressed in a canvas containment
          suit full of tubes and taps. His hands are encased in thick

          weak.

</b>          Jeez- your buddy there doesn't look too
          good.

</b>          Wow- You have that effect on me too.
          The Fairy's cheekbones hollow and it finally collapses.
          Ectoplasm escapes its body and regroups at Johan's
          fingertips.

          elements: Its geometry remains somewhat unchanged, but
          instead of a pile of boxes a tree trunk and a large, mossy

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          Gentlemen: welcome to Troll Market.

<b>          66 INT. TROLL MARKET - NIGHT 66
</b>
          Troll Market is a steamy, medieval nightmare. A labyrinth of
          narrow alleys and foetid vapour.
          Trolls scavenge the crumbling, marble shoreline, picking
          through garbage, scattering vermin.
          Muddy water trickles down from above, forming cloudy
          puddles.
          Roaming vendors hawk exotic objects from every culture and
          century.
          At kiosks and shops, Trolls peddle cats (skinned or alive)
          cadres of Lovecraftian entities stroll about: Mer-men,
          Goblins and a few select species unknown to any cosmology.
          A dogfight of sorts is taking place in a small ring. Instead
          of pitbulls, multi-limbed creatures leap at one another
          while violent bettors laugh and shout.
          At the rail, Abe watches in horror, then sees a woman in
          rags making her way through the crowd. He catches a glimpse
          of her slippered feet...
          .which flash with pearls and gold embroidery. His
          curiosity aroused, he follows her.

<b>          67
</b>
<b>          67 MARKET STALL
</b>          The woman inspects a pile of ancient bric-a-brac at a market
          stall; her cowl swings aside, briefly revealing her face.
          It's the PRINCESS. In these grotesque surroundings, her
          beauty is transcendent.

<b>          
</b>

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          HELLBOY 2 41
</b>          Abe is thunderstruck.
          As she turns to leave, they briefly make eye contact. On her
          bandaged arm: a bracelet adorned with the seal's coat of
          arms!

<b>          ABE

          Brother Red!!

<b>          HELLBOY

          As the Princess disappears into the mob, Abe hurries after
          her.

          Hellboy and Johann show a picture of a tooth fairy to a

<b>          SHOP OWNER
</b>          Never seen anything like it. No one sells
          `em down here - over in Jersey, maybe.
          Behind him, there's a faceless CAVE BERSERKER: a tall and
          gnarly ogre, his naked chest crisscrossed with scars, his
          feet encased in iron shoes.
          Growling, it bares its teeth at HE. HB smiles back-

          Abe follows the Princess down an alley - and then another

          them away.

          Now Johann shows a drawing of the royal seal to the shop

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          What about this?? Do you recognize this
          seal?

</b>          The shop owner's face suddenly grows pale.

<b>          SHOP OWNER
</b>          You'd better go. Now.

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          Please. We'll make it worth your while.
          The shop owner claps his hands. BERSERKER takes two steps
          forward, ROARING. Its iron shoes go CLOMP-CLOMP!!

<b>          SHOP OWNER (CONT'D)
</b>          He's not friendly-
          Hellboy huffs and walks up to the creature.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          Well, neither am I-
          BAMMMM!!!!! With a single uppercut, he sends it flying
          toward the ceiling, shoeless. The shop keeper watches in awe
          until it lands, about thirty feet away in the middle of the
          dogfight.
          The crowd scatters as the mongrel creatures attack the thing
          with blind instinct.
          Hellboy grabs the shop owner by the lapels and pulls him
          close. The shop owner's head rockets back and forth like a
          boxer's speed bag as HB "gently" slaps him around. Teeth fly
          everywhere.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          Feeling more chatty now??

<b>          SHOP OWNER
</b>          It's rumors! ... just- No- don't hit me,
          all right? There's talk of a revolt- a
          revolt against the human world-
          Hellboy releases him, then looks around.

<b>          HELLBOY

          He pushes his belt locator-

          The Princess has entered a shop selling MAPS and PRINTS. Abe
          stays outside, watching through a window as she negotiates
          to purchase a silver and crystal CYLINDER contained in a
          safety holding case.
          The SALESMAN denies it at first but after the Princess hands
          him a gold bracelet he finally acquiesces while vowing to
          her. He extracts the cylinder from its holding case and
          hands it to her.
          A red locator light flashes on Abe's utility belt.

<b>          HELLBOY

<b>          HELLBOY

          Another TROLL comes up behind Abe.

<b>          ABE (CONT'D)
</b>          I don't think you-
          The TROLL opens a small wooden box and extracts a nasty
          looking Insect: A NARCOTIC BUG.

<b>          ABE (CONT'D)
</b>          Oh, my-
          The second TROLL loads the buzzing bug - like a bullet -
          into a blowpipe. Abe turns just as he blows. The bug lands
          on Abe's chest and sinks its stinger deep into his flesh. He
          groans.

          cobblestones.

          The locator's blue light dims; concerned, Hellboy and Johann
          look at each other.
          Seeing his chance, the shop keeper melts away into the
          crowd.

<b>          73 INT. MAP SHOP - LATER 73

          Abe opens his eyes and slowly gets up. He looks around: he's
          surrounded by racks of ancient scrolls and musty books. The
          door is locked. Instinctively he looks for his belt-
          It's not there.

<b>          PRINCESS
</b>          If you are looking for your weapons, my
          guards took them.
          Abe turns to face the Princess, who stands only a few feet
          away. She has cast off her dingy cloak and is radiant in
          fine silk robes.
          She is feeding slices of fruit to a cage of large,
          featherless REPTILE/BIRDS.

<b>          ABE

<b>          PRINCESS

          Abe is ashamed to realize the real answer. He's utterly
          beguiled by her.

          He takes a step forward but the YRDRIG comes out of nowhere,
          barking and growling.

<b>          PRINCESS
</b>          Then answer me truthfully- Why were you

          Abe complies, thrilled as she runs her fingers over his
          palm.
          The Princess' face brightens. She smiles and gestures for
          the YRDRIG to yield.

<b>          PRINCESS
</b>          Down Yrdrig - he's a friend.
          The YRDRIG jumps on Abe and starts licking him with all
          three tongues.

<b>          PRINCESS (CONT'D)
</b>          Yrdrig's really just a puppy.
          The drooling beast pins Abe to the floor with one paw.

          But as man in his greed expanded his
          dominion, there ensued a bitter war...

<b>          DISSOLVE:
</b>
<b>          75 EXT. MYTHICAL BATTLEFIELD - DUSK 75
</b>
          Silhouetted against a crimson sky, the shadows of thousands
          upon thousands of goblins, elves and fairies do battle with
          hordes of men.

<b>          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          In those days, my people were led by my
          Father, King BALOR, the one-armed king of
          Elfland.
          KING BALOR fights valiantly at the side of his son, the
          tall, pale elf knight: PRINCE NUADA.

<b>          PRINCESS (V. 0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          The bloodshed went on year after year.
          Many lives were lost.
          An overview of the battlefield fades as the sun sinks below
          the horizon.

<b>          76 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 76

          Seated in an 'opulent throne room, KING BALOR addresses a
          wretched guild of deformed goblins.

<b>          PRINCESS (V.0.)
</b>          It was then that the King ordered the
          Sigri to build him a new, invincible
          army.

<b>          77 INT. BLACKSMITH FURNACES - DUSK 77
</b>
          Lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of
          goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving
          parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted
          onto tall, ornate, golden figures.

<b>          PRINCESS (V.0.)
</b>          This was an army that would not eat,
          drink or grow tired. A heartless,
          ruthless force made of the purest metal,
          mined from the depths of the earth.

<b>          78 INT. COURTYARD, CASTLE - DUSK 78
</b>
          In perfect ranks, in eerie unison, the golden soldiers line
          up, filling the entire courtyard, awaiting the King's
          command.

<b>          PRINCESS (V.0.)
</b>          The Sigri worked until the winter moon
          was high in the sky -
          The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved segments
          of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN
          directly over the King's head.

<b>          KING
</b>          I am King Balor, leader of the Golden
          Army. Is there anyone here who disputes
          my right???
          Silence. Prince NUADA kneels next to his father. The Goblin
          crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In response-
          TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing him.

<b>          79 EXT. HUMAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTFALL 79
</b>
          As the humans make ready for battle, a tremor shakes the
          earth. They turn their gaze to the horizon, which bristles
          with the arms of the approaching troops.

</b>
          The fight is brutal. The mechanical soldiers mow down the
          humans by the hundreds, their swords replaced as needed by
          battle axes, bludgeons and lances.

<b>          PRINCESS (V.0.)
</b>          But this army knew no bounds, had no
          remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in
          blind battle with man, woman or child.
          The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through
          armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise.
          The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine
          devouring tender flesh.
          At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp.

<b>          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And as the king gazed upon the earth
          awash in blood and at the impassive metal
          faces of the army he had created, his
          heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at
          too high a price. This war should never
          have been waged.
          The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand
          in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions.

<b>          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          And so he arranged a truce: the surviving
          men would keep to their cities and we
          children of the Earth would dwell within
          the forests. This pact, he declared,
          would be honored by our sons and the sons
          of their sons until the end of time.
          Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish.

<b>          PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
</b>          But my brother did not believe in the
          promises of men. He marched off into
          exile, vowing to return if the Sons of
          the Earth ever needed him.
          Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying sunset.

</b>          The location of the Golden Army is
          contained within this cylinder--
          She opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside. She
          extends it: the map just shows three coordinates.

          The Princess leads the group through the surging, noisy
          crowd of bizarre creatures. Hellboy, Johann and Abe bring up
          the rear.

<b>          PRINCESS
</b>          No- not that way. Too risky-
          They're lost in unfamiliar alleys and byways. Until-

          The Prince appears at the top of the stairs, dressed in
          black. He's surrounded by his elite guard. Stepping to the
          rail, he points at his sister and addresses the crowd:

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          Hear me, o creatures of the forest! Can
          you recognize a traitor? She's here to
          betray her own!
          He casts a disdainful look at Hellboy.

</b>          I'm here to recruit all of you against
          the humans. Make your decision now. Those
          who join me will be rewarded. The rest...
          will be killed.
          A sudden silence falls over the throng. Then, the sound of
          CRACKING KNUCKLES. Everyone looks at Hellboy, who is
          unclenching his fists and stretching his neck.
          He starts up the stairs, but a couple of the GUARDS leap
          down to block his path.

          A crowded BOWLING ALLEY is full of serious-looking players
          in colorful shirts and shoes.
          Someone rolls a ball down the center lane, and as it speeds
          right at the pins...

          CRASH! Hellboy erupts from under the floorboards, fighting
          the clawing monsters right behind him!
          As the bowlers freeze in shock, dozens of creatures pour out
          into the human world. Grunting, Hellboy punches his way
          free, only to be dragged back by the tail by WINK.
          Abe, shielding the Princess, demonstrates the way of the
          water, a fluid martial arts display. He ducks and parries
          the blows, leaping like Nureyev.
          Abe scoops up a couple of bowling balls and rolls them at
          the Prince's guards. He manages to knock a couple off their
          feet.
          As they get back up, he uses the available bowling pins as

          up through the Bridge overpass!!
          Picking up speed, the tree branches soar up, up, up... into

          of the tree and stares at Hellboy.

          and pulverizes a GASOLINE TRUCK!
          WHUMP- ! Flames leap up! The Elemental grins with delight,
          turning his baleful gaze on the Princess. As she shrinks
          back, her pet Yrdrig rushes at the thing, snarling. In a
          single leap, it sinks its teeth into the Elemental's heel.

          ground where they had been standing!
          Every time the ELEMENTAL moves, he trails behind roots and
          branches. The roots connecting to its feet and leading to

</b>          Hellboy climbs a fire escape as the Elemental's arm/branches
          extend and grow over the ladder, pulling it down below his
          feet. Hellboy ducks into one of the open windows as the
          Elemental tears away the rest of the scaffolding. Growing
          and discarding branches and roots.

</b>
          Hellboy runs like a cockroach through a dilapidated KITCHEN.
          Behind him, the Elemental's massive BRANCH/FIST crashes
          through the wall, then pursues him as he runs down a
          corridor littered with debris.
          Like a wrecking ball, the Elemental demolishes each section
          of the corridor as Hellboy runs.

<b>          90 EXT. LEDGE - CONTINUOUS 90

          Hellboy steps out onto a ledge ten stories up, just out of
          reach of the Elemental.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          (to the Elemental)
          What now, Big Boy? You get a ladder?
          The Elemental jumps up and down, trying to reach him,
          barking in frustration.
          Hellboy's RADIO crackles:

</b>          So, lead him to the bridge.
          Hellboy looks over the buildings and sees the Brooklyn
          Bridge in the distance.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          That's nine blocks from here, Fishbowl!

<b>          ABE
</b>          You'll figure it out.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          What's at the bridge? Abe - ? Liz?
          Hello???
          No answer. Muttering, Hellboy climbs higher, up a buzzing
          neon sign reading "Hotel".
          The Elemental smashes the letters "tel"... so Hellboy climbs
          the "0" to the roof.

          Liz drives the garbage truck toward the Brooklyn Bridge.
          Johann is sitting next to her.

<b>          92 EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS 92

          Hellboy makes a running start and leaps off the building. He
          sails over the alley, reaches for the approaching cornice...
          and almost loses his grip! He hangs on for dear life.
          Behind him, the Elemental appears, climbing onto an adjacent
          roof. As his feet smash through the skylights, the Elemental
          pulls down a WATER TOWER. A wall of water rolls toward
          Hellboy, like an ocean wave!
          Hellboy leaps to the next roof... and the water shoots over
          the edge of the building, cascading onto the street below.

<b>          93 EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME 93

          Liz parks the truck near the Brooklyn Bridge. Using
          binoculars, Abe peers out the back doors to see Hellboy
          bringing the Elemental closer.

          Johann moves among massive construction machinery. He stops
          at a stack of heavy SPOOLS OF CABLE.
          Abe comes running, pointing at the cable.

<b>          ABE
</b>          Yes. I had the very same idea...
          He gets behind the levers and handles of a complex machine
          which holds a half mile of steel cable.

<b>          ABE
</b>          (gazing at the controls)
          .but how do you operate this??

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          If you'll permit me...
          Johann opens his fingers, and plunges both arms deep into
          the mechanism! Instantly, the diesel engine STARTS UP.

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          (to Abe)
          Stand back, Abe.
          A hydraulic strut lifts the spool, then pitches it through
          the air, spinning off 300 yards of cable. It splashes down
          near the far shore of the East River.

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          Now, tie it onto the pontoons on the
          other side.

          Quickly, Abe!

<b>          94 IN THE WATER 94
</b>          Abe races down a pier and dives smartly into the dark water.
          Then he surfaces, surging dolphin-like toward the Manhattan
          shore.

<b>          95 BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DOCKS 95

          barges.

          towing it to a half-submerged pontoon.

<b>          JOHANN (CONT'D)
</b>          (on the radio)
          Macht schnell! Abe - make it fast!
          The cable is a yard short of the anchor point! Abe tugs on

</b>
<b>          ABE
</b>          I need more!

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          No more available!
          The Elemental's feet stomp through the river; he stumbles as
          he encounters the submerged cable.

<b>          97
</b>
<b>          97 UNDERWATER
</b>          Clinging to the cable, Abe is dragged down, down down...
          past rusting cars, oil drums... and a couple of rotting
          CORPSES, their feet in tubs of cement!
          Suddenly, Abe's head strikes a sunken truck, knocking him
          unconscious. Blood seeps from his wound.

<b>          98

<b>          98 AT THE BRIDGE
</b>          As Hellboy climbs one of the bridge towers, he hears someone
          calling out from above:

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          (to Hellboy)
          Haven't you managed to kill it yet? You,
          who were so eager for a fight?
          The Prince is standing on top of the tower. He points at
          Hellboy, then yells at the Elemental.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          (to the Elemental)
          Over here, dear friend...
          SNATCH! The Elemental plucks Hellboy off a parapet! Hellboy

<b>          HELLBOY 2 62
</b>          The Prince walks to the edge of the tower, near a steel
          spire, his coat flapping in the night wind.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          This might be a good chance for you to
          come to your senses. Help us.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          I've been all through this! The answer's
          still no!
          Far below, Johann slips his right arm into the cable,
          bringing it to life, whipping it back and forth, like a
          steel snake!
          The cable forms a huge loop, splashing down near the
          Elemental and tightening around his ankles. The cable

<b>          TENSES-
</b>
<b>          JOHANN
</b>          (to Liz)
          Burn the roots!!! Burn them!!i
          He points at the roots trailing into the river. Liz
          concentrates and a bolt of fierce white-hot energy pours out
          of her hands, burning the roots at the Elemental's feet.
          Johann gyrates; the cable responds, whipping up out of the
          river! With a bellow, the Elemental loses his balance; he
          tosses Hellboy high into the air.
          On the way down, Hellboy grabs a support stay and swings
          back and forth like a red monkey. He lands atop of the
          Elemental's back, right behind his head.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          Nap time, Big guy-
          He raises his stone fist and hits him straight in the back
          of the neck.
          The cable tenses-
          -The Elemental pitches forward-
          The Prince looks up to see the Elemental falling right at
          him; his mouth opens as if to scream...
          The Elemental goes down, impaling himself on a spire atop
          the bridge... exactly where the Prince had been standing.
          Putting an end, it seems, to both of them.

          of the city are now covered in trees and grass and mossy
          leaves... A strangely beatific and precious change.
          Liz runs up, looking out at the river as Abe emerges,
          bleeding, but alive. Abe, Liz and Johann embrace firmly,
          laughing and happy to be together.
          Abe eyes the Princess standing nearby, smiling back at
          him...
          Hellboy meanwhile observes the group from a distance,
          jealous, alone.

          BLAM! BLAM! Deafening shots as Hellboy blasts the Samaritan
          again and again at a target in the dark firing range. Hits a
          button, brings the paper close for inspection.
          Result: a very ragged, loose pattern around the bull's eye.
          Suddenly, from the next alley, RAPID GUNFIRE. Johann leans
          over, and to address Hellboy through a cloud of gunsmoke.

</b>          So- this "Hellboy" what is he?? Is he
          really on our side?? I mean, he's red,
          has a tail and shaves his horns- horns,

</b>          Once there- they reform into humanoid shapes, vaguely
          reminiscent of their mortal bodies.
          JOHANN floats freely, approaching another humanoid form in
          the void: That of a woman, his wife.

<b>          JOHANN'S VOICE
</b>          But it was there, while he was partially
          on the ethereal plane, that disaster

</b>          He is about to embrace his wife's form when a horrible

          were and seated around the seance table, charred corpses
          hold hands in eternal contact. As the Agents move around a

          It's Johann.

          bone... The shape of Ectoplasm stands there, alone and lost-
          Then, Professor TREVOR BROOM wanders into the scene and

          He grows silent for a brief moment.

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          But I've never been able to see her
          again. My reach became limited- My loss,

          Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music

          each crisis in the globe. They keep turning on a dozen a
          second.

          Abe enters the dark, soaking library and surveys the ruins
          of his tank.
          He goes directly to one of the book stands, which lies in
          pieces on the floor. He comes up with his copy of "Jane
          Eyre."
          He opens it to Chapter 23 and finds the gold piece.

<b>          LIZ
</b>          Any luck?
          Liz has come in behind him. Abe quickly palms the precious
          thing in his webbed hand.

<b>          ABE
</b>          No. Sorry.

<b>          LIZ
</b>          It doesn't matter.

</b>          Abe, let's do this for Red!
          Abe nods, unable to find a good answer. He manages to tuck

          Abe stands at a lectern. Behind him, a projected image of

</b>          The map contained within the cylinder
          seems useless-

</b>          Now the case itself proves very useful-
          He moistens the holding cylinder case on a rubber stamp mat
          and imprints the surface pattern on the paper map. Glyphs
          and coordinates become visible.
          A silhouette of a twisted, gnarly tree is visible too.

</b>          Renvyle it is- Both the Princess and her

</b>          Even if you're right, we sit tight and

          light and ocean waves to enter.
          Rounding a few corners, the Prince stops near a wall
          decorated with a large, elaborate FRESCO. It shows a
          stylized family tree, hunting scenes and naive renderings of
          trolls, faeries and ogres.

          He's found a roundish SLOT in the tree, where the lowest

          A GOBLIN speaks up from an outcropping of rocks in the

          atop of a tree: A SATYR and a CROW observe the group.

          warming its skeletal hands by the fire.
          A raspy voice utters something in an ancient language. The
          Goblin replies, gesturing at Hellboy, who collapses on the
          floor.
          In a deep coma, Hellboy lies on the floor, near the
          crackling fireplace. The ANGEL OF DEATH extends its FOUR
          BLACK WINGS and a thin, jagged smile appears in its pale,

          It studies the speartip, which has buried itself deep in
          Hellboy's flesh.

<b>          ANGEL OF DEATH (CONT'D)

          The creature cackles and then grips the spear tip with the
          tongs. A cry of pain from Hellboy as it withdraws the bloody
          point from his chest.

          She tosses the speartip to the creature, who scoops it up
          and bounds out the door.
          instantly, the goblins and birds leap down and crowd around
          him, chattering in excitement over the latest prize.
          She gazes down at Hellboy, whose yellow eyes are fixed on
          her. He smiles wanly.

          Alone on a hilltop, Abe surveys the coastline. Through the
          binoculars, he discerns a SECOND CAVE half-hidden behind
          wild, breaking waves.
          Glancing back at ANGEL OF DEATH's cave, Johann strikes off
          on his own, headed for the cave.

          Outside ANGEL OF DEATH's hut, a bandaged HB is sitting up,
          blinking in the sunlight. He sips some tea and gazes at Liz,
          who is happy now.

          Johann, Liz and Hellboy follow a rugged trail along a bluff
          high over the sea. Johann refers to the map, then points to
          the cave opening a half-mile ahead. Abe is standing there,

<b>          WAVING-
</b>
<b>          JOHANN
</b>          There.
          Abe points at the violent sea below-

<b>          ABE
</b>          The only way in- I'm afraid we'll have to
          jump in-
          (looks at Hellboy)
          Can you make it-?
          Hellboy nods.

<b>          BELLBOY
</b>          Strange. If this is the entrance-

<b>          ABE
</b>          I know- Why isn't there more security??
          With a ROAR, WINK!!!!! - jumps out and throws a CHAIN around
          Bellboy's neck!
          The chain is connected to his IRON MACE which now dangles
          around Hellboy's neck.
          The two creatures battle each other fiercely. WINK's MACE
          destroys a nearby tree, like a wrecking ball and it connects
          twice with Hellboy's head.
          But Red gets the upper hand quickly, snapping the chain in
          two and twirling the mace like a boleador.

</b>          He hits Wink again and again-

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          See?? It hurts!!! It hurts!!!
          Hellboy grips the chain, pulls the creature close, then,
          like a weightlifter, raises him high overhead. With a mighty
          GRUNT, Hellboy tosses him overboard. WINK hits the jagged
          rocks once- twice- thrice-

          We better go swimming before any more

          He stares down into the swirling waters and discreetly takes
          his hand to his bandaged side: He's bleeding. The wound has
          re-opened.

<b>          ABE
</b>          Red, are you-?

</b>          Johann plunges in from above, his body quickly tumbled by
          the rough seas. A moment later, Liz and Hellboy are in the
          water, too.
          Johann swims down, leading them into the darkness of the
          cave entrance.

          As they bob up for air, they find there's only a few inches
          of breathing room between the sea and the rocky ceiling. Liz
          starts coughing.

</b>          Johann dives down to find a rusting, iron LOCK six feet
          under the surface. He tries to turn the control wheel, but
          can't make it budge.

</b>          Seconds later, Hellboy is at his side, gripping the wheel in
          his huge hands. Using all his strength, Hellboy finally
          manages to turn it.
          His bandage, however, floats free... and his wound opens up,
          emitting a plume of blood.
          Lungs bursting, he shoots to the surface. Johann stays
          behind and swings open the lock, revealing...

          He dabs at his chest with a rag.

          Hold up. We need to rest.

          He lurches forward, pushing past the others, fighting off
          his pain.

          This was a mistake. He's -

          pausing to gaze up at the blank face of one of the
          infantrymen.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          Hey, amigo. You got some gum?
          Two rows away, Johann examines the lethal weaponry that
          terminates the arms of each soldier.

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          Most ingenious. A versatile, highly
          mobile killing machine.

<b>          LIZ
</b>          Make that machines, Johann. I see more
          than one.
          Hellboy taps on a soldier's mechanical chest, which booms
          faintly, sending ECHOES up into the dark cavern.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          Wow. You hear that? Listen -
          He thumps it, harder. The mechanical thing rocks
          backwards...

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          Uh oh.
          CRASH!!! The thing falls onto the soldier behind it! Then,

</b>          the ear-shattering noise of a hundred car wrecks builds as
          - a toppling LINE OF SOLDIERS races away like falling
          dominoes!!

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          Whoops.
          The sound dwindles, then builds again as ANOTHER LINE of
          falling soldiers bears down on them!!
           Liz screams and Hellboy pulls her aside. The soldiers crash
          past them until -
          - the din suddenly stops. The PRINCE stands revealed at the
          head of the column.

          He strolls past the mechanical figures, pausing to kick
          aside some of the weapons.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          (to Hellboy)
          You're bleeding. Most unfortunate.
          Hellboy wipes at his oozing chest wound.

</b>          Yeah. Now it's your turn.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          Do you envy these contraptions? They
          never bleed. They feel nothing. Not even
          the zest of combat.
          The Prince circles them, keeping an eye on Johann.

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          These fighting men are the very model of
          patience... merely awaiting word from
          their lawful commander.

          he fits them together...

          them.

</b>          Stop - I have it.
          Abe, dripping wet, stands there, the last gold segment in
          the palm of his hand.

          Keeping his eyes on the Princess, Abe gives the gold piece
          to the Prince.
          Hellboy steps forward, feeling dizzy and betrayed.

<b>          HELLBOY

          With the deep sound of gears, ratchets and springs, the army
          comes to life. Up comes the lances and shields.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          Abe old buddy. If we survive this, we
          need to talk.
          The Army swings into action, marching toward them. The four
          friends retreat, soon pressed against one of the walls.

<b>          ABE
</b>          He - he's a cad! Can you imagine, a

</b>          Not now, Abe, okay?
          The first phalanx of golden soldiers is upon them, their
          terrifying weapons slashing in unison. Hellboy brings out
          his huge gun and starts firing as Johann grabs a torch and
          swings it like a club.
          A couple of the mechanical soldiers go down, only to pop
          back onto their feet, new weapons blossoming on their arms.

<b>          LIZ
</b>          Let me -
          Liz summons up a white-hot burst of electrical fire in each
          hand. With a yell, she unleashes a searing EXPLOSION at the
          oncoming fighters.
          The shock wave rolls through the enemy ranks, flattening
          scores of soldiers. For a moment, the BPRD team regains
          hope... but the endless lines of mechanicals keep coming,
          marching on and over their scorched comrades.
          Hellboy holsters the Samaritan and rushes forward, giving it
          his best. His wound is running with fresh blood.
          He punches a soldier, whose mace pounds repeatedly against
          his ravaged chest; as blood spatters his face, Hellboy
          groans and keeps fighting, to absolutely no effect.
          At length, the mechanical arms throw Hellboy against the
          wall, where he collapses, unable to carry on.

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          Invincibility!? So - the only one thing
          may stop them -
          Johann unzips his suit; with a HISSS, his ectoplasmic self
          flows out, into the body of the nearest mechanical soldier!

</b>          Instantly, the thing whirls on its companions and starts
          chopping! Bits and pieces of gold machinery fly about as
          Johann rips into the enemy!!
          But again, fresh metal soldiers fill in for the fallen. As
          the BPRD team watches in dismay, Johann's mechanical shell
          is surrounded by the other SOLDIERS, who methodically
          dismember it like marauding insects!
          As the parts drop to the floor, twitching and useless,
          Johann slithers out and re-inhabits his suit.

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          Ach. They are too many. Anyone have
          another idea?
          Hellboy grabs the nearest sword and hauls himself to his
          feet.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          (a bellow)
          Prince Nuada: I challenge your right to

          With a soft BOOM, the clockwork troops come to a halt! All
          the mechanical heads turn toward the Prince, who stands on a
          ledge with his sister.

<b>          ABE

          No= please- no-
          Hellboy moves away from him.

          Her eyes lock with Abe's: there's no other way.
          The Prince sees Hellboy coming and with a bitter smile picks
          up his sword.

          As the hall rings with their first blows of their swords-

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          Hellboy's too weak-
          Summoning up his last ounce of strength, Hellboy manages to
          drive the Prince back into the center of the arena, where
          they fight under the inscrutable gaze of the golden army.
          Every time Hellboy gets a clean shot at the Prince, Abe
          looks at him, pleading, and HB has no choice but to keep
          parrying off his enemy.
          Hellboy's sword grows heavy in his hands; he stares at it in
          dismay as it trembles. His muscles can no longer respond.
          The Prince is ready to kill him.

          forward and...
          Using her concealed DAGGER, she STABS HERSELF in the right
          arm!! In silent slow motion, she drops the dagger.
          Instantly, the Prince drops his arm... his hands come away
          red with blood. He looks over at his sister.
          They share a hard look of mutual understanding. Love and
          hatred.
          Hellboy raises, through supreme effort, bleeding. He quickly
          raises his sword. The fight resumes, but this time, HB has
          the advantage.
          He fights bravely and after parrying fiercely with the
          Prince, he disarms him and points his sword at his chest.

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          I- have- won-

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          No. You have not-

</b>
<b>          HELLBOY 2 110
</b>          He impales himself on HELLBOY's sword. The blade goes
          through his abdomen and protrudes on the other side. Hellboy
          pulls it out, but it's too late. Both the Prince and the
          Princess collapse to the ground, mortally wounded.

<b>          ABE
</b>
<b>          (GASPS)
</b>
<b>          NO-
</b>          Abe hurries to the Princess. Takes her into his arms,
          blinking in despair.
          The pale young creature is now a ghostly white. She lifts
          her eyes to Abe's, caressing his thin, scaly face.

<b>          PRINCESS
</b>          We'll find each other again, somewhere.
          And she dies in his arms.
          In the center of the arena:

<b>          PRINCE
</b>          (to Hellboy)
          You... think you're any different from
          me? The humans - they will tire of you.
          They will disappoint you. And in the end,
          they will betray you. You... are living a
          lie. Your time will come again. May you
          make a better choice.
          Then, he, too, is dead. Both him and his sister turn to
          fine, pale dust. And the wind carries away the ashes from
          Abe's hands...
          Shaken, Hellboy lifts the crown from the Prince's head.
          Looks at it carefully, as if considering the possibilities.
          Suddenly, he rips it into pieces. As he crushes the first
          segement...
          . an entire division of the golden army collapses into a
          heap of scrap metal!
          Hellboy does the same with a second section of the crown and
          another massive division of the army tumbles into junk!
          HB is about the tear up the last segment of the crown, when
          it explodes in his hands!
          WHUMP! The last of the army disintegrates.
          Hellboy confronts the Prince's frightened troll guards:

          You - and your kind! Leave here. And stay
          in the shadows - where you belong.
          As the ogres slink back into the tunnels, Liz looks at
          Hellboy. He seems angry, stung by the Prince's last words.

          The BPRD team crosses waterfalls and stone bridges, through
          the magical hills.
          Liz walks at Hellboy's side, but he avoids her glance.

          They reach the strange, twisted tree. Johann takes the map
          cylinder and fits it into the slot.

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          Any last minute requests?

<b>          ABE
</b>          (very quiet)
          Do it, please. I - I'm ready for the real
          world now.
          Johann turns the cylinder. The tree roots form their arch...
          and the BPRD team walks through.

          On the other side of the tree: Manning and a bunch of agents
          have set up spotter scopes and are gazing out over the
          countryside, looking for them.
          Suddenly, the team appears, literally from out of nowhere.

<b>          MANNING
</b>
<b>          (STARTLED)
</b>          Whoa! Where'd you come from? We were just-

<b>          BELLBOY
</b>          I know, here to help. Well, I appreciate
          that Manning.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          HELLBOY 2 112
</b>          Abe steps past Hellboy and removes his gunbelt and equipment
          pack.

<b>          ABE
</b>          Yes, Mr. Manning. I want to thank you,
          too. For all you've done for us over the
          years.
          He gives his stuff to the astonished agent.

<b>          MANNING
</b>          What? What, exactly is this?

<b>          ABE
</b>          (walking away)
          I quit.
          Hellboy glances at Abe, then hauls out the Samaritan and
          shrugs off his pack, too.

<b>          MANNING
</b>          Come on. You're resigning?

<b>          HELLBOY
</b>          Looks that way, doesn't it?
          Hellboy starts to leave, but spins around and takes his gun
          back.

<b>          HELLBOY (CONT'D)
</b>          I think I'll keep this.
          He finally meets Liz's gaze. She crosses to him and takes
          him by the arm. She walks off with Hellboy and Abe, clinging
          tightly to the big, red daemon.

<b>          MANNING
</b>          Liz -- not you, too!?
          (to Johann)
          They can't do this. Stop them, Johann-

<b>          JOHANN
</b>          Manning, you're an asshole.

<b>          166 EXT. COASTLINE - DAY 166

          Miles down the road, Abe stands on a promontory, staring off
          at the ocean, which blazes with golden reflections.
          Liz and HB sit next to each other on some mossy rocks.
          Overhead: blue sky, puffy white clouds.
