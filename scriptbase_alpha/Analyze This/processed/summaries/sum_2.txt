Who ever heard of a tough Mafia boss having an emotional breakdown... and crying, to boot!
Well, that's the premise of this zany comedy about just such a happening, and the consequences for the poor analyst who is picked to work with him are devastating.
Especially since this psychiatrist is about to be married... a fact that doesn't seem to enter into the Mafia guy's consideration, for whenever he feels a need to talk, that's when the analyst must be yanked away... one time right from the altar, literally.
But there's more, for during this time the Mafia is doing a lot of jockeying to come up with a new Don and this makes the need to 'cure' the emotionally distressed boss all the more urgent and definitely secretive.
