The basic premise of this film is what if one of gangland's Dons suddenly started having anxiety attacks because of past problems.
When he decides to see a shrink, what can he tell him without giving away the gang's secrets and reveal too much about his own situations?
Add to the fact that this type of individual is used to everyone catering to his whims and he expects the psychiatrist to do the same, neglecting his regular practice and his attempts to get married.
