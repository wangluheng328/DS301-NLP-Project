   <title>Serial Mom, by John Waters</title>



   <pre>








<b>                             SERIAL MOM
</b>
                                 by

                            John Waters






                                   Second Draft:  July 22, 1992









1.     Film opens with prologue title: "This is a true
       story.  The screenplay is based on court testimony,
       sworn declarations, and hundreds of interviews
       conducted by the film-makers".  Fade out.

       Fade in to second prologue title: "Some of the
       innocent characters' names have been changed in the
       interests of a larger truth".  Fade out.

       Fade in to final prologue title:  "No one involved
       in the crimes received any form of financial
       compensation".  Fade out.

2.     Establishing shot of upper-middle class suburban home.
       We hear on the soundtrack the daily morning chatter
       of a family rushing to get to work and school.

       Subtitle appears:  "2815 Calverton Court.  The
       Sutphin Family".  Fade out.

       Second subtitle fades in:  "Friday, September 18th,
       1992.  7:08am".  Fade out.

3.     Interior cheery, bright SUTPHIN kitchen.  CREDITS
<b>       BEGIN.
</b>
       MOM, BEVERLY, a trim, fortyish, pretty Betty Crocker
       of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and
       butters it. She waves cheerfully out the kitchen
       window to the passing GARBAGEMEN on the back of a
       Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her
       husband and children and expertly begins to serve
       breakfast.

       DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by
       trade, divides the morning paper up between himself
       and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in
       high-school.  Daughter, MISTY, a pretty and slightly
       overweight college student, frantically prices the
       junk she plans on selling at the flea market after
       classes while gulping down a light breakfast.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  Who wants fruit salad?

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                  I do, please.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                       (Hesitating)
                  That's not gum in your mouth,
                  is it?

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                       (Removing it)
                  It's sugarless.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                       (Gently)
                  You know how I hate gum,
                  Misty.  All that chomping
                  and cheesing...
                       (Begins serving her)

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                  Sorry, Mom.  Thanks.
                   (To her brother, as she
                    prices a record album)
                  Hey, Chip, think I could get
                  50c for Vanilla Ice.

<b>                            CHIP
</b>                  I wouldn't give ya a nickle.

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                          (Dreamily)
                  Carl can't believe how much I
                  make at swap meets.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  (Rolling her eyes good-naturedly)
                  And <u>who</u> may I ask is Carl?

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                  Just a boy.  He's picking me up
                  this morning.

<b>                            CHIP
</b>                  Here we go again.

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                  He's <u>really</u> cute!

<b>                            MOM
</b>                    (Watching the cute little
                     birds nibbling seed from
                     the bird-feeder in kitchen
                     window)
                  Cute is not enough, Misty.
                  You know that.

<b>                            CHIP
</b>                  She sure can pick 'em!

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                       (Exasperated)
                  He goes to <u>college</u> with me!

<b>                            DAD
</b>                  Leave her alone, Chip.
                       (To MOM)
                  I think it's great she has a
                  new beau, Beverly.

       MOM smiles kindly, picks up a box of cereal in each
       hand and turns to the family.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  Cereal anybody?

       Title "SERIAL MOM" appears on the screen.

<b>                            DAD
</b>                  Just a little, please.  Bad
                  for the teeth.

<b>                            CHIP
</b>                  Always the dentist.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  Chip, honey?

<b>                            CHIP
</b>                  Thanks, Mom.

       As MOM serves the cereal, she spots a lone fly as it
       lands on the butter dish.  Without letting on to her
       family, she grabs a flyswatter and begins stalking
       the fly with a terrifying intensity, its buzzing
       enough to make MOM's head explode.

<b>                            DAD
</b>                       (Reading paper)
                  Look at this!
                  (Reading out loud in disgust)
                  "Hillside Strangler gets his
                  college degree in prison!"

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  (Preoccupied, stalking fly)
                  That's nice.

<b>                            DAD
</b>                  Nice?!  He should have been
                  executed!

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                  He <u>killed</u> people, Mom.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                       (To herself)
                  We all have bad nights.
                  (Gets ready to swat, but fly
                   buzzes off)

<b>                            CHIP
</b>                       (To MISTY)
                  <u>You'd</u> probably date him!
                       (Mimicking her)
                  He's cu-uuute!  Hey, Dad, did
                  you ever see "Henry, Portrait of
                  a Serial Killer?"

<b>                            DAD
</b>                  I certainly did not.

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                  You've been working in that
                  video shop too long.

<b>                            DAD
</b>                  And all that gore better hadn't be
                  interfering with your schoolwork.

       MOM stalks fly as it lands on CHIP's toast as the
       rest of the family remains oblivious to MOM's
       building anger.

<b>                            CHIP
</b>                  I do great in school, Dad.
                  (Eats toast as fly buzzes off)

       A sickened and rage-filled MOM stalks the fly to
       DAD's orange juice glass where it secretes on the
       rim in closeup.

<b>                            DAD
</b>                  Well, your mother's going to PTA
                  today.  We'll see what your
                  teacher has to say.
                  (Takes a big gulp as fly buzzes away)

<b>                            CHIP
</b>                  (Giving a pleading look to MOM as
                   the buzzing of the fly builds in
                   intensity on the soundtrack)
                  Aw, Mom!  I hate Mr. Stubbins!

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  (Moving in for the kill, hissing
                   the words in a rage)
                  Don't say the word "hate", honey.
                  "Hate" is a very serious word!

       MOM swats violently and we see fly splat in bloody
       closeup. ("Directed by John Waters" credit appears).

       Family is suddenly silent as they uneasily look up
       in surprise at MOM's ferocious attack.

       MOM quickly wipes up squashed fly and smiles back at

       front lawn.  Subtitle appears: "2:15pm" and then

       Cut to MOM, driving happily by in her station wagon
       as she waves to DOTTIE.

       DOTTIE sees MOM, tries to look cheerful and waves
       back.

       Cut back to MOM who looks in her rear view mirror,
       sees she's not being followed and suddenly screeches
       car into a U-turn as MOM's "Psycho Theme" plays on
       soundtrack

       MOM's face turns to stone as ripple flashback
       effects dissolve to that fateful day in the mall
       when MOM pulled up to parallel park and DOTTIE
       HINKLE stole her place from behind.

       Ripple effects dissolve to the present as the wheels
       of MOM'S car skid to a stop.  The car door opens and
       MOM's sensible shoes step out as "Mom Psycho Theme"
       builds.

       MOM closes car door quietly, watches DOTTIE HINKLE
       up the street undetected and then takes the scissors
       from her purse and hides them up her sleeve.

       As MOM sneaks up street towards DOTTIE, intercut are
       obsessional flashbacks of details of the traumatic
       parking place incident;  MOM'S POV of DOTTIE pulling
       into space, DOTTIE'S maddening nonchalance as she
       snottily gets out of her car and trots right past
       MOM without the slightest apology, MOM'S sputtering
       face paralyzed with anger when she realizes there is
       nowhere else to park.

       Back in the present, MOM starts walking faster and
       faster as she sees DOTTIE begin to pack up her
       gardening tools to go back inside her house.
<b>         
</b>       Arriving just a second too late as DOTTIE closes the
       door behind her, MOM spots a can of gasoline near
       DOTTIE's lawnmower.  Thinking fast, MOM dumps gas on
       DOTTIE's mail in the mailbox on porch, lights it on
       fire and runs from the flames, happily throwing a
       coin into DOTTIE's wishing well as an afterthought.
<b>         
</b>       MOM walks as fast as possible back to her car, gets
       in and pulls off.  Smiling evily to herself, she
       drives by and sees DOTTIE HINKLE screaming in horror
       and trying to beat the fire out with a broom.

       under her coat as she stalks CARL and SEXPOT DATE to
       baseball memorabilia booth.  MOM pretends to shop
       nearby as CARL buys Oriole penant for himself.

       MOM follows them to concession stand where CARL
       excuses himself for a quick trip to the men's room.
       SEXPOT DATE adjusts her cleavage as she waits, much
       to the embarrassment of YOUNG BOY walking by.

       to next booth and enters.

       A male PERVERT in locked booth is drawing dirty
       pictures on the wall.  He looks down and sees MOM's
       shoes under the stall and starts moaning sexually as
       he writes "EAT ME" with a magic marker.

       racehorse.

       PERVERT looks through peep-hole between booths and
       sees MOM and moans in silent orgasm.

       MOM pulls fire poker out from under her coat.

       PERVERT zips up in a panic and flees bathroom in
       fear.

       Suddenly MOM runs from her booth with fire poker
       drawn and skewers CARL in the back at the urinal.

       CARL screams in horror as MOM pulls out fire poker
       with his liver skewered on the end.

       CARL collapses to his knees, his head landing in
       urinal.

       MOM looks horrified at the liver and tries to shake
       it off poker, panicked that someone will come into
       men's room.

       Closing her eyes in revulsion, she pulls off liver
       with her fingertips and throws it on floor.

       Running from men's room, she slips in gore, catches
       her balance, looks back at CARL's head in urinal,
       hesitates and finally runs back to flush toilet
       before escaping undetected.

       MOM's car veers across lawn and flattens Mrs.
       Hinkle's entire flower garden as she plows her way
       back to street.

       DET. BRADFORD comes running out of house and jumps
       out of way as ROOKIE COP's car skids around corner
       and smashes into Mrs. Ackerman's wishing well
       decoration in her front yard.

       DOTTIE HINKLE is held back by burly POLICEWOMAN on
       porch as she curses MOM in the distance.

       MOM turns off tape player and pulls to a stop on a

       dish-washing gloves and slips them on her hands.

<b>74.    INTERIOR SCOTTY'S BEDROOM AT HIS PARENTS' HOUSE.

       SCOTTY lies in bed, surrounded by vintage
       sexploitation movie posters that decorate his walls
       ("Garden of Eden", "Mud-Honey", "There She Blows"),
       and watches on video the ridiculous 70's trash film
       "Double-Agent '73" starring Chesty Morgan.

       In the credit sequence he sees Miss Morgan
       "photographing" men with her humongous breasts that
       supposedly have cameras implanted inside.  SCOTTY is
       getting turned on.  He runs to lock bedroom door,
       closes curtain on window and then hops under a
       blanket to commit the sin of self-abuse.

       SCOTTY is watching Chesty Morgan on video roll about

       shoes as he concentrates on her gigantic breasts and
       touches himself off camera.  He hears banging at

79.    CUT to MOM staring evily through plate glass window
       from outside a suburban house.

       Reverse angle shows not Scotty, but the dental
       emergency couple, THE STERNERS, as they sit in their
       dining room eating a dinner of cornish game hens.

       MOM zeros in on the game hens and flashes back to
       "Dede" and the other cute birds in her bird-feeder
       at home.

       As the couple viciously slice apart the game hens
       and stuff the meat in their mouths, MOM breaks a
       small pane of glass in back door to gain entry.

       MOM is listening in disgust, notices a limp plant,
       waters it thoughtfully and then jumps out of the way
       to hide as MRS. STERNER comes into kitchen to get a
       large chocolate pie.

       As MRS. STERNER continues to watch TV we see her get
       ready for bed.

       We see her change from her shoes to bedroom slippers
       from under the bed.

       We see her brush her hair from behind the mirror.

       We see her open her drawer and take out
       birth-control foam from inside the bureau.

       We see her go to closed curtains moving ominously in
       the breeze and close the window from the other side.

       MRS. STERNER takes off her dress to reveal monstrous
       white all-in-one bra and girdle and moves to closet
       door.

       She opens closet door and hesitates.

       We see shoe in bottom of closet move slightly.

       Suddenly a mouse scurries out of shoe and runs
       across floor as MRS. STERNER screams,

       MRS. STERNER reaches for nightgown and pulls it off
       hanger to reveal MOM's insane face.  Suddenly MOM
       stabs MRS. STERNER viciously in the stomach with
       MRS. ACKERMAN's scissors.

       MRS. STERNER opens her mouth in a silent scream as
       MOM pulls out the scissors and stabs her again and
       again as a large rat in the closet runs out and
       begins biting MRS. STERNER's ankle at the same time.

       MR. STERNER burps in front of empty plate and hears

       STERNER's head.  He ducks in the nick of time and
       the scissors stick in the wall.

       MR. STERNER turns and runs in fear as MOM gives
       chase, grabbing the scissors out of the wall.

       MR. STERNER runs down the steps screaming as MOM
       runs after him.  She throws the scissors at him
       again, but just misses him.

       Thinking fast, MR. STERNER grabs scissors from wall
       and throws them back at MOM.  She ducks in the nick
       of time and her face goes purple with rage.

       SCOTTY stares in complete mortification as the

       Sutphin car pulls to a stop at a red light next to
       car full of churchgoers.  MOM turns to smile at them
       and all the churchgoers scream in horror at the
       sight of her face.

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE look up in amazement
       as they see the Sutphins pull into church parking
       lot followed by string of police cars.

       The Sutphins nervously get out of car and walk
       towards church as the good Christian families glare
       at them and gossip with a vengeance.

       DAD tries to be brave, MISTY hangs her head in
       mortification, CHIP is excited by all the attention
       and MOM smiles happily to appalled worshippers.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the two garbagemen, dressed in their
       shabby church clothes wave to MOM in secret
       admiration.

       BIRDIE's eyes light up at seeing CHIP but her
       suddenly forbidding parents hold her back when she
       tries to join him.  She mouths "I love you" to him
       as CHIP looks back to her parents with hurt and
       confusion.

       As the SUTPHIN family reaches the church door, a
       reporter runs towards them with his cameras drawn.

       The SUTPHINS take their place in a half filled pew
       next to appalled young MARRIED COUPLE as a still
       mortified SCOTTY glares in hatred and vengeance from
       a pew in the back of the church.

       BIRDIE's face is covered in tears as she sits with
       her parents helplessly.

       MISTY turns in her seat and searches the hostile
       crowd for the face of the cute REPORTER.  When she
       spots him secretly snapping her photo, she subtly
       gives him a sexy pose.

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and all the COPS begin
       infiltrating the church, taking places in pews and
       then moving forward to other pews closer to MOM.

       SCOTTY beams at police presence and eagerly scoots
       over to let DET. BRADFORD and DET. MOORE sit with
       him on their way to nail MOM.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the garbagemen, scowl at the police
       and look with loyalty to poor MOM.

       As CONGREGATION prays along with FATHER STONE, COPS
       flood the church and move towards MOM.

       A BABY in the arms of a MOTHER in pew in front of

       MOM sneezes and a hunk of phlegm flies out and hits
       BABY square in face.

       BABY'S MOTHER screams in horror at seeing her BABY's
       face and the entire congregation1 thinking she's
       been attacked by MOM, dives to the floor in terror.

       COPS draw guns and leap over pews as complete
       pandemonium breaks out in church.

       Just as DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD are about to
       grab MOM, GUS and SLOPPY punch the COPS in the mouth
       and MOM runs off.

       DAD looks for MOM in a panic and realizes she has
       vanished.

       CHIP cringes in fear as hordes of COPS surround his
       family until he is relieved to see that MOM has
       escaped.

       MISTY gives "dramatic" poses of "fear" and "horror"
       as cute REPORTER snaps her picture excitedly.

       BIRDIE escapes her parents, runs to CHIP, embraces
       him and together they take off.

       FATHER STONE stares out from altar in shock as
       worshippers scream and trample each other trying to
       get out of church as police try to restore order.

       SCOTTY, trying to be macho, fights his way towards
       front of church and for a split-second sees CHIP,
       BIRDIE and MOM running out back door of sacristy in
       escape.

       DAD looks horrified as he politely maneuvers his way
       through crowd as CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE take over
       and begin "slamming" their way through crowd opening
       up a crowd for DAD.

       The COPS flood the place.  DET. MOORE sees MOM in
       the distance, grabs DET. BRADFORD and they begin to
       fight their way through crowd after her.

       "CAMEL LIPS" incites the crowd from the stage to
       fight back against the police.

       SCOTTY is running toward stage in terror, looking
       over his shoulder and seeing MOM gaining on him.

       DAD gets caught in a mob of slam dancers and is
       lifted off his feet and tossed through the air by
       the crowd.

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE see DAD airborne and start
       slamming into the crowd to save him.  MISTY and CHIP
       slam into big BIKER below DAD and DAD is knocked
       back to the ground safely.

       When BIRDIE sees a slam dancer with a trickle of
       blood running from his nose, she starts gagging at
       the sight of real blood.

       SCOTTY is at the edge of the stage.  He sees MOM
       almost on top of him and leaps onto stage and runs
       for his life, dodging bouncers and beer bottles
       being thrown from audience.

       MOM looks furious that SCOTTY has escaped but then
       looks up at theatrical light rigging overhead and
       then back down at SCOTTY's face as "CAMEL LIPS"
       tries to hit him with their instruments.  MOM looks
       over her shoulder and sees DET. MOORE and DET.
       BRADFORD advancing on her.  Ducking behind a giant
       speaker, out of view of the crowd MOM pulls butcher
       knife from purse, cuts supporting rope and sends
       whole set of lights crashing down on SCOTTY's head.

       The crowd goes wild thinking it's more of "CAMEL
       LIPS" sickening theatrics.

       A gang of heavy-metal chicks slam into DET. MOORE
       and DET. BRADFORD and knock them to the ground.

       MOM's eyes light up in fury when she sees SCOTTY
       still alive, crawling out from under the lights,
       semi-conscious and bleeding.

       BIRDIE faints at the sight of more blood.

       Thinking fast, MOM swipes a hairspray can sticking
       out of a girl's purse and uses her VIP pass to go
       backstage as CAMEL LIPS reaches its deafening
       crescendo of musical mayhem.

       As SCOTTY crawls to side of stage, MOM jumps out
       from a piece of backstage scenery and aims hairspray
       can at him.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                       (Hissing)
                  Buckle up, Scotty!

       MOM lights the spray from the hairspray can and
       ignites SCOTTY's clothes in lethal flames without
       anyone seeing her.

       SCOTTY runs across the stage ablaze as "CAMEL LIPS"
       plays the final deafening note of their song and the
       crowd gives a screaming ovation, all holding up lit
       lighters, thinking SCOTTY on fire is all part of the
       act.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD look to the stage in
       horror.

       DAD gasps in fear.  MISTY and CHIP stare speechless
       as SCOTTY falls to his knees and keels over.  BIRDIE
       comes to and then faints again.

       The LEAD SINGER thinks it's a joke, pours a little
       Jack Daniels on the smouldering corpse and then
       jumps back in comic over-reaction when the flames
       light up again.

       MOM, now caught in the front row of laughing
       slam-dancing spectators, turns to her dumb-struck
       family, smiles and sticks fingers in her ears,
       mimicking that the music is much too loud.

       DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD slamdance MOM from both
       sides and knock her to the ground and handcuff her.

       DAD puts his arms around CHIP, MISTY and BIRDIE as
       they hang their heads in sorrow.

       "CAMEL LIPS" and the entire audience of grunge-punks
       boo and jeer the police as they drag MOM out as she
       smiles innocently in suburban lunacy.

       follow him to the stand.  CHIP, who has joined
       BIRDIE and his family looks at MOM and sees her
       worried expression.

       MARVIN sinks down lower in witness chair so he can
       get a better view up MOM's skirt.

                  sure?!

       MOM suddenly realizes MARVIN is looking up her
       skirt.  In a brilliant legal maneuver she begins
       inching her skirt up a little higher under the table
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom, giving
       MARVIN a better view and hoping to change his
       damning testimony.

                  pair of lady's shoes" in the
                  stall next to you.

       MOM smiles like the perfect saint as she begins
       flapping her leqe back and forth under the table,
       flashing MARVIN her very prim nun-like undergarments
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom.

       have rejoined the family in court and is horrified
       to see them with their arms wrapped around each
       other, cuddling.

<b>                            BIRDIE
</b>                       (Mumbling to herself)
                  No more violence...No more
                  violence...

<b>                            REPORTER BOYFRIEND
</b>                  Think she'll like me?

<b>                            MISTY
</b>                       (Worried)
                  Just be nice to her.  And try
                  ...just try not to get on her
                  nerves.

       MOM rushes over to DAD, free at last and gives him a
       big hug as press, fans, even the jury cheer her
       victory.

<b>174.   INTERIOR COURTROOM HALLWAY.
</b>
       The stunned Sutphin family exits as MOM raises fists
       like "Rocky" to cheers of her supporters.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                    (Graciously accepting
                     flowers, signing autographs,
                     posing for the press)
                  I love you!  Thanks for coming!
                     (Slows a kiss to newsteam)
                  Hi Los Angeles!
                     (Looking into another camera)
                  Hello Cleveland!
                     (And another)
                  And you too, New York!

       Down the hall, inside a bank of old fashioned wooden
       phone booths is JUROR #8, excitedly talking on pay
       phone.

<b>                            JUROR #8
</b>                       (Proudly)
                  We did it!  We set her free!
                  I knew she was innocent
                  right from the beginning!...

       Without warning, MOM slams her way into phone booth,
       hangs up the call and grabs receiver out of JUROR
       #8's hand.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                       (Snarling scarily)
                  You can't wear white shoes
                  after Labor Day!

<b>                            JUROR #8
</b>                       (Stammering in open-mouthed
                        terror)
                  No...please...that's not
                  true anymore.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  Oh yes it is!
                       (In homicidal fury)
                  Didn't your mother ever
                  tell you?!

       MOM suddenly bludgeons JUROR #8 over the head with
       the telephone receiver.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  Well, now you know!

       JUROR #8, stunned by the blow, struggles to stay
       conscious.

<b>                            JUROR #8
</b>                       (Staggering in pain)
                  But...fashion has changed...

<b>                            MOM
</b>                       (Enraged)
                  No it hasn't!

       MOM imediately hits JUROR #8 over the head again
       with the telephone receiver.

       As JUROR #8's screams are drowned out by the passing
       PRESS MOB, MOM hits her again and again with the
       telephone receiver until JUROR #8 collapses to the
       ground, her white summer shoes turned red with her
       own blood.

       Cut back to Sutphin family, holding on to each other
       for dear life as the mob of supporters swell around
       them.

<b>                            DAD
</b>                     (Realizing MOM is missing
                      in the confusion)
                  Beverly?  Beverly?

       MOM flies out of phone booth wearing a big smile,
       not missing a beat.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  Right here, honey.

<b>                            PRESS
</b>                  Mrs. Sutphin, can we get
                  a shot with you and Farrah
                  Fawcett?

<b>                            MOM
</b>                  Certainly.

       FARRAH FAWCETT barges in and takes over.

<b>                            FARRAH
</b>                  Hello, Beverly.  I'm Farrah
                  Fawcett
                      (Pulling MOM rudely)
                  You stand here...
                      (To PRESS)
                  Ok, boys, a medium two shot...

<b>                            MOM
</b>                   (Trying to get on other
                    side of FAWCETT)
                  ...but please...if I could
                  just...

<b>                            FARRAH
</b>                    (Rudely shoving MOM back
                     in place)
                  Stay there, Beverly.
                       (Posing)
                  Smile, Serial Mom!

       Flashbulbs explode.

<b>                            MOM
</b>                   (Hissing to FARRAH in the
                    scariest, most threatening
                    voice yet)
<b>                  THAT'S MY BAD SIDE, FARRAH
</b><b>                  FAWCETT!!
</b>
       A JUROR down the hall screams in horror as she opens
       phone booth door and a bloody white shoe pops out.

       FARRAH FAWCETT looks back at MOM in sudden fear.

       MOM glares back with the face of a madwoman.

       Freeze frame.

       Dissolve to epilogue title card:  "Beverly Sutphin
       is a free woman."
