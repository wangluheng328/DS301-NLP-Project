<title>"FORREST GUMP" -- by Eric Roth</title>

<pre>
<b>                                      "FORREST GUMP"
</b>
                                      Screenplay by

                                        Eric Roth

                                   Based on a novel by

                                      Winston Groom

<b>                
</b>
<b>               EXT. A SAVANNAH STREET - DAY (1981)
</b>
               A feather floats through the air. The falling feather.

               A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather 
               floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down 
               toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive 
               by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder.

               He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked 
               back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car. 
               The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward 
               the street.

               The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying 
               back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather 
               floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's 
               mudsoaked shoe.

               The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is 
               FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a 
               box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case.

               Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a 
               pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items.

               Forrest pulls out a book titled "Curious George," then places 
               the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase.

               Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all 
               there.

               Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard.

               A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus 
               continues on.

               A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at 
               the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a 
               magazine as Forrest looks at her.

<b>                                     FORREST
</b>                         Hello. My name's Forrest Gump.

               He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse.

<b>                                     FORREST
</b>                         You want a chocolate?

               The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this 
               strange man next to her.

<b>                                     FORREST
</b>                         I could eat about a million and a 
                         half of these. My momma always said, 
                         "Life was like a box of chocolates.
                         You never know what you're gonna 
                         get."

               Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's 
               shoes.

<b>                                     FORREST
</b>                         Those must be comfortable shoes. 
                         I'll bet you could walk all day in 
                         shoes like that and not feel a thing. 
                         I wish I had shoes like that.

<b>                                     BLACK WOMAN
</b>                         My feet hurt.

<b>                                     FORREST
</b>                         Momma always says there's an awful 
                         lot you could tell about a person by 
                         their shoes. Where they're going.
                         Where they've been.

               The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his 
               own shoes.

<b>                                     FORREST
</b>                         I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I 
                         think about it real hard I could 
                         remember my first pair of shoes.

               Forrest closes his eyes tightly.

<b>                                     FORREST
</b>                         Momma said they'd take my anywhere.

<b>               INT. COUNTRY DOCTOR'S OFFICE - GREENBOW, ALABAMA - DAY 
</b><b>               (1951)
</b>
               A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as 
               he sits in a doctor's office.

<b>                                     FORREST (V.O.)
</b>                         She said they was my magic shoes.

               Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg 
               braces.

<b>                                     DOCTOR
</b>                         All right, Forrest, you can open 
                         your eyes now. Let's take a little 
                         walk around.

               The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around 
               stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks 
               around the room awkwardly.

<b>                                     DOCTOR
</b>                         How do those feel? His legs are 
                         strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've 
                         ever seen. But his back is as crooked 
                         as a politician.

               Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump.

<b>                                     DOCTOR
</b>                         But we're gonna straighten him right 
                         up now, won't we, Forrest?

               A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls.

<b>                                     MRS. GUMP
</b>                         Forrest!

<b>               EXT. GREENBOW, ALABAMA
</b>
               Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street. Forrest 
               walks stiffly next to his mother.

<b>                                     FORREST (V.O.)
</b>                         Now, when I was a baby, Momma named 
                         me after the great Civil War hero, 
                         General Nathan Bedford Forrest...

<b>               EXT. RURAL ALABAMA
</b>
               A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest.

               The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded 
               sheet over his head.

               The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse.

               The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan 
               members dressed in full uniform.

<b>                                     FORREST (V.O.)
</b>                         She said we was related to him in 
                         some way. And, what he did was, he 
                         started up this club called the Ku 
                         Klux Klan. They'd all dress up in 
                         their robes and their bedsheets and 
                         act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks 
                         or something. They'd even put 
                         bedsheets on their horses and ride 
                         around. And anyway, that's how I got 
                         my name. Forrest Gump.

<b>               EXT. GREENBOW
</b>
               Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street.

<b>                                     FORREST (V.O.)
</b>                         Momma said that the Forrest part was 
                         to remind me that sometimes we all 
                         do things that, well, just don't 
                         make no sense.

               Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's 
               brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and 
               tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a 
               barber shop and watch.

<b>                                     MRS. GUMP
</b>                         Just wait, let me get it.

               Mrs. Gump struggles to pull the stuck brace from the grate.

               Forrest runs from the chasing room. He looks over his shoulder 
               in fear.

               The boys on the bikes peddle faster as they gain on Forrest, 
               running.

               Forrest tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly his 
               braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the 
               air.

               Forrest runs and look down at his legs in surprise.

               Forrest continues to run faster as the metal braces and straps 
               fly off his legs.

               Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed.

               The chasing boys ride over the remains of Forrest's braces.

               Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone.

               Some opposing players fall down. Forrest runs along the 
               sidelines. The opposing players try to catch him.

               Forrest runs into the end zone as an opposing player dives 
               at his feet. The referee holds up his arm, signaling a touch 
               down. The crowd cheers wildly.

               Forrest continues to run, smashing through the band members, 
               then all the way toward the team tunnel. The football coach

               Forrest and Mrs. Gump have their picure taken in front of a 
               large statue. A military recruiter spots Forrest and steps 
               up to him.

               Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest. The recruiter slaps 
               Forrest on the shoulder and hands him some military 
               literature.

               The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and 
               rain.

                         What it is ain't exactly clear. 
                         There's a man with a gun over there,

</b>                         This one day, we was out walking, 
                         like always, and then, just like 
                         that, somebody turned off the rain 
                         and the sun come out.

               Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears. Forrest's 
               platoon is attacked. A bullet kills the soldier standing 
               next to Forrest. Bombs explode all around as the soldiers 
               scramble to the ground.

               Forrest crawls over a berm as bullets fly overhead and explode 
               all around him. Forrest rolls over and pulls his pack off 
               Lt. Dan lies next to Forrest.

               Two soldiers with a machine gun fire into the jungle. Lt.

               into the jungle.

               The machine gunner fires into the treeline. Another soldier 
               helps him with the ammunition. The machine gun jams.

               A rocket explodes on the machine gunner and the other soldier, 
               killing them. Forrest looks down and covers his head as 
               rockets explodes all around him.

               The platoon gets up and runs toward the cover of the jungle.

               Rockets explode all around the field. Forrest runs into the 
               jungle. The soldiers run through the jungle as bullets explode 
               all around. A soldier is blown up by a rocket. A soldier 
               runs through the jungle. Forrest runs past the soldier.

                         the ground.

               Tex lies on the ground, his face distorted with pain.

               Forrest reaches down and picks up Tex from the ground. Forrest 
               pulls Tex up over his shoulder, then runs.

                         I grabbed him up and run him out of 
                         there.

               Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing.

               He sets Tex down on the bank of a river, and runs back into 
               the jungle.

                         for Bubba, somebody else was saying, 
                         "Help me, Forrest. Help me."

               Forrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of 
               the river next to Tex, and then runs back toward the jungle.

               Forrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground 
               and turns him over. It is DALLAS.

               Forrest trips over something and falls to the ground. He 
               looks up to find two bloody legs. It is Lt. Dan, who is

               up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They 
               fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs.

               Forrest walks by the Lincoln Memorial. A fence surrounds the 
               Memorial, as well as armed military guards.

                         with people looking at all the statues

                         always try to keep my promise. So I

                         I thought about Jenny. I thought

                         couldn't draw that well and he didn't

               Forrest runs along a highway. A lake reflects the mountains 
               and the sky.

</b>                         It was so clear, Jenny. It looks 
                         like there were two skies, one on 
                         top of the other. And then in the 
                         desert, when the sun comes up...

<b>               EXT. DESERT - FLASHBACK - SUNRISE
</b>
               Forrest runs along a desert highway. The morning light casts 
               an orange glow over the desert.

<b>                                     FORREST (V.O.)
</b>                         I couldn't tell where heavens stopped 
                         and the earth began. It was so 
                         beautiful.

<b>               INT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING
</b>
               Forrest looks at Jenny. Jenny looks out the window.

               Jenny reaches over and takes Forrest's hand.

<b>               EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE AT OLD OAK TREE - DAY
</b>
               Forrest stands under the old oak tree where Jenny has been 
               buried.

               Jenny's grave marker. Forrest tries to hold back his tears.

               Forrest watches as Jenny's dad's house is knocked down by a 
               bulldozer.

               Jenny's grave marker reads: JENNY GUMP July 16, 1945 -- March

               Forrest looks down as he sobs.

               Forrest Jr. serves the ball, causing Forrest dive and miss 
               it.

               Forrest and Forrest Jr. sit on a log by the river and fish.

                         He's so smart, Jenny. You'd be so 
                         proud of him. I am. He, uh, wrote a 
                         letter, and he says I can't read it. 
                         I'm not supposed to, so I'll just 
                         leave it here for you.

               Forrest places the letter down at the grave marker, next to 
               fresh flowers. The name on the envelope reads: "Mom." Forrest 
               steps back and looks down at the grave.

</b>                         Jenny, I don't know if Momma was 
                         right or if, if it's Lieutenant Dan.
                         I don't know if we each have a 
                         destiny, or if we're all just floating 
                         around accidental-like on a breeze, 
                         but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe 
                         both is happening at the same time. 
                         I miss you, Jenny. If there's anything 
                         you need, I won't be far away.

               As Forrest walks away, a flock of birds flies overhead and 
               lands in the tree. Forrest turns and watches.

<b>               EXT. ROAD - MORNING
</b>
               Forrest walks with Forrest Jr. for the bus. The bus drives 
               toward them.

</b>                         Here's your bus. Okay.

               Forrest pulls "Curious George" out of Forrest Jr.'s backpack.

                         tell because grandma used to read it 
                         to you.

               Forrest looks at the book. The feather from the beginning of 
               the movie drops out of the book, unnoticed.

               The bus comes to a stop. The door opens.

</b>                         Well...

               Forrest puts the book back into Forrest Jr.'s backpack and 
               hands it to him.

               Forrest Jr. walks toward the bus. Forrest stands up.

               Forrest Jr. looks into the bus and at the bus driver. It is 
               the same bus driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to 
               school when he was a young boy.

<b>                                     FORREST JR.

                         and I'm Forrest Gump.

               Forrest Jr. looks over and waves to his father. Forrest nods 
               approvingly.

               Forrest Jr. gets on the bus. The bus pulls away. Forrest 
               stands next to the mailbox.

               Forrest sits down. The camera cranes down, revealing the 
               feather as it lies at Forrest's feet.

               A gust of wind picks the feather up. The feather floats up 
               into the air.

               Forrest sits at the side of the road. The feather floats 
               higher into the air.

               The feather soars up into the sky and travels up and down, 
               then covers the camera lens.
