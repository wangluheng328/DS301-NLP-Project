<b>   FADE IN:
</b>
<b>   EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY
</b>
   Ann is walking down the street.  The firedog runs out of the
   firehouse, she gives the dog a biscuit, and pats him on the
   head. 

   The fireman is out front with a cup of coffee.  Ann hands him
   a poster.

<b>   EXT. STATE AND MAIN - INTERSECTION - DAY
</b>
   Morris and Spud, two codgers, are about to cross the street
   when they hear a beeping and stop.

   As they cross, we see the tail end of a van, and the group
   nods in that direction.

<b>                       MORRIS
</b>             You hear that?

<b>                       SPUD
</b>             Yes, I hear it.

<b>                       MORRIS
</b>             Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half
             an-hour, get across the street
             yesterday.

<b>                       SPUD
</b>             I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank
             of the building.  Said, "What are you
             doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the
             'leven o'clock crossing..."

   As Morris and Spud speak a car is coming down the street, and
   bounces in the pothole.

<b>                       MORRIS
</b>             Y'wanna fix something, you should fix
             the pothole.  Yessir, they should be
             trussed up, thrown off some high
             building.

   DOUG MACKENZIE, a young Republican type, walks up to join
   them.

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             Who's that?

<b>                       MORRIS
</b>             Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand
             dollars, a new traffic light, you could
             grow old, paint your house before it
             lets you cross the street, and then, not
             fix the pothole.

<b>                       SPUD
</b>             What was wrong with the old traffic
             light?

<b>   INT. COFFEE CORNER - DAY
</b>
   They enter the Coffee Corner.  Carla is serving the folk, and
   Jack the owner is behind the counter.

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             I'm glad you asked... I'll tell you what
             was wrong with it.  And what was wrong
             with it was it was behind the times. 
             Now: You want to bring business into
             this town?  You have to plan for a
             Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at
             the moment, no...

<b>                       ANN
</b>             Morning, darling.

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             Morning.

<b>                       CARLA
</b>             Hi, Annie.

   Ann hands Carla a poster.

<b>                       ANN
</b>             Morning, Carla.

   Doug and the two codgers move to a table by the window where
   Carla, the nubile waitress, brings them coffee.  Ann talks to
   a woman at the counter.

<b>                       MORRIS
</b>             ...the damn thing...

<b>                       SPUD
</b>             No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a
             lot of people are pretty upset...

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             They are, yes.  I'm sure they are...

<b>                       WOMAN AT COUNTER
</b>             Annie, I'm going to be a lil' late for
             the rehearsal, tonight.

<b>                       ANN
</b>             S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             ...I'm sure that people are upset...

<b>                       MAUDE
</b>             I know 'em, I don't know what order they
             come in...

<b>                       ANN
</b>             We'll work it out.

<b>                       JACK 
</b>             What're they talking about?

<b>                       ANN
</b>             Traffic light.

<b>                       JACK
</b>             Waal, no, th'traffic light's Doug's
             thing.  That's his thing, fine.

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             Thank you, Jack, and...

<b>                       JACK
</b>             But we got to talk about the pothole.

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             Jack...

<b>                       JACK
</b>             A public office is a public trust...
             This is why this is America.  Question
             is: who owns the street.

   Outside the front booth, on the street, the airport van
   cruises by.
<b>			
</b><b>   
</b><b>			EXT. STATE AND MAIN - DAY
</b>
   As they walk out we hear a high pitched beeping sound at the
   traffic light.  We see DOC WILSON crossing the street,
   holding his doctor's bag.  An ELDERLY MAN approaches Doc at
   the crossing.  As Walt and Bill walk, the airport van follows
   them.

<b>                       TOWNSMAN
</b>             Doc, those pills, y'gave me for my back? 
             I'm not sure that they work.

<b>                       DOC WILSON
</b>             Well, I'm not sure either, but y'don't
             hear me complain... come by th'office,
             end of th'afternoon.

<b>                       TOWNSMAN
</b>             Thanks, Doc...

<b>                       BILL
</b>             This is your movie, this is small town
             America.

<b>                       WALT
</b>             Town in New Hampshire was small town
             America, too.  Forty thousand dollars a
             day, to shoot on the street.  And then
             they kicked us out...

   They stop in front of a rack of fifty "factory seconds."

   Black and red hunting jackets, in front of the sporting goods
   store.  The sign reads "FACTORY SECONDS, FIVE DOLLARS."

<b>                       BILL
</b>             A jacket for five dollars... I can buy
             this town for fifty bucks.

<b>                       WALT
</b>             You told me that about the last town.

<b>                       BILL
</b>             Yeah, but they never made a movie here.

<b>                       WALT
</b>             I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm bleeding...

<b>                       BILL

<b>                       WALT
</b>             What, what, what, what do they got that
             can pass for the Old Mill?

   Bill shows Walt a brochure from Waterford, which shows a
   picture of the Old Mill.  Walt reads.

<b>                       WALT (CONT'D)
</b>             "The Waterford Mill, built in 1825, and

<b>   ANGLE:

<b>   INT. THE AIRPORT VAN - CONTINUOUS
</b>
   UBERTO is asleep.  Bill wakes him up.

<b>                       UBERTO
</b>             Where are we?

<b>                       WALT
</b>             Givvem a cigarette...

   Uberto comes out of the car and squints around.

<b>                       UBERTO
</b>             ...they ship our Old Mill from New

<b>                       BILL
</b>             They're holding our Old Mill for ransom.

<b>                       UBERTO
</b>             We build it?

<b>                       BILL
</b>             We don't have to build it.

   He shows Uberto the brochure.

<b>                       UBERTO
</b>             We build the fire hut?

   Walt shows Uberto the Firehouse.  Uberto looks through the
   viewfinder.

<b>                       UBERTO (CONT'D)
</b>             We have to lose the window.

<b>                       WALT

<b>                       BILL
</b>             NO, we can't ever go back to New
             Hampshire.

   A pick-up truck with two calves in it stops, the driver seen
   from the back is a farmer smoking a pipe.

<b>                       WALT
</b>             NO, we're gonna stay here.  This is what
             my people died for.  The right to make a
             movie in this town.

<b>   INT. TAVERN INN LOBBY - DAY
</b>
   A desk clerk, SCOTT, looks up.  Behind the desk a display of
   several souvenir plates, "Souvenir of Waterford, VT", with a
   picture of the Old Mill on them.  Walt picks one up and hands
   it to Bill.

<b>                       SCOTT

   Walt talks into his cell phone as he talks to Scott.

   He walks away and the CAMERA takes him into a backyard, by a
   bunch of clotheslines.  His glasses fall apart as he changes
   them.  He looks up as the wind blows the sheet.

   He sees Ann, sitting on the backstairs of what, as we draw
   closer, we see is the playhouse.  In back of her we see the
   "Trials of the Heart" flats, seen from the back.

   She ducks under the sheet hanging by the door, she and Joe
   come upon the fishergirl, who is standing by the bank about
   to make a cast.

   We see Annie take some leader from the little girl and burn
   one end to make a hinge.

   and burns his finger.

   Joe, as he nods to himself, takes out a pad, starts to jot a
   note, fumbles with his glasses.  Joe saunters on, writing, we
   hear the beeping from the traffic light.  Joe hears a
   screeching of tires.

   He looks up, a film station wagon comes barreling around the
   corner, hits the pothole, goes out of control, careens, turns
   over, knocks down the control box of the traffic light.

   Joe holds a beat, runs over to the car, to driver's side.
   Battered driver, bleeding, upside down.  Joe drags him from
   the car.  It is Bob Barrenger.

   The trooper, Doug, and Bob Barrenger walk up to Marty.

<b>                       TROOPER

   Doug hands the arrest warrant to Marty.

<b>                       MARTY
</b>             Oh, good.  I'm his lawyer...and you must
             be Perry Mason.  Guess what, you're
             about one-half step from a world of
             hurt...how diverting...the Mayor's gonna
             have your ass.  Can I watch?

   CAMERA takes the group, the trooper, Doug, Bob, in handcuffs,
   Marty talking with them, through the crowd, on the back of
   which we see Ann and Joe.

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             Well, you guess what.  The Mayor sent
             me.  I have your Mr. Barrenger with a

</b>             Moral turp...you're on my home court,
             friend.  I have the Mayor and the town
             behind me, and forget making your movie:
             I may own the studio when I get through
             with you: I got a civil suit, I got
             rape, I got collusion...

<b>                       MARTY

             witness...

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White
             saw the crime.

<b>                       MARTY
</b>             He told you that!?

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             He didn't have to tell.

<b>                       MARTY

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             Oh, you're his attorney, too?

<b>                       MARTY
</b>             Later for you, pal.

<b>                       DOUG
</b>             Okay.

   He motions the cop to take out Barrenger.  Marty sees Joe in
   the back.

<b>                       MARTY
</b>             Bobby, don't say anything.

<b>                       BOB

   Marty, as he leads Joe down into an alleyway, and into a
   backyard, hung with washing on the lines.

   Ann.  She sees something down the other street.  We see Cal,
   the policeman, enter and start toward Joe.  We see Ann
   restrain him, and speak to him in the b.g. for several

   there is a pause and he looks at Joe, and exits.

   left on the coffee table.  Ann hands the paper to Joe.

   Joe, holding the paper.

   The masthead reads, "Waterford Sentinel, All the News of the
   Mountains, 'You Shall Not Bear False  Witness.'"

   Ann, who has also picked up the "For Sale" sign, showing the

   They look towards him.

   Cal walks with Joe, still holding the newspaper.  As they
   round a housecorner, Walt appears and walks with Joe.

</b>             You want me to lie.

<b>                       WALT
</b>             To the contrary.  I want you to tell the

             The truth is, you can't tell me, to a
             certainty, that you saw the thing.  You
             don't remember, a gun to your head,
             which glasses you have on.  And you have
             a fertile imagination.  Imagination
             wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  IF

             at the crossroads with a stake through
             their heart, you know?  The people who
             are talking to you about the way we live
             though we may praise them, we fear them. 
             And they fear us.  Because we tell the
             truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a
             damn roost, and everyone knows it;
             the guy is looking for a case, he wants
             to make a name for himself...If we let
             him do that, if we let him do that, then
             we're being false to our community...to
             our community, you understand?  To our
             world.  Cause you are a part of that
             world, now.  You have to take off the
             steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.
                 (pause)
             And be part of your world.  I got a five
             picture deal with the studio.  And you
             stick with me.  You write one, two more,
             you stick with me, and you'll direct the
             third one.  You are a part of this
             world.  You have to do the right thing:
             we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff,
             literally is at our door.  You have to
             stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the
             bottom line.  You have to...if you had
             the leisure to think it through, you'd
             see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in
             the car.

   Cal takes Joe to a side door of the courthouse.

   The old bellhop is packing up his lunchbox and changing into
   his streetclothes.

<b>   INT. JOE'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
   Joe enters and takes out his pad and pencil.  He sits on the
   bed.  On the pillow, he sees and picks up a black and red
   hunting jacket, onto which the one foot short sleeve has been
   knitted in baby blue.  There is a card in the picket that
   reads "Better than new -- it's got a story!"  He puts it
   down.

   He picks up his notebook, in which he has written: "The
   Purpose of the Second Chance is to allow you to make the same
   mistake twice."

   He stops by the mirror on the chiffonier into which he puts
   the lure, which still has the attached card reading "The
   truth may not always set you free, but it's always the truth 
   - Joseph Turner White."

   Joe goes to the bed.  On the bed is a small package tied with
   ribbon.  Joe opens it.

<b>   ANGLE INS.

   It is a small thing of maple syrup.  Attached to it is a card
   reading: "It is your invention which makes everything sweet."

   He takes off his jacket, and picks up his notebook.  Out of
   his jacket pocket falls the old copy of the Waterford
   Sentinel.

   He picks it up.

<b>   ANGLE JOE'S POV
</b>
   The masthead: Waterford Sentinel "The Voice of the Mountains,
   You Shall Not Bear False Witness."

   He puts the newspaper down.  Picks up the maple sugar card
   again, and looks at it.

   He sees an arrow and turns it over

   The back of the card reads: "How about an Associate Producer

   He takes the paper, balls it up and throws them into the
   trash.  He picks up the fishing lure which is resting on the
   typewriter.  Puts it into his pocket, thinks again, throws it
   in the trash.  Shakes his head, and picks up his suitcase and
   starts packing...

<b>                       DOC WILSON
</b>             It's the truth that you should never

   Joe enters, and the camera takes him into the deserted
   building, through the courtroom and, in back, he sees Ann
   standing alone.  He walks back to her, through the doors
   which appear to be the Judge's chambers.

<b>   ANGLE REVERSED
</b>
   We show that the walls of the Courtroom are the set, and we
   are back in the "Trials of the Heart" set.  Ann is sitting
   there.  Reading her play by Joe White.  He looks at her for
   an explanation.  Maude, the court reporter woman, is sitting
   in the b.g.  Ann is knitting in pink wool.

   Ann moves to embrace Joe.  They hear screaming.  They turn.

   Ann and Joe, who starts to cross the street.  We see the
