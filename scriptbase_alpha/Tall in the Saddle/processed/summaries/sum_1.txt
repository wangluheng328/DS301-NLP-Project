An experienced ranch hand, Rocklin, arrives in town expecting to start a new job only to find that his prospective employer was shot dead a few weeks before.
Also arriving at the same time is a pretty young woman, Clara Cardell, who is about to inherit her uncle's ranch and her domineering aunt, Elizabeth Martin.
Rocklin no sooner arrives than he has a run-in with Arly Harolday, owner of a neighboring ranch, a woman who can ride and shoot as well as he does.
Rocklin finds that he's not very welcome in town and finds that there are plans to swindle Clara out of her inheritance.
There's also an attempt to frame him for murder.
