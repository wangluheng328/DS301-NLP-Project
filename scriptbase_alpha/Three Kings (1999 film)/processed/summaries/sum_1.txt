In the days immediately after the Gulf War, a group of American soldiers come across a secret Iraqi map, which discloses the whereabouts of a bunker where Iraq is storing stolen gold and treasure from Kuwait.
The soldiers hope to take the gold and keep it for themselves.
However, when they arrive at the site, they discover that the Iraqi army is more concerned about persecuting its civilians than stopping them from stealing the gold.
They learn that the civilians have been encouraged by the U.S. government to rise up and fight Sadaam Hussein, but are facing certain execution because the U.S. military refuses to help them.
This incident creates a crisis of conscience for the American soldiers.
Do they take the money and run, leaving the civilians to face certain death at the hands of the Iraqi army?
Or do they risk losing the gold in order to escort them to safety across the border into Iran?
