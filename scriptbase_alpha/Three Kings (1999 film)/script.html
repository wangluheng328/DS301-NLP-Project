   <title>"Three Kings", shooting draft, by David O Russell</title>



   <pre>






                          <u>THREE KINGS</u>





     a screenplay by
     David O. Russell
     Story by
     John Ridley and David O. Russell




                                                  Draft Date: 6/22/98




<b>     FADE IN:
</b>
<b>     EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY
</b>
     WIDE ANGLE POV of wide open desert, flat grey sky.

     THE CAMERA is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the
     distance. There are O.S. sounds: SOLDIER'S EQUIPMENT
     CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a MAN's BREATHING.

     The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders
     APPEAR in the BOTTOM of the FRAME, running. This is TROY
     BARLOW, Sargeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet is
     a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby.

     Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an IRAQI SOLDIER
     stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares
     at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters a white flag
     over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. Troy
     turns around, we see his face for the first time.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Are we shooting people, or what?

<b>                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
</b>               <u>Are we shooting?</u>

<b>                         TROY
</b>               <u>That's what I'm asking you.</u>

<b>                         SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
</b>               <u>What's the answer?</u>

<b>                         TROY
</b>               <u>I don't know the answer. That's</u>
               <u>what I'm trying to find out.</u>

     PAN TO THREE SOLDIERS 40 yards away -- ZOOM IN --

     SOLDIER #1 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth.
     TWO OTHER SOLDIERS put out their hands and get pieces of gum.

     PAN TO 100 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- SOLDIER #2 stands with
     his head tilted back while SOLDIER #3 looks into his eye.

<b>                         SOLDIER #3
</b>               It looks like a grain of sand, but
               I don't know how I'm gonna get it
               out--

     CAPTAIN VAN METER, 37, crab-like, is in the far distance.

<b>                         CAPTAIN VAN METER
</b>               <u>If they surrender, don't shoot, if</u>
               <u>they don't surrender, then shoot.</u>

     PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns
     back to the dune and runs a few yards.

     Stops and stares, raises his rifle.  He aims at the figure on
     the horizon.

<b>     POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE
</b>
     The Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. Hear Troy's breathing,
     loud, as he pulls trigger slowly.  Slow motion RIFLE sound.

     Silent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck
     explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for sound of
     Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks toward the big berm, and up
     to the crest. All we hear are his footsteps and breathing.

<b>                         SOLDIER #3 (O.S.)
</b>               <u>That guy just shot a towel head.</u>

<b>                         SOLDIER #4 (O.S.)
</b>               <u>Bullshit.</u>

<b>     YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER
</b>
     lies on the ground. A piece of his neck is blown away. He is
     rasping, a flag is clasped in one hand; a rifle in the other.
     He is looking up at Troy, who looks down at him.

<b>                                              SMASH CUT TO
</b>
<b>     FANTASY - INT. HOSPITAL, TORRANCE, CAL. - DAY
</b>
     A WHITE BABY GIRL, covered in blood and placenta, is pulled
     from between the legs of Troy's WIFE, DARLENE. THE NURSE
     holds the SCREAMING BABY aloft, proud and happy.

<b>                         VIG (V.O.)
</b>                      (deep southern accent)
               Congratulations, you got yourself
               a rag head, my man.

<b>     EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY (PRESENT)
</b>
     The rasping Iraqi dies.

     PAN TO CONRAD VIG, 18 or 20, wiry, intense, deep south,
     wearing Army issue glasses, out of breath.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               Dag.

     Troy turns, upset, murmurs "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               "Gettin' bugged drivin' up and
               down the same old strip, gotta
               find a new place where the kids
               are hip, I get around --"

<b>                         SOLDIER #1
</b>               I didn't think I'd see anyone get
               shot over here.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               It looked like the guy's head blew
               three feet into the air --

<b>     FANTASY SEQUENCE IN SLOW MOTION
</b>
     The Iraqi's head pops three feet into the air.

<b>     BACK TO THE SCENE
</b>
<b>                         SOLDIER #1
</b>               Bullshit, that's not what happened.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               I said it <u>looked</u> like that
               happened, but then we got here and
               he was still breathing.

<b>                         SOLDIER #2
</b>               Oh, my God, it's just like
               'Predator,' where the guy, the
               black guy --

<b>                         SOLDIER #3
</b>               Carl Weathers. His arm gets shot
               off.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               And when it hits the ground, his
               hand keeps on firing.

<b>     SCENE FROM 'PREDATOR'
</b>
     Carl Weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing.

<b>     BACK TO THE SCENE.
</b>
<b>                         SOLDIER #5
</b>               Take my picture.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               Do you still want to sell pictures?

<b>                         TROY
</b>                      (distracted monotone)
               For twenty.

<b>                         SOLDIER #5
</b>               Twenty dollars, man, what's the
               meaning of life?

<b>                         TROY
</b>               You're lucky you got to see
               anybody shot in this war.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               War's been over five days, Jim,
               ain't gonna be much more of this.

<b>                         SOLDIER #5
</b>               Bobby, take my picture.

     He holds the camera out.

<b>                         SOLDIER #4
</b>               If he shot the guy, it's up to him.

<b>                         SOLDIER #5
</b>               It's not like he shot a fucking
               deer. It's the enemy.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               Troy's enemy, yours for twenty.

     Soldiers get their cash out, Troy takes it.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Accept no substitute, this is the
               real thing, oh, Jesus [winces] --

<b>                         VIG
</b>               What's wrong?

<b>                         TROY
</b>               I got a really bad headache all of
               a sudden--

     SOLDIER #7 bends next to the corpse and holds his camera out
     at arm's length.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               No free pictures, motherfucker.

     Vig shoves the soldier away and the two wrestle as they roll
     down the sand berm.

     "I Just Want to Celebrate" by Rare Earth comes on LOUD.

     Troy walks away holding his temple in pain; SOLDIERS gather
     to stare at the dead Iraqi, getting their cameras out.

<b>     EXT. IRAQI DESERT ROAD - AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN COMBAT GEAR
</b>
     dance on a road in the desert. "I Just Want to Celebrate"
     BLARES as the CAMERA DOLLIES THROUGH the soldiers.

     DOLLY INTO TENT TOWN, past bare chested soldiers pumping free
     weights; jogging in formation; sunbathing on big water
     storage mattresses; DOLLY OUT OF THE TENT TOWN, past a
     soldier taking a makeshift foxhole desert bath, past a dead
     Iraqi on the road, a chopper hovering in the distance, to
     MORE DANCING SOLDIERS, as music continues --

<b>                         BILL SMITHSON (O.S.)
</b>               Spirits are high and the music is
               boisterous as these young troops
               celebrate -- Shit. Let me try that
               again.

     DOLLY AROUND the dancing soldiers to see: hundreds of
     stripped Iraqi soldiers lying face down in undershorts.

<b>                         BILL SMITHSON (O.S.)
</b>               Spirits are high and the music is

     PAN PAST CNN REPORTER BILL SMITHSON, 45, in white safari
     jacket over Desert Storm fatigues, cleaning his eye; nearby
     a cluster of ROWDY SOLDIERS who are mugging into the camera.

     DOLLY TO ARCHIE GATES, 55, Lieutenant Colonel, Special
     Forces, wearing sunglasses, talking to HAVICHON, a FRENCH
     Special Forces Captain on CRUTCHES with a broken leg.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

     Soldiers scream and go nuts.

     Beer is sputtered from soldiers' mouths.

     "I Can't Do Nothing For Ya Man" by Public Enemy blasts.

     WALTER WOGOMAN, 19, quiet, tall, Southern operates two
     parallel boom boxes like a DJ.

     A Soldier rapidly peels down one Bruce Lee poster on top of
     another, like a flip-book animating Bruce Lee. Vig wearing
     a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a
     series of cheerleader-like karate arm movements.

     Soldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at Troy. He
     whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes.

     Soldiers -- Vig, Walter, others -- scream viscerally as the
     music blasts.  Two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols
     at Troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal.

<b>                         TROY

<b>                         TROY

     Vig points the big pistol at an OLDER IRAQI OFFICER who is
     the only one not taking his clothes off.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               Take your fucking rags off, take

               Sir? We need you to disrobe like
               all the other towel heads, OK?

     The Officer does not move, Troy punches his head once. Vig
     and Walter forcibly pull the Iraqi Officer's pants off. Troy
     takes out a bottle of aspirin, eats two.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               Whoa, it's a freaky thing, Troy.

     Vig points to the Officer's bare buttocks, where a rolled up
     piece of paper is sticking out --

<b>                         TROY
</b>               There's a document in that guy's
               ass, Conrad.

<b>                         VIG

</b>               It wouldn't come out perfect like

     Troy pulls out a latex glove out of his pocket.

<b>                         TROY

<b>                         IRAQI OFFICER

     The Officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by
     Walter as Vig, wearing the glove, slowly pulls the rolled up,
     greasy paper from the Officer's ass -- Troy looks disgusted.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Open it up.

<b>                         VIG

               but you gotta open it up. That's
               how the chain of command works.

     Vig takes out a U.S. Army pen and uses it to unroll the
     greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand.

<b>     CLOSE UP - THE RUMPLED PAPER

     is a handwritten map, with scant Arabic writing, a few spare
     roads, numbers, and three small boxes.

     Iraqi soldiers look scared as the Humvee drives up, like it's
     going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the breeze.

     Vig stands and speaks into a megaphone.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               We are the Army of the United
               States of America. We are here to
               protect you. Remain calm.

     Troy and Doc leap from the Humvee with pistols drawn and
     their free hands held up in a 'halt' sign. The TWO IRAQI
     GUARDS look stunned as Troy and Doc simply take their machine
     guns and put the Iraqis face down on the ground. Troy and Doc
     pull out <u>plastic twist hand-cuffs</u>, as used in urban riots.

     Archie bounds forward holding up a thick white document.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               Orders from President Bush, step
               aside.

     Troy finishes handcuffing one of the Iraqi soldiers, as a
     gaunt mother, with a baby in her arms, opens her blouse,
     revealing her small breasts. Other peasants gather.

<b>                         IRAQI MOTHER
</b>               No milk. Baby milk.

     Troy looks shocked until Archie suddenly pushes him past the
     Iraqi mother and to the door of the bunker, which Doc holds.

<b>     INT. BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     Five IRAQI SOLDIERS look disoriented and scared as they hold
     their hands up in the air.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

               <u>and safety.</u>

     Iraqi women and children kiss Vig's feet.

     The five Iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands
     raised, and the starved Shiite civilians spit and throw
     stones at them while 'I Get Around' keeps playing.

<b>                         VIG

     Archie runs down the narrow stairs of the bunker, followed by
     Troy and Doc.

<b>     INT. BASEMENT OF BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     Doc lashes an Iraqi's hands behind his back and cuffs him.

     Troy shoots the door lock with his pistol.  Then backs up and
     gives it a running shoulder. The door doesn't budge.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Shit.

     He holds his shoulder in pain.  Archie kicks the door
     repeatedly.  Troy joins him, it finally flies open.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               <u>Freeze.</u>

     Troy is embraced by an Iraqi soldier, about 25.

<b>                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
</b>               I am love United States of
               Freedom. I am hate Saddam.

     Troy tries some karate moves, jerking his elbows to dislodge
     the Iraqi from the bear hug --

<b>                         TROY
</b>               <u>Ya -- ya -- ha --</u>

     Doc points his pistol in the Iraqi's face.

<b>                         DOC
</b>               Let him go.

     The Iraqi throws his hands in the air.

<b>                         FRIENDLY IRAQI
</b>               No problem, my friend.

     Archie goes to a series of WOODEN CRATES the size of file
     cabinets, where Doc helps Archie take off his back pack.
     Archie pulls out a bolt cutter and a pneumatic saw, both
     attached to a small air tank - and opens the crate, which is
     filled with hundreds of Kuwaiti passports.

<b>                         FRIENDLY IRAQI

     They use the power tools to open the second crate -- also
     filled with hundreds of passports.

     Archie pulls out the infrared map and shows it to the Iraqi,
     who says nothing.

<b>     EXT. BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     FOUR NEW IRAQI SOLDIERS, armed with rifles, run from the far
     side of the square and start shooting.

     30 rock-throwing Shiite scatter at the gunfire. TWO MEN fall
     to the ground as they are shot.

<b>                         CHILD

     Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone
     as he points his big unloaded pistol. The soldiers point
     their rifles as they come towards Vig, when suddenly two of
     them look to the side and shout.

<b>                         ARMED IRAQI SOLDIER

     PAN TO a shiny METAL TANKER TRUCK three hundred yards out,
     bearing down fast on the village square.

     The soldiers open fire on the truck.

<b>     INT - THE CAB OF THE TANKER TRUCK
</b>
     The Shiite riding shotgun fires back, as the windshield
     shatters on the truck. The driver is dead. The other Shiite
     grabs the wheel.

<b>     BACK TO THE SCENE
</b>
     Archie bursts out the front door, followed by Troy and Doc.
     They freeze as --

     The tanker truck careens sideways toward them, 50 feet away.

     An Iraqi soldier fires a grenade-launcher off his shoulder
     which explodes the container on the back of the truck --

     Milk explodes everywhere, gushing around the wheels of the
     Humvee and the feet of Archie and the others.

     Shiite women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs rush
     out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk. Other Shiites
     crowd the Humvee and climb in.

     Iraqi soldiers drag two bodies from the cab of the truck.
     Troy and Doc point their guns in the crowd.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               <u>Move. Out of the way.</u>

     Archie shoves Shiite peasants out of the Humvee.

<b>                         SHIITE WOMAN
</b>               Hos-pital.

     She holds a SHIRTLESS BOY of 7 with a bandage around his
     entire chest. Doc pushes her off the Humvee.

<b>                         SHIITE MAN
</b>               America help.

     He grabs Archie. Troy shoves the man off the vehicle. Vig
     starts the engine.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               <u>Give them MRE's.</u>

     Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army
     Meal Rations to the crowd -- Vig leans on the horn.

     The friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it
     starts to pull away. Archie shoves the friendly Iraqi out,
     and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing Shiites.

     Archie and Troy look back at the debacle as they pull away.

     He lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest.

     Archie runs down a narrow cement corridor, pistol held at
     arm's length, white document in the other hand; followed by
     Troy and Doc, pistols drawn.

     An IRAQI SOLDIER steps into the corridor at the far end, sees
     Archie coming, looks terrified, and runs back. Archie and
     Troy run right past the scared Iraqi. Doc comes third,
     slamming the Iraqi face down and cuffing him.

     Archie kicks a door open and goes in, followed by Troy.

     A large room; walls lined with shelves full of brand new

     A television plays a rerun of 'Happy Days' in Arabic.

     Another TV: CNN's first reports of the Rodney King beating.

     An IRAQI CAPTAIN sits in a chair in front of the TVs.

     TWO IRAQIS sit loading rifles. Two others sit at a radio.

     PAN TO Troy pointing to a narrow door in a corner of the
     room. Archie kicks it open.

<b>     INT. INNER ROOM - DAY
</b>
     A bound, naked SHIITE MAN IN GLASSES, clean shaven, sits on
     the floor in a five foot square shallow metal box, four
     inches deep, filled with water. There is an electric cable
     going into the water. The naked Shiite in glasses shakes.

     Troy watches Archie walk over and yank the cable out.

<b>                         IRAQI SARGEANT
</b>               I am just do my job, buddy.

     Archie pauses, then gives the Sargeant a backhand that sends
     him flying to the corner. Archie steps on the man's wrist,
     takes the pistol out of his hand. Troy watches.

     Archie turns and sees TEN SHIITES across the room: 3 MEN, 3
     WOMEN, 4 CHILDREN. The men and women are bound and GAGGED.

     Archie steps toward the Shiites, but the INTERROGATOR, 35,
     also a captain, steps in his way.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>               These Shiite. Iraq problem. United

</b>               We take them outside, so it don't
               bother you, OK, sir? <u>Kata fanam.</u>

     The disarmed Iraqi Sargeant NODS and opens a small rear door
     and pushes the Shiites out. Archie walks back to the main
     room and points his pistol in the Captain's face.

<b>     EXT. FRONT OF BUNKER TWO - DAY
</b>
     Vig keeps the TWO CUFFED IRAQI GUARDS on the ground at gun
     point as 15 SHIITES with crude clubs and sling shots encircle.

     One of the Shiites shoots a rock from the slingshot and nails
     a handcuffed Iraqi in the back of the head.

<b>                         VIG

     PAN TO the ten Shiites, and the naked Man with Glasses, who
     is getting dressed, exiting the side of the bunker, ushered
     by the unarmed Iraqi Sargeant.

<b>                         VIG

     Suddenly a SHIITE WOMAN runs up to the tortured Shiite Man
     with Glasses and embraces him, sobbing. A LITTLE GIRL with
     dirty casts on both broken arms runs up and hugs his legs.

     The bound Shiite prisoners start to walk away from the
     bunker, and the unarmed Sargeant has a fit.

<b>                         IRAQI SARGEANT

     shoot rocks and club him.

<b>     EXT. BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     The Shiite crowd curses and spits on the Iraqi soldiers. The
     Sargeant is beaten.

     Suddenly an Iraqi armored truck with a mounted machine gun
     races up and SEVEN IRAQI SOLDIERS pour out swinging clubs,
     followed by an IRAQI MAJOR, about 45. The Iraqi soldiers
     savagely beat the Shiites.

     Vig looks horrified as he watches.

     TWO SOLDIERS grab the Woman from the Man With Glasses, and
     drag her into a circle with three other soldiers; the ten
     year-old girl with dirty casts on both arms, screams and
     punches at them.

     The Man With Glasses is held down at knife point.

     The Iraqi Major glances over at Vig, but the soldiers do not
     stop brutalizing the Shiites -- they round up eight more
     Shiites and make them lay face down.

<b>     INT. BASEMENT
</b>
     Troy and Doc disarm TWO GUARDS outside a door in the basement.

     Archie goes through the door, followed by the Iraqi
     Interrogator and Captain.

<b>     INT. ROOM OF BUNKER 2 - DAY

     Bright white cement, many overhead lights and a high ceiling.
     <u>empty but for 15 brand new, jumbo-sized Louis Vuitton</u>
     <u>suitcases standing neatly in a row in the center of the room.</u>

     Archie stands looking at the suitcases with Troy and Doc.

     Several of the big Vuitton suitcases are laid on their sides
     by Archie, Troy and Doc.

     The Iraqi Captain paces frantically punching and kicking the
     walls and talking (SUBTITLED in ENGLISH).

<b>                         IRAQI CAPTAIN
</b>               It's Saddam's gold.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>               Shut up, he signed the treaty.

     The suitcases are quickly unzipped. One suitcase is full of
     gleaming antique silverware. One suitcase is full of jewelry.

     Archie opens one full of hundreds of gold Cartier watches.

     Troy and Doc slip a handful of jewelry into their pockets.

     The Iraqi Captain goes nuts, throwing himself on Doc's back,
     choking Doc, who flails about. Troy punches the Iraqi in the
     head and rips him off Doc.

     Archie puts his pistol in the man's face.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

               that belongs to us now, understand?

     He turns to Doc.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               Put it back.

<b>                         DOC

</b>               Stick to the plan. The plan is for
               gold.

     Doc and Troy, out of breath, empty their pockets of jewelry.

     Archie opens another Vuitton suitcase and pushes it aside -
     it's full of Kuwaiti passports.

     When Doc opens the next suitcase, he freezes. Archie looks
     over and freezes. Troy closes cuffs behind the Captain's back
     and looks over his shoulder -- wide-eyed.

     The very large Vuitton suitcase is filled with five-kilo
     bricks of gold. They all stare. Troy picks one up.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Is this five kilos?

     Archie holds another brick.

     Archie opens another large Vuitton suitcase, and it is also
     filled with sixty bars. Troy opens another suitcase, there's
     another sixty bars. Doc opens another, another sixty bars.
     They frantically check all of the suitcases. The handcuffed
     Captain is crying.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               Ten suitcases; sixty bricks each.
               That's thirty million dollars.

     Archie, Doc and Troy look at each other in shock.

     With effort, Doc and Troy help Archie pick up the heavy,
     jumbo-sized suitcase sideways, like a table top.

<b>                         TROY

     Suddenly the suitcase rips apart and gold bars fall to the
     floor; one lands on Troy's foot. He jumps in pain.

<b>     LATER
</b>
     Troy and Vig untangle, with difficulty, an ox cart from a
     messy pile of old ox carts against a bombed out building.
     Troy looks troubled --

<b>                         TROY
</b>                      (under his breath)
               'Little deuce coupe with a fiat

               Thunderbird like it's standin'
               still --'

     CLOSE UP A SHIITE MAN is smashed in the face with a club.

     CLOSE UP TROY pulls a heavy chain from the Humvee.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               'She'll do a hundred and forty

     The Little Girl with arm casts is screaming while her father,
     the Man In Glasses, tries to hold her.

     Troy and Vig quickly chain the ox cart to the Humvee.

<b>                         TROY

<b>     INT. NARROW CEMENT STAIRCASE OF BUNKER
</b>
     Archie, Doc, the Interrogator run up carrying Vuitton cases.

<b>     INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM OF BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     They hurry past the huge poster of Saddam, the TVs playing
     'Happy Days' and Rodney King, the many shelves of stereos,
     etc., and past the soldiers lying face down, handcuffed.

<b>     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY
</b>
     Archie, Doc, and the Interrogator charge out of the bunker
     with Vuitton luggage and put it onto the ox cart Troy has
     rigged. Archie and Doc stop and stare in shock --
     Soldiers 6 &amp; 7 drag and beat Shiites; 5 wounded men and women
     lie on the ground bleeding. A cuffed Iraqi Guard kneels with
     a bleeding head. Five soldiers continue to encircle someone
     (the Shiite woman). The Man In Glasses and the Little Girl
     PRAY in ARABIC as they bow on the ground.

     Troy and Vig stare back at Archie, looking tense.

     <u>The Iraqi Major greets the Interrogator warmly and they</u>
     <u>embrace.</u> Then the Major salutes Archie.

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               He certainly does.

     Shiites run past throwing rocks at Iraqi soldiers 6 &amp; 7 who
     tackle and pummel them to the ground.

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

     The Major turns and shouts --

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR
</b>               Hazal jarat finan.

     Iraqis 6 &amp; 7 jog over. The soldiers are out of breath.

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR
</b>               These man help you.

     Archie looks at one soldier's hands.

     CLOSE UP: BLOOD on the Iraqi Soldier's knuckles and wrists.

     PAN UP TO THE FACES of the Iraqi soldiers.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

<b>     INT. STAIRWELL
</b>
     Iraqi Soldiers 6 &amp; 7 carry suitcases up the narrow stairs.

<b>     EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY
</b>
     Luggage is loaded into the Humvee and the cart while Troy
     directs Iraqis 6 &amp; 7; Doc and Vig help.

<b>                         TROY

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Sure it is --

     The cart collapses from the weight into a pile of broken wood.

     The Vuitton bags roll onto the debris-cluttered ground, one
     goes through a pool of blood. Doc picks the case up.

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR
</b>               You need a truck.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               We'll rig two carts.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Let's take the truck.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               We're not taking their truck.

<b>                         TROY

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR
</b>               We cooperate with peace accord.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Let's take the truck.

     Archie looks vaguely disgusted.

     Troy backs the truck up.

     Vuitton hat cases are loaded into the back of the truck,
     which is completely full.

     Archie sits behind the wheel of the Humvee. Vig sits next to
     him. Archie starts the engine. Iraqi 6 taps on the door of
     the Humvee by way of saying goodbye. Archie nods.

     The Iraqi Major points to the Shiite Woman.

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR
</b>               Nazaran yafit haisul.

     <u>Archie watches as Iraqis 6 &amp; 7 walk directly to the circle of</u>
     <u>soldiers around the woman -- it is now clear she has been</u>
     <u>raped. They pull her from the group, they stand the Woman in</u>
     <u>an open area and shoot her dead.</u>

     Troy jerks slightly in his seat and turns away. Doc stares.

     Archie bows his head to the steering wheel and leans there
     for a second as Vig looks wide-eyed at the dead woman.

     The Girl in arm casts screams. She is grabbed by the hair and
     pulled away by an Iraqi soldier, but the Man In Glasses
     punches him and takes the girl. The soldier chases them with
     a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally.

     <u>Archie gets out of the Humvee and slams the door, walks</u>
     <u>slowly toward the Iraqi soldiers.</u>

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               This has to stop.

     The Iraqis look at him. The soldier with the knife continues
     to slash the Man In Glasses.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>               You get your ass kick in a war, it

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR
</b>               You go now, please.

     He salutes Archie.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               I don't think so. I'm sure you

<b>                         INTERROGATOR

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Archie, let's stick to the plan,

<b>                         DOC

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR
</b>               What?

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               How much gold do you want to let
               these people come with us?

     The Iraqi Major smiles. The Interrogator laughs.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>               Cannot do.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               What do you mean, cannot do? I'm
               offering you a lot of money.

     The Iraqi Major continues smiling.

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR
</b>               Cannot let Shiite go --

<b>                         INTERROGATOR

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               Are you listening? I said cover me.

     Troy and Doc stare at Archie, then Troy gets out of the
     truck, Doc gets out of the Humvee, <u>and they nervously point</u>
     <u>their pistols.</u> Troy points his gun at Iraqi 6, who has come
     forward with a rifle; Doc points at Iraqi 7, who has also
     come forward. To the rear, Iraqi 6 stands with a rifle, near
     Iraqis 2,3,4 and the Sargeant stand over the eight
     prone Shiite prisoners laying face down.

     Vig nervously sits for a moment, then jumps to his feet and
     mans the mounted machine gun in the rear of the Hummer.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               No unnecessary shots, Conrad, is
               that clear?

<b>                         VIG
</b>               Yes, sir.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               Because we know what bullets do to

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               That's right, that's what they do.

     Troy, Doc, Vig watch with trepidation as Archie walks toward
     the soldier slashing the Man In Glasses, who carries the Girl.

     Archie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling
     the blade away from the man's body. He holds the soldier's
     wrist up. The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free
     hand, but Archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting
     the Iraqi into a choke hold. The soldier drops the knife in
     the dirt.

     The bloodied Man In Glasses collapses to the ground,
     clutching the Little Girl in arm casts.

     Troy, Doc, Vig point their guns. The Iraqi Major is pissed.

     Archie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face
     down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away. Archie
     helps the Shiite Man In Glasses to his feet, takes the Girl,
     and walks them over to the Humvee.

     Two Shiite prisoners try to stand up, the Iraqi guards kick
     them back down.

<b>                         IRAQI MAJOR
</b>                      (pissed)

     The Iraqi Major raises his machine gun as he stands next to
     the Humvee, but Archie grabs the barrel and holds it down.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               No shooting.

     Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi
     soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc.

     CUT BACK TO the Major pauses, then smashes the barrel of his
     machine gun, with Archie's hand, against the Humvee.

     Archie winces, but doesn't let go. The Major does it again,
     smashing Archie's hand. Archie winces, doesn't let go. The
     Major tries to jerk the barrel up, but Archie pushes it down,
     and it fires by accident, into the Major's leg. The Major
     howls with pain. Blood dribbles out the bottom of his pants
     leg like piss.

     Troy covers Iraqi 6 with his rifle.

<b>                         TROY

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               <u>Accident. Stay cool.</u>

     Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun from one Iraqi
     in the rear to another, but doesn't shoot. Iraqi soldiers
     point their rifles at the Americans.

<b>     ANGLE ON TROY
</b>
<b>                         TROY
</b>               <u>No.</u>

     WHIP PAN TO Iraqi 6 jerks his rifle toward Archie and fires.

     The sound cuts out.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: WHIP PAN from Iraqi rifle to Archie.

     The only SOUND is the BULLET PIERCING THE FLESH of Archie's
     lower left arm and tearing his muscle as it passes through.
     Archie grimaces violently in pain.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Troy fires his pistol. NO SOUND except
     for the SLOW MOTION SOUND of the BULLET EXPLODING.

     SLOW MOTION: The bullet tears through Iraqi 6's chest.

     THE ONLY SOUND is the IRAQI'S HEARTBEAT, the bullet tearing
     flesh and crushing bone, and the heartbeat stopping with a
     VIOLENT SPLASH. Iraqi 6 falls to the ground with only a dull
     thud and the slow clank of his gear.

     REGULAR SPEED: Vig swings the mounted machine gun from one
     Iraqi to another, but still doesn't shoot. He looks terrified
     as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.

     Iraqi 7 FIRES twice.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: a bullet tears into Troy's chest with
     a DULL SNAP. He winces in pain.

     PAN TO the windshield of the Humvee shatters behind Doc; he
     turns and fires his pistol.

     PAN TO -- slightly slow motion: NO SOUND EXCEPT THE BULLET
     TEARING INTO IRAQI 7'S KNEE, smashing through bone. He falls
     to the ground clutching his leg.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Vig swings the mounted machine gun and
<b>     FIRES. NO SOUND BUT THE SLOW CRACKS OF THE RED TRACER BULLETS
</b>     EXPLODING from the gun.

     SLOW MOTION: tracer bullets slice across the face of Iraqi 5
     and Iraqi 2 in the rear, NO SOUND BUT THE BULLETS BREAKING
<b>     THROUGH BONE AND FLESH.
</b>
     SLOW MOTION: Archie jams his pistol under the Major's chin
     and FIRES -- the ONLY SOUND IS THE. SLOW EXPLOSION OF THE GUN,
     and the slow tearing of tissue, ending with a sharp SNAP as
     the tissue, bone, and the bullet CRACK out the top of the
     Iraqi Major's head.

     HIGH ANGLE LOOKING DOWN -- replay of entire shoot out at
     REGULAR SPEED. Ending on the wide-eyed Little Girl with her
     hand in her mouth, staring.

     ANOTHER ANGLE -- replay of entire shoot out at REGULAR SPEED.
     Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest.

     <u>The dead Iraqi Major lies face down in sand with eyes open;</u>
     <u>the Interrogator holds his hand and WEEPS.</u>

     Archie's lightly blood-flecked face stares down at the dead
     Major, clouds pass overhead.

     Dead Iraqi 6 lies with legs twisted under his body.

     A rivulet of blood trickles through the sand. A spider runs
     across it and gets stuck.

     LOW ANGLE up at Doc, stone still, staring straight ahead as
     clouds pass slowly above him in the sky.

     Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun back and forth.

     Troy, drenched in sweat, looks pained as he unbuttons his
     shirt: there's a gunshot in his kevlar vest. The slug drops
     out of the dent, into his hand -- he exhales.

     Iraqis 2, 3, 4, and the Sargeant, throw their hands up in
     surrender and drop their weapons.  Big Iraqi 2 walks toward
     the Humvee in surrender, and bows down.

     Archie points.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

     Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining
     Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               Doc.

     Doc follows Archie over to the three Iraqi soldiers.

<b>                         DOC

     The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy.

     Troy displays the gunshot in the Kevlar.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               <u>What if this was you not wearing</u>
               <u>Kevlar?</u>

     Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK. They turn.

     A tank rolls toward them fast, down a narrow side street,
     followed by a truck with a rocket launcher.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Great, a fucking tank. That should

<b>                         VIG

</b>               No. Let's get out of here.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               It's about fucking time.

     Troy jumps into the luggage-packed truck, starts the engine.
     Vig starts the Humvee; Archie jumps in next to Vig.

     PAN TO the eight Shiites, plus the Man In Glasses and the
     Little Girl, jam into the crowded Humvee. Doc jumps in.

     The tank approaches. The Humvee pulls away. The tank rolls in
     from the side, but the tank turret WHINES and CLICKS, stuck
     in place. An Iraqi pops out the top of the tank.

<b>                         TANK IRAQI

     tries pushing the turret. The truck with the small rocket
     launcher pulls up.

     SLOW MOTION: Doc looks straight up with the binoculars.

     SLOW MOTION: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke
     across the sky.

     REAR OF HUMVEE, SLOW MOTION: half the Shiites hunch down,
     bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their
     necks, looking straight up into the sky. They cower when
     there is an EXPLOSION above.

     PAN UP TO - REGULAR SPEED: the ROCKET EXPLODES in the sky a
     hundred yards above the Humvee -- INTO A BROWN CLOUD.

     Troy leans out the window of the moving truck and squints up
     at the brown gas cloud above as he drives fast.

     Archie and Doc grapple to put on their gas masks. Vig reaches
     around behind him for his mask as he drives.

     Archie dives from the Humvee followed by Vig, Doc, the Man In
     Glasses holding the Little Girl, the other Shiites, including
     the Two Five Year Olds. The Hummer drives ten yards, hits the
     first mine with an explosion and flies into the air --

<b>     INT. TRUCK DRIVEN BY TROY
</b>
     Flying debris smashes the windshield. Troy instinctively
     jerks the wheel and the truck flips onto its side and slides
     across the sand.

<b>     EXT. MINEFIELD
</b>
     The airborne Humvee lands on its side, hits another mine, is
     blown into the air, lands on its back, and is blown to pieces.

     Troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a
     halt inches before a mine, 30 yards behind the wrecked Humvee.

     SILENCE. A wheel on the wrecked Humvee spin in the air,
     squeaking.

     Louis Vuitton suitcases are scattered all over. One has
     opened and the gold bars are spilled around.

     Shiites stagger to their feet, some cut and bleeding, some
     limping. They cover their faces with their clothes as the
     dense brown fog descends around them.

     <u>Vig's right eye has taken shrapnel and is bloody mess -- he</u>
     <u>gropes in the sand for his glasses as blood drips down.</u>

     <u>Archie puts his gas mask on the Little Girl with arm casts.</u>
     <u>Doc takes his mask off when he sees what Archie has done and</u>
     <u>gives it to the Shiite Man in Glasses.</u>

     Doc picks up Vig's glasses and hands them to Vig, who stands,
     blinking his one good eye, while blood streams down his face.

     Vig is in shock. Doc lifts Vig's bloody hand to Vig's mouth.
     Unseen in the fog, Troy climbs out of the overturned truck.

     He picks up two Vuitton hat cases, looks up, sees the TWO
     LITTLE CHILDREN from the Humvee, running across a mine field

     He runs, hard, after the children, who are now 70 yards away,
     the Vuitton hat cases banging against his legs.

     Doc pulls a syringe from a sterile packet, is about to stick
     it into his leg when Archie grabs his hand.

     Troy chases the children through the brown fog, he drops one
     of the suitcases, catches up to the Girl and scoops her up in
     his left arm and covers her face with her coat.

     Troy drops the other Vuitton bag, catches the Boy and has
     both children under his arms like footballs -- when suddenly
     Troy is grabbed from behind with a cord around his neck -- he
     lands on his back with the two children in his arms.

<b>     TROY'S POV LOOKING UP

     the Iraqi Interrogator, wearing a gas mask, kicks Troy in the
     head. The screaming Children are torn from Troy's arms by
     Iraqi soldiers. Troy reaches for his pistol and it is ripped
     from his hand as he is dragged to an Iraqi jeep.

     Archie and Doc circle through the thick haze carrying a

     Archie spins around, drops the bag and points his pistol.

     TWO BLACK ROBED FIGURES pick up Vuitton hat cases.

     A Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared
     Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side.

     More black cloaked figures appear. There are THIRTY IN ALL.

     Archie, Doc, and Vig look disoriented, point their pistols
     around as black robes appear and lead the Shiites away.

<b>                         VIG

     The robes lead the Shiites to a 4 FOOT HIGH TUNNEL ENTRANCE
     in a mound of desert earth and disappear into it.

     Vig stands and rubs his one good eye. Doc grabs Vig by the
     arm and pulls him back toward the tunnel.

<b>                         DOC

     Doc grabs Vig.

<b>                         DOC

     Vig punches Doc in the side of the head. Doc punches Vig in
     the stomach. They fall to the ground, fighting.

     Archie searches for Troy in the brown haze.

     Two black-robed figures pull Vig off Doc and drag him to the
     tunnel. Another robed figure pulls Doc to the tunnel.

     Archie walks, looks for Troy, chokes, vomits into the sand.
     A black robed figure takes him by the arm and pulls him back
     to the tunnel, where they disappear inside.

     Chaos. People choking and vomiting. GAS LANTERNS SWING. The

     The door is slammed. Stolen blenders, radios, CDs, stacks of
     new Levis litter the floor. Troy kicks all the crap angrily
     and hundreds of cell phones tumble from a box.

     Troy looks at the pile of cell phones, picks one up, tries it
     for a dial tone, drops it, tries another, until he gets one
     that gives him a tone and dials.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               No, they're not coming.

     The Interrogator signals someone O.S. and suddenly voltage
     races through the wire, causing Troy to gnash his teeth
     together so hard they chip. He writhes in pain.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>                      (in subtitles)
               That seemed like too much volts.
               You got to build it up slow.

     A SECOND IRAQI gestures defensively at a console that is
     connected to the wire around Troy's jaw.  A THIRD IRAQI
     reaches forward and turns a dial.  The SECOND IRAQI murmurs
     defensively and turns the dial back.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR

<b>                         INTERROGATOR

<b>                         TROY

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>               Tell the truth, dudesky. Save us
               the big bummer.

     Troy starts to cry, represses it. His lip is bleeding.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>               Does it hurt?

     Troy says nothing.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>               I ask you question, bro.

<b>                         TROY

<b>                         INTERROGATOR

               that?

     Troy starts shaking slightly.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>               You blow up my home. The whole

               nice legs, too. Those legs cut off
               now.

     Emotion comes into the INTERROGATOR'S VOICE as he says this.

<b>                         TROY

     Archie pulls two of the colored footballs from the beat up
     pack. He looks at Doc as if to say "Great."

     Archie's arm is in pain as he carefully wraps a thin layer of
     light blue plastic explosive around a football, presses small
     nails sideways into the plastique and inserts a fuse in the
     end of the ball. Another ball-bomb just like it has already
     been constructed.

     His gunshot blows a hole in the Iraqi truck -- which deflates
     like a huge beach ball, circling wildly until it lies in a
     heap of collapsed camouflage canvass while 50 yards away --
     55 SHIITES flip sand-colored blankets off and stand up in the

     Archie now walks among Shiites toting old rifles. There are

     They pass through a cluttered room with six cots, down a

     The Interrogator pulls a CD from Troy's pocket and jams it
     into Troy's mouth.

</b>               This is your fahking stability, my

     The Interrogator uses the CD as a funnel to force-feed the
     crude oil into Troy's mouth as he pours it from the bucket.

<b>     EXT. RIM OF DUNE OVERLOOKING OASIS BUNKER
</b>
     Archie, Doc, Vig, stand on a sand ridge and look down on the
     Oasis bunker in the distance. Behind them are the three cars,
     Imam, and a handful of Shiite gunmen. They get into the cars.

<b>     EXT. DUNES
</b>
     An empty ridge. The Infiniti, Rolls, Mercedes shoot over it,
     arcing down toward the bunker, engines roaring.

<b>     EXT. OASIS BUNKER
</b>
     It is quiet. A Slim Jim is unwrapped as an IRAQI GUARD slowly
     raises it to his mouth, bites it, chews, and looks puzzled at
     the cars approaching in the distance.

     HIGH WIDE SHOT - looking straight down.

     The cars drive three abreast down the approach road to the
     bunker. The Infiniti is in the middle, flanked by the Rolls
     on the left and the Mercedes on the right.

<b>     INT. INFINITI
</b>
     Vig looks scared as he drives the Infiniti straight toward
     the bunker. A Shiite sits up front with him. Fifty yards from
     the bunker, Vig turns sharply and drives in circles.

<b>     EXT. BUNKER
</b>
     TWO IRAQI GUARDS, one chewing a Slim Jim, look bewildered as
     they stare at the circling Infiniti fifty yards away.

<b>     INT. MERCEDES
</b>
     Archie, with Imam in the passenger seat, two Shiites in back,
     speeds the Mercedes past the guards, around the right side,
     to the back side of the bunker, skidding across the sand.

<b>     AERIAL VIEW
</b>
     The Mercedes and the Rolls diverge around the bunker on
     either side: Rolls on the left, Mercedes on the right.

<b>     INT. ROLLS ROYCE
</b>
     Doc drives the Rolls around the left, to the bunker's rear.

<b>     EXT. BUNKER
</b>
     Iraqi soldiers fire a grenade that blows up right behind the
     Rolls as Doc skids right up to a rear entrance of the bunker,
     the grill touching the metal door. Doc parks, blockading the
     rear door shut, and, with three Shiite riflemen, jumps out.

<b>     INT. INFINITI
</b>
     A Shiite helps Vig wedge a piece of wood onto the gas pedal.
     Vig suddenly grabs his hand in PAIN. The Shiite looks at him.

</b>               Come on.

<b>     EXT. INFINITI
</b>
     Vig and the Shiite bail out of the moving Infiniti. Wads of
     plastic explosive are taped to the grill of the car as it
     speeds towards the bunker, then drifts to the side --

<b>                         VIG
</b>               Go straight, go straight --

     He jumps up and down and points, but the Infiniti goes far to
     the side of the bunker and <u>explodes</u> into some ruins. The two
     guards point their guns at Vig and the Shiite and they run
     into the desert as bullets pop around them.

<b>     EXT. RIGHT SIDE OF BUNKER
</b>
     Archie skids the Mercedes to a halt on the right side of the
     bunker, jumps out, slams the door, followed by Imam and the
     two other Shiites.

     They run toward the bunker, Archie with a wad of plastic
     explosive and nails in one hand and a cigarette lighter in
     the other. He HEARS the CHIRP of a car alarm being activated
     as he runs to the bunker.

     Imam finds a vent hole on the low facade of the bunker, pulls
     off a grill. Archie lights a fuse sticking out of the plastic
     explosive, and drops it into the vent.

<b>     INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Troy gags and spits, his front is covered in oil. The
     Interrogator raises the bucket.

</b>               Are you feeling stable enough for
               more?

     An EXPLOSION elsewhere in the bunker causes the lights to
     flicker out.

<b>     INT. BUNKER CORRIDOR
</b>
     Iraqi soldiers scurry in the darkness with flashlights. They
     go to the rear door, pile up in the dark, pushing.

<b>     EXT. REAR OF BUNKER
</b>
     The parked Rolls Royce blockades the rear door.

<b>     EXT. SIDE OF BUNKER
</b>
     Archie and Imam run back to the Mercedes, but the car is
     locked, his pistol sits inside on the front seat. A GUNSHOT
     from the bunker roof shatters the window of the Mercedes,
     setting off THE CAR ALARM.

     Archie reaches in, grabs his pistol, and bolts as a launched
     grenade blows the Mercedes.

<b>     EXT. FRONT OF BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     12 Iraqi soldiers pour out of the smoking bunker as 3 Shiite
     riflemen with Doc fire on them. Two Iraqis go down, with only
     the sound of bullets piercing their flesh.

     6 Iraqis run for it, into the desert. 2 Iraqis throw their
     hands up in surrender while 2 look ambivalent, one holds <u>a</u>
     <u>stack of new Levis.</u> Doc raises a hand to stop his Shiite
     gunmen from firing, but they fire anyway and 3 Iraqis fire
     back -- the Shiite next to Doc is hit in the face.

<b>                         DOC
</b>               Stop shooting, what's the matter

     He reaches out and holds the rifle of a Shiite. Everyone
     stops firing, slowly the Iraqis drop their guns. Doc has WET

     of the bunker. Imam takes cover on the side of the bunker
     while Shiites and Iraqis aim at each other.

     Vig approaches cautiously from the desert, HEARS AN AIRCRAFT,
     and looks up. An Iraqi helicopter comes in fast and opens
     FIRE with MACHINE GUNS --

<b>                         VIG
</b>               <u>Shit.</u>

     Vig runs toward the bunker for cover, but is cut off by
     MACHINE GUN FIRE from THE CHOPPER. Shiites FIRE rifles up at
     the chopper.

<b>     INT. IRAQI CHOPPER
</b>
     Chips of metal and plastic fly off as bullets hit the
     chopper. Arabic chatter is heard over a crackling radio.

<b>     POV - FROM INSIDE THE CHOPPER
</b>
     100 feet below -- Vig and six remaining Shiite riflemen are
     running into the desert away from the chopper.

<b>     EXT. DESERT -  DAY
</b>
     Vig and the six Shiites frantically search for cover.

     The chopper FIRES and one of the Shiites running with Vig is
     hit in the head, thrown by the force of the gunshot into Vig,
     who goes down, faking it.

     Vig lies face down, out of breath, with the dead Shiite on
     top of him while the chopper hovers above.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               Jesus God, I don't wanna get hit,
               please Jesus, watch over me --

<b>     INT. BUNKER
</b>
     It is dimly lighted by a few mounted emergency lights.

     Archie and Doc run down the empty stairs, through the big
     main room -- it is empty. Archie goes down the right side,
     kicks open a door --

     It's the bathroom full of stolen stuff and cell phones --

     Doc goes down the left side of the room -- kicks in a door --
     a room full of Benneton sweaters in all colors.

     Archie kicks in a door -- a room with shelves full of large
     snow globes, thousands of them.

     Doc kicks in a door -- a room cluttered with debris, but
     there is another door at the far side of the room. He
     approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success.

     Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency
     light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi
     torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the
     emergency light with a screwdriver --

     In flickering light -- Archie SHOOTS one Iraqi guard squarely
     in the chest, then the other -- the only SOUND IS THE GUN
     POPPING and the BULLETS TEARING into their bodies.

     Archie turns to the Interrogator, who stands next to Troy.

<b>                         INTERROGATOR
</b>               It's OK, buddy, we are just
               talking now --

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Archie shoots the Interrogator in the
     thigh. THE ONLY SOUND IS GUN SHOOTING, FLESH TEARING --

     Blood thinly splatters across Troy's face as the Interrogator
     grimaces and falls to the floor. The light flicks on a few
     beats, then off a few beats.

     Archie rips the wires from the table controls, goes to Troy,
     unhinges the wire from his jaw.

     The Interrogator writhes in pain on the ground. Archie takes
     the Interrogator's pistol, snaps open a knife, cuts the cord
     binding Troy to the chair and gives Troy the pistol.

     Troy sits, stained with oil, blood, tears. He gets up, looks
     down at the interrogator on the floor, points the pistol into
     the Interrogator's face.

     The Interrogator stares at Troy, who stares back. Archie
     watches, out of breath. Troy FIRES the gun just to the side
     of the Interrogator's face, into the ground. The Interrogator
     looks terrified, crying. Troy stares back, looks unhappy,
     lowers the gun.

     Troy and Archie look at each other for an intense moment.

<b>     INT. ANOTHER BUNKER ROOM
</b>
     Doc shoots the lock on the inner door and it finally opens.
     He looks inside and sees, in a sunken room, 50 more Shiite
     civilians huddled together. Archie rushes by with Troy.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

<b>     INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     Archie and Troy run out of the bunker --

<b>     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     The chopper hovers right there. It FIRES A GRENADE which
     EXPLODES next to Archie and Troy. They scramble back into the
     bunker.

<b>     INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     Archie and Troy run into Doc at the door, knocking him over.
     They crouch inside the door; the chopper hovers low outside.

<b>     EXT. DESERT - DAY
</b>
     Vig gropes the sand for his glasses, crawling on his hands
     and knees with the dead Shiite on his back.

</b>               They killed your families, you

     The Tough Iraqi and his partner, sweating profusely, out of
     breath, split up and head back toward the bunker.

<b>     INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY
</b>
     Archie's in great pain. He grimaces as he tightens the
     bandage around his forearm. Troy is shaking uncontrollably.
     Doc grabs Troy's shoulders firmly.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               <u>We're gonna get out of here alive,</u>

     Troy nods. Archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in
     C-4 from his small pack, and hands it to Doc.

     Archie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand.

               <u>gives you two steps out the door.</u>

     PAN ACROSS Troy and Doc listen intently.

     Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife.

     The three of them stand at the door, ready. Archie holds his
     pistol ready. Doc holds the football, Troy holds the lighter.

     Imam, lying in a ditch, is concealed on the side of the
     bunker, and aims an old rifle at the chopper.

     GUNSHOTS ring off the side of the chopper, chipping plastic.
     The chopper banks toward Vig in response.

     Vig watches the chopper turn toward him.

</b>               God help me.

     Troy flicks the lighter and with a shaking hand tries to
     light the fuse. Archie steadies Troy's hand. The fuse is lit.

</b>
     Archie FIRES his pistol as he goes out the door with Troy,
     also FIRING a pistol. Doc follows with the ball, fuse burning.
     Doc throws the ball hard at the chopper, hovering 40 feet up.

<b>     INT. CHOPPER
</b>
     The chopper turns to face the ball just as it hits the
     plexiglas window and bounces off, not exploding. The pilots
     look perplexed. The ball hits the ground and EXPLODES.

<b>     EXT. BUNKER
</b>
     Archie, Troy, Doc, stunned -- turn back to the bunker.

<b>     INT. BUNKER DOORWAY - DAY
</b>
     They run inside and take cover, catch their breath. Troy and
     Doc look terrified.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               OK.  Shorter fuse this time.

     He pulls out the second ball, cuts another fuse, affixes it.
     They wait at the door again, watching the chopper.

<b>     EXT. BUNKER
</b>
     Imam, from the side of the bunker, FIRES again, the chopper
     swivels toward him to RETURN FIRE --

<b>     INT. BUNKER

     Troy lights the second fuse. They bolt out the door, Troy and
     Archie FIRING pistols, Doc in the middle with the ball.

<b>     EXT. BUNKER
</b>
     SLOW TO FREEZE FRAME MID-STRIDE -- with just THE SOUND OF THE
     CHOPPER: Archie, Doc, Troy, three abreast, mid-stride.

     RESUME REGULAR SPEED -- Doc unleashes the football.

     PAN TO - SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- the ball hits the chopper
     broadside and THE CHOPPER EXPLODES INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: The chopper comes crashing to the
     ground in a heap of metal. The rotary spins off, whips over
     Archie, Troy, and Doc's heads and smashes into the bunker.

     Silence.

     Troy and Doc look at each other, and punch their fists
     together. Troy notices that he's wet his pants.

     Troy and Archie look at each other, smile slightly.

<b>                         VIG (O.S.)
</b>               <u>Yes. Yes. All right.</u>

     They all turn to look.

     WIDE SHOT -- Vig pops up in the desert, 150 yards away.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               <u>You made it.</u>

     Vig comes running.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               <u>I thought that was you. Yeah.</u>

     Troy smiles as he steps in the direction of Vig. Suddenly a
     RIFLE SHOT RINGS OUT, Troy jumps.

     SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Vig is hit in the collar bone, ONLY
     THE SOUND OF THE BULLET SMASHING HIS FLESH AND BONE. He is
     jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering
     toward Troy, 125 yards away.

     Troy looks stunned.

     Archie turns sharply to his right and FIRES a rifle.

     An IRAQI SOLDIER, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground
     as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire.

     Troy runs as hard as he can toward Vig.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES
</b>               <u>Cover him.</u>

     Doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie
     scans the area and directs 3 SHIITE RIFLEMEN to spread out.

     Troy runs, catches the staggering Vig in his arms and
     embraces him. Blood runs from Vig's mouth, onto Troy's
     shoulder, as Vig tries to talk.

<b>                         VIG
</b>               You made it, man --

     Troy cries as he runs with Vig in his arms.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               <u>Help him.</u>

     Doc takes Vig from Troy's arms and carefully lays him on the
     ground, cradling his head in his lap. Vig spits blood.

<b>                         VIG

     The hole in Vig's collar bone is pumping out blood. Troy puts
     his hands over it. Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to
     turns Vig's head to help him breathe.

     He runs hard across the desert toward Troy.

     Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other.

     Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great
     difficulty -- RASPING.

<b>     INT. TROY'S RIB CAGE
</b>
     His breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to
     the left side.

</b>
     looking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but
     there's NO SOUND EXCEPT TROY'S LABORED BREATHING

     The POV turns to the side -- Vig is no longer breathing.

<b>     BACK TO THE SCENE - CLOSE UP
</b>
     Troy lies on the ground, trying to breathe, eyes wide.

<b>     TROY'S POV
</b>
     Archie and Imam step into frame. Archie looks down at Troy,
     opens his waist pack, pulls out a sterile wrapped scalpel.

<b>     TROY'S POV TURNS TO THE SIDE --
</b>
     FISH EYE LENS - The Jaguar pulls up in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.

     Imam's Little Girl gets out of the passenger side, SLIGHTLY
     SLOW MOTION, NO SOUND. Imam scolds her and gesticulates,
     indicating she should be back with the others where it is
     safe. The Little Girl embraces Imam and stares down at Troy
     over her father's shoulder.

<b>     EXT. DESERT
</b>
     Troy's eyes are wide, staring up at the Girl as he has great
     difficulty breathing. Archie rolls Troy's shirt up, exposing
     Troy's chest, with the bullet wound. Archie points to a spot
     on Troy's upper chest, near the collar bone --

     Doc squeezes a small tube of brown disinfectant gel onto this
     spot -- the only sounds are the squirt of the ointment and
     Troy's breathing.

     <u>Archie looks nervous, then focussed as he brings the shiny</u>
     <u>metal scalpel down.</u> Troy is in great pain as he watches
     Archie plunge the scalpel into his upper chest. Archie twists
     the scalpel to open the incision wide --

     There is a pronounced HISSING as trapped air rushes out. Huge
     relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally.

     Regular sound FADES BACK IN, THE FIRST SOUND IS THE GIRL'S

     He tears open a short I.V. tube and plunges the I.V. into the
     scalpel hole. There is a small valve on the end of the tube,
     which he tightens.

     A GUNSHOT SOUNDS -- Archie turns and looks over --

<b>     EXT. DESERT
</b>
     FIVE SHIITE RIFLE MEN chase down and shoot, at 30 yards, the
     last Iraqi gunner in the desert.

     Troy sits up slowly and watches for a moment.

<b>     EXT. FRONT OF THE BUNKER - LATER
</b>
     Shiite women and children chant and pray around Vig's corpse
     as it lies in the open trunk of the Jaguar. Archie, Troy and
     Doc stand together watching. Troy and Doc do a muted version
     of Vig's Karate arm dance as they look down at his corpse.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               He's got no family.

     <u>Archie sadly takes Vig's big pistol from Vig's clenched hand.</u>

<b>     EXT. DESERT - LATER
</b>
     <u>Archie fills a single rusted oil drum with gold bars and</u>
     <u>tapes it shut.</u> Troy sits in a folding chair nearby. He looks
     pained and uncomfortable.

               every fifteen minutes. Release the
               valve, close it up again.

     Archie unscrews the valve on the tube in Troy's chest, and
     air hisses out. Troy looks relieved. Archie closes the valve.

<b>                         TROY

     Mobil gas station glisten in the wet palm of Archie's hand.

     Archie looks at the Three Kings in his hand.

     Troy cracks open a snow globe, filters water with a Shiite.

     Dozens of Shiites are doing the same.

     Archie passes an urn to some parched Shiites who drink the
     water thirstily. Troy, Doc do the same.

     Imam pours gasoline on a pile of Vuitton suitcases,
     Troy throws a match, the suitcases go up in a rush of fire.

<b>     EXT. DESERT - LATER
</b>
     Imam hands two gold bars to a Shiite peasant, who takes them
     and moves on. There are two long lines of Shiite peasants
     patiently waiting to get their gold, as it is handed out by
     Imam and another Shiite while, Archie, Troy, and Doc watch.
     Shiites stash their gold bars inside their clothing and bags.

<b>     LATER
</b>
     Everyone sits and waits: Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his
     daughter, 105 Shiite peasants.

     Troy looks pained, then releases the valve on the tube
     sticking through his chest bandage and there is a hiss of
     air. He looks relieved.

     There is the SOUND OF DISTANT MOTORS RUMBLING. An approaching
     convoy in the desert: six open U.S. personnel trucks, led by
     a Humvee.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, his daughter, dozens of Shiites
     watch the convoy approaching -- they hold their guns ready.

     The U.S. Military trucks and the Humvee pull up to the bunker.

     Walter stands in the front of the Humvee with Hash, both
     wearing sand goggles as they pull up -- Walter salutes.

     6 ARMY DRIVERS, among them the disillusioned infantrymen
     interviewed by Bill Smithson earlier, get out of their
     vehicles, greeted by Doc, Archie, and Imam.

     Walter walks up, carrying a medical pack.

<b>                         WALTER
</b>               Watcha doing out here, Troy?

     They bang fists in greeting.

</b>               We better get you fixed up to go
               home to the land of the brave.

<b>                         TROY
</b>               Give me that penicillin, baby.

     Doc pushes an I.V. needle into Archie's arm and tapes the
     penicillin sack to Archie's shirt.

     Bach's "Gloria" plays powerfully.

     Shiites pile into the six open trucks. The lone oil can full
     of gold is loaded, as well. Imam and his daughter are helped
     into a truck by Doc. Archie whistles loud from the front seat
     of the Humvee -- which leads the way as the convoy pulls out.

     Doc, in the back of a truck with Shiites, waves.

     Troy smiles as he sits in the back of a crowded truck with
     Imam, his daughter, and other Shiites.

     The Humvee slows to a halt.

     Archie stands in the front of the Humvee with a rifle at his

     100 yards beyond it, dozens of Iraqi tanks are lined up along
     the border, 100 feet apart, stretching into the distance
     either way. There are 50 IRAQI GROUND TROOPS standing at the
     border station, marked by razor wire on the one-lane road.

     On the far side of the border, IRANIAN SOLDIERS with RELIEF
     WORKERS wearing RED CRESCENTS wait by white school buses and
     stare at the American convoy.

<b>     EXT. IRAQI SIDE OF THE BORDER
</b>
     Archie stares at the border, thinking.

     Imam helps Troy down from the truck. Doc carries the Little
     Girl.

               through. But it's not wide enough
               for a truck.

     Archie gets out of the Humvee and looks at the border.

<b>                         ARCHIE GATES

               out of here.

     Doc turns and signals to the drivers to come up.

     Troy takes the safety off his M-16.

     5 U.S.Drivers get out with their rifles ready. They release
     the safeties. Havichon, with his leg in a cast, stays back to
     man the mounted machine gun on the Humvee. Iraqi soldiers on
     the border nervously watch the Americans and the Shiites,
     holding their machine guns.

     105 Shiites empty the trucks and gather in a crowd that walks
     toward the border. Two Shiite men carry Vig's body, wrapped
     in Arabic cloths.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, lead the crowd single file through a
     narrow opening in the razor wire. On the other side, the
     crowd spreads out and keeps walking. Archie, Troy, and Doc
     walk three abreast, 7 feet apart, rifles ready.

     Imam and Walter are behind, flanking them.

     FACES: CLOSE DOLLY - SHIITE Children, Women, Men, as they
     fearfully walk toward the border. The five U.S. Drivers flank

     Archie helps Troy as they walk three abreast with Doc.

     CHOPPERS ARE HEARD in the distance. They grow LOUDER. Imam
     turns and looks back. Archie turns around and looks.

     SIX APACHE CHOPPERS approach from the distance

     He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy
     cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others.
     The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and
     Walter look up also. Archie does not.

     Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the
     choppers as they pass overhead, loud.

     PAN UP TO Six Apaches hover over everyone's heads and land in
     the 50 yards between Archie and the border, blocking his
     path, blowing up dust.

     Archie, Troy, Doc, Imam, the Shiites turn and wince in the
     blowing sand.

     10 U.S. MILITARY POLICE jump from the landing choppers,
     followed by another TEN U.S. TROOPS with rifles.

     Iraqi soldiers watch apprehensively.

     M.P.S grab Archie, Troy, And Doc, and pull them away from
     the Shiites.

     Troy shouts over the choppers.

     U.S. soldiers push the Shiites toward the border.

     The Shiites, including two who carry Vig's body, run toward

</b>               <u>Put his cuffs in front.</u>

     He and Doc are pulled away from Troy.

     Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them,
     throwing some to the ground. Troy looks over his shoulder at
     this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is
     thrown to the ground and dragged.

<b>                         TROY

     Troy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs

     General Horn walks away as MPS stare at Troy on the ground,
     concerned.

     A US SOLDIER stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in
     his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade,
     crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the MP standing
     by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs. Troy reaches with
     difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes.

     <u>Archie looks at Troy, then up at the border.</u>

     <u>Imam and the Shiites are lined up in a firing squad. Vig's</u>
     <u>body is dropped in the sand.</u>

     An MP jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold
     bars spill to the sand.

     The General looks at the gold. Troy and Doc, held in custody,
     watch.  The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers --
     and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET.

     THE U.S. Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in
     custody -- stand and watch Archie.

<b>                         GENERAL HORN

     fires his pistol into the air.

     Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk 40 yards to the
     frozen Iraqi soldiers and the terrified Shiites.

     Archie, Troy, Doc in handcuffs with MPS, watch.

     Walter and the other U.S. Soldiers watch from afar as
     Captain Van Meter and General Horn walk into the midst of
     Iraqi soldiers.
