<br/>
<br/>o    A blac k dog sleeps on the shoulder of the highway, head
<br/>     between his paws , curled up next to the barricad e that
<br/>     separates the north and southbound lanes .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>     Traffic rumbles past him: yellow cabs , blu e polic e cruisers ,
<br/>     white limousines with tinted glass and Jersey plates .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>     We hea r the squeal of brakes. A black *65 Ford Mustang, min t
<br/>     condition, pulls onto the shoulder, ten yard s past the dog ,
<br/>     and back s up . Th e dog raises its head.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>    Two me n step out of the car.          The driver , MONT Y BROGAN, mid -
<br/>    twenties , is pale-skinned in          the flickering light . A small
<br/>    silver crucifix hangs from a           silver chain around his neck ;
<br/>    his fingers are adorned with           silver rings .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>    The passenger , KOSTYA NOVOTNY, a hulking ma n in his late
<br/>    thirties , blow s his nose in his handkerchief.
<br/>    It's a cold night . Monty wears a camel's hai r overcoat,
<br/>    Kostya an old blue Soviet Navy coat .

<br/>
<br/>    The dog continues to stare at them impassively, his face lit
<br/>    by the passing headlights. The pavement by hi s paws is

<br/>            They just left him here to die. They
<br/>            threw him out the window and kept
<br/>            driving.
<br/> A ship's horn sounds from the Hudson.

<br/></b>
<br/>           They're used to waiting.
<br/>Monty squats near the dog and inspects him. From this angle
<br/>it is clear that the pit bull has been badly abused. One ear
<br/>has been chewed to mince; his hide is scored with cigarette
<br/>burns; flies crawl in his bloodied fur.
<br/>

<br/></b>
<br/>           I think maybe his hip --
<br/>The dog pounces, jaws snapping,; lunging for Monty's face.
<br/>Monty stumbles backwards. The dog, too badly injured to
<br/>continue the attack, remains in his crouch, growling.
<br/>Monty sits on the pavement, shaking his head.
<br/>
<br/><b>                     MONTY (CONT'D)

<br/>Monty is not listening. He walks back to his car, opens the
<br/>trunk, pulls out a soiled green army blanket.
<br/>Kostya holds up his hands: stop.

<br/>Monty, carrying the army blanket, walks back toward the dog.

<br/>The dog has slumped back to the pavement. His breath, comes in.
<br/>shorts rasps and wheezes. But he never takes his eyes off the
<br/>two men.
<br/>

<br/> Kostya stares at his friend in disbelief. He looks down. A
<br/> crumpled soda can lies by his feet. He kicks the can.
<br/> The dog's head pivots to follow the aluminum flash.
<br/> Monty hurls the blanket over the dog and spring forward,
<br/> wrapping his arms around the dog's midsection. The dog
<br/> growls, bites the wool, tries to break the blanket's neck.
<br/> Monty lurches toward the Mustang, struggling to retain his
<br/> bearhug while the pit bull slithers in his grasp. As they
<br/> stumble closer to the car the dog releases the blanket and
<br/> snaps at Monty's throat.
<br/>Monty hurls the dog into the trunk and slams the lid. He
<br/>returns to the driver's seat.
<br/>Kostya watches him in silence, stares at the sky for a few
<br/>seconds, finally gets back in the car. The dog thrashes in
<br/>the trunk.

<br/>Both men sit in silence as Monty revs the engine. Blood is
<br/>beginning to leak from a bite on the right side of Monty's

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>             Monty nods but doesn't say anything. He's studying the view.
<br/>             He stares at the green river, the steel bridges , the red
<br/>             tugboats, the stone lighthouse of Roosevelt Island.

<br/>Monty and Doyle watch the man go; they begin walking in the
<br/>opposite direction. They pass the concrete chessboards, the
<br/>sandboxes, and pause for a moment by a basketball court.
<br/>Six TEENS play -- with little skill -- one last game before
<br/>school. Monty shakes his head disdainfully, watching one

<br/>Monty looks up at the old private school, tucked away on a
<br/>leafy street on the Upper East Side.
<br/>Two TENTH GRADE GIRLS look at Monty as they pass by. People
<br/>are always looking at Monty.
<br/>Both girls take long final drags on their cigarettes before
<br/>crushing them out and entering the school.

<br/>Monty walks down a corridor of the school building, Doyle
<br/>padding along beside him. STUDENTS, hurrying to their
<br/>classes, stare at the dog and then at Monty.
<br/>The bells ring and within moments the corridor is empty.
<br/>Monty stops before a row of framed photographs. He examines
<br/>one photograph and smiles.

<br/><b>     INT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER CLASSROOM
<br/></b>
<br/>     JAKOB ELINSKY stands at the blackboard, facing three rows of
<br/>     uninspired teenage faces. He wears a tweed jacket that seems
<br/>     a few sizes too large, with chalk stains on the sleeves.
<br/>     Jakob is the same age as Monty but he seems younger. There is
<br/>     something adolescent in his slouch, in the way he chews his
<br/>     lip.
<br/>    One of his students, MARY D'ANNUNZIO (17), stands at her
<br/>    desk, reading from a poetry textbook. Her eyes drown in pools
<br/>    of painted shadow, her hair is dyed black, tattooed roses
<br/>    garland her wrist.

<br/>                     Through the iron gates of life."
<br/>    Jakob watches her. We don't know the Campbell-Sawyer dress
<br/>    code, but we can guess that she's violating it . We can also
<br/>    guess that Jakob is watching her a little too avidly.
<br/>    Her pierced navel is visible below her Donnas tee-shirt.

<br/>       Vince Miskella writes a story about his
<br/>       grandmother dying and you give him an A?
<br/>       What is that, a charity A? Everyone's
<br/>       always writing about their grandmother
<br/>       dying. You know why? Not because it's so
<br/>       traumatic. Because it's a guaranteed A.
<br/>       And you're all sentimental, like, "Oh,
<br/>       Vince, that was very powerful, very
<br/>       moving." No it wasn't. You didn't care, I
<br/>       didn't care, nobody cared. That's what
<br/>       grandmothers do, they die.

<br/>A four-story walk-up on a quiet street in Yorkville.
<br/>NATURELLE ROSARIO sits on the stoop steps, reading a book.
<br/>Naturelle, in her early twenties, has the lean body of a
<br/>runner. It's cold outside but she doesn't seem to mind. When

<br/><b>      INT. MONTY'S APARTMENT
<br/></b>
<br/>     Monty closes the apartment door behind Naturelle and Doyle,
<br/>     then locks it. There are five locks and a heavy steel
<br/>     deadbolt.
<br/>     Despite the ominous security, it's a nice one-bedroom
<br/>     apartment, with hardwood floors and tall windows facing the
<br/>     brownstones across the street.
<br/>     Black-and-white photographs line the walls: shots of the
<br/>     Manhattan skyline, of Bensonhurst, of Doyle. The largest
<br/>     photo, hanging above the sofa, is of Brogan's Bar.
<br/>     Doyle curls up next to the radiator and quickly falls asleep.
<br/>     Monty sits on the sofa and flicks on the television with the
<br/>     remote.

<br/>     Naturelle comes out of the kitchen carrying a jar of honey
<br/>     and a spoon.
<br/>     She hands the jar to Monty, who opens it for her. She sits

<br/>    from the back of his belt. A "B" for Brogan is tooled into
<br/>    the leather, stylized like the old Brooklyn Dodgers' logo.
<br/>    A .40 caliber automatic, squat and black, rests in the
<br/>    holster. Monty drops the holster onto the coffee table and

<br/>The snow is falling faster. We watch the flakes spin through
<br/>a yellow cone of streetlight.
<br/>We see the bar from the street.. The name "Brogan's Bar &amp;
<br/>Grill" is written in gold script on the storefront window.
<br/>From the outside it looks like any other Bensonhurst bar,
<br/>neon beer signs hanging in the window.

<br/>On the inside, though, it's clear that attention has been

<br/>RUTH (60), a waitress with a face like a crumpled pape r bag,

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>     UNCLE BLUE, SENKA VALGHOBEK, and VICTOR GEDNY sit on the
<br/>     private balcony that overlooks the restaurant's mai n room.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>     The place is furnished in classic Outer Borough Greek
<br/>     fashion: whitewashed walls , clay-tiled floors, poster s of the
<br/>     Parthenon at dawn and Santorini at sunset.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>    Uncle Blue owns the place . He's a fierce-looking ma n with a
<br/>    thick black beard, powerful hands, and no tolerance for
<br/>    incompetence. It's hard to determine his age -- anywhere from
<br/>    forty to sixty.
<br/>    Valghobek, his lieutenant, looks at first glance like an
<br/>    overweight suburban dad. But on closer inspection there is
<br/>    something absolutely mirthless in his smile, a meannes s
<br/>    around his eyes. He's in his late forties.
<br/>    Gedny, mid-thirties, Uncle Blue's lawyer, wears a shiny suit,
<br/>    a gold bracelet, and a deep , artificial-looking tan .
<br/>    Gedny busily eats his shrimp and feta while the other two
<br/>    watch him. Gedny gestures toward the windows.

<br/>        Monty leads Jakob and Mary into the VIP room. Naturelle is
<br/>        already there, speaking with Slattery.
<br/>        The walls of the VIP room are covered with crushed red
<br/>        velvet. The couches are upholstered in red velvet, the small
<br/>        bar in the corner is draped with red velvet, the carpet is
<br/>        red faux velvet.
<br/>----^   DJ Dusk's music pours from speakers bolted into the corners.

<br/>        His beats are impossible to sit still for, incorporating
<br/>        elements of bossa nova, techno, hip hop, and jazz.
<br/>        Slattery has a hard time keeping his eyes off Naturelle. His
<br/>        gaze tends to slide her way, and his desire for her is
<br/>        apparent to everyone.
<br/>        Naturelle smiles when she sees Monty and goes to him. She

<br/>        When she realizes he's not returning the hug, she quickly
<br/>        releases him. He's watching her carefully. She sees Jakob and
<br/>        smiles at him.

<br/>         Doyle's the toughest guy I know. He was
<br/>         lying there off the highway when I found
<br/>         him, waiting to die. He knew he was going
<br/>         to die. And he didn't make a sound. The
<br/>         best thing I ever did, my whole life, was
<br/>         rescue that black little son-of-a-bitch.
<br/>         Every day he's had since then is because
<br/>         of me . Every time he runs through the
<br/>         park, that's me . Every bone he chews --
<br/>         because of me . I saved him.

<br/> Both girls wear the uniform of their private school: white

<br/>equally aged, sits with one of the little girls on her lap.

<br/><b>                     MR. BROGAN (V.O.)
<br/></b>
<br/>          And maybe one day, years from now, long
<br/>          after I'm dead and gone, you gather your
<br/>          whole family together and you tell them
<br/>          the truth. Who you are and where you came
<br/>          from.
<br/>As Monty speaks his children exchange glances. They can't
<br/>really believe what they're hearing, but they know their
<br/>father is telling the truth.
<br/>
<br/><b>                    MR. BROGAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
<br/></b>
<br/>          You tell them the whole thing. And then
<br/>          you ask them if they know how lucky they
<br/>          are to be there.
<br/>Monty looks at his family. He is awed by their existence, by
<br/>the life he has created. He looks at Naturelle, still
<br/>beautiful in old age, and she smiles back at him.

<br/><b>                    OLD MONTY
<br/></b>
<br/>          It all came so close to never happening.
<br/>
<br/><b>INT. MR. BROGAN'S HONDA -- MORNING
<br/></b>
<br/>The sun shines through the windshield. Monty sleeps, his
<br/>battered head resting against the window below his frost-
<br/>spelt name: M-O-N-T-Y.
<br/>
<br/><b>                     OLD MONTY (V.O.)
<br/></b>
<br/>          This life came so close to never
<br/>          happening.
