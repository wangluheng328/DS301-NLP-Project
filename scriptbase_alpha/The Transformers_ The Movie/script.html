<b>EXT. SPACE
</b>
A small planet glows in the light of its sun. Suddenly, we
hear a loud rumble, and see a thick, electronic mist behind
the planet... Then, the electronic mist begins to engulf the
planet, and we hear the horrible sounds of destruction.
Almost like somebody, or something, is eating it.

<b>                                                   PUSH DOWN TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. THE NEAR SIDE OF THE PLANET'S SURFACE
</b>
Strange robotic creatures scramble around the planet in a
wild panic. It looks like Pompeii must have looked as
Vesuvius erupted.

<b>ANGLE ON ONE OF THE CREATURES - TRACKING
</b>
The creature is KRANIX. We will meet him later on in a very
different context, but for now, he is running from the ever-
growing mist that threatens to engulf him.

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE - THE PANIC
</b>
As Kranix runs, another creature, ARBLUS, calls to him.

<b>                       ARBLUS
</b>             Transform and flee, Kranix! You must
             warn all you meet of the horror of
             Unicron! Suddenly, the pitiful creature
             is surrounded by the strange energy cloud
             and it looks like his body has
             simultaneously caught fire and been
             doused with acid.

<b>                        KRANIX
</b>             Arblus!   No!

<b>ANGLE ON KRANIX
</b>
The mist threatens to engulf him too. He transforms into a
small rocket ship and...

<b>TRACK WITH KRANIX AS...
</b>
He takes off. As we rise higher and higher in the atmosphere,
we see the horror wrought by the hideous and still mysterious
Unicron. The planet cracks like an egg and rivers of lava
leak out. The energy cloud surrounds it and... Dissolves
everything... ... And when the smoke clears, we get our
first look at Unicron. It is horrifying. A massive, metal orb
with a gaping maw and a field of electricity.

<b>                                                    (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
PAN FORWARD to SHOW that this hideous planet is on a direct
collision course with...

<b>MOONS ORBITING CYBERTRON IN DEEP SPACE
</b>
There are TWO MECHANISTIC MOONS orbiting the huge planet
Cybertron. But we are most concerned with a small, greenish
metal one.

<b>                    NARRATOR
</b>          It is the year 2005. The treacherous
          Decepticons have conquered the Autobots'
          home planet of Cybertron. But from
          secret staging grounds on two of
          Cybertron's moons the valiant Autobots
          prepare to retake their homeland.

<b>CLOSER ON GREEN MOON
</b>
At first, we see nothing unusual or suspicious. Then,
pulling closer, we see that the top of the moon is covered
with moon camouflage "netting" and underneath it is a huge
cache of futuristic weapons. This is the Autobot staging
ground for an assault on Cybertron. DOLLY THROUGH THE COMPLEX
until we arrive at a Command Center where several Autobots
peer into monitors, running constant surveillance on
Cybertron.

<b>ANGLE ON IRONHIDE
</b>
He peers into a monitor. As he speaks, we see the monitor
PAN to an area where a huge Decepticon Symbol is emblazoned
on Cybertron.

<b>                    IRONHIDE
</b>          Every time I look into this thing, my
          circuits sizzle. I'm tired of this
          waiting game, Prime. When are we gonna
          start bustin' Deceptichops?

<b>ANGLE ON OPTIMUS PRIME
</b>
He stands over a holographic map which shows various invasion
plans for Cybertron.

<b>                    OPTIMUS PRIME
</b>          We still don't have enough Energon cubes
          to power a full scale assault, Ironhide.

<b>                    IRONHIDE
</b>          Then let me make another run to Autobot
          City on Earth. I'll bring you back more
          cubes than you'll know what to do with.
<b>
</b><b>                                                              3.
</b>


<b>ANGLE ON PRIME
</b>
He solemnly hands down an order

<b>                     PRIME
</b>           Alright, ready the shuttle for launch.

<b>ANGLE ON IRONHIDE
</b>
He raises a fist in a warwhoop!

<b>                     IRONHIDE
</b><b>           YAHOO!
</b>               (looking into monitor)
           Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps.

<b>A SMALL MOON "MOUNTAIN"
</b>
Ironhide transforms and Races toward a mountain, which stands
about a half mile from the secret Autobot facility.

<b>                       OPTIMUS PRIME (V.O.)
</b>           Jazz,    report security status.

<b>COMMAND CENTER - ANGLE ON THE CONSOLES
</b>
<b>                     JAZZ
</b>           No sign of Decepticons in this sector,
           Prime.

<b>                     PRIME
</b>           What about Moon Base 2?

<b>                     JAZZ
</b>           Jazz to Moon Base 2.

PAN UP   and through the sky to -

<b>                      ANOTHER MOON
</b>           This is the second moon. It is much
           closer to Cybertron than the first one.
           This is where Bumblebee and Spike are
           stationed.

<b>                     JAZZ (V.O.)
</b>           Jazz to Moon Base 2.

<b>ANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE AND SPIKE
</b>
They stand together a communication console. Spike is now
35 years old. Bumblebee looks as he has always looked, save
for a couple of funny bumper stickers on his tail: I (heart)
Cybertron. I (club) Decepticons.

<b>                                                     (CONTINUED)

</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>

<b>                        BUMBLEBEE
</b>              Bumblebee and Spike here.

<b>                        JAZZ (V.O.)
</b>              We're about to send up the bird. Any
              Decepticon shenanigans in your sector?

<b>                        BUMBLEBEE
</b>              All clear, Jazz.
                  (pause)

<b>                          SPIKE
</b>              Hey,   Ironhide, tell my son, Daniel, I
              miss   him, and tell him I'll be coming
              home   as soon as we've kicked Megatron's
              tail   across the galaxy.

<b>                                                              CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE SHUTTLE
</b>
Ironhide and Prowl sit at the controls, running a series of
pre-launch tests.

<b>                        IRONHIDE
</b>              Will do, Spike.

<b>ANGLE ON PRIME, CLIFFJUMPER, AND THE OTHERS
</b>
Standing at the Command Center, watching:

<b>                        PRIME
</b>              Commence countdown, Cliffjumper.

<b>                        CLIFFJUMPER
</b>              Five...Four...Three...Two...

<b>THE   LUNAR    "MOUNTAIN"
</b>
Suddenly, smoke starts pouring out of the mountain.

<b>                          CLIFFJUMPER
</b>              One....

Then, the "mountain" which must be made of paper mache or
something blows away revealing -- The shuttle!

<b>                          CLIFFJUMPER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>              Liftoff.

Suddenly, the shuttle rips out of the ground in a ball of
fire.


<b>                                                          (CONTINUED)
</b><b>
</b><b>                                                                5.
</b><b>CONTINUED:
</b>
As it takes off, we realize this isn't any dinky shuttle, but
a massive ship, capable of carrying all the energon needed
to fight a war and an army to boot. The screen is bathed in
smoke and fire which slowly clears.

<b>ANGLE ON PRIME
</b>
As he watches the shuttle shoot into the distance.

<b>                       PRIME
</b>             Now, all we need is a little Energon and
             a lot of luck.

<b>ANGLE BEHIND PRIME
</b>
We see a bank of computers. Suddenly, a small tape deck pops
open... a cassette pops out and transforms into...
...Laserbeak who flies away unseen.

<b>                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. SPACE    - LATER
</b>
The shuttle    hurtles though a massive asteroid field.

<b>                       PROWL (V.O.)
</b>             Slow down, Ironhide. We want to get to
             Autobot city in one piece.

<b>                                                           CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. THE SHUTTLE
</b>
Ironhide is at the controls.

<b>                        IRONHIDE
</b>             If I can dodge Dececpticon rays, I can
             sure as shootin' dodge a couple of
             asteroids.

Suddenly, there is a terrible BANG! on the side of the ship,
and the two Autobots are thrown from their seats.

<b>                       PROWL
</b>             You were saying?

<b>                       IRONHIDE (IRKED)
</b>             That wasn't an asteroid. There is a blast
             of light and they turn to see...
<b>
</b><b>                                                               6.
</b>


<b>ANGLE ON THE SHIP
</b>
The most powerful laser light anybody has ever seen cuts a
gaping hole in the side of the ship... Then, when the light
clears, a panel of the ship falls in and we see -

<b>MEGATRON!
</b>
In all his glory.

<b>                      MEGATRON
</b>            Die Autobots!

Then, he transforms to Gun Mode, spins into STARSCREAM'S arms
and Starscream fires.

<b>                      BRAWN
</b>            is cut in half by Megatron's blast.

<b>                      ON PROWL
</b>            as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN.

<b>                      THE INSECTICONS
</b>            ...eat away at the hole in the shuttle to
            make way for... ...an ARMY of other
            Decepticons including Laserbeak who
            enter, firing.

<b>IRONHIDE AND RATCHET

As they enter the now empty ship, a number of Decepticons
flood past them, taking positions and searching for other
living Autobots.

</b>            This was almost too easy, Starscream.

<b>                       STARSCREAM
</b>            Much easier, oh mighty Megatron, than
            attacking the real threat: the Autobots

<b>ANOTHER ANGLE - ON AUTOBOT CITY
</b>
FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the
perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant
Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD
also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about.
(DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy
project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit
every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered
with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks
pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions
of volts. Near all of these various things are energon
compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN
THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel
truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this
energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then
convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot
City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of
Autobot City is to harvest energy. All the while, Hot Rod and
Daniel are riding recklessly out from the Autobot City and up
into neighboring hills for an overview of the -

<b>CIRCULAR LANDING AREA
</b>
which resides within the "bowl" created by the City structure
and natural surroundings.

<b>TIGHTEN SHOT ON ULTRA MAGNUS AND OPTIMUS PRIME
</b>
A distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand
and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest. Then,
pressing a button on Prime's chest, a small, secret doorway
opens, and we see something extremely bright glowing in
there. Ultra Magnus, nearly blinded by the intense light,
reaches in, and lifts out --

<b>THE AUTOBOT LEADERSHIP MATRIX,
</b>
-- and holds it for a moment in his hand.

The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal,
seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the
shot. Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest,
closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary,
and extremely powerful glow from his eyes.

She starts helping him into the exo-suit.

          over his body like a grid-work metal
          "cage."

Daniel clips "cage" of Exo-Suit shut and stands up inside the
gridwork which makes him taller and broader. He moves
awkwardly, barely able to advance a step

</b>          Don't fight it Dan-O.

He suddenly starts moving rapidly backwards, then sideways,
then forward, then he starts dancing rapidly, then bounces
off walls... ..spinning upside down, then flips over several
times and lands in a splatter, legs spread, arms this way and
that - amused, startled and unhurt.

He suddenly flips around twice in mid-air then regains his
feet and leans way over against Arcee for support. She laughs
and pats his shoulder

They stand at the gate, looking more like kids showing up at

He is about to pounce on Slag when a massive tree, which is
actually more like a sword, suddenly is spring and arcs
toward him. The machete like blade strikes the ground,
between Grimlock and Slag narrowly missing them. He turns
and sees the thing stocking in the ground.

<b>                    GRIMLOCK
</b>          Me, Grimlock think trees here are cheap

</b>          Like your head! (laughs at own joke)
          Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him

Sharkticon teeth, packs a three bladed laser knife and a
special SLING which hurls FIRE STONES. He fears nothing,

vehicle, and the vehicle will transform to become the driver.
They are gibbering, singing almost a wild kind of junk-rock,
war-cry song which, like their language, is constructed of
bits and pieces of the museum junk of our culture - a
humorous aggressive song which makes a surreal kind of sense.

welding things... ...screwing things together... ... and
kicking control panels to make them work...

<b>EXT. SPACE
</b>
Both halves of the Junkion ship act as independent space
ships.

<b>EXT THE SPACE BATTLE
</b>
As the Quintesson ship shoots toward Unicron's face.

<b>                    THE CRUISER
</b>          Is suddenly struck by a ray from
          Unicron's eye, and half of it is knocked
          off.

<b>INT THE CRUISER
</b>
Lights go off, and the Autobots are thrown around like toys.

<b>ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN
</b>
They are heading right to Unicron's eye.

<b>ANGLE ON UNICRON AND THE CRUISER
</b>
Unicron swipes at the cruiser, but misses. The Cruiser
crashes right through Unicron's eye like a corkscrew!

<b>                    UNICRON (V.O.)
</b>          Graaaaaaaaaaa!

<b>INT. UNICRON'S HEAD - SAME TIME
</b>
The cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through
several electrical membranes that are, in fact, Unicron's
brain.

<b>ANGLE ON THE SHIP
</b>
As the ship tumbles through, it dumps off the various
Autobots like rubbish and disintegrates.

<b>ANGLE ON HOT ROD
</b>
He tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit (which we
can assume is a robotic sinus or something)

<b>EXT. THE BRAIN AREA
</b>
Kup, Springer, Daniel and Arcee are scattered about the floor
in the giant, flickering chamber.

<b>                    DANIEL

</b>
Hot Rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of
miscellaneous junk.

<b>ON HOT ROD
</b>
He slowly gets up and looks around the chamber.

<b>WHAT HE SEES
</b>
Pan as Hot Rod looks over various different bits of junk,
until he sees the glowing shape of the Autobot Matrix
apparently suspended in mid air.

<b>                       HOT ROD
</b>             The Autobot Matrix!

Then, suddenly two red, burning eyes light up above the
matrix, and we see the hideous form of Galvatron.

<b>                       GALVATRON
</b>             It will do you no good, Autobot.   It
             cannot be opened.

He stands up and walks towards Galvatron.

<b>ANGLE ON GALVATRON AND HOT ROD
</b>
Galvatron takes a shot at Hot Rod. ... Hot Rod dives away, as
electricity seems to flash everywhere.

</b>          He peers into the gloom.

Daniel    rips through what seem to be endless caves on the
torrent    of liquid, until he is dumped down a high waterfall
into...    .... A glowing lake. ... He stays under for a
moment,    and then bobs up to see...

<b>                       UNICRON'S STOMACH
</b>             This is the central processing area for
             Unicron's "food" and "energy." A long
             conveyer belt drops junk into a clear,
             bubbling vat, where it is separated into
             raw material and energy. The energy,
             which comes out in raw form, goes into a
             machine and is crunched into energon
             cubes, while the solid material, is
             separated into it's component metals and
             plastics, formed into ingots and sent
             elsewhere in an assembly line fashion.

<b>                    JAZZ
</b>          Let's burn rubber!

<b>ANGLE ON THE TUNNEL
</b>
They transform. The humans jump in.

<b>THE CHASE - TRACKING
</b>
They race up the tunnel, one step ahead    of Unicron's hand
which shoots after them, pulling apart    what we know must be
pieces of his brain... Then, they reach    what seems like a
dead end. In fact, it is the back side     of Unicron's good
eye. The hand comes in after them!

<b>ANGLE DOWN THE CORRIDOR
</b>
An unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the
Autobots. When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus
Prime.

<b>                    KUP
</b>          I knew you had potential, lad!

<b>ANGLE ON RODIMUS PRIME
</b>
<b>                    RODIMUS PRIME
</b>          Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus
          Prime transforms into truck mode as the
          other Autobots also transform. Daniel
          and Spike jump into him. Then, in a
          continuous line, he shoots off, the other
          Autobots racing behind him.

<b>                                                      SMASH CUT:
</b>
<b>EXT. UNICRON
</b>
Rodimus Prime shoots out the second eye...    Followed by the
others.

<b>ANGLE ON UNICRON
</b>
An arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence
spreads throughout the body, blowing circuits. Suddenly,
Unicron lets out a loud agonized ROAR. SPARKS seem to shoot
out of every part of his body. Then, he spins in space like
some kind of a fireworks display, shooting off sparks. And
then...
<b>
</b><b>                                                         110.
</b>


<b>BANG!
</b>
We get the big visual explosion.

<b>                                                 DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>EXT. SPACE - MUCH LATER
</b>
Unicron's head orbits Cybertron. PAN to Cybertron where and
PUSH IN on Rodimus Prime, Arcee, Kup, Springer, Ultra Magnus,
Wreck-Gar, Daniel, Perceptor, Blaster and Spike watch
construction being done on Cybertron below.

<b>                    RODIMUS PRIME
</b>          Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian
          wars as we move forward to a new age of
          peace and happiness....

<b>                    ALL
</b>          Until all are one!
