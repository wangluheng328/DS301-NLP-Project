This theatrical movie based on the television series (which was based, in turn, on a popular multiform robot toyline) didn't go over very well at the box office.
The movie is set in 2005, twenty years after the television series, and chronicles the efforts of the heroic Autobots to defend their homeworld Cybertron from the evil Decepticons.
Both factions are seething with anger, and that hatred has blinded them to a hideous menace headed their way.
That menace is Unicron, a huge robotic creature so powerful, he devours planets such as Cybertron.
