In 1999, in Nebraska, the police officer Kathryn Bolkovac sees the chance to raise money to be close to her teenage daughter, who lives with her father in another state, with the temporary assignment serving as U.N. peacemaker in Bosnia.
The idealistic Kathryn believes that she can make the difference in a country devastated by the war, and she works hard and is promoted to director of her department.
But soon she discloses a corruption and human trafficking ring with the direct participation of contractors and diplomats that have diplomatic immunity and she does not know who is reliable.
