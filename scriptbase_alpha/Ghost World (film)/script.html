<b>               OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE - EVENING
</b>
               We MOVE through the city in a series of brief shots that 
               define and establish our setting, from commercial district 
               to residential neighborhood. Eventually we find ourselves 
               moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many 
               of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT. 
               As we track past at window-level we see:

               A glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER 
               runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays..

               An empty room...

               A large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts, 
               watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed 
               potatoes with his fingers...

               A dazed old woman staring out the window.

               The silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself.

               We enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the 
               THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production 
               number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of 
               clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted 
               back as she dances along to the video while trying on a 
<b>               GRADUATION CAP AND GOWN.
</b>
<b>               EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION - AFTERNOON NEXT DAY.
</b>
               A modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner 
               with a "Coca Cola" logo reads: "GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM."

<b>               INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAY
</b>
               A graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland 
               faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first, 
               we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her 
               head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh.

               She makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is 
               also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an 
               elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices.

<b>                                     SPEAKER
</b>                         High school is like the training 
                         wheels for the bicycle of real life.  
                         It is a time for young people to 
                         explore different fields of interest 
                         and to hopefully grow from their 
                         experiences.  After all, that which 
                         we learn from our mistakes can be as 
                         valuable as what we learn from our 
                         textbooks, and often we can turn the 
                         negative experiences that are common 
                         to all high-schoolers into positive 
                         steps toward personal growth and 
                         achievement. In coming to terms with 
                         my own personal setback, which I'm 
                         sure you've all heard about, I've 
                         been able to learn a lot about myself. 
                         I've learned for one thing that I 
                         don't need to rely on drugs and 
                         alcohol
<b>                              (APPLAUSE)
</b>                         and that I'm very lucky-that more 
                         people besides Carrie and myself 
                         weren't hurt in the accident; I've 
                         learned that I'm blessed with 
                         wonderful parents, teachers and above 
                         all the best classmates in the world -- 
                         I love each and every one of you 
                         guys!!
<b>                              (APPLAUSE)
</b>                         and I've learned that to get through 
                         life's obstacles you need faith, 
                         hope and, most of all, a sense of 
                         humor.

               A trio of TEENAGE GIRLS (one white, one Asian, one black) 
               come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping. 
               The audience loves them.

               The auditorium door opens and GRADUATES emerge. Enid &amp; Rebecca 
               run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up 
               diplomas. They run toward the school playground, nearly 
               bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release.

               Enid stops and looks back at the school. She gives it THE 
               FINGER. They sit on a see-saw, out of breath.

               Todd, forgotten, walks away. The singer wails a sappy, maudlin 
               ballad. Enid spots DENNIS, the class loser, wandering around

               Seymour sits down and looks around. Weird Al brings a menu.

               Rebecca turns around and pretends to look past Seymour.

               It's now 1:30 PM. His date is 30 MINUTES LATE. Seymour gets 
               up and walks sadly towards the cashier (Weird Al).

               Enid goes back to the table to leave a tip, two dollars. Al 
               passes behind her.

               Enid hesitates, overcome with guilt. She glances back at Al, 
               then digs every penny out of her pocket (about seven dollars 
               in coins and wadded up bills) and adds it to his tip.

               The trio drive in silence. Suddenly, an extra-wide pick-up 
               vrooms past Josh, cutting off the driver (SEYMOUR) next to 
               him. SEYMOUR bobs violently as he screams silent obscenities.

               FULL SCREEN: grainy B&amp;W video footage. The CAMERA travels up 
               a shadowy flight of stairs. We hear FOOTSTEPS, a rhythmic 
               POUNDING, and a deranged CHILDREN'S CHOIR ("LALALALALALA").

               The CAMERA reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that 
               slowly CREAKS open. We move into the room beyond, it's 
               decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix. We 
               HEAR a televangelist's sermon. We MOVE CLOSE on a little 
               girl's doll. Very slowly a MAN'S HAND reaches for the doll 
               and drags it into the shadows. The hand throws the now 
               mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around.

               We see grainy footage (shot off of TV) of Christians angrily 
               picketing an abortion clinic. CREDITS come up: THE END.  A

               There are about a dozen students, mostly pimply 14-year-old 
               boys, a few 14-ish girls, and Enid, dressed in schoolgirl 
               outfit. The teacher, ROBERTA ALLSWORTH, addresses the class.

</b>                         That piece is entitled 
                         "Mirror/Father/Mirror." I like to 
                         show it to people I'm meeting for 
                         the first time because it says so 
                         much about who I am and what it feels 
                         like to inhabit my specific skin.  
                         And this is exactly what I'm hoping 
                         to get from each of you over the 
                         course of this Summer: a picture of 
                         your own self-exploration. My own 
                         background is in video and performance 
                         art, but I'm hoping that doesn't 
                         influence you and that you'll find 
                         your own ways of externalizing the 
                         internal. At the end of the Summer, 
                         this class has been invited, along 
                         with several others in the area, to 
                         participate in a show of High-School 
                         art at the Neighborhood Activity 
                         Center. The title of the show will 
                         be "Brotherhood and Community: Art 
                         as Dialogue." I think the 
                         "Brotherhood" theme ties in nicely 
                         with the theme of self-discovery 
                         that I'd like to emphasize in this 
                         class. Are there any questions so

                              from TV)
                         It's a mongoose.

                         never heard of a mongoose?  That's a 
                         classic piece of vintage taxidermy. 
                         Nobody alive today knows how to do 
                         work like that.

                         that for the time being.

               Joe shuts off the TV. He turns to the girls, not wanting to 
               lose the rapport he's established with two potential 
               customers.

                         particular? There's a lot of other 
                         stuff in storage...

               He picks up a plastic Casio-type guitar/keyboard (a child's 
               toy) and starts noodling pre-programmed rock licks.

</b>                         Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to 
                         you.  Absolutely no practice 
                         necessary.  You shread like a giant.

               Enid glances at Rebecca and mouths the implausible name: 
               "Seymour?!" Rebecca snorts, unable to control her laughter, 
               and turns away from the table. Enid keeps her cool...

                         1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from 
                         the twenties in my collection, but 
                         it's not really for sale. I don't 
                         really collect "foreign."

               Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s.

                         can play regular records...

               He points her to a nearby box of LPs.

                         here that re-issue some really great 
                         old blues stuff.

               Rebecca tugs on Enid's sleeve. Enid gets free and continues 
               looking through the records. She stops on one with an 
               especially wacky cover.

</b>                         Nah, it's not so great. Here's the 
                         one I'd recommend.

               He pulls out a bland-looking record: "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS, 
               VOLUME THREE." Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her.

</b>                         This track alone by Memphis Minnie 
                         is worth about $500 if you have the 
                         original 78. She was one of the 
                         greatest guitar players that ever 
                         lived, and a great singer and 
                         songwriter as well. I know the guy 
                         who owns the original and lent it 
                         for use on this reissue.

               Rebecca snorts at Enid's over-exuberance. Enid kicks her.

               Loud water running; PUNK ROCK blares from adjoining bedroom 
               as Enid, her head in the sink, sings along, making up her 
               own words. As she straightens INTO FRAME, we see that she's 
               dyed her hair green. She grabs a towel and heads into the

               Enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom.  
               She rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box 
               (black hair dye). She wets her hair, then goes into the 
               bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. The punk 
               rock song we heard earlier plays. She yanks out the tape and 
               flings it away. She skims through her records and CDs, 
               dismissing them all. She notices Seymour's bag in the corner.

               She takes out the record and puts it on. The first tune is 
               an upbeat instrumental number. She returns to the bathroom.

               Several minutes pass. TRACK TWO begins on the LP. She (and 
               we) slowly begin to take notice. It's a strange, haunting 
               old BLUES RECORD. We see that the tune has struck a nerve.

                         just keep playing that one over and

                         a masterpiece. There are no other

                         with issues; emotional, spiritual,

                         we need to find a place where you 
                         can meet women who share your 
                         interests.

                         who shares my interests.  I hate my 
                         interests! Where can I go to meet

                         Well, let's see... I guess I'd have 
                         to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and 
                         Ragtime music at the top of the list,

               complicated frozen yogurt sundae for a little girl.

               He turns around non-chalantly, holding the sundae. He looks 
               up and sees Enid with the guy from Wowsville (Seymour).

               Josh is startled and drops the sundae. The girl starts crying. 
               Josh immediately starts to clean up the mess. Enid, satisfied, 
               heads with Seymour for the door.

               WE MOVE into the bathroom and see Enid taking a shower. Josh

               FRED CHATMAN, age 82, plays an acoustic blues number. He's 
               good, but he's being politely ignored for the most part by 
               the TWENTY-SOMETHING PATRONS. Most of them are more interested 
               in a baseball game showing on a big-screen TV.

               A CUTE GIRL, mid-20's, stands near their table sipping her

               Enid gets up before Seymour can stop her and talks to CUTE 
               GIRL who looks back at Seymour and smiles. She goes to join 
               him. Enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving 
               Seymour a "thumbs up."

</b>                         Actually, technically what he was 
                         mostly playing would more accurately 
                         be classified in the "ragtime" idiom. 
                         Although of course not in the 
                         strictest sense of the more classical 
                         ragtime piano music like that of 
                         Scott Joplin or Joseph Lamb. Authentic 
                         Blues has a more conventional twelve-
                         bar structure in its stanzas.

                         just gotta see Blueshammer!  They're 
                         so great!

               ANGLE ON: Enid standing alone at the bar. We see Seymour and 
               Cute Girl from her POV. Her gaze drifts to the other people 
               in the bar. WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and stop 
               on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue. He 
               makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue 
               twirling routine. Her gaze drifts on.

               She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off 
               her hat reconfiguring her hair. She reaches into her purse 
               and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. This is interrupted 
               by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage. Young, white, cocky, pretty 
               boys.

               boogeying to the music.

               Several horny ALPHA MALES press in on Seymour (who's still 
               sitting), spilling his drink as they vie to dance with her.

               Seymour extricates himself from the table and walks toward

                         this lost culture of the 20th century.

               She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken 
               logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then 
               into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's 
               Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef, 
               followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's 
               version. On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels 
               tracing the design evolution of a different company.

</b>                         These are all valid comments, but I 
                         think we should see if the artist 
                         has anything to bring to this.

</b>                         Well, I got the idea when I was doing 
                         some research and I discovered that 
                         Cook's Chicken used to be called 
                         Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to 
                         do my project based on this discovery 
                         as kind of a comment on racism... 
                         and the way racism is whitewashed 
                         over in our culture...

</b>                         And how do you think this addresses 
                         the subject of racism?

                         to show how racism used to -- more 
                         out in the open and now it's hidden, 
                         or something...

</b>                         And how does an image like this help 
                         us to see that?

                              (thinks)
                         I guess because when we see something 
                         like this it seems really shocking 
                         and we have to figure out why it's 
                         so shocking?

               A long pause as Roberta and the class stare at the painting.

               It's Roberta, taking photos. She moves on to Enid, in front

               Seymour is just finishing the dinner DANA has cooked for 
               them at her place. Dana is an attractive redhead, about 40.

</b>                         That was great - jeez, thanks again 
                         for cooking all this.

</b>                         Oh I love to cook. I guess most women 
                         wouldn't invite a man over on the 
                         first date, but I believe you should 
                         trust your instincts. When I talked 
                         to you on the phone you just seemed 
                         so... I don't know... harmless. Ready 
                         for ice cream?

               Dana heads for the kitchen. Seymour gets up to relieve his 
               backache. He walks over to a framed photo on the wall.

               It's the next morning. Josh is asleep. Enid, fully awake and 
               dressed, sits on the bed looking at him, thoroughly 
               disillusioned. She pulls out a record from his collection 
               and grimaces. She opens a closet door and finds an electric 
               guitar.

               A homemade banner reads: "HIGH SCHOOL ART SHOW - BROTHERHOOD 
               AND COMMUNITY: ART AS DIALOGUE." Along one wall is all the 
               work from Roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract 
               bric-a-brac and Enid's large painting. The painting has drawn 
               a small crowd. We see a chain of events beginning with three 
               PARENTS talking to a matronly DIRECTOR/CURATOR who in turn 
               seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for

                         her intentions with this piece...

               Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner. 
               She goes over and picks it up.

               Enid looks out the window and sees Seymour walking away. She 
               has a terribly sad look on her face.

<b>               INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING
</b>
               Seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick" 
               telephone. In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert 
               plays on the TV. We hear three rings followed by Enid's 
               answering machine message. He hangs up before it finishes.  
               Joe walks by the doorway.

                         Enid, huh?

               Seymour doesn't answer. He looks away.

                         She could at least have the decency 
                         to call me back.

                         It could be a million things. It's 
                         wasted time trying to logically figure 
                         out the female brain, that's for 
                         sure.

               Again no answer from Seymour, he stares off into space.

                         No problem.

               Seymour looks so miserable that even Joe has some compassion 
               for him.

                         can't get any worse.

               Joe leaves. Seymour is left listening to the record.

               Seymour is at work, walking down a carpeted hallway with

               Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" T-shirt 
               and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag. She's looking around 
               at her new home: a hopelessly drab, characterless apartment.

               She drags Enid into the kitchen and opens a BUILT-IN IRONING 
               BOARD as though it's the most amazing thing she's ever-seen.

               Enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. Digging through her 
               closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. Inside 
               are her old children's records (45's). She excitedly takes 
               one out and plays it. She folds her clothes while listening 
               to this song, which clearly is getting to her. She grabs 
               mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. It's 
               the uniform from her job at "Computer Station." She folds 
               it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange 
               fabric.

               Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff.

               She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the 
               time to 12:45. She goes to the phone and calls Enid. The 
               machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up. She does another 
               tedious, pointless task. IT'S NOW 3:30. She's pissed off and 
               goes to the phone to call again. As it rings there's a knock 
               on the door. Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.

               Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box

               hands it to Seymour.

               We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR 
               in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH

               Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into 
               the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.

<b>               INT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON
</b>
               Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine, 
               with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is 
               over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine.

               As he says this he flips over a SMALL DISPLAY RACK of potato 
               chips. Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front 
               of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying 
               and gets more and more frustrated.

               Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he 
               creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get 
               into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling.  
               Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with 
               his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked 
               out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.

<b>               INT. ENID &amp; REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT
</b>
               The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying 
               streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, 
               exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud 
               radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she 
               checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one 
               last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP 
               of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up.

               She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a 
               cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over 
               her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.

</b>
<b>               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
               The dialogue begins in voice-over as the title card fades. 
               We slowly fade in to see Seymour, lying on a pink pastel 
               psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his THERAPIST, a 
               handsome, well-coiffed woman in her late 40s.

<b>                                     SEYMOUR
</b>                         I have to admit, things have really 
                         started looking up for me since my 
                         life turned to shit.

<b>                                     THERAPIST
</b>                         So tell me more about this job.  
                         What exactly will you be doing?

<b>                                     SEYMOUR
</b>                         Well, mostly archival research, 
                         cataloguing old records and writing 
                         liner notes for their CD reissues.  
                         It's really... I can't believe it.

<b>                                     THERAPIST
</b>                         Remember what I said when we first 
                         started -- this little breakdown 
                         might turn out to be the best thing 
                         that ever happened to you!

<b>                                     SEYMOUR
</b>                         It doesn't pay very much, but I should 
                         be able to afford my own place in a 
                         few months... Do you think that's 
                         too soon? I'm really anxious to get 
                         my record collection out of storage...

<b>                                     THERAPIST
</b>                         Why don't we start with that next 
                         week?

               Seymour looks up. She nods toward the large wall clock behind 
               her: thirty seconds after five. Re gets up and she walks him 
               slowly toward the door.

<b>                                     SEYMOUR
</b>                         Thank you, doctor.

<b>                                     THERAPIST
</b>                              (as she opens the 
                              door)
                         Don't thank me. You're doing all the 
                         work.

               A pause. They stand facing each other.

<b>                                     THERAPIST
</b>                         Seymour?

<b>                                     SEYMOUR
</b>                         Yes?

</b>                         Do you have a check for me?

               Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket. In 
               the waiting room, we see SEYMOUR'S MOTHER.

<b>                                     MOTHER
</b>                         Seymour? Are you done? Did you have 
                         a chance to think about what you 
                         might want for dinner while you were 
                         in there?

<b>                                     SEYMOUR
</b>                         We can talk about it in the car, 
                         Ma...

               As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the 
               doctor.

<b>               INT. QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville 
               more than the old Quality Cafe. There are no neighborhood 
               "characters" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings. We 
               see that Rebecca is now a waitress here. She tears off a 
               check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted 
               EUROPEAN HIPSTER, who is too busy tapping away at his 
               POWERBOOK to notice.

               She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her 
               receipts. She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's 
               style clothes, sitting across from her.

<b>                                     ENID
</b>                         Hi.

</b>                         Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize 
                         you -- I think I need to get glasses; 
                         you're all blurry!

<b>                                     ENID
</b>                              (nodding toward 
                              muscular HIPSTER)
                         You're lucky then, you can't see the 
                         veins on that guy's biceps.

<b>                                     REBECCA
</b>                         Actually, he's a really nice guy.

               We see at this point that Rebecca &amp; Enid are no longer 
               friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.

<b>                                     REBECCA
</b>                         Do you want anything?

</b>                         Maybe an orange juice.

               Rebecca goes to get it. Enid looks around, bemused and 
               saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become.

<b>                                     ENID
</b>                         Hey, look what I got...

               She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out 
               her DIPLOMA.

<b>                                     REBECCA
</b>                         Wow... finally.

<b>                                     ENID
</b>                         It just came yesterday...

               Pause. Josh enters. Enid turns around.

<b>                                     JOSH
</b>                         Hi Enid.

<b>                                     ENID
</b>                         Hey Josh.

<b>                                     JOSH
</b>                         Are you ready to go?

               For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:

<b>                                     REBECCA
</b>                              (still counting 
                              receipts)
                         Yeah, just one second...

               She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind 
               the counter. She kisses Josh perfunctorily.

<b>                                     REBECCA
</b>                              (to Josh)
                         Did you remember to pay the phone 
                         bill?

<b>                                     JOSH
</b>                         Yeah.

<b>                                     REBECCA
</b>                              (to Enid)
                         Call me sometime.

<b>                                     ENID
</b>                         Definitely. We still have to go to 
                         that shoe store sometime.

               Rebecca &amp; Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien 
               world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly 
               stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL 
               BAG at her feet.

<b>               EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENING
</b>
               We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.

               It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.

               She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It 
               looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands 
               right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered 
               over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures: 
               a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a 
               FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: "Coming 
               Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.

<b>               EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING
</b>
               She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm 
               stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by 
               her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She 
               stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect 
               for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the 
               glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.

               She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she 
               has the street all to herself.

<b>               EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHT
</b>
               We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She 
               looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman 
               who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing 
               her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing 
               happens in another window down the street... then another...  
               Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the 
               corner and heads toward her.

               From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus 
               as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment 
               later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves 
               upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the 
               credits roll.

<b>               EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING
</b>
               The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.

<b>                                         THE END
