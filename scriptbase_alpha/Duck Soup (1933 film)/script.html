                                     Duck Soup (1933)

                                      Screenplay by

                         Harry Ruby, Bert Kalmar and Grover Jones

<b>                
</b>
               The story begins with an opening shot on the exterior of the 
               executive mansion.  It is a gala day.  Soldiers are lined up 
               in front of the entrance; expensive cars and carriages are 
               arriving and depositing distinguished notables from the 
               adjoining countries.  Two trumpeters at the head of the stairs 
               announce the arrival of each notable.

               In the large reception hall, Mrs. Teasdale, wife of the late 
               president, is greeting the newcomers.  The room is filled 
               with distinguished guests.  At the moment we see Mrs. 
               Teasdale, she is talking with a notable.  In the near 
               background is a group of distinguished men, members of her 
               own cabinet.  Her words to the notable are not lost on them, 
               and as she begins to praise the new dictator, there is the 
               exchange of disapproving glances.

<b>                                     MRS. TEASDALE
</b>                         It is so good of you to come.

<b>                                     NOTABLE
</b>                         An honor, Mrs. Teasdale...  You must 
                         indeed have great faith in your new 
                         dictator to give him such a 
                         magnificent reception.

<b>                                     MRS. TEASDALE
</b>                         I feel that Rufus T. Firefly is the 
                         only logical successor to my dear 
                         departed husband.  He has the 
                         statesmanship of Gladstone, the 
                         humility of Lincoln, and the wisdom 
                         of Pericles.

               The notable kisses her hand once more and leaves the scene.  
               As he does, the background group moves into Mrs. Teasdale.  
               Their spokesman addresses Mrs. Teasdale.

<b>                                     FIRST CABINET MEMBER
</b>                              (Protestingly)
                         Mrs. Teasdale, as members of 
                         Freedonia's cabinet, we do not approve 
                         of your choice.  Who is this Rufus 
                         T. Firefly?

<b>                                     SECOND CABINET MEMBER
</b>                              (Waving aloft a paper)
                         A stranger in our midst, an agent 
                         for the Eureka Ammunition Company.  
                         Think of it, Gentlemen, an ammunition 
                         salesman dictating the policies of 
                         our peace-loving country.

<b>                                     THIRD CABINET MEMBER
</b>                         Reconsider, Mrs. Teasdale, before it 
                         is too late.  The citizens of 
                         Freedonia want a President!

<b>                                     MRS. TEASDALE
</b>                         As the widow of your last president, 
                         I have the right to choose -- and, 
                         Gentlemen, I refuse to discuss the 
                         matter any further.

               Mrs Teasdale turns her back on them, leaving them to mumble 
               among themselves.

               From off scene comes a servant's voice, announcing:

<b>                                     SERVANT
</b>                         His Excellency, Ambassador Verdi 
                         Trentino of Amnesia!

               Cut... to the archway.  We see Trentino enter with a beautiful 
               brunette at his side.  He is followed by two or three of his 
               fellowmen.  He moves across the reception hall to Mrs. 
               Teasdale, bows most graciously and presses his lips to the 
               back of her hand, then introduces his companion.

<b>                                     TRENTINO
</b>                         Mrs. Teasdale... my niece, Vera.

               Mrs. Teasdale shakes the girl's hand warmly.

<b>                                     MRS. TEASDALE
</b>                              (To niece)
                         Your uncle has been such a friend to 
                         us in every crisis.  Without his 
                         country's financial aid --

<b>                                     TRENTINO
</b>                              (Lightly)
                         What is money?
                              (Tenderly)
                         Mrs. Teasdale, for you -- I would do 
                         anything.

<b>                                     MRS. TEASDALE
</b>                              (Flustered)
                         Ambassador!
                              (Attempting to change 
                              the subject)
                         I am so anxious for you to meet our 
                         new dictator.

<b>                                     TRENTINO
</b>                              (Persistent in his 
                              flattery)
                         Mrs. Teasdale -- no matter who rules 
                         Freedonia, to me you will always be 
                         the first lady of the land.

               Trentino attempts to take her hand.  The latter is a bit 
               confused, much to the amusement of Vera, who laughingly says:

<b>                                     VERA
</b>                         Mrs. Teasdale, my uncle's hopeless -- 
                         you've been the only topic of 
                         conversation ever since we left 
                         Amnesia.

               Mrs. Teasdale's confusion is happily interrupted by the 
               announcement of a servant, off scene.

<b>                                     SERVANT
</b>                         The Honorable Mohamed Pandooh of 
                         Mufhtan!

<b>                                     MRS. TEASDALE
</b>                              (Hastily)
                         Oh, I must greet His Honor.

               Mrs. Teasdale exits from the scene quickly.  Vera and Trentino 
               look after her, then Vera laughs softly, as their eyes meet.

<b>                                     VERA
</b>                         So that's the one you want to marry.

<b>                                     TRENTINO
</b>                         With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and 
                         Freedonia under my control --
                              (He rubs his hands 
                              significantly)

<b>                                     VERA
</b>                         Maybe it's not going to be so easy.  
                         From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale 
                         is rather sweet on this Rufus T. 
                         Firefly.

<b>                                     TRENTINO
</b>                         That's where you come in.  I'll leave 
                         him in your hands, and don't forget 
                         you're supposed to be my niece.

               Vera winks agreeingly.

               outstretched hands turned toward the main door that connects 
               the reception hall with the outer hall.

                         nothing to worry about.  Father is 
                         probably taking extra care in getting 
                         into his robes of state.  I'll call 
                         him.

               Bob goes over to a corner of the room and pulls a tapestried 
               bell cord.  This rings a fire bell in Groucho's room -- and 
               Groucho is disclosed asleep in his canopied bed under a 
               mosquito netting.  He has an unlighted cigar in his mouth.  
               The continued jangling of the fire bell awakens him from his 
               slumber and he rises quickly.  The cigar begins to emit smoke 
               when he starts puffing.  He hurries over to one corner of 
               the room where his clothes are arranged in fireman fashion, 
               gets into them, and then sides down a fireman's pole into 
               the reception hall.

               The guests are singing the last two lines of the national 
               anthem when he arrives.

               Groucho starts across the hall in the direction of Mrs. 
               Teasdale.  He passes several notables, one of whom is wearing 
               an impressive looking medal.  Groucho deprives him of it 
               without stopping his forward movement, and pins it on himself.  
               He pauses only when he is facing the principal group.

                              off scene)
                         His Excellency's car!

               This is repeated by a servant's voice off scene...

               A servant enters to Groucho, bearing his high silk hat.

               He bows low as he hands it to Groucho... Groucho takes hat, 
               removes a white rabbit, hands it back to servant, dons his 
               hat and with a swanky gesture exits... again we hear a 
               servant's voice calling: "His Excellency's car"...

               We see the trumpeters at the top of the steps of the mansion, 
               outside, standing at attention... their trumpets at their 
               sides...

               From inside comes the voice of a servant calling "His 
               Excellency's car"...

               The trumpeters click their heels, draw themselves erect, put 
               the trumpets to their mouths and blow a fanfare to summon 
               the car...

               We cut to the Exterior of the Dictator's garage.  This is a 
               pretentious affair.  In central foreground a wall, in the 
               center of which is a large wrought-iron double gate.  On 
               each side of the gate is a crest or design in relief.  Also 
               two liveried guards stand erect before the gate.  A trumpeter 
               on the wall above.  Through the gate we see the patio and 
               suggestions of the garage.  Two or three high-class cars in 
               background identify the garage.

               At the beginning of the scene, we hear finish of trumpeter's 
               call.  Instantly the two guards move to the center of the 
               gates and call through the bars -

<b>                                     GUARDS
</b>                              (In unison)
                         His Excellency's car!

               Almost instantly there is a terrific roar of motors on the 
               other side of the wall.  The two guards open gates moving in 
               military manner.  Immediately the gates are wide open, Harpo 
               appears on his motorcycle, that carries a side car.

               The motorcycle is decorated... perhaps a crest in relief on 
               the side of the car...  a thin staff, about four or five 
               feet high is fastened to the handle bars...  As Harpo rides 
               along, he hoists the Freedonian flag to the staff.  Further 
               along the road he hits a man... he looks behind to see what 
               damage he's done, but continues riding... A CUT BACK to the 
               man shows that he is lying prostrate on the ground.

               We CUT BACK to Harpo, who is just getting off motorcycle... 
               he takes another look back at the man, lowers the flag to 
               half-mast, takes bugle, which is hanging on his car and blows 
               a few bars of taps... he mounts motorcycle again and starts 
               off...

               CUT TO top of mansion steps as Groucho comes from mansion... 
               the two guards standing stiffly erect, form a seat by crossing 
               hands... Groucho sits on the seat made by their hands, puts 
               his arms around their shoulders and they carry him down 
               stairs... as fast as they can.

               CUT TO Harpo arriving in front of mansion just as Groucho, 
               carried by the men, moves into the scene.  Groucho gets into 
               the side-car... and in Napoleonic manner says to Harpo:

<b>                                     GROUCHO
</b>                         To the House of Representatives... 
                         ride like fury... Don't stop for any 
                         signals and don't wait for a corner 
                         to make a turn... see if you can 
                         break a record...

               Harpo takes a phonograph record and smashes it on the 
               ground... there is a roar of the motor -- the motorcycle 
               starts off but leaves the side-car.

               Groucho gets out of side-car... starts back to steps, stops 
               and says:

<b>                                     GROUCHO
</b>                         A fine thing -- leaving the head of 
                         the nation at the foot of the 
                         stairs...

               As he dashes up the stairs, we CUT TO Harpo... riding along...

               A very attractive girl is coming along in the opposite 
               direction.  As she approaches Harpo, he toots his horn to 
               attract her attention, she throws him a indignant look and 
               continues on down the street.  Harpo turns his motorcycle 
               around and starts after her.  She looks around, sees Harpo

               pursuing and breaks into a run... CUT BACK to Harpo following 
               her, putting on speed... he lowers the Freedonian flag and 
               simultaneously raises a pirate flag -- with skull and cross-
               bones on it, displayed prominently.  A motorcycle cop is 
               parked on the corner waiting for prospective violators...  
               he sees Harpo chasing the girl and quickly starts his motor 
               and follows in pursuit...

               The girl, as she reaches the executive mansion, rushes up 
               the stairs in an effort to escape.  Harpo comes into the 
               scene and rides up the stairs after her... As Harpo gets 
               about half way up the stairs the motorcycle cop is seen 
               approaching the mansion.

               CUT TO reception room of mansion as the girl is running madly 
               through the room... a moment later we see Harpo on his bike 
               following... there is panic among the guests.  Then we see 
               the girl tearing up the stairs leading to the circular 
               balcony...

               CUT BACK to Harpo.  He looks behind him as he rides and sees 
               the motorcycle cop following on his bike.  On the balcony 
               above,  the girl is running, with an occasional glance over 
               her shoulder as she runs out of scene... Harpo rides into 
               scene.  This time he is bent over his handle-bars in the 
               manner of a six day bicycle rider... following closely behind 
               him rides the motorcycle cop.  They circle the mezzanine... 
               Harpo in the lead, looking back now and then over his shoulder 
               at his pursuer... this is done in imitation of a six day 
               bicycle race... The motorcycle cop is closing in on Harpo... 
               the latter approaching a large open door, rides through the 
               opening, but the cop continues on around the balcony...  as 
               he gets to the opposite side of the circular balcony he passes 
               another open doorway.  Harpo comes riding out of it and is 
               now in pursuit of the cop...

               CUT down stairs to Groucho... One hand is upraised holding a 
               gun.  As he looks at a wrist watch, he fires gun, then 
               addresses guests looking into CAMERA.

                         off the gold standard...

               CUT BACK to balcony... Harpo is passing the cop...  He holds 
               up his hand for the cop to stop... they both come to a halt... 
               Harpo gets off his motorcycle, walks over angrily to cop, 
               takes out his book, writes out a summons and hands it to the 
               cop as we FADE OUT...

               FADE IN on interior of Freedonian House of Representatives.  
               This interior although not a replica of our own House of 
               Representatives, should be close enough technically to sell 
               the idea... Each seat is occupied by an officious-looking 
               dignitary.  On the platform are a few desks... perhaps a 
               pulpit which Groucho uses when he arrives...  The one to the 
               right is the court stenographer's desk, occupied by Bob 
               Firefly.  He takes notes as the meeting progresses.

               Throughout the House runs a ripple of excitement, which is 
               stopped by the rapping of the gavel by the Speaker of the

               CUT TO - the corner of Groucho's bedroom, showing fireman's 
               pole.  The sound of the clanging bell is heard over scene.

               Groucho hurries into scene, fully clad but for his coat which 
               he has on his arm... without waiting to don his coat he slides 
               down the pole.  We pick him up finishing the slide down the 
               pole into the House of Representatives.  As he arrives the 
               members are on their feet singing the last four bars of the

               Telephone bell rings.  They both make a dash for the 
               telephone, but Harpo rushes in through hallway door and 
               reaches the phone first.  Harpo picks up through telephone

               occasional nod and shake of the head.  As he listens, he

               FADE IN to garden party.  This is an afternoon tea in the 
               garden of the Teasdale estate.   Spotted in the set-up are 
               innumerable colorful umbrellas, under which are tea tables.

               The guests include the notables we saw in the mansion in the 
               first sequence.  The only two people absent are Ambassador 
               Trentino and Mrs. Teasdale.  Vera Trentino is seated at one 
               of the tables and her presence is established there in the 
               opening shot.  Music is heard over the scene and should be 
               continued through the scene as if being played by an orchestra 
               on the premises.  Suddenly the chatter ceases as the following 
               announcement is heard coming over scene.

               All eyes turn toward those off scene and everyone rises to 
               sing the last four bars of the national anthem.

               Cut to the gateway leading into the garden... a servant on 
               each side of the gate, as Groucho jauntily strides through 
               the gate, swinging the unusually large gauntlets...

               Groucho hands his high silk hat to one of the guards and 
               starts down the walk among the guests.  From his attitude it 
               is evident that he is intent on finding Ambassador Trentino.  
               Suddenly he stops, having seen something of interest off 
               scene.  The following dialogue comes over the scene.

               All of the girls laugh heartily at at this remark.

               Harpo is laughing also.  He slaps the story-teller on the 
               leg.

               Her laughter ceases instantly.  She slaps him back, and gets 
               another slap on the leg in return.  A little squeal of pain 
               from her and she raises her dress disclosing a bruise on her

               The girl drops her skirt and hands the paper to Chico.  Chico 
               looks at the paper

               knees again and puts the paper back in her stocking, while 
               Chico looks on.  She drops her skirt.

                         at that paper...

               She lifts the skirt again to get the paper, while Chico steals 
               another glance.  The girl drops her skirt and hands him the 
               paper.

               She walks over to him and lovingly strokes his hair, puts 
               both arms around him, then suddenly becomes very amorous, 
               bends him over and kisses him madly.  She lets go after a 
               little while and Chico comes up for air.  He staggers around 
               in a daze.  Then he takes the watch from his vest pocket, 
               hands it to her, extends his wrist and says:

               Suddenly the screaming of girls is heard coming from the 
               anteroom, and we cut to the anteroom in the midst of 
               confusion.  The girls are running helter-skelter, one or two 
               of them are standing on chairs with their skirts lifted above 
               their knees.  There is a little white mouse running about 
               the room.

               Harpo is sitting innocently on the bench.  The girl just 
               interviewed by Chico comes from the office, sees the mouse, 
               screams and joins in the general confusion.  Groucho enters 
               as the girls are running about - zig-zags among them and 
               continues through the room into the private office of Chico - 
               closing door behind him. The girls clear out of anteroom and 
               Harpo is left all alone.  He takes a small mouse trap from 
               his large pocketbook, puts it on the floor, crouches down 
               and whistles to the mouse in the manner of a man trying to 
               call a dog.  The mouse in answer to the whistle runs into 
               the trap.

               At this point, Harpo makes his entrance through the door, 
               carrying his unusually large pocketbook which is about the 
               size of a carpetbag.   He walks past Groucho in a seductive 
               manner, swinging his bag and rolling his eyes flirtatiously.  
               Groucho is delighted with this action and returns the ogling.

               Harpo lifts his dress and shows them the tattoo on his leg 
               of the two hearts.  Groucho examines it closely.

               Harpo lifts his dress above the other leg and shows a picture 
               of Gainsborough's "Blue Boy".  Chico and Groucho arise from 
               the examination.

                         know how to make love?

               Harpo walks over to Chico, throws his arms around him and 
               starts to give him a big hug. He squeezes him very hard.  In 
               the midst of this there is a loud report.

               A startled look from Groucho and Chico.  We see that Harpo 
               is minus one breast.  He tries to affect an innocent look 
               when suddenly there is a second loud report and his breasts 
               are now as flat as a billiard table.

               Just as he turns to hide the sight from Chico and Groucho, a 
               hissing sound is heard -- the air is leaking out of his bustle 
               and the bustle is becoming deflated.)

               Harpo goes to a corner of the room and keeps his back to 
               CAMERA.  He takes a tube out of his dress front and begins 
               to blow.  Chico and Groucho wear a puzzled look as they watch 
               him - the bustle starts to expand.

               This inflation continues to gigantic proportions as they 
               look on.

                         age.

               There is a terrific explosion and all of Harpo's clothes are 
               blown off him - leaving him in nothing but running pants and 
               ladies' silk stockings.  His body is literally covered with 
               tattoos.

               Winks significantly at Harpo.  Harpo returns the wink.

               He and Chico continue further examination of the tattooed

               Harpo pulls a catalogue from under the belt of his trunks 
               and hands it to Chico.  Groucho and Chico look at the 
               catalogue.

               Harpo reveals more of his back and shows a superb tattooed 
               job of a beautiful girl's head.

                         phone number?

               Harpo raises one arm and shows the phone number tattooed 
               right under the arm pit.  He holds this a moment, then turns 
               and discloses a portion of the tattooing on his chest.  
               Groucho and Chico's eyes shift from the telephone number to 
               the tattooed picture on his chest.  Harpo completes move and 
               discloses the entire picture.  It is a country back-house 
               with a crescent over the door.  Chico laughs uproariously.

               He slaps Harpo an the back good-naturedly.

               TRICK SHOT on HARPO'S CHEST.  The door in the outhouse flies 
               open.  The head of a real man appears in the opening.  He 
               looks off in the direction of Chico and mumbles incoherencies 
               under his breath.

               He is terribly angry at being interrupted.  He draws in his 
               head, closing the door behind him.

                         spying...

               Harpo takes the glasses and goes directly toward the window.  
               As he looks across street through binoculars, he is grinning 
               all over and wiggling around like a happy kid.

               Looking into the open window of a bedroom as Harpo would see 
               it through the binoculars.  A beautiful girl is undressing, 
               preparing to retire.  After a moment of this shot CUT BACK 
               to Harpo looking through the binoculars.  Chico takes the 
               binoculars from Harpo and pushes him out of the scene, 
               proceeds to look himself.  He registers the same satisfaction 
               as Harpo and hands the binoculars to Groucho.  As Groucho 
               looks through the binoculars at the beautiful girl, Chico 
               says:

               Groucho takes a second look through the binoculars at the 
               beautiful girl.  This time he sees Harpo chasing the girl 
               around the roam.  This is shot through the binoculars as 
               before.  Groucho registers amazement as he looks through 
               binoculars; perhaps squints his eyes once or twice and takes 
               second look.

               Chico takes the binoculars and looks at the room across the 
               street.  Binocular shot as before.  The girl is in her 
               underwear, tearing out of the room into the hall, pursued by 
               Harpo.  Chico is still looking through the binoculars.

               girl.  She comes dashing madly out of the door and starts 
               down the street, clad only in her underwear.  Harpo appears 
               in doorway, riding his motorcycle and starts down the street 
               after her.

               smartly appointed room.  Its main feature for our purposes 
               is a winding stairway leading to bedrooms above.

               In the absence of Mrs. Teasdale, Vera is seated by fireplace 
               while Ambassador Trentino is excitedly pacing up and down...

               love making.

               She picks up Groucho's hat and hands it to him.  He removes 
               a white rabbit from hat and gives it to her.  He is about to 
               put the hat on his head when something in the hat attracts 
               his attention.  He empties six baby rabbits out of the hat 
               onto the table; puts his hat on and exits.

               CUT TO outside of house just as Harpo is pulling up to the 
               curb in his motorcycle and sidecar.  Groucho comes out of 
               house and walks directly to motorcycle.

               They both step out of box, onto stage and stroll casually 
               across as singing is going on.  Part of the way across, Harpo 
               and Chico react to the singing of a very high note -- it's 
               practically in Harpo's ear.  He stops -- makes a terrible 
               face -- takes out ear-muffs, puts them on his ears and he 
               and Chico continue toward the box --

               CUT TO other box -- the one that Chico and Harpo are headed 
               for.  Mrs. Teasdale and guests are being ushered in...

               Chico and Harpo come into scene, arriving at box.  Chico 
               steps into box from stage.  Harpo is about to follow when he 
               spies a pretty girl in box above.  He starts climbing up the 
               proscenium arch to upper box -- the girl sees him, screams 
               and dashes out of box.  Harpo completes climb into box -- at 
               this point the singing has just finished and applause breaks 
               out.

               Harpo acknowledges the applause as if it was in appreciation 
               of his climb -- after a few quick bows he starts out of the 
               box after the girl.  As he is running out of box into the 
               foyer he bumps into Ambassador Trentino.

                         better write that down.

               Harpo takes out a pencil with heavy lead and writes the 
               address on the white and purple-edged silk band which is 
               across Trentino's shirt bosom.  Then he pushes Trentino's 
               coat aside and from under his vest pulls the ribbon in the 
               manner of a ticker tape -- tears it off -- and starts back 
               to box.

               to stage where the shooting of the apple in "William Tell"

               good aim and lets the arrow fly...  It hits its mark and the 
               apple falls to the ground.  William Tell, having arrived at 
               spot from which he's going to shoot, turns to take aim and 
               sees that the apple is gone.  He picks up another, at the 
               base of an apple tree and starts in direction of his son.

               into box and brings up another arrow -- takes aim and lets 
               arrow fly.  Again it hits its mark and the apple falls to 
               ground.  William Tell, reaching his place, turns to take aim 
               and is bewildered at the sight of the second missing apple.  
               The tree is bare and there are no more apples around.

               A whistle is heard coming over scene.  William Tell turns in 
               direction of the whistle and we CUT TO Harpo whistling with 
               his fingers in his mouth.  Reaching down into the box, he 
               brings up a bag of apples and dumps all the apples onto the

               from its hiding place and places it on the ledge of the box 
               out of Chico's reach.  CUT TO:

               Ballet dancers' dressing room. The CAMERA PANS along, showing 
               several of the ballet dancers limbered up by other dancers.

               This is done as follows: - a girl stands against the wall on 
               one leg while another girl raises the other leg up and down.

               The CAMERA passes three or four of the girls and comes to a 
               stop on Vera and Groucho -- the latter is stretching her leg 
               in the same manner.

               Hero continues his song while Harpo litters the stage with 
               various articles - a saddle - a chair, etc...

               CUT TO box below - Chico is trying to reach for pocketbook 
               on ledge but can't get it.  He whistles up to Harpo.  Harpo 
               looks down and Chico pantomimes to him to get the pocketbook, 
               pointing to it.  The singing stops and aplause follows -- 
               the orchestra starts a selection -- which continues through 
               following routine without any singing.

               CUT TO box above.  Harpo takes out a fishing pole with a 
               reel on it -- he unwinds reel and the line descends

               near box below and lands in a man's hair -- the man occupies 
               an aisle seat in the orchestra -- near Teasdale box.

               CUT TO Harpo reeling in.  CUT TO man on aisle seat -- The 
               hook has caught onto his toupe and its being pulled off his 
               head.  CUT TO Harpo reeling in with great satisfaction in 
               the belief that he has the purse -- on the end of the line 
               comes the toupe.  Harpo, astonished, looks down on the victim 
               who, minus the toupe, now displays a shiny bald pate.

               Harpo takes out his fountain pen and releases gadget. The 
               ink pours down on the bald spot of the man below and spreads 
               into the form of a toupe parted in the middle.  CUT BACK to 
               Harpo - he places the toupe on the bare back side of a figure 
               of Cupid carved on the arch.  He is now suddenly attracted 
               by something on the stage -- it is a pool with a practical 
               fountain in its center.  Harpo digs into a decorative flower 
               box set in a groove in the proscenium arch.

               He brings out a real live worm and baits his hook -- stands 
               up and casts... the line swishes through the air and the 
               hook lands in the pool on the stage.  The line instantly 
               tightens and a large carp fish is yanked out of the pool...  
               as the line is drawn in the fish nearly hits Mrs. Teasdale.

               She covers her face with her hands.  Chico takes advantage 
               of her action, grabs the line, removes the fish, and puts 
               hook on handle of purse...  then signals Harpo with a whistle 
               and in the manner of a construction foreman, motions to him 
               to start "hoisting".  The line becomes taut and the purse is 
               yanked out of view.  Mrs. Teasdale uncovers her face and 
               discovers that the purse is missing.

               There is a buzz of excitement among the rest of the guests 
               as they help Mrs. Teasdale look for the purse.

               Chico joins in the search.  He grabs an elderly dignified 
               man in the party, throws back his coat and starts to frisk 
               him.

                         plans, you paper snatchers --

               He makes a grab at Chico -- Chico passes the plans to Harpo - 
               Groucho goes after Harpo - the latter leans away over ledge 
               of box and holds the plans out over the stage.  As Groucho 
               is trying to reach for the plans, Vera dances into scene, 
               makes a graceful pirouette and with her outstretched hands 
               takes the plans from Harpo.  As she dances away she deposits 
               the plans in her bodice...

               Vera's male dancing partner enters from the wings, walks out 
               about four feet - stops and strikes a pose with uplifted 
               hand.  Vera is dancing on the opposite side with her back 
               turned.  CUT TO Groucho back stage - he sees the dancing 
               partner - pulls a lever on switchboard marked "TRAP DOOR" -

               former spot holding the same pose ...

               CUT TO full stage shot.  Groucho and Vera are dancing 
               together.  During the dance Groucho tries to get the paper.

               He bends her way over in an effort to make the paper drop 
               out of her bodice.  Harpo and Chico, watching the struggle, 
               quickly tear off their capes and coats and leap from the box 
               on to stage in their shirts.

               This develops into a four-cornered adagio dance.

               She hands the papers to Harpo over Groucho's shoulder as she 
               dances with him... Groucho rushes to Harpo and they do a 
               twirl together.  Harpo hands the paper to Chico over Groucho's 
               shoulder.  Groucho rushes at Chico and twirls with him - 
               Chico in trying to pass the papers to Vera drops them on the 
               floor.  They all make a dive for them.  Groucho gets the 
               papers and dashes with them to the lower box just as Mrs. 
               Teasdale enters same.

               FADE IN - Mrs. Teasdale's living room.  Night.  Subdued light.  
               We begin with an EXTREME CLOSE CLOSE SHOT of a hand depositing 
               the plans of war in a vault.  This vault is about the height 
               of a man, the door flush with wall.  The CAMERA TRUCKS back 
               and discloses that the one depositing the papers is Mrs. 
               Teasdale -- she is in negligee.  She closes the vault door, 
               pulls a cord, closing a pair of drapes which hide the vault.  
               The CAMERA PANS to the balcony above where Vera Trentino,  
               also in negligee, is watching the action in the living room 
               below.  She tiptoes quietly from the scene.

               Downstairs, Mrs. Teasdale turns out the center table light 
               and moves toward the stairway.

               CUT TO Vera Trentino's bedroom.  Vera comes toward window, 
               raises it quietly and waves a handkerchief, evidently 
               signalling somebody below.

               CUT TO EXTERIOR of house.  Chico and Harpo are waving back 
               to signify that they have caught the signal.  The boys try 
               to raise the window which is located next to the main 
               entrance, but it is locked and they can't budge it.

                         It's all your fault. Now we gotta 
                         steal the plans again -- You had 'em 
                         on you... you take a bath... and now 
                         we no gotta plans of war.

               They try the window again and find it hopeless

                         You wait here -- I'll let you in.

               Chico walks right in through the door, closes it behind him 
               and then appears at the window.  He raises it from the inside 
               and Harpo climbs in through the window and joins Chico.

               CUT TO INSIDE.  They are walking cautiously across the room 
               when they hear the following coming over scene -- "Psst... 
               Psst..."  They stop and look around, trying to locate the 
               source of the sound.  We CUT TO the balcony and see Vera 
               Trentino, still dressed in her negligee.  Once more she tries 
               to attract them.

               The boys look up and see her.

                              again)

               Harpo hasn't taken his eyes off of Vera during all this, 
               makes a sudden dash for her, as she turns to her room.

               Chico stops him on the second or third step of the stairs.

               Chico goes over to the safe and draws the curtains, disclosing 
               safe.  Harpo follows and takes from his back pocket a rather 
               large electrical drill with a cord and plug attached to it.  
               Chico takes the cord and plugs it into the wall socket.

               Harpo starts to drill the safe door, making a terrific noise -- 
               the usual reaping whir-r-r of an electric drill.  Chico grabs 
               his hand and stops him from drilling.

                         can't hear what we're doing.

               Harpo goes over to radio and turns it on... a dance tune 
               comes over the air.  Harpo grabs Chico and whirls him around 
               as if he were dancing with a dame...

                         What's-a matter, you crazy... ?

               Chico goes to radio and adjusts dial to another station... 
               the following comes over the air...

                         woman walking around in her nightgown ---

               Harpo drops the drill and makes a wild dash for door obviously 
               to go to the woman... Chico stops him.

               Chico rushes to phone... and dials...  This shot excludes

                              mouth and whistles.)

               CUT TO Vera's bedroom.  It is a CLOSE SHOT showing Vera in 
               bed, shot from side of bed.  She is under the bedcovers 
               desperately trying to keep them from being pulled off her... 
               TRUCK back disclosing Harpo on the other end of the bedcovers, 
               trying to pull them off her... for a moment following, a tug 
               of war goes on, Harpo pulling the covers about a foot his 
               way and Vera pulling them back...  The sound of Chico's second 
               whistle coming over scene attracts Harpo, who lets go of the 
               covers and runs out of the room.

               We pick him up outside of the room on balcony.  Without 
               hesitation he slides down the bannisters to join Chico who 
               is waiting at foot of stairs.

               Harpo nods and takes from under his coat a woman's silk 
               combination... winks and looks back in the direction of Vera's 
               room...  Chico snatches it out of his hand and throws it 
               away.

               During above Mrs. Teasdale has come out on balcony, sees the 
               boys but can't distinguish them in the room which is 
               practically in darkness except for a few splotches of 
               moonlight.  She runs back into her room...

               Harpo lights fuse... each stands on either side of safe door

               a terrific blast of sound... and the screen is masked with

               starts off.

               DISSOLVE to CLOSE UP of Harpo riding at breakneck speed.  As 
               he looks grimly ahead he reaches down out of scene and brings 
               up a three-cornered colonial hat and puts it on his head.

               DISSOLVE to a Moving Insert - Harpo bringing the horse to a 
               stop in front of a farm house.  He blows a blast on a regular 
               army bugle... immediately a few old men rush out of the house 
               in their nightgowns, carrying guns, and into the scene from 
               all directions rush other men, answering the call, similarly 
               attired.  Harpo starts his horse and we DISSOLVE to him 
               pulling up to another farm house.

               This house has a single door on the extreme end of it and a 
               very large French window covering almost the rest of the 
               house.  Harpo stops and sounds the bugle call.  This time 
               there is no answer to his call.  He waits a second, then 
               turns his horse in the direction of the house and rides 
               through the single door.  After a short pause, the doors of 
               the French window fly open and the horse runs out pulling a 
               double bed which is on wheels.  Harpo is standing at the 
               foot of the bed, braced against the bedpost, holding the 
               reins.  There is an old couple, man and woman, fast asleep 
               in the bed - (This couple might be the blase gentleman and 
               young wife used by Peter Arno in his cartoons.)  After riding 
               a few feet Harpo leaps from the bed onto the horse's back 
               and rides off leaving the bed and its occupants on the road.

               DISSOLVE to Harpo pulling up to another farm house.

               He stops, sounds his bugle.  A very pretty young girl, in 
               her night clothes pokes her head out of the second story 
               window.  Harpo takes a good look at her, leaps off his horse 
               and dashes into the house.  A moment later he comes out of 
               the house with a feed bag and puts it on the horse's head....  
               then he dashes back into the house again.  Almost instantly 
               he comes tearing out of the house, followed by an old geezer 
               in his nightgown, who is chasing him, with rifle in hand...

               He fires a few shots -

               The sound of a distant booming of guns is heard over this 
               scene.  On the wall is a large war map with colored thumb 
               tacks indicating the positions of Groucho's men and the enemy.

               Groucho, in the uniform of a Confederate General, (a Robert 
               E. Lee make-up), is studying the war map with a few of his 
               Generals.

               The door flies open and Bob, in a snappy uniform, enters

               Groucho snatches the dispatch from Bob's hand, tears it open --

               He rises and moves to wall toward which the cannon is pointed.  
               He draws a target on the wall with a piece of chalk -- goes 
               back to cannon.  He picks up the firing string, and faces 
               the target toward which the cannon is pointing.  Chico puts 
               his fingers into his ears.  Groucho picks up a pencil from 
               desk - taps it on desk - then raises both hands, in the manner 
               of an orchestra leader.  He holds this pose for a second - 
               and on the down beat, Harpo jerks the string and there is a 
               terrific explosion.  The cannon fires out the back end instead 
               of the front and blows a hole through the back wall.  The 
               two stare off in the direction of the hole.  Groucho turns 
               to Chico.

               Groucho and Zeppo descend out of scene, as Harpo and Chico 
               come into scene from above, both suspended from the ropes of 
               their parachutes... They are in a sitting position, with a 
               board across their knees, playing cards...

               FADE IN - to a group of notables standing around a large 
               table.  Among them are Mrs. Teasdale and Zeppo.  Groucho is 
               the guest of honor, very gaily attired for the occasion.

               As we FADE INTO this scene, they are singing -

               Then follows a musical interlude during which Groucho says: -

                         against us, and so, I have invited

                              (Applause)

               CUT TO door, as it is being opened by two pages.

               Trentino and Vera enter.  They both stop and bow in 
               acknowledgment of the applause coming over scene.

               As they walk toward table and out of scene, Chico and Harpo 
               enter.  The latter is carrying a carpet runner, rolled up 
               under his arm. He flips the carpet runner away from him on 
               the floor, holding onto one end.  It rolls out and Harpo 
               strides majestically down its length toward the table with 
               Chico following.  Harpo pauses, brings to light a cuspidor 
               from under his coat, puts it on the carpet and spits into 
               it, and continues on, following Chico, who is now ahead of 
               him.  Harpo breaks into a run and he and Chico dash madly to 
               the table.  They take seats on either side of Groucho and 
               without hesitating, start to eat the food in front of them.  
               The guests are standing.  Trentino and Vera arrive at their 
               places and everyone sits down.

               Harpo reaches for a large service plate with a pretty picture 
               on it, pushes his plate away, breaks the service plate with 
               a knife... it breaks into little pieces like a jig-saw puzzle.  
               He mixes the pieces up, and then starts to put them together 
               again ... Groucho watches him... then helps him...

                              tries to fit a piece)

                              (Picking up a piece 
                              and placing it...)

               A waiter places a dish of tasty food in front of Groucho... 
               he is just about to dig into it with his knife and fork when 
               Harpo turns the table toward himself.  This brings Groucho's 
               food to Harpo, and Chico's empty plate to Groucho...

                         have a second helping...  waiter...

               Snapping his finger to waiter off scene.  The waiter 
               immediately appears placing a second dish in front of Groucho.  
               He starts to dig his knife and fork into it again when Chico 
               turns the table toward himself... This brings his food to 
               Chico... Harpo lifts his plate up and puts it down again 
               when the table stops turning... this time Groucho has nothing 
               in front of him...

               Harpo takes salt shaker from man to his right, places it in 
               front of himself and gives the table a quick turn toward the 
               woman next to Chico...

               Groucho is still without food.  He rises and looks about 
               table... Sees a dish of food in front of Trentino, who is 
               seated at opposite side of table...  Trentino is eating.

               He gives the table a quick turn and Trentino's plate 
               disappears as it spins around toward Groucho...

               Just as it gets to Harpo, he lifts up the plate...  the table 
               goes on a few feet more and when it stops, Harpo puts down 
               his plate and starts to eat...  again Groucho has nothing... 
               Groucho picks up his napkin and wipes his mouth.

               The table starts to turn slowly...  Groucho starts to walk 
               in opposite direction... staying in same place.
