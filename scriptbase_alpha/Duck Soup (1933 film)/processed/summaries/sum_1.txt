To rescue the small country of Freedonia from bankruptcy, Mrs. Teasdale agrees to donate 20 million dollars if Rufus T. Firefly is appointed its new president.
Firefly is a cynical, sarcastic dictator who refuses to play politics by the book.
For instance, he does reduce workers' hours--by shortening their lunch breaks!
Firefly attempts to win the hand of Mrs. Teasdale, as does Ambassador Trentino of the neighboring country, Sylvania.
When the two leaders cannot resolve their dispute over the wealthy dowager, war between the countries is declared, and Mrs. Teasdale's house comes under attack.
Who will save the day?
