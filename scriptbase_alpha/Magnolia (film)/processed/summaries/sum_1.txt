The coincidence in this movie is not apparent.
Rather, I believe this movie is about choice- and the where and when this reality manifests itself.
Throughout the film, we are introduced to characters both young and old, perhaps only sharing emptiness among them.
Through the variety especially in age of characters, the movie presents choice in its three forms- present, past, and future- making present choices, choices already made, and setting ourselves up to make choices in the future.
The movie emphasizes choices made over the other two.
We witness two men, who have nothing else in common aside from their expected and imminent deaths, regress painfully over wretched pasts- results of pathetic choices.
Furthermore, the movie affirms the eminence of present choices through a young prodigy displayed on a game show.
Will he too one day regret his past decisions?
Our prophetic cop indirectly divulges his personal secret to making unknown future decisions- morality.
