Calvin Clifford (C. C.) "Bud" Baxter (Jack Lemmon) is a lonely office drudge at a national insurance corporation in a high-rise building in New York City.
In order to climb the corporate ladder, Baxter allows four company managers, who reinforce their position over him by regularly calling him "Buddy Boy," to take turns borrowing his Upper West Side apartment for their various extramarital liaisons, which are so noisy that his neighbors assume that he is bringing home different women every night.

The four managers--(Ray Walston, David Lewis, Willard Waterman, and David White)--write glowing reports about Baxter, who hopes for a promotion from the personnel director, Jeff Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray).
Sheldrake calls Baxter to his office but says that he has found out why they were so enthusiastic, but then promotes him in return for exclusive privileges to borrow the apartment.
He insists on using it that same night and, as compensation for such short notice, gives Baxter two company-sponsored tickets to the hit Broadway musical The Music Man.

After work, Baxter catches Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine), an elevator operator on whom he has had his eye, and asks her to go to the musical with him.
They agree to meet at the theater after she has a drink with a former fling.
The man whom she meets, by coincidence is Sheldrake, who convinces her that he is about to divorce his wife for her.
They go to Baxter's apartment as Baxter waits forlornly outside the theater.
