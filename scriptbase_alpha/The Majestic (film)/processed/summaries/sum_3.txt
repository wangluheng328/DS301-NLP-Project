Peter Appleton is a script writer during the 1950's who is suspected to be a Communist among many Hollywood film people (which is not true).
Along the way, he gets into a freak car accident and suffers amnesia, then ends up in a small California town.
There he lives in a run down movie theatre where he learns the magic of experiencing a movie in it.
Soon, the Communist hunters find him and call him to testify before a Senate hearing committee.
