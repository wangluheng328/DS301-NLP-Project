Badlands is narrated by Holly (Spacek), a teenage girl living in a dead-end South Dakota town.
One day she meets Kit (Sheen), a young greaser, who charms and runs away with her.
Holly's narration, describing her adventures with Kit in romantic clich√©s, is juxtaposed as Kit's increasingly antisocial and violent behavior is slowly revealed.
The two are eventually arrested; Kit is executed for his crimes, while Holly receives probation.
