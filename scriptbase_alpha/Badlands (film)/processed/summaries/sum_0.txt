Kit Carruthers, a young garbage collector and his girlfriend Holly Sargis from Fort Dupree, South Dakota, are on the run after killing Holly's father who disagreed with their relationship.
On their way towards the Badlands of Montana they leave a trail of dispassionate and seemingly random murders.
A very intriguing narrative without judgements, and lacking the usually sensational approach of this genre.
Very good acting and directing, and beautiful photography.
The script was based upon the true story of the Charles Starkweather and Caril-Ann Fugate murders in 1958.
