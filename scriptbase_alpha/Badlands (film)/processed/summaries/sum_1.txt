In Fort Dupre, South Dakota, in 1959, Kit Carruthers, a twenty-five-year-old garbageman, starts courting fifteen-year-old Holly Sargis.
Holly, who reads pop music and movie magazines, is infatuated with Kit.
She thinks he looks like actor James Dean.
But her widower father, a sign painter, shoots her dog when he finds out she's been seeing Kit, and forbids him to come near her.
While Holly watches with mixed emotions, Kit kills her father with a pistol.
They burn down the house and take off on a killing spree throughout the Midwest.
