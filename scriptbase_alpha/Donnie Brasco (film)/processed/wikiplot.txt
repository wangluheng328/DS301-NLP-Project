In 1978, FBI agent Joseph D. Pistone is assigned to infiltrate the New York City–based Bonanno crime family.
He calls himself Donnie Brasco and poses as an expert jewel thief from Vero beach.
Brasco is befriended by Benjamin "Lefty" Ruggiero—a low-level, mob hit-man whose personal life is in tatters—and Dominick "Sonny Black" Napolitano, the captain of Lefty's crew.

Lefty cannot make enough money and he is continually passed over for promotion within the crime family.
His son is a drug addict.
He constantly reminds Brasco of his growing disillusionment with his life after his having spent 30 years as a wiseguy killing 26 people and has little to show for it.

In Donnie, at least, Lefty sees a young protégé who might be able to succeed where he failed.
He takes Donnie under his wing.
Donnie quickly becomes accepted by the other family members, as an "associate" (the lowest Mafia rank describing people who have criminal ties to the Mafia but are not actual members) and is later nearly officially inducted into the mob as a "made man."

The longer Pistone plays the role of a gangster, the more he finds himself actually becoming Donnie Brasco during his rare off-duty hours.
His long absences and change in personality drive a wedge between Pistone and his wife and three children.
Meanwhile, the slightest mistake in his performance as a mobster could result in death to him and his family.

In addition, Pistone has come to regard Lefty as a close and trusted friend.
He knows that when the day finally comes that the FBI arrests his mob associates, he will be ending Lefty's life as surely as if he himself had killed him.
