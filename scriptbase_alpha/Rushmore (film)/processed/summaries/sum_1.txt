Max is a homely 10th-grade scholarship boy at Rushmore, a private school where he fails classes but constantly organizes clubs and plays.
He befriends a depressed local factory magnate, Blume, and falls for a recently widowed teacher, Ms. Cross.
When a scheme gets him expelled, he tries his Rushmore style at the local high school.
He ignores the proffered friendship of a student, Margaret, to pursue the unattainable Ms. Cross.
Max discovers Blume also loves her; he seeks vengeance, Blume retaliates, war ensues, and Max's troubles deepen.
Rescue comes from unexpected places, including his sweet father, a barber.
Can Max accept a realistic place in the world?
