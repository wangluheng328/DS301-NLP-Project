The film was based on the novel of the same title by Michael Pye.
Numerous hands had a part in the screenplay as script doctors.
The cover page of the screenplay credits Jon Bokenkamp with the original draft, Nicholas Kazan with subsequent revisions, Hilary Seitz with more revisions, and David Ayer with the last revisions (to February 28, 2003).
The WGA screenwriting credit system ultimately awarded screenplay and adaptation credit to Bokenkamp alone.
