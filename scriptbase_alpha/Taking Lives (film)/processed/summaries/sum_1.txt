A successful FBI profiler, Illeana Scott, is summoned to help out Quebec law enforcement in Montreal.
Her task is to hunt down a serial killer who assumes the lives and identities of the people he kills as he travels across North America.
This forces Illeana to adjust to working in a strange city with a police team with which she doesn't really fit in.
