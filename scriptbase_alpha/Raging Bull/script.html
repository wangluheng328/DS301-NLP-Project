	MUSIC IN: "Stone Cold Dead in the Market" by Louis Jordon
<b>	
</b>	THE TITLES appear on black. They are intercut with CLOSE-UPS
	of a fighter's body.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXAMPLES:
</b><b>	
</b>	Feet move.
<b>	
</b>	Credit over black.
<b>	
</b>	Body lunges.
<b>	
</b>	Credit over black.
<b>	
</b>	Fists swing and punch at the air.
<b>	
</b>	Credit over black.
<b>	
</b>	WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of young JAKE LAMOTTA.
<b>	
</b><b>	                                   THEN CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (1964)
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE LAMOTTA, wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing.
<b>	
</b>	We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the
	shadows. At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the
	balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on
	canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short
	bursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
	     It's a thrill to be standing here
	     talking to you wonderful people. In
	     fact, it's a thrill to be standing!
	     I haven't seen so many people since
	     my last fight at Madison Square
	     Garden. After that fight, a
	     reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do
	     you go from here?' I said, 'To a
	     hospital!' I fought one hundred and
	     six professional fights and still
	     none of them bums figured out how
	     to fight me -- they kept hitting me
	     in the head! And that's why I'm
	     here tonight...
	          (starts to sing)
	     'When the fighter's not engaged in
	     his employment, his employment,
	     although he was Champ and quite the
	     rage, he must go somewhere else to
	     seek employment, seek employment.
	     But a fighter's life is not a bowl
	     of cherries, still I'd rather have
	     an egg than a fist upon my face...
	     That's Entertainment!'
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT (1941)
</b><b>	
</b>	Bam! JIMMY REEVES, a fast, black middleweight, jabs LAMOTTA,
	19 years old, in the face. JAKE staggers forward. No matter
	how hard LAMOTTA is hit, no matter how often, he always
	staggers forward -- like a bull. The bell sounds.
<b>	
</b>	Battered, JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner.
<b>	
</b>	It's September, 1941. Europe and Asia are already at war.
	Young SOLDIERS, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience --
	each screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring.
<b>	
</b>	Suddenly, words are exchanged, a GIRL screams, and a SOLDIER
	and a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging.
<b>	
</b>	AND IN THE RING: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits
	blood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for
	him. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     You didn't have to come to
	     Cleveland to get beat by a "moulan
	     yan," Jake!
<b>	
</b><b>	               TONY
</b>	     He's got you, Jake! You're
	     outpointed! You're coming up for
	     the tenth. You gotta knock him out!
<b>	
</b>	The bell sounds for the tenth. JAKE pulls himself up and
	charges at REEVES.
<b>	
</b>	REEVES slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points.
<b>	
</b>	In JAKE's corner, JOEY stands and yells at JAKE:
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     A grand apiece! We got a grand
	     apiece on this, Jake! A fucking
	     grand!
<b>	
</b>	JAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild
	alley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another.
<b>	
</b>	The SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill.
<b>	
</b>	REEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas.
<b>	
</b>	The REFEREE counts:
<b>	
</b><b>	               REFEREE
</b>	     One, two, three, four...
<b>	
</b>	The GAMBLERS call out new odds; ten to one for REEVES, the
	underdog. JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and
	steps in front of the bell. He swings his arms, pretending
	not to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a
	few seconds. This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but
	not enough. JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the
	count of nine, ending the match.
<b>	
</b>	Boos and cheers. The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to
	get their money.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting
	them toward the CROWD. JOEY rushes out and hugs him.
<b>	
</b>	The ANNOUNCER steps into the ring with the mike:
<b>	
</b><b>	               ANNOUNCER
</b>	     Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner,
	     under the rules of the Cleveland
	     Boxing Commission, after ten
	     rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy
	     Reeves.
<b>	
</b>	The ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES' arm as his corner tries to
	lift him off the canvas -- still out cold. TWO ATTENDANTS
	bring in a stretcher.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE is stunned. He still prances around, now trying to
	figure out what happened. He raises his arms in victory, and
	the FANS go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting
	with the COPS, throwing bottles and junk into the ring.
	PEOPLE go into the ring.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	          (to Jake)
	     Don't get out of the ring. You won
	     the fight -- let him go out first.
<b>	
</b><b>	                                   CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b>	REEVES being placed on the stretcher.
<b>	
</b>	A ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to
	play the "Star Spangled Banner." REEVES is carried out.
<b>	
</b>	Only then do JOEY and TONY escort JAKE out of the ring.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. WEBSTER AVENUE AND 169TH ST., THE BRONX - NEXT DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	It's a rough neighborhood, inhabited primarily by welfare
	cases and street kids.
<b>	
</b>	In the street, two young PUNKS, 13 or 14 years old, exchange
	words and start to fight. Their FRIENDS cheer them on. SALVY
	and JOEY turn the corner.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Salvy, would I steer you wrong?
	     Let's say that's the truck; it's
	     full of cigarettes, right? Now, two
	     o'clock this morning we move the
	     truck from here to there,
	          (he points; the CAMERA
<b>	          PANS)
</b>	     take the cigarettes out, sell 'em,
	     make some cash.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SALVY
</b>	     Hey but Joey, you're thinking
	     nickels and dimes. The money's with
	     your brother.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     What do you want from my life,
	     Salvy? He's my brother.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SALVY
</b>	     He ain't doin' the right thing.
	     He's makin' beans compared to what
	     he should be makin'. Can't you make
	     him understand that?
<b>	
</b>	A COP goes over and starts to break up the fight.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	          (to cop)
	     Hey, leave the kids alone.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SALVY
</b>	     Get lost.
	          (joking, he knows the Cop)
	     Hey kids, "A cop is a rat."
	     Remember that, "A rat."
<b>	
</b>	The KIDS yell.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	          (to Cop)
	     Hey Jimmy, here's a dollar for your
	     trouble. There's some bums around
	     the corner -- they need your help.
<b>	
</b><b>	               COP
</b>	     Keep the dollar, Joey. Get yourself
	     a new suit.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	          (laughs)
	     Here's my new suit.
	          (grabs his crotch)
	     Right here.
<b>	
</b><b>	               COP
</b>	     Hey, don't get wise!
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Just kidding, take it easy.
	          (to himself)
	     No fuckin' sense of humor.
<b>	
</b>	SALVY and JOEY continue to walk a little faster, giggling.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE, bandaged from the REEVES fight the night before, sits
	at the kitchen table (he's had a few glasses of wine) while
	his wife, IRMA, 19, cooks at the stove.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE gets up and pokes at the frying steak with a fork.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     This looks done.
<b>	
</b><b>	               IRMA
</b>	     It's not done.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     It looks done. I'll take it the way
	     it is.
<b>	
</b><b>	               IRMA
</b>	     Here's your steak. You can't wait
	     for it to be done. Here.
<b>	
</b>	She slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the
	stove.
<b>	
</b><b>	               IRMA (CONT'D)
</b>	     Here's your carrots. You're in such
	     a hurry. You can't wait.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     No, I can't wait. You know when I
	     wait? When it's important to wait.
	     It's not important to wait for no
	     steak. It's important to wait for
	     Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't
	     important to wait for no steak! I
	     won that fight. So, I stayed in the
	     ring, and that way I made sure
	     everybody knew it. I shoulda
	     knocked him out earlier,
	     sonofabitch.
<b>	
</b>	He starts to eat the steak. He takes a drink of wine.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Wait! I'll wait. But let me tell
	     you, if this steak was the
	     middleweight championship, I'd show
	     you how I'd wait. I'd eat it raw.
	     I'd drink the blood. I'd eat it
	     before it came out of the cow --
	     that's how I'd wait.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING/TENEMENT - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	SALVY and JOEY approach the building.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     I can't convince him. He's got such
	     a thick head, I'd like to crack it
	     open myself. Believe me, my own
	     brother. It's very hard. You don't
	     have to convince me -- I know we
	     should be with Tommy. You talk to
	     him. He don't listen to nobody.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SALVY
</b>	     Look, I'm just tellin' you how
	     Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard
	     on himself. Tommy wants him with
	     us. It's as simple as that.
<b>

</b>	     Talk some sense into him, will ya?
	     You're still his brother.
	     If he ain't gonna listen to you, he
	     ain't gonna listen to nobody!
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     All right, I'll try. See you later.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SALVY
</b>	     Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Right, the gym.
<b>	
</b>	SALVY leaves. JOEY goes into the building.

</b><b>	INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JOEY is knocking at the door. IRMA opens it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	          (noticing Jake)
	     What's the matter?
<b>	
</b><b>	               IRMA
</b>	     He's doing it again.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	          (goes to Jake)
	     What's the matter? You're drinking.
	     You're eating like an animal.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY sits next to JAKE at the kitchen table. JAKE has a drink
	in his hand, and tears on his face.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY (CONT'D)
</b>	     What's wrong?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (gets up)
	     Nothing...
<b>	
</b>	JAKE goes into the living room. IRMA looks at JOEY. JOEY
	follows JAKE.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM
</b><b>	
</b>	JOEY walks up to JAKE.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (privately, to Joey)
	     I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis,
	     that's what's the matter.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     What're you talking about? He's a
	     heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE holds out his scarred hands.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Look at these hands. These fuckin'
	     hands. I was born with a girl's
	     hands. And even if I put on enough
	     weight to be a heavyweight, I'd be
	     too slow to fight. No matter how
	     big I get, I'll never be big enough
	     to fight Louis.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE pauses. IRMA watches from the doorway.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     That's what I'm sayin'. You
	     shouldn't even think like that.
	     It's crazy.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll
	     never be big enough to fight Louis,
	     but I know Joey, I know...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     You know?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Yeah. Do me a favor.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Sure. What is it?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Hit me in the face.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	          (after a pause)
	     You want me to do what?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     You heard me, I said hit me.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your
	     best shot. On the jaw.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Jack, I got no gloves.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (grabs a nearby towel)
	     Here's your glove.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY wraps it around his fist. IRMA watches. JOEY hits JAKE
	with his right. JAKE holds fast.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Go ahead. Hit me. C'mon, don't
	     worry about it. I want you to hit
	     me with everything you got.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY hauls off and lands him a real belt. JAKE rolls with it
	and stands firm.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Again. Harder.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY hits him again.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Harder. Go 'head.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY hits him again.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Harder.
	          (grabs the towel)
	     Take the towel off.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Jack! Enough!
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Go ahead.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY hits him again. JAKE holds fast. JAKE starts to walk
	away.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     What was that for? I know you can
	     take punches. I can hit you from
	     now to doomsday. What the fuck does
	     that prove?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     See that, I don't feel it. I can
	     take it. I know I can take anybody.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. GLEASON'S GYM - NEXT DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Gleason's, a small gym and fight club, stands on 149th Street
	and 3rd Avenue above a small sandwich shop.
<b>	
</b>	Each day BOBBY GLEASON posts a small sign alongside the door
	listing the fighters who will be working out. JAKE's name is
	posted at the top; the other names are unmemorable.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. GLEASON'S - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Gleason's has a single sparring ring and ten training bags.
	About a dozen managers train their fighters out at Gleason's.
	For 50 cents, spectators sit in the gallery and watch the
	workouts.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE is sparring with JOEY in the ring. They've been working
	out for a while now. The bell rings ending the third round.
	JAKE prances about the ring waiting for the bell to sound
	again.
<b>	
</b>	At that moment, SALVY, along with two other young "BUTTON"
	MEN (actually, they are very young -- about JOEY's age) enter
	the gym. They are well-dressed (over-coat, ties, suits,
	flashy rings, etc.). They say hello to some PEOPLE by the
	door. JAKE looks over and notices them. SALVY looks over to
	the ring.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SALVY
</b>	          (waves)
	     Hey Joey --
<b>	
</b>	JOEY waves back.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SALVY (CONT'D)
</b>	          (waves again)
	     Jake, how you doin'?
<b>	
</b>	JAKE nods to SALVY very cold. SALVY notices and can feel that
	he's not exactly wanted there by JAKE. JOEY notices the same
	and becomes a bit nervous.
<b>	
</b>	SALVY sits down near the ring but not as close as he'd like
	to. His two friends, FRANKIE and GUIDO, sit nearby also.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE goes to JOEY's corner.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Did you know they were coming up
	     here?
<b>	
</b>	JOEY doesn't answer.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	     Answer me when I talk to you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to
	     talk to you. So I...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (interrupting)
	     Don't ever bring those kids up here
	     again! I'm working out, I'm killin'
	     myself in here, and they walk
	     around like they fuckin' own the
	     neighborhood.
<b>	
</b>	SALVY and the OTHERS see JOEY being chewed out by JAKE. They
	begin to feel unwelcome at the gym.
<b>	
</b>	The bell sounds. JAKE is more aggressive now as he corners
	JOEY. JAKE swings away with body punches. JOEY can't block
	them. SALVY and the OTHERS watch.
<b>	
</b>	The bell sounds again. With that, SALVY and the OTHERS start
	to leave.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SALVY
</b>	          (to Joey)
	     Hey Joey, we better go. See you
	     later.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY, dazed, turns to wave.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Go 'head. Wave goodbye. They're
	     your friends.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE watches them leave.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	     And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he
	     think he is? I'm gonna let that
	     fuckin' hard-on come up here and
	     act like a big shot.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     What are you getting so hot about --
	     Tommy Como told him to come down
	     here...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (interrupting)
	     Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como.
	     I don't care about Jesus Christ on
	     the fuckin' cross. I gotta give
	     them a percentage of what I make!
	     I'm in here breaking my ass, not
	     them. Don't ever bring them up here
	     again.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     I didn't tell them to come. Tommy
	     Como...
<b>	
</b>	The bell sounds again. JAKE hits JOEY a few more solid body
	punches. JOEY gets angry and fights back with a flurry of
	punches which have no effect on JAKE. JAKE laughs.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     That's right, fight back. I got
	     laid three times before I came up
	     here this morning and I can still
	     break your ass.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY fights back, but it's no use.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     You cocksucker.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE laughs. The two continue to swing it out, as SALVY
	watches unseen from the doorway.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)
</b><b>	
</b>	The Shorehaven Pool, spic-and-span in the summer sun is the
	closest thing to a country club in the Bronx. An eight foot
	fence stands between the pool and the street.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE, wearing slacks and a sportshirt, hangs out with the
	"BOYS" near the bar area. Older, "MADE" MEN play cards. A
	young FAN walks by and says:
<b>	
</b><b>	               FAN
</b>	     Hey, Jake.
<b>	
</b>	At the opposite end of the pool where the GIRLS gossip, and
	sunbathe, JOEY swaps small talk with VICKIE, a school girl,
	about 15. VICKIE is a knockout.
<b>	
</b>	SALVY, FRANKIE and JUNIOR are with VICKIE and her FRIENDS.
	They joke with JOEY.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE watches SALVY and VICKIE.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE'S P.O.V.: JOEY is talking (PAN) to VICKIE. VICKIE
	giggles. JOEY stands and walks over to JAKE.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (referring to Vickie)
	     Who's that?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Whadda you care?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who
	     is she? What's a matter? You afraid
	     I'm gonna take her on you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna
	     meet her?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Yeah --
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Cause I'll go right over there and
	     bring her here.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Go 'head.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     You sure you wanna meet her? Don't
	     make me go over there, you change
	     your mind and you make me look bad,
	     cause she's really a knockout.
	     She's 15, this kid -- a great piece
	     of ass.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     How do you know? You know her that
	     good?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     No, I see her around the pool. I
	     know her. I know her like that --
	     not like that.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (gesturing to his bandage)
	     Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I
	     don't feel right...
<b>	
</b>	JAKE watches VICKIE.

</b>	          (to Jake)
	     I'm tellin' you, she'll be there, I
	     know she'll be there.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     'Cause I wanna catch her alone.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     How you gonna catch anybody alone
	     at a dance?... I don't know if
	     she'll be there alone... She'll
	     probably be there with her
	     girlfriends or something.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Nah, she don't go with nobody.
	     She's only 15 years old.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     What does that have to do with it?
	     She don't look 15 to me. I heard
	     somethin' with Salvy. She was with
	     him once or somethin', I think. It
	     was like some blonde. That's the
	     one...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Probably. You know she talks to
	     everybody, and not just him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Yeah, she's nice.

<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I

</b>	     Go ahead -- that's all you're good

</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A neighborhood dance is in progress. A small BAND is playing
	while mainly OLDER COUPLES dance. There are TWO PRIESTS
	present. The younger people are divided into two groups --
	the BOYS, who are dressed in suits and ties, and spend most
	of their time at the bar area -- and the GIRLS, who are in
	evening dresses, and spend most of their time dancing
	together.
<b>	
</b>	Some of the more popular GIRLS are surrounded by "WISE-GUYS."
	There are tables near the dance floor with "set ups" (bottles
	of Scotch, rye, and a bucket of ice) on them. These tables
	are the "bases of operation" for different neighborhood
	groups, as if they were street corners.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE and JOEY are walking toward a table. VERA, a young
	neighborhood girl, blocks their way as she bends over to talk
	to some GUYS at a table. VERA's well-built, and knows it.

</b>	JOEY tries to move one way; VERA again blocks his way. This
	little game goes on for a few seconds, then:
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Look, could you move a little.
	     Would you mind, darling?
<b>	
</b><b>	               VERA

<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE

	     Eh, girlie, take a walk.

</b>	          (to Vera)
	     All right, darling, I'll just stand
	     here and wait.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY cups his hands and grabs VERA's breasts. VERA squeals,
	covers her breasts, and moves back. JOEY and JAKE walk past
	her. JOEY smiles.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY and JAKE sit down at an empty table.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE

	a good time.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY (CONT'D)

<b>	
</b>	As they watch, WE SEE, from JAKE's POV:
<b>	
</b>	SALVY, FRANKIE, and JUNIOR show up at VICKIE's table. They
	are in overcoats and hats and don't sit down. They are
	obviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood
	dance -- and VICKIE and her GIRLFRIENDS are glad to go with
	them. They get up to leave.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Be right back.
<b>	
</b>	SALVY, FRANKIE, JUNIOR, VTCKIE and the other TWO GIRLS leave

</b><b>	EXT. SHORE ROAD - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE drives his Packard convertible down Shore Road. VICKIE
	sits in the passenger seat, her blonde hair blowing in the

</b><b>	EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE parks across the street from the new miniature golf

<b>	
</b>	JAKE and VICKIE get out to cross the street.
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     You don't talk very much.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE

<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE

<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE

<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     You don't get nothin' done by

	     Here, I'll help you.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE hands VICKIE the putter, then moves behind her and puts
	her hand on the club.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	     That's it. Just grip up a little

	     feel?
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     It feels real good.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Just keep your eye on the ball.
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     Should I hit it?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Just give it a nice little tap.
<b>	
</b>	VICKIE swings and the ball rolls into the center of the
	windmill. VICKIE breaks free and follows her ball. JAKE
	follows.
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     I can't find my ball.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE

</b><b>	               VICKIE

<b>	
</b>	JAKE takes VICKIE by the arm.

</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     It means the game is over.
<b>

<b>	
</b><b>	INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The bedroom is a few rooms away from the kitchen. JAKE closes
	the door. (There is a warm light in the bedroom.)
<b>

</b>	     Jake, this is your father's

<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     That's all right. He don't mind.
<b>	
</b>	The room is sparsely furnished. On the bureau, there is a
	large framed photo of the boxing brothers: JAKE and JOEY
	LAMOTTA. (JOEY wears a suit in the picture.)
<b>	
</b>	JAKE puts VICKIE on the bed and removes his jacket and tie.

</b><b>	INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 5, 1943)
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE is fighting SUGAR RAY ROBINSON. (It's their 2nd match.)
	WE SEE highlights of the fight: JAKE is fighting ferociously,
	but SUGAR RAY is a formidable opponent. AN ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	gives a blow by blow description. JAKE takes a lot of
	punishment from SUGAR RAY -- until the 8th round. Then, JAKE
	nails SUGAR RAY with a savage left. JAKE chases SUGAR RAY and
	pounds him with a left and a right. SUGAR RAY gets in a right
	cross. They stand toe to toe, fighting. Then, JAKE lands a
	left to SUGAR RAY's stomach, and knocks him through the
	ropes. JAKE goes after SUGAR RAY, but the REFEREE stops him.
	SUGAR RAY gets back into the ring and sinks to one knee,
	while the REFEREE counts to 9. The bell sounds.
<b>	
</b>	TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out that JAKE is the winner.
	JAKE throws kisses. The CROWD goes wild.

</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE's press conference.
<b>	
</b>	FIVE REPORTERS meander around the gym, waiting for JAKE to
	finish sparring. They are not thrilled with their assignment.
	JAKE is not thrilled with having them there.
<b>	
</b>	The gallery is spotted with the usual BRONX TYPES. The lone
	exception is VICKIE, dressed very well, very sensual, and
	quite content to watch JAKE make his SPARRING PARTNERS' lives
	miserable, despite their head and belly protectors.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY is off in one of the corners arguing with ONE of the
<b>	REPORTERS:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     The fuckin' papers are full of
	     Robinson and nothing on Jake -- and
	     Jake knocked him clear outa the
	     ring in Detroit. He's the only guy
	     ever to beat Robinson. Whatsa
	     matter with you? I thought we had
	     an arrangement.
<b>	
</b><b>	               REPORTER
</b>	     We do Joey. You know we do.

<b>	
</b>	The bell sounds, ending the sparring round.
<b>	
</b><b>	               REPORTER
</b>	     I can't print nothing if Jake won't
	     give me nothing.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY walks over to the ring. The REPORTER follows not far
	behind.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     C'mon, Jake. You're makin' us look
	     stupid. I brought these guys up

</b><b>	               REPORTER
</b>	     All right, Jake, you're being
	     talked about as the top
	     middleweight contender. Do you

	     Ray will get you a shot at the
	     title?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Why not? There's nobody else around
	     who wants to fight me; they're all

	     have a shot at the title right now.
<b>	
</b><b>	               REPORTER
</b>	     Well, the word is to get a title
	     shot you have to cooperate with the

<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE

	     I can't tell the difference. I just

</b>	JAKE turns to VICKIE, smiles, and prepares for his next
<b>	SPARRING PARTNER.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY (FEB. 1943)
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE, wearing pleated dress slacks, sits on the edge of the
	bed examining his muscle tone.
<b>	
</b>	He studies his small fists. Squeezes each knuckle. Twists his
	wrists. Clenches. Unclenches.
<b>	
</b>	VICKIE steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and
	panties.
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE

</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Come here.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE watches VICKIE approach him. He respects her as he would
	a shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie.
<b>	
</b>	His round hands caress her smooth skin. He glides his bruised
	knuckles across her shoulders, pride on his face.
<b>	
</b>	She kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously, then his bruised
	face.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)

<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Go 'head. Do it.
<b>	
</b>	She pulls off his shorts. VICKIE is now getting excited. She
	kisses his chest and licks it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     I like the gym smell.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE

</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     Oh, Jake.
<b>	
</b>	She caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his
	erection.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE's lips are trembling. He quickly turns his back on
	VICKIE, goes into the bathroom, and gets a full glass of cold
	water.
<b>	
</b>	VICKIE watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold
	water. She is shocked and surprised.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE

	     This Robinson, I gotta beat him

	     come near me.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE grabs her again and kisses her. Then, gently but firmly,
	he turns her around and pushes her out. (It's starting again,
	and he must stop it.) He goes back the bathroom and closes
	the door.

<b>	
</b>	THE FOURTH ROUND: JAKE is in serious trouble. SUGAR RAY
	knocks him with a hard right, then a series of rights and

	in there.
<b>	
</b>	THE SEVENTH ROUND: JAKE, coming on strong, forces SUGAR RAY
	into his own corner, then lands a left hook to his chin.
	SUGAR RAY drops, and takes a nine count. This time, however,
	the blow does not have a crippling effect on SUGAR RAY;

	the winner. JAKE is stunned. The CROWD boos so loud and for
	so long that THE ANNOUNCER is unable to introduce the
	fighters in the next bout.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	JOEY and TONY are in the dressing room. JAKE sits on the
	table, dejected. His hand is being examined by a DOCTOR. TWO
	HANGERS-ON are also present.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	          (angry)
	     They robbed us! Those fuckin'
	     judges -- What the fuck fight were
	     they watching? If I see them on the
	     street, I'll break their heads.
	     Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass!
	     Those judges give him the decision
	     'cause he's goin in the army next
	     week! How else could this have
	     happened?... What do you think they
	     gave him the decision for, that's
	     why.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (almost to himself)
	     Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked
	     him down. What did I do wrong? I
	     don't understand.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     You won and was robbed! You didn't
	     do nothin' wrong.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     I dunno. Maybe I don't deserve to
	     win. I've done a lot of bad things.
	     I dunno...
<b>	
</b>	TONY goes to the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOYE
</b>	     Fuck that. This was the fight. This
	     coulda done it. This was our shot.
	     They out and out robbed us.
<b>	
</b>	MARIO comes back from the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	               MARIO
</b>	     Vickie is here, Jake.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     I don't wanna see nobody.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     You want us to wait for you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     No, take her home. I wanna be alone
	     for a while. Everybody go.
<b>	
</b>	They exit.
<b>	
</b><b>	                                   DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT. BATHROOM NEAR THE DRESSING ROOM
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE, now alone, goes into the bathroom. He looks in the
	bathroom mirror. After a pauseg, he touches his newly
	acquired bruises and bandages. He combs his hair.
<b>	
</b>	We hear the beginning of an early Frank Sinatra song. This
	song carries over onto the following MONTAGE.
<b>	
</b><b>	MONTAGE
</b><b>	
</b>	This MONTAGE covers the period between 1943 and early 1947.
	It shows JAKE hard at work fighting all the tough guys he
	can. Each of the fights will be introduced by the
	corresponding title card from the "Big Fights" film showing a
	boxing glove with the fighters' names and the places of the
	fights superimposed on it. The actual fight images will be
	black and white newspaper photos JUMP CUT together to
	simulate real action. For example: In still #1 JAKE is about
	to land a punch on an OPPONENT.
<b>	
</b><b>	                                   CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b>	Still #2, and the punch lands, distorting the OPPONENT's
	face, sweat spraying out everywhere. Live sound effects
	accompany these stills.
<b>	
</b>	The fight stills are INTERCUT with 16mm black and white home
	movies of JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY, etc. (to be shot in 16mm black
	and white).
<b>	
</b>	It'll go something like this:
<b>	
</b>	A) JAKE VS. FRITZIE ZIVIC at the Detroit Olympia (January 14,
<b>	1944)
</b><b>	
</b>	B) JAKE, VICKIE, and JOEY, wearing sunglasses, pose in front
	of a Cadillac. (1944)
<b>	
</b>	C) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Madison Square Garden
	(February 23, 1945)
<b>	
</b>	D) JAKE and VICKIE getting married. (This will be a black and
	white still photo, posed especially for the occasion.) (1945,
<b>	
</b>	New Jersey courthouse)
<b>	
</b>	E) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Comiskey Park, Chicago
	(September 26, 1945)
<b>	
</b>	F) JAKE and VICKIE on vacation -- very loving. They are
	dancing, and he allows her to knock him into the pool. Then,
	JAKE gives VICKIE a present by the poolside. She opens the
	box and takes out a white garment and turban. She kisses
<b>	JAKE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                                   CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b>	VICKIE dressed in the outfit. She looks very much like Lana
	Turner in "The Postman Always Rings Twice." She kisses JAKE.
<b>	(1946)
</b><b>	
</b>	G) JAKE VS. JIMMY EDGAR at Detroit (The University of Detroit
	Stadium) (June 12, 1946)
<b>	
</b>	H) JOEY's marriage. JAKE and VICKIE are there as witnesses.
	(Could also be a still photo as D was.) (1946)
<b>	
</b>	I) JAKE VS. BOB SATTERFIELD at Wrigley Field, Chicago
	(September 12, 1946)
<b>	
</b>	J) JAKE and VICKIE in front of their new Pelham Parkway
	house. It is an affluent, split-level house, an idyllic scene
	-- stone terrace, freshly cut lawn, etc. JAKE carries VICKIE
	inside.
<b>	
</b><b>	                                   CUT TO:
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE and VICKIE with their two boys JACK, age 2, and JOEY,
	age 1 in the backyard of the Pelham Parkway house; they are
	having a cookout. JOEY and his WIFE and their two children (a
	BOY and a GIRL about the same ages as JAKE's) are there also.
<b>	(1947)
</b><b>	
</b>	K) JAKE VS. TOMMY BELL at Madison Square Garden (March 14,
<b>	1947)
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE (1947)
</b><b>	
</b>	WE SEE an early model, round screen television. Nearby an old
	radio. On it, Sinatra is finishing the song we heard in the
	preceding montage.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE enters, and turns down the volume on the radio. WE SEE
	JAKE's living room; it is late forties modern.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY and VICKIE are seated around the coffee table, which is
	near the television. There are some remnants of a snack on
	the table. JAKE's TWO BOYS are playing nearby.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (to Joey as he turns down
	          the radio)
	     I just weighed myself - I'm 161. No
	     more deals like this Janiro
	     bullshit. I didn't tell you to do
	     it in the first place.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Jake, you're the one who said you
	     could get down to 155! What did I
	     do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (angry)
	     Well, sometimes you shouldn't
	     listen to me! Now I don't know if I
	     can make it down to 155. I'm having
	     trouble making 160, and without
	     telling me, you sign me for a fight
	     at 155 pounds, and if I don't make
	     155, I forfeit $15,000! You're
	     supposed to know what you're doin'.
	     You're supposed to be a manager!
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     You want the title shot?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Say what you're gonna say.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     You want the title shot or not?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Say what you gotta say. Don't be a
	     smart ass.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	          (yelling)
	     This Janiro's an up-and-coming
	     fighter, this kid you gotta knock
	     out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm
	     telling you, this is your step
	     towards getting a shot at the
	     title. Listen to me: I'm telling
	     you. You been killin' yourself for
	     three years. There's nobody left --
	     they're afraid to fight you.
	     This Janiro's up-and-coming. He
	     don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart,
	     wipe him out! What are you worried
	     about? Your weight? Look, even if
	     you lose they're gonna think you're
	     weak; they're gonna think you're
	     not the fighter you used to be.
	     They'll match you with guys they
	     were afraid to match you with
	     before, and then you'll kill them
	     and you'll get your title shot. And
	     if you beat this kid Janiro, they
	     gotta give you a shot at the title
	     because there's nobody else. Either
	     way you win and you do it on your
	     own -- just like you want it. All
	     right?
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     Joey's right. Janiro's up-and
	     coming, he's good looking...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (interrupting)
	     What do you mean, "good looking?"
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     Well, he's popular. A lotta people
	     like Janiro. You beat him and it
	     only figures they'll wanna see you
	     get a title shot. But, what do I
	     know? I should keep my mouth shut,
	     I should...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (interrupting)
	     Who asked you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     But, Jake, I was just...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (interrupting)
	     Who asked you?
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     I was just...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (interrupting)
	     Who asked you?
<b>	
</b>	VICKIE, amazed, gets up to leave.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE glares at her.
<b>	
</b>	VICKIE rounds up the kids and takes them into the kitchen.
<b>	(MOVING SHOT).
</b><b>	
</b>	WE SEE VICKIE in the kitchen angrily throwing things around.
	We clearly see the tension as she cleans up, muttering to
	herself.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	          (turns to Joey)
	     All right, manager. Everybody had
	     their say around here. Now this is
	     what I'm gonna say. I'm gonna get
	     down to 155, and I'm gonna destroy
	     this kid -- get my title shot. And
	     don't ever bet 15 thousand without
	     my sayso again.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE comes into the kitchen. He tries to make up with VICKIE.
	She plays hard-to-get. They begin to tease each other.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. COPACABANA LOUNGE - NIGHT (1947)
</b><b>	
</b>	A COMEDIAN is in the middle of his act. JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY,
	and JANET sit at a nearby table. JANET, an attractive blonde,
	is are of JOEY's girlfriends; the moment you set eyes on her,
	you know this is not his wife.
<b>	
</b>	The lounge is very crowded. The COMEDIAN interrupts his
	routine to point out that JAKE LAMOTTA is in the audience,
	and even tries a little harmless joking at JAKE's expense.
<b>	
</b><b>	               COMEDIAN
</b>	     Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
	     point out a special guest we have
	     with us tonight -- The Raging Bull,
	     The Bronx Bull, Mr. Jake LaMotta.
<b>	
</b>	There is applause. JAKE smiles, and gives a hesitant wave.
<b>	
</b><b>	               COMEDIAN (CONT'D)
</b>	     Stand up, Jake, c'mon. Oh, you are
	     standing. Sorry.
	          (laughs)
	     Just kiddin', Jake.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE waves a fist at the COMEDIAN, good-naturedly playing
	along with the joke -- even though he hates it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (to Joey)
	     Look at this abuse I gotta take.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY, VICKIE, and JANET are amused.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	          (joking)
	     What's so funny?
	          (lifting his glass)
	     Cheers! Post-time. Joey, Vickie,
	     and...
	          (to Janet)
	     What's your name again, darling?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JANET
</b>	     Janet.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE Smiles. They all drink.
<b>	
</b>	SALVY, a little older, but still young-looking, and dressed
	even better than when we last saw him (flashy rings, etc.),
	comes over to their table. He walks around like he owns the
	fucking place. JAKE hates it.
<b>	
</b><b>	               SALVY
</b>	     Hi, Joey. Jake, how you doin'?
	     Vickie...
<b>	
</b>	They respond. JAKE is cold towards SALVY.
<b>	
</b>	SALVY goes on his way to COMO's table.
<b>	
</b>	As SALVY walks away, JAKE turns to VICKIE.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     What're you lookin' at? You lookin'
	     at him?
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     Don't tell me "No." I saw you
	     lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     I'm not interested in him.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     You're not interested in him?
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     No, I'm not.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	     In other words, you're not
	     interested in him but you'd be
	     interested in somebody else, right?
<b>	
</b><b>	               VICKIE
</b>	     Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (turns to Joey, referring
	          to Salvy)
	     Look at this, all of a sudden
	     everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around
	     here. Did you see the way she was
	     lookin' at him?
<b>	
</b><b>	               JOEY
</b>	     Nah, she would never...
<b>	
</b><b>	               JAKE
</b>	          (interrupting)
	     Didn't you just see her lookin' at
	      him? She told me no, but I don't
	      believe her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	           (uncomfortable)
	      C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy
	      about you.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE gives him a suspicious look. JOEY feels uneasy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      I'd just love to catch her. Oooooh,
	      I'd just love to catch her once.
<b>	
</b>	Drinks arrive at their table.
<b>	
</b><b>	                WAITER
</b>	      These are from Tommy Como.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE looks up but can't see where COMO is. JOEY gets up.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	           (to Jake)
	      Excuse me for a minute. Be right
	      back.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	           (sarcastic)
	      Don't be long. I'm afraid with all
	      these tough guys here.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY goes to COMO's table in the rear of the lounge. JAKE
	slides over and watches. JOEY shakes hands with COMO. SALVY
	is there at COMO's table. JOEY comes right back.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	      Jake, come over for a few minutes.
	      Tommy wants to say hello to you.
	      C'mon, just come and say hello.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE doesn't like the idea, but goes along with it anyway.
<b>	
</b>	ANOTHER ANGLE: COMO's table. JAKE comes over.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Hi, Tommy. How are you?
<b>	
</b><b>	                TOMMY
</b>	      Jake, sit down for a minute.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE sits. SALVY smiles and nods to JAKE. JAKE barely nods
	back.
<b>	
</b><b>	                TOMMY (CONT'D)
</b>	           (his arm around Jake)
	      Fuckin' kid! You're the best
	      fuckin' fighter around. Loved what
	      you did to Satterfield. Them
	      "moulan yans" -- forget about it.
	      They're all afraid to fight you.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE

	      good?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Never felt better.
<b>	
</b><b>	                TOMMY
</b>	      Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      He should.
<b>	
</b><b>	                TOMMY
</b>	           (to Salvy)
	      This Janiro's a good fiahter,
	      pretty good-lookin' kid.
<b>	
</b><b>	                SALVY
</b>	      Bet on him three times. Always come
	      through for me.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE just stares, holding his anger in.
<b>	
</b>	There is a pause.
<b>	
</b><b>	                TOMMY
</b>	      How's the weight? Ok?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Yeah, the weight's Ok.
<b>	
</b>	Another pause. TOMMY smiles and moves closer to JAKE.
<b>	
</b><b>	                TOMMY
</b>	      All right, lemme ask you something.
	      Let's say I was a good friend of
	      yours. And I was telling you I was
	      gonna bet a lot of money on you in
	      this Janiro fight. What would you
	      tell me?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
<b>	
</b>	TOMMY sips his drink.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

</b>	VICKIE is in bed trying to sleep. JAKE comes out of the

<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE

<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      I never noticed his face.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      You sure you're not thinking of him
	      right now?
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      Positive.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      You're the one who said he was good
	      looking. You think he's good
	      looking 'cause I know you think
	      he's good-looking. I'll smash his
	      face inside out. I'll make him into
	      dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's
	      good-looking when I get through
	      with him. So you just go ahead and
	      think about who you want.

</b>	TONY JANIRO, wearing boxer trunks, steps off the scale.
	Commissioner COL. EDDIE EAGAN, a white-haired, heavyset man
	in his mid-forties, calls out the weight.
<b>	
</b>	The basement of the New York Boxing Commission on Worth

<b>	MANAGERS.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                EAGAN
</b>	      Tony Janiro, 151 lbs. and one half.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE steps on the scale. He looks weak and woozy. After the

<b>	
</b><b>	                EAGAN (CONT'D)
</b>	      Jake LaMotta, 155 lbs. and one
	      fourth.

</b>	There's a commotion in JAKE's camp. JANIRO smiles.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Just a minute.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE, JOEY, and TONY confer.

</b>	      Ok. This is official.
<b>	
</b>	LAMOTTA stares at JANIRO.

</b><b>	INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	It's the last round and JAKE is pouring it on a beaten and
	virtually helpless JANIRO.
<b>	
</b>	The CROWD chants:
<b>	
</b><b>	                CROWD
</b>	      LaMotta.
<b>	
</b>	HALF THE AUDIENCE is already on its feet. The kill is
	imminent -- and they love it.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE lands one blow after another. He is relentless.
<b>	
</b>	Several rows back, TOMMY COMO, SALVY and SEVERAL OTHER "MADE"
	GUYS sit with sober looks on their faces.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE moves in fast, and with a powerful barrage, smashes
	JANIRO's nose -- plastering it against his left cheek.
<b>	
</b>	The final bell rings. JANIRO, his legs all rubber, staggers
	back to his corner.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE prances about, kissing his fists and throwing them to
	the CROWD. JOEY rushes out, throws JAKE's leopard skin robe
	over him and embraces him. TONY follows. JAKE looks right at
	COMO and SALVY.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring:
<b>

<b>	
</b>	JAKE, weak from losing the weight and winning the fight,
	still manages to prance around the ring victoriously.

</b>	           (to Vickie)
	      C'mere, let me talk to you for a

<b>	
</b>	There is an awkward silence as he grabs VICKIE by the arm and

<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY (CONT'D)
</b>	      What're you doin' with Salvy? You

</b>	      Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's

<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY

</b>	      You don't sleep with him. I do. I

	      If he thinks I'm lookin' at

	      nobody. If he saw the two of us
	      talking together right now, you'd
	      be in trouble too -- believe me.
	      Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old.
	      I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake,
	      but you don't know. He gets crazy
	      sometimes. I'm scared.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	      Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's
	      got a lotta aggravation. He's been
	      a top contender too long.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      That's right, take his part. You're
	      his brother. He's never gonna be

	      him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	      And you're drinking with them right
	      now.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      And I'm gonna finish my drink. And,
	      I'm gonna have a good time, because
	      I ain't doing nothing wrong.

	      just take it easy before this gets
	      out of hand.

</b>	As the conversation gets louder, PEOPLE begin to notice.
	PAUL, the owner (a tough-looking, well-dressed guy), and some
	BOUNCERS also become aware of the argument.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	      Get the fuck outa here. What did

<b>	
</b>	JOEY goes for SALVY. PEOPLE react.
<b>	
</b>	The GIRLS begin to scream. VICKIE exits. JOEY notices her
	leave, and calls after her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY (CONT'D)

	      Ain't there never supposed to be no

</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT. COPACABANA - NIGHT

<b>	
</b>	After a few moments, PAUL and the BOUNCERS from the Copa come
	out. The BOUNCERS pull PATSY away. They try to separate SALVY

<b>

	      can make it easier for him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	      Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't
	      even say hello to anybody else --
	      you know that. But you know when
	      Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus
	      Christ Almighty could get off the
	      fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna
	      talk him out of it. I'm his kid
	      brother. I got no say with Jake on
	      this. He thinks he can buck
	      everybody and make it on his own.
<b>	
</b><b>	                COMO
</b>	      Make it on his own? Does he know
	      the kind of money involved? I mean
	      the real money. He thinks he's
	      gonna become champ on his own?
	      We're gonna sit by and see some nut
	      come in there and hold one of the
	      most important titles in the world?
	      A nut who don't listen to nobody or
	      respect nobody? Is he really crazy?
	      Listen, Joey, you understand, you
	      tell him. I don't care how great he
	      is or how colorful. He could beat
	      all the Sugar Ray Robinsons and all
	      the Janiros he wants to. He ain't
	      gonna get a shot at the title
	      without us. I'm not askin' you to
	      do another thing except get that

</b>	      Billy Fox, 173 3/4 pounds.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY removes JAKE's leopard-skin robe as he steps on the

<b>	
</b><b>	                EAGAN
</b>	      You were a big favorite in this

<b>

</b>	      Now the fight's off the books

	      Meyer Lansky couldn't get a bet

</b><b>	INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT (NOV. 14, 1947)
</b><b>	
</b>	The old Garden is packed. The EX-CHAMPS, the PRESS, the
	OFFICIALS, the MOB GUYS, the FANS -- they're all here.
<b>	
</b>	The FIGHTERS are announced. BILLY FOX and JAKE touch gloves
	and return to their corners.
<b>	
</b>	FOX is taller and has a longer reach than JAKE.
<b>	
</b>	The bell sounds and the FIGHTERS come out. FOX goes to the
	head; JAKE goes to the body.
<b>	
</b>	FOX lands a solid blow to JAKE's jaw, but LAMOTTA is unfazed.
	FOX is surprised. In the past, his opponents have gone down
	when he connected.
<b>	
</b>	In the audience, COMO, SALVY, and some other BOYS watch with
	interest.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE moves in with a rapid series of trademark body blows.
	All of a sudden, FOX is wobbly. JAKE goes for the head, then
	cuts his punch short. FOX is about to go down.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE throws his arms around FOX to make sure he doesn't fall.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	           (to Fox)
	      Stand up! What the fuck are you
	      doin'?
<b>	
</b>	The REFEREE breaks them apart and FOX remounts his attack.
	JAKE bicycles into a corner and lets FOX work him over.
<b>	
</b>	FOX connects: once, twice, three times. JAKE barely defends
	himself -- but he doesn't go down either.
<b>	
</b>	The CROWD starts to smell a fix. There are calls from the
<b>	AUDIENCE.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                CROWD
</b>	      Got your swimming trunks on, Jake?
	      I hope they're paying you enough.
	      Fake, fake.
<b>	
</b><b>	                                    TIME CUT:
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE's corner. JAKE is acting stunned. TONY, not aware of
	what's going on, is slapping JAKE.
<b>	
</b><b>	                TONY
</b>	      What's the matter with you? What's
	      the matter with you?
<b>	
</b><b>	                                    TIME CUT:
</b><b>	
</b>	The sign reads "Round Four." JAKE is in the center of the
	ring taking a relentless pasting from FOX. JAKE's arms hang
	at waist level... FOX lands one blow after another. The stink
	of a fix permeates the arena.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE is furious that FOX can't deck him. He curses through
	his mouthpiece (as he absorbs blow after blow):
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter
	      with you, you motherfucker? Hit me!
<b>	
</b>	Boos and catcalls echo through the Garden. This is not even a
	fight. The REFEREE, realizing this, steps in between FOX and
	LAMOTTA, waves his arms and signals that FOX is the winner by
	a technical knockout.
<b>	
</b>	As he does, JAKE spits his mouthpiece in disgust at FOX and
	struts back to his corner.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE, JOEY, and TONY are already on their way out of the
	arena as the REFEREE declares FOX the winner.
<b>	
</b>	COMO and the OTHERS, satisfied, get up to leave.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	As a REPORTER and a PHOTOGRAPHER come through the door, WE
	SEE and hear a commotion in the hall behind them. They rush
	in, look, and stop by the door. There is silence -- except
	for JAKE'S uncontrollable sobbing. The atmosphere is like
	that of funeral.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE is seated behind the rubbing table. He is still in his
	leopard-skin robe. His head hangs low as he sobs.
<b>	
</b>	The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture. The HANDLER motions to him
	to stop, and then goes and sits near the door. The REPORTER
	still stands near the doorway, seeming quite stunned by the
	scene he is witnessing, but nevertheless continuing to
	scribble away on his pad.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY, standing near JAKE, has his back to everyone; his
	shoulders are shaking, his lips are tightly drawn. He cries
	soundlessly. TONY is pacing nearby.
<b>	
</b><b>	                TONY
</b>	      Don't fight anymore!
	           (pause)
	      It's a free country, don't fight
	      anymore!
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	           (between sobs)
	      Why did they have to stop it? Why
	      did they have to stop it?
<b>	
</b>	The REPORTER leans over to the HANDLER and whispers.
<b>	
</b><b>	                REPORTER
</b>	      What happened?
<b>	
</b><b>	                HANDLER
</b>	           (quietly)
	      He must've been really hurt in the
	      2nd. He didn't answer me when I
	      tried to tell him something in the
	      corner.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE, still buried in his robe, becomes aware of the hum of
	voices and shouts out:
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Get everyone out of here!
<b>	
</b>	The REPORTER and the PHOTOGRAPHER leave. JAKE continues to
	sob.

</b><b>	
</b>	INSERT: CLOSE UP of a Daily News Headline from November 22,

<b>	
</b>	JAKE, dejected, sits on the couch. In front of him, on the
	coffee table are scattered several newspapers -- including
	the one with the headline we have just seen.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY paces in front of JAKE.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	           (yelling)
	      It woulda been so easy, Jack. So

<b>	
</b>	JOEY goes into a boxing stance.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY (CONT'D)
</b>	      Stick out your hands, Jake.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE

</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	      G'wan, do it.
	           (jabs at him)
	      Protect yourself, rummy.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE, out of reflex, sticks out his hands. As he does, JOEY
	feigns a hit and falls onto the floor -- "out cold." JAKE
	looks down at him.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY pops to his feet.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY (CONT'D)
</b>	      See? That's all there was to it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE

<b>	
</b>	JAKE steps into the ring to both cheers and boos (many still

<b>	
</b><b>	                ANNOUNCER

	      Good luck.

<b>	
</b><b>	                                    TIME CUT:
</b><b>	
</b>	The opening bell sounds. CERDAN and LAMOTTA touch gloves and
	begin to fight.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE is hot: there's no stopping him tonight. He fights like
	a man possessed.
<b>	
</b>	CERDAN clinches JAKE to avoid his brutal body blows. JAKE
	pushes him out of the clinch in disgust.
<b>	
</b>	There are no more boos. JAKE has won over the crowd.
<b>	
</b><b>	                                    TIME CUT:

	Punches to the body, then to the head, then back to the body.
	The bell sounds.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE walks back to his corner and sits down. JOEY is
	ecstatic:
<b>	
</b><b>	                JOEY
</b>	      Look at him, Jackie! You got at!
	      The fuckin' championship! He's

<b>	
</b>	JAKE doesn't have the chance. The REFEREE, standing in
	CERDAN's corner, waves his hands signaling the end of the
	fight.
<b>	
</b>	The REFEREE holds up JAKE's hands as THE ANNOUNCER takes the
	mike:

	      the world by a knockout after nine
	      rounds, the Bronx Bull, Jake
	      LaMotta!
<b>	
</b>	JOEY is all over him. TONY helps VICKIE through the MOB.
<b>	
</b>	In his corner, CERDAN holds his head in his hands and says,
	"My title, my title!"
<b>	
</b>	The OFFICIALS clear a circle as they bring over the jewel
	studded championship belt. JOE LOUIS fastens the belt around
	JAKE's waist.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE touches the oversized belt with his bloody gloves. Tears
	fall across JAKE's huge grin as he holds his hands high in
	the air. It is the most glorious night in his life.

</b>	JAKE LAMOTTA, 34 years old, wearing a tux, steps in front of
	a large painted wall mural of the Cerdan fight as he enters
	his club.
<b>	
</b>	The Lounge is dominated by a large circular bar. Featured
	entertainers perform on a raised platform in the center of
	the bar.
<b>	
</b>	The club is half filled with SPORTS, ENTERTAINMENT and MOB
<b>	TYPES.
</b><b>	
</b>	The small BAND plays a routine fanfare as JAKE steps onto the
	platform. He takes the mike with one hand and silences the
	BAND with the other. The applause dies out as he speaks:
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
	      It's a thrill to be standin' here
	      talking to you wonderful people. In
	      fact, it's a thrill to be standin'.
	      I haven't seen so many people since
	      my last fight at Madison Square
	      Garden. After that fight a reporter
	      asked me, "Jake, where do you go
	      from here?" I said, "To a
	      hospital."
<b>	
</b>	About HALF THE PATRONS are listening; of them, HALF are
	laughing, SOME a little too loud.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      I fought one hundred and six
	      professional fights and none of
	      them bums figured out how to fight
	      me -- they kept hitting me in the
	      head!
	           (calls to the bar)
	      Will somebody at the bar -- Linda? 
	      - get me a drink. I figure if I'm
	      gonna work to drunks I might as
	      well be one of 'em! I like this
	      place. It's a family type club...
	      every night I see a lot of fathers
	      sitting out there with their young
	      daughters! That's nice.
<b>	
</b>	LINDA hands him a drink.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      Thanks, honey. -- She's terrific.
	      The kinda girl you wanta take home
	      to meet your father. Especially if
	      your old man's a degenerate! --
	      Here's a toast! "To your health!
	      You only live once. But if you play
	      it right, once is enough." I
	      shouldn't be drinkin' like this
	      'cause I'm tryin' to lose weight.
	      I'm on this terrific diet -- I'm
	      allowed to eat anything I want. As
	      long as I don't swallow it! Well, I
	      never had much luck with my weight.
	      In fact, -- I never had much luck
	      with anything -- until about a few
	      years ago, when this happened --
<b>	
</b>	He indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause,
	of which there is some.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      ... thanks, I'm glad to see you
	      remember. For those of you that
	      don't... that's me takin' the title
	      from Cerdan.
	      You know, the tough thing about
	      winnin' the title... the next thing
	      you gotta do is have a rematch...
	      just to show it wasn't no fluke. So
	      what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a
	      really great champ, after I beat
	      him... he gets himself killed in
	      that airplane crash... a pretty
	      rotten break for him. That's why I
	      don't like to fly. People say to
	      me, "Look, Jake, when your time is
	      up, your time is up." And I say,
	      "Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane
	      and the pilot's time is up?" As
	      good as Cerdan was, I could've
	      taken him again. But I never got
	      the chance to prove it wasn't no
	      fluke. He got killed but he got to
	      be what they call a legend. I don't
	      know what's worse -- bein' a fluke
	      or bein' a legend. -- That's the
	      kinda luck I got. That's why I quit
	      the ring and moved down here from
	      New York. My wife said, "You gotta
	      get outa this town, Jake." Come to
	      think of it... the boxing
	      commission said the same thing! But
	      I don't miss New York. Give me
	      Miami any day.
<b>	
</b>	The AUDIENCE applauds.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      Miami's a great place. I get along
	      with everybody in this town... even
	      the police force... They got the
	      best cops here money can buy! --
	      Only kiddin'. By the way... me and
	      my wife Vickie's gettin' ready to
	      celibrate our eleventh wedding
	      anniversary.
<b>	
</b>	More applause.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      We get along real great. We fight a
	      little but I never really belted
	      her on purpose. Once  in a while
	      I'm standin' there doin' little
	      shadow-boxin' and she happens to
	      walk right into the shadow... I
	      can't help that.
	      She says, "Whataya hittin' me for?"
	      I says, "It's nothin'. It's only a
	      love tap." She says, "It's a good
	      thing you're not crazy about me!" --
	      I am crazy about her. I heard her
	      talkin' to a friend on the phone
	      and she was sayin', "After eleven
	      years, I'm still in love with the
	      same guy." -- If I ever find out
	      who the bum is, I'll kill him!
	      Women. You can't live with 'em, you
	      can't live without 'em.
<b>	
</b>	Then, suddenly, falling into character... he quotes lago's
	speech in Othello.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      "'Oh, beware, my lord, of jealousy.
	      It is the green-eyed monster, which
	      doth mock the meat it feeds on.
	      That cuckold lives in bliss who,
	      certain of his fate, loves not his
	      woronger; But O, what damned
	      minutes tells he o'er who dotes,
	      yet doubts -- suspects, yet fondly
	      loves!" -- That's from somethin'
	      called "Othello" --
<b>	
</b><b>	OR, ALTERNATE SPEECH:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      Is whispering nothing? Is leaning
	      cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses?
	      Kissing with inside lip? Stopping
	      the career of laughter with a sign?
	      -- A note infallible of breaking
	      honesty -- horsing foot on foot?
	      Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks
	      more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon,
	      midnight? and all eyes blind with
	      the pin and web but theirs, theirs
	      only, that would unseen be wicked?
	      Is this nothing? Why, then the
	      world and all that's in't is
	      nothing; The covering sky is
	      nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife
	      is nothing; nor nothing have these
	      nothings, if this be nothing." --
	      That's from something called "The
	      Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You
	      all remember Shakespeare.
	      He wrote all them famous plays one
	      after the other, then he went into
	      a big slump and he ain't done
	      anything good in years. That speech
	      is about jealousy -- jealousy's a
	      bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot
	      of guys... take me... I almost
	      killed my brother... I love him...
	      he's my family... I mean, there's
	      nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And
	      that's the way we been goin' thru
	      life -- doin' nothin' for each
	      other! Anytime he got in trouble
	      when we was kids, I got him out of
	      it. You know, he used to steal
	      little things when we was growin'
	      up. But he was particular... only
	      stole things that begin with an 'a'
	      -- a watch, a car, a suit, a
	      ring... But I was wrong... I
	      shoulda never hit my brother.
	      Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every
	      time I need somethin' I gotta go
	      shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist
	      once told me, "When you hit your
	      brother you're really hittin' your
	      mother, but you can't admit it to
	      yourself." He's really crazy. I
	      woulda never hit my mother. I mean,
	      only in self-defense!

</b><b>	
</b>	The LAMOTTA-DAUTHUILLE middleweight championship is told
	through the eyes and words of the RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER. JAKE is
	not doing well.
<b>	
</b><b>	                RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER
</b>	      ... Ladies and gentlemen, I've sat
	      in front of these microphones for
	      over twenty years but this is the
	      strangest championship bout I've
	      ever seen. With two minutes to go
	      in the final round, the champion,
	      the mighty Bull from the Bronx, is
	      just simply taking punch after
	      punch from the challenger.
	      Dauthuille scores a combination,
	      then backpedals. LaMotta pursues
	      him. One minute to go. Laurent
	      DauthuiLlle, who has already beat
	      Lamotta in a non-title bout, is
	      about to fulfill a dream -- to
	      bring the middleweight crown back
	      to France.
<b>	
</b>	In the ring, JAKE looks like he's on queer street. Bouncing
	off the ropes, opening his jaw to DAUTHUILLE. But
	DAUTHUILLE's punches lack strength. JAKM is playing possum.
<b>	
</b><b>	                RINGSIDE'ANNOUNCER
</b>	      Thirty seconds to go. The Bull
	      starts to swing. LaMotta comes in
	      for a brutal body combinaticn: one,
	      two, three, four punches. LaMotta
	      has landed a solid left hook to the
	      Frenchman's jaw! Dauthuille seems
	      confused. LaMotta is swinging
	      wildly now: right, left, right,
	      left! Dauthuille is backing off!
	      Everyone is on their feet! I can
	      hardly see, ladies and gentlemen.
	      Dauthuille is on the ropes. LaMotta
	      hits a right -- Dauthuille is down!
	      Dauthuille is down! Referee Lou
	      Handler is counting him out --
	      three, four, five -- if Dauthuille
	      can stand, he'll win the decision --
	      eight, nine --  Dauthuille is on
	      one knee -- ten! It's all over!
	      With thirteen seconds left on the
	      clock, Jake LaMotta has retained
	      his middleweight championship in
	      one of the most remarkable combacks
	      in boxing! Dauthuille is standing
	      now, confused. But the fight is
	      over.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANNOUNCER holds up JAKE's victorious hand. He seems as
	surprised as everyone else.

	calls out:

	      I shoulda never hit my brother.

</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      Jake.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE, chagrined, steps over to the car.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      I'm sorry. I had to work late last
	      night. Slept at the club.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      I'm leaving your Jake.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Sure, what else is new?
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      No. This time it's true. I didn't
	      bother to tell you until I had
	      everything worked out.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE tries to open the door. It's locked.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Open the door, Vickie.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      No. I won't talk to you where you
	      can use your hands on me.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting
	      a divorce. I'm getting custody of
	      the kids.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Aw, c'mon, Vick --
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      I'm sick of it. I can't watch you
	      this way. You're too drunk all the
	      time. There's too many girls. I
	      can't... I don't wanna talk about
	      it. I made up my mind.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE tries to reach in the window, but VICKIE hits the power
	switch, closing it and catching his hand. She now has to yell
	to him:
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE (CONT'D)
</b>	      You got three days to get your
	      stuff out of the house. After that,
	      the cops will be there. I have the
	      kids with me. I never want to see
	      you again.
<b>	
</b>	VICKIE turns her face and drives away.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE grabs at the Cadillac, but it is bigger and stronger
	than him.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE is left alone in the parking lot. The car is gone.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JAKE'S OFFICE - DAY (JAN. 9, 1957)
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE has an office above the lounge. Ever since VICKIE left,
	it's also been his apartment.
<b>	
</b>	The place is a mess. JAKE sends his laundry out when he runs
	out of clean clothes. Dirty socks, shorts and shirts are
	scattered randomly. Empty whiskey bottles on the desk, empty
	beer cans in the wastebasket.
<b>	
</b><b>	                1ST DEPUTY

<b>	
</b><b>	                1ST DEPUTY
</b>	      I don't run the joint. They just

</b><b>	                JAKE

<b>	
</b><b>	                2ND DEPUTY

<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Hey, I'm a big tax payer down here.
	      Don't that entitle me to some

<b>	
</b>	The SECOND DEPUTY shows JAKE a photo.
<b>

</b>	      I dunno.
<b>	
</b><b>	                2ND DEPUTY
</b>	      She says you introduced her to men.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      I introduced a lot of people to
	      men. So what? What does that mean?

<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE, wearing a suit, walks up to the door and pushes the
	bell.
<b>	
</b>	VICKIE opens the door and looks at him over the chain.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      Are you drunk?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      No. Open the door.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE tries to touch her face through the doorway crack, but
	she steps back.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      Please, Vick. I won't bother you.
	      I'm out on bail. You can send the
	      kids next door. I just gotta pick
	      one thing up, then I'll get outa
	      here.
<b>	
</b>	VICKIE thinks a moment, then opens the door and lets JAKE in.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      The kids are sleeping.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      I promise I just gotta pick up one
	      thing.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      All right, just don't make any
	      noise.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE walks directly past VICKIE into the living room. VICKIE
	watches from a safe distance.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE removes his jewel-studded championship belt from the
	glass bookcase and carries it into the kitchen.
<b>	
</b>	In the kitchen, he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a
	drawer, places the belt on the counter top, and starts
	digging the jewels out of it.
<b>	
</b>	VICKIE appears in the doorway.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      What are you doing?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      I need ten thousand dollars. My
	      lawyer says if we can spread ten
	      thousand bucks around, we can get
	      the case dropped.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      But they don't have a case against
	      you.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	           (digging at the belt)
	      Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a
	      14-year-old testify in court? Did
	      you see the papers? "LaMotta on
	      Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot
	      at the Champ.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      Jake, be careful! What're you doing
	      to the belt?!
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Don't make no difference no more.
<b>	
</b><b>	                VICKIE
</b>	      Can't you get the money from your
	      friends?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      What friends?
<b>	
</b>	JAKE, frustrated by his task, turns the belt over and hammers
	at it. The jewels scatter across the counter top and floor.
	JAKE collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JEWELRY SHOP - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE stands at the counter of a small jewelry store. The
	JEWELER examines the stones.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JEWELER
</b>	      Didn't you also wish to sell the
	      Championship Belt, Mr. LaMotta?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      That's it. Those are the jewels
	      that were in the belt.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JEWELER
</b>	      But where's the belt?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      You want the jewels or the belt?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JEWELER
</b>	      Both. These stones are worth about
	      fifteen hudred dollars, but the
	      belt of a champion is a very rare
	      item. The belt with the stones
	      untouched would have been worth
	      near five thousand dollars.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the
	attempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE places a call from a booth outside the jewelry store.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	           (on phone)
	      I can't raise the ten thousand.
	      Fuck 'em. Let 'em put me on trial.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Same as Scene 1.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE, 42 years old, continues to rehearse. He is seated
	across from a mirror.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      So there I am in the can... and not
	      the one that says "gentlemen" on
	      the door. I'm talkin' about jail!
	      Down south!
	      I mean, jail up north is gotta be
	      like summer camp compared to jail
	      down in cracker country. And if
	      you're a guy like me, you ain't got
	      a chance in a place like that.
	      Especially if you're Italian... you
	      come from the Bronx... and you're
	      an ex-champ. As soon as they saw
	      me... soon as they heard me... I
	      know I'm in trouble. To me, they
	      got an accent, and to them, I got
	      an accent! You gotta get the
	      picture -- I'm big, I got small
	      hands, I walk like I'm still in the
	      ring... the balls of my feet pop up
	      and down, you know... and whenever
	      I get the chance, I read a lot. So
	      naturally, takin' all this into
	                                      co
	      sideration, they figure it adds up
	      to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I
	      didn't mind too much when they
	      called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough
	      Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one
	      day these screws got to me... I was
	      workin' on the work gang, pickin'
	      up some trees that were knocked
	      down by a storm or somethin' and
	      puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a
	      sudden... one of the trees slipped
	      and fell on me and pinned me to the
	      ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree
	      across my chest! This screw walks
	      over, takin' his time, he looks
	      down at me and says, "Well, Champ
	      Pimp... you lyin' down on the job
	      again?"! They got a great sense of
	      humor when they're standin' there
	      with a gun in their arms and you
	      got a tree on your chest! So I look
	      up at him and say, "Oh, this
	      tree... it fell on me." And he
	      says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have
	      known, I would've yelled 'timber'"
	      I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I
	      think maybe I broke somethin'!" He
	      says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ
	      PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then
	      I got as stupid as him. I said, "If
	      I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin'
	      me the money you made last night?"!
	      Then another screw comes over and
	      says, "This Yankee creep givin' you
	      trouble?" -- What kind of trouble?
	      What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with
	      the tree? Now anybody else in their
	      right mind would've said, "No sir,
	      I wouldn't think of giving any of
	      you gentlemen trouble... I just
	      want to serve my time and get the
	      hell out of here as soon as I can."
	      That's anybody else. When I said
	      it... it was a little different.
	      "You stupid cracker... take your
	      hands off me or I'll get up and
	      kick your brains out -- but first
	      you gotta bend over so I can find
	      'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the
	      hole. Solitary confinement. All my
	      life I had guys in my corner
	      yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill
	      'em! You're the greatest." Now
	      there's nobody rootin' for me. But
	      it wasn't so bad. I learned things
	      there. I learned how to scratch a
	      calendar on the wall. I never knew
	      how to do that before. Now I know.
	      Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is
	      two scratches. Wednesday is three
	      scratches. And so on. Except for
	      Sundays. Sundays is no scratches.
	      Sundays rested.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. DADE COUNTY STOCKADE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The CAMERA TRACKS down the lonely corridors of the Dade
	County Prison. Empty faces stare out from behind the bars.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE is led down a long corridor by TWO GUARDS. His hands and
	legs are manacled and chained.
<b>	
</b>	The GUARDS, redneck screws both, take special pleasure in
	working JAKE over.
<b>	
</b>	They take JAKE to the "Hole" -- solitary confinement.
<b>	
</b>	ONE of the GUARDS unmanacles JAKE.
<b>	
</b>	Both GUARDS push JAKE into the cell and slam the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. THE HOLE - DAY OR NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A thin slit provides the only light in JAKE's cell.
<b>	
</b>	The rough cement walls are covered with obscure graffiti. The
	8x8x8 room features only a cot and a toilet.
<b>	
</b>	The room is mostly darkness. Sounds are more tangible here
	than sights.
<b>	
</b>	WE SEE JAKE's body as it passes through the slit of light.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE crouches into the corner away from the light. As WE SEE
	JAKE's face, the following MONTAGE images appear.
<b>	
</b>	(There will be contrasting sound effects accompanying the
	images: for example, the image of JAKE hitting VICKIE might
	be accompanied by the sounds from a love scene between them.)
<b>	
</b>	A) 1940s black and white pornography: partially clothed men
	and women engaged in explicit sex acts.
<b>	
</b>	B) Boxing magazines: fighters' beaten and bloody faces. A
	body building ad: Charles Atlas raises his muscled biceps.
<b>	
</b>	C) Li'l Abner comics; Daisy Mae's tits seem about to fall
	free.
<b>	
</b>	D) Reprise from earlier scene: Back in JAKE and IRMA's old
	apartment, JOEY, using a towel as a glove, punches JAKE in
	the face.
<b>	
</b>	E) A 1934 "OLDER GIRL" sashays into the candy store in
	flickering 8mm black and white footage. WE SEE ohter Bronx
	PRETEEN GIRLS walking, smiling.
<b>	
</b>	F) At Shorehaven pool, JAKE and JOEY, in bathing suits, are
	sleeping in the sun next to each other. OTHER BATHERS are
	around, also taking in the sun.
<b>	
</b>	G) Reprise from earlier scene: As in D, JOEY hits JAKE in the
	face again.
<b>	
</b>	WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.
<b>	
</b>	The MONTAGE continues:
<b>	
</b>	H) JANIRO's face at the weigh-in.
<b>	
</b>	I) JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss at the weigh-in.
<b>	
</b>	J) JAKE punches in JANIRO's face.
<b>	
</b>	K) A naked GIRL stands in the doorway of a bedroom.
<b>	
</b>	L) JAKE lies in bed with IRMA staring at the ceiling.
<b>	
</b>	M) VICKIE's pretty young face DOUBLE EXPOSES with SUGAR RAY
	ROBINSON's.
<b>	
</b>	N) DR. PINTO injects novacaine into JAKE's fists.
<b>	
</b>	O) Sitting in his corner of the ring, JAKE spits blood into a
	pail...
<b>	
</b>	P) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY wipes off his brother's
	bloody face.
<b>	
</b>	Q) Still in JAKE's corner: There is an open cut over JAKE's
	eye. JOEY, rushing against time, sucks the blood from the
	wound as DR. PINTO begins to examine it.
<b>	
</b>	R) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY puts the mouthpiece in JAKE's
	mouth. (SLOW MOTION)
<b>	
</b>	S) JAKE wins over CERDAN. JOEY, overenthusiastic, hits JAKE
	on the back of the head a little too hard. JAKE gives JOEY a
	quick look, but JOEY just embraces him.
<b>	
</b>	T) On a bed, a GIRL is going down on JOEY. The GIRL turns and
	looks up at JAKE. It's LINDA, the waitress from his club.
	JAKE stares.
<b>	
</b>	U) JAKE's fist hits LINDA's face.
<b>	
</b>	V) VICKIE playfully bends JAKE's hand back, pretending to
	break it.
<b>	
</b>	W) JAKE hits LINDA again. She cries.
<b>	
</b>	X) Repeat image N: DR. PINTO injects novocaine into JAKE's
	fists.
<b>	
</b>	WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.
<b>	
</b>	The MONTAGE continues:
<b>	
</b>	Y) VICKIE is in her underwear in a bedroom. A pair of black
	arms come in and embrace her body.
<b>	
</b>	Z) CLOSE UP of JAKE; he reacts to this. He's in the ring with
	SUGAR RAY. He knocks SUGAR RAY out of the ring.
<b>	
</b>	AA) VICKIE again. JAKE approaches her from behind, pulls her
	head back by her hair, and slaps her.
<b>	
</b>	BB) THE ANNOUNCER points to SUGAR RAY as the winner.
	(Different fight.) CAMERA PANS to RAY, victorious, his arms
	up.
<b>	
</b>	CC) A bloodied JAKE comes over to SUGAR RAY and embraces him.
<b>	
</b>	WE ARE BACK WITH JAKE in the cell. He slowly starts to bang
	his head against the wall.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	           (murmuring)
	      Why, why, why?
	           (with each bang of his
	           head)
	      I'm a man, I'm a man. I'm no
	      faggot. I'm not a faggot. Ma, why?
	      What do they want? My cock's not
	      enough. What do they want from me?
	      Why? Ma? Why?
<b>	
</b>	JAKE is now smashing the wall with all his strength --
	vicious body punches.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      Why, why, why me? You took it away
	      from me. They took everything away.
	      What do they want from me? What the
	      fuck do they want from me? I ain't
	      bad. I ain't bad. I'm not that guy.
	      I'm not that guy. I'm not a
	      monster. I'm not an animal.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE breaks his knuckles; the pain and blood are unbearable.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE collapses to the concrete floor. His hands are smashed.
	He cries, then sobs.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      I'm not like that. Please. I'm not
	      like that. Please. Please. Please.
<b>	
</b>	Then silence.
<b>	
</b>	We begin to hear: JAKE doing a monologue.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      And so, as Shakespeare said, I've
	      been down so low there's nowhere
	      else to go.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. METROPOLE - NIGHT (1958)
</b><b>	
</b>	The Metropole is a club on 7th Avenue off Times Square.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE LAMOTTA, 36 years old and wearing a hip Fifties suit,
	continues his monologue.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Except here, gentlemen, with you
	      bums. I call you "gentlemen"... but
	      you know what you really are! You
	      know, this place used to be pretty
	      exclusive... now they got bouncers
	      outside to throw the drunks in! My
	      first night here I said to the
	      boss, "Where's the toilet?" -- He
	      said, "You're in it!" By the way,
	      this engagement is just a stepping
	      stone for me. If I do good here,
	      I'm ready to get out of the
	      business!
<b>	
</b>	The CROWD starts to shout: "Get the fuck off the stage!"
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      OK, OK, I know what you're waitin'
	      for -- and from the looks of you,
	      you been waitin' for it for a long
	      time. I had my own joint in Miami
	      Beach once... it was too high-class
	      for you guys... we had a 50-cent
	      minimum charge just to keep out the
	      riff-raff!
<b>	
</b>	The CROWD continues to shout, as before, also shouting:
	"Bring out the girls!"
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      Hey, sorry. Here's your girls.
	           (grabs his crotch)
	      Yeah, she's here... just like it's
	      advertised out front. She's come
	      back. A girl who's seen the Lower
	      Depths... who's been as far as I
	      have in that direction. She's on
	      her way back up now... give you an
	      idea how low she was! Let's give
	      her a warm welcome... make her glad
	      she's back, boys. -- Miss Emma
	      48's!
<b>	
</b>	JAKE gets off the stage as MISS EMMA 48's goes into her
	dance. He goes over to the bar and gets a drink. SEVERAL
	OLDER MEN in T-shirts - a disreputable looking lot - are at
	the bar.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. METROPOLE - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	The Club is closing. JAKE and EMMA, the stripper, come out
	and walk by a delicatessen on their way to a parking lot.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE sees his brother JOEY enter the delicatessen.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Look, sweetie, be a good girl.
	      Here's some money. Take a cab. Go
	      home by yourself. Just wanna walk
	      around a little, sort of unwind.
<b>	      OK?
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                EMMA
</b>	      Will I see you later?
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Yeah. I dunno... I'll call you.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE goes to the parking lot entrance as EMMA gets into a
	cab.
<b>	
</b><b>	                                    DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	It's about twenty minutes later.
<b>	
</b>	DOLLY INTO A MEDIUM SHOT of JAKE waiting by the parking lot.
	He looks at the delicatessen.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY finally comes out carrying a paper bag. Not noticing
	JAKE, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near
	the rear of the outdoor lot.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      Hey, Joey --
<b>	
</b>	JAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY looks at JAKE. Silence. JOEY turns his back and starts
	to get into his car.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE runs over to JOEY and grabs his shoulder.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      No, Joey, no. Look, wait a minute,
	      please --
<b>	
</b>	JOEY looks at JAKE like he's shit, throws JAKE's hand off his
	shoulder, and starts to get into his car again.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      Aw, Joey --
<b>	
</b>	JAKE stops JOEY from getting into his car. He puts his hand
	on JOEY's shoulder again.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      You're right. You're perfectly
	      right. You got every right in the
	      world to hate my guts.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY pulls away from JAKE's hand, and tries to put the paper
	bag into the front seat of the car.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      No, please. I know I was a
	      cocksucker. You're right. I shoulda
	      never raised my hands to you.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY half pushes JAKE away, and begins to get into his car
	again.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE pulls JOEY by the arm.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      No, Joey, listen to me --
<b>	
</b>	JAKE pulls too hard, causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to
	his feet. The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break
	open and splatter JOEY's pants legs.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he
	belts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken
	by surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY keeps pouring it on. JAKE drops his hands and takes it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      Go ahead.
	           (gets punched)
	      Hit me again.
	           (gets punched)
	      I deserve it...
	           (gets punched)
	      Pay me back...
	           (gets punched)
	      More...
	           (gets punched)
<b>	
</b>	JOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE. He can't figure
	it out.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE (CONT'D)
</b>	      More. Go ahead, Joey. I deserve it.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to JAKE's
	shoulder.
	He leaves his hand there -- then, uncurls his fist -- and
	finally puts his hand around JAKE's neck as tears start to
	fill his eyes.
<b>	
</b>	JOEY hugs JAKE close to him, crying.
<b>	
</b>	They hug each other, both crying. They don't say anything.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATER - NIGHT (1964)
</b><b>	
</b>	The theater lights are flashing.
<b>	
</b>	This may not be Broadway, but it's a long way from the
	Metropole. The entrance to the Barbizon looks out on the
	corner of 6th Avenue and Central Park South.
<b>	
</b>	A stand-up billboard in front of the theater advertises "An
	Evening with Jake LaMotta." The billboard also lists the
	authors whose works will be performed: Paddy Chayevsky, Rod
	Serling, Shakespeare, Bud Schulberg, Tennessee Williams.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Same as Scenes One and Eighty-One.
<b>	
</b>	JAKE is alone preparing to go onstage. He rehearses.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      You know, I'm not a philosopher or
	      anything like that but I been
	      around a little and the way I look
	      at it is -- We're, all of us,
	      lookin' for the same thing: a shot
	      at the title. No matter what you
	      wanta be... you wanta shot at bein'
	      the best. Well, I had mine and
	      it'll always be in the record
	      books... it don't make no
	      difference what happens to me from
	      here on in -- I got my shot and
	      that's a fact. Some guys weren't
	      that lucky... like the one Marlon
	      Brando played in "On the
	      Waterfront" -- an up and comer
	      who's now a down and outer. You
	      remember... there was this scene in
	      the back of the car with his
	      brother Charlie, a small-time
	      racket guy, and it went somethin'
	      like this -- "It wasn't him,
	      Charlie. It was you. You 'member
	      that night in the Garden you came
	      down my dressing room and said.
	      'Kid, this ain't your night.
	      We're going for the price on
	      Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This
	      ain't your night!' My night -- I
	      coulda taken Wilson apart! So what
	      happens? He gets the title shot
	      outdoors on the ballpark, and what
	      do I get? A one-way ticket to
	      Palookaville. I never was no good
	      after that night. It was like a
	      peak you reach. Then it went
	      downhill. It was you, Charlie. You
	      was my brother, Charlie. You
	      shoulda looked out for me a little
	      bit. You shoulda taken care of me
	      just a little bit so I wouldn't
	      have to take them dives for the
	      short end money... You don't
	      understand! I coulda had class. I
	      coulda been a contender. I coulda
	      been somebody -- instead of a bum,
	      which is what I am. Let's face it.
	      It was you, Charlie."
<b>	
</b>	A shadow goes by the frame; it's a STAGEHAND.
<b>	
</b><b>	                STAGEHAND (O.S.)
</b>	      Hey Jake, how you doing?
<b>	
</b>	The shadow exits.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b>	      How long do I have?
<b>	
</b>	The shadow pops in again.
<b>	
</b><b>	                STAGEHAND (O.S.)
</b>	      About five minutes
<b>	
</b>	The shadow exits.
<b>	
</b><b>	                JAKE
</b><b>	      OK.
</b><b>	
</b>	JAKE pauses, then starts to shadow-box in his dressing room.
<b>	
</b>	His breath comes in quick gasps. His feet pop up and down
	like they were on canvas. His tiny fists jerk forward with
	short bursts of light.
<b>	
</b>	Still alive. Still a contender. A 42-year-old man fighting
	for his shot.
<b>	
</b>	The CAMERA DOLLIES into a FULL SHOT of his fists as they hit
	the empty air -- in and out of the frame.
<b>	
</b>	This quote appears: (Music in)
<b>	  		
</b>	"Verily, verily I say unto thee,
	  Except a man be born again,
	  He can not enter into the kingdom of heaven..."
<b>	
</b>	                                                 John 3-3
<b>	
</b>	The CAMERA goes into DARKNESS.
<b>	
</b>	The END CREDITS roll up.
<b>	
</b><b>	                       THE END
