               and we're going to have to put you

</b>
     The house falls dead SILENT. We hear footsteps thundering
     through the house. A TENSE STRAIN OF MUSIC FADES UP.

<b>                              TODD
</b>               What's that?

</b>               You heads starting to swell up!!

     Todd screams. We hear the sound of Tom's footsteps running
     through the kitchen, down the hall, up the stairs, up the
     hallway. A door open.

<b>                              TOM
</b>                          (breathless)
               What's the matter?

<b>                              JOYCE
</b>                          (worried)
               It's Ferris!

<b>                              TOM

<b>                              JOYCE

               What's wrong? For Christ's sake!
               Look at him!

<b>  2  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              2
</b>
     An eighteen year-old boy. He's staring lifelessly at CAMERA.
     His mouth's open. His eyes are bugged-out. His tongue is fat
     and dry in his mouth. He's laying in bed, on his side.

<b>  3  INT. BOY'S BEDROOM                                            3
</b>
     Ferris' parents, TOM and JOYCE BUELLER are standing at
     bedside. They're in their late forties, early fifties.
     Handsome, upper-middle class parents. They're both dressed
     for work.

<b>                              TOM
</b>               Ferris?

<b>                              JOYCE
</b>               He doesn't have a fever. But he says
               his stomach hurts and he's seeing spots.

<b>  4  CLOSE-UP. FERRIS                                              4
</b>
     His lifeless eyes blink.

<b>  5  INT. BEDROOM. PARENTS                                         5
</b>
     Tom bends down and touches Ferris' forehead.

<b>                              TOM
</b>               What's the matter, Ferris?

<b>                              JOYCE
</b>               Feel his hands. They're cold and clammy.

     Tom takes one of Ferris' hands.

<b>                              TOM
</b>                          (discreetly)
               Should you call the doctor?

<b>                              JOYCE
</b>                          (whispers)
               He doesn't want me to.

<b>                              TOM
</b>               Why don't you want Mom to call
               the doctor?

     Ferris exhales loudly. He tries to speak but all he can
     manage is a choked gasp.

<b>                              TOM
</b>               What?

     Ferris tries again.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>                          (raspy)
               Don't make a fuss. I'm fine. I'll get up.

     He starts to get up. Joyce gently pushes him back down.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               I have a test today. I have to take it.
               I want to get into a good college
               so I can have a fruitful life...

<b>                              JOYCE
</b>               You're not going to school like
               this.
                          (to Tom)
               Maybe I should call the office and
               tell them I won't be in.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               I'm okay, Mom. I feel perfectly...Oh, God!

     He's gripped by a seizure. His body stiffens and he chokes.
     His older sister, JEANIE, walks into the room. She's dressed
     for school. She's cute and stuck-up. A major pill.

<b>                              JEAN
</b>               Oh, fine. What's this? What's his problem?

<b>                              JOYCE
</b>               He doesn't feel well.

<b>                              JEAN
</b>               Yeah, right. Dry that one out
               and you can fertilize the lawn.

<b>                              TOM
</b>               That's enough, Jeanie.

<b>                              JEANIE
</b>               You're not falling for this, are you?
               Tell me you're not falling for this.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Is that Jeanie? I can't see that
               far. Jeanie?

<b>                              JEANIE
</b>               Pucker up and squat, Ferris.

<b>                              JOYCE
</b>                          (annoyed)
               Thank you, Jeanie. Get to school.

<b>                              JEANIE
</b>                          (angry, defeated)

     slips out of the room. Ferris' brother, TODD and sister,

               It's physical evidence of illness. It's
               a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are
               generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
               And to make them work you have to go a hundred
               and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous
               mother and you end up in a doctor's office
               and that's worse than school.

     up.

               still wouldn't change the fact that I

     Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around
     his waist. He's drying his hair with another of a different
     color.

<b>                              FERRIS

               believe in an "ism". He should
               believe in himself. John Lennon
               said it on his first solo album.
               "I don't believe in Beatles, I
               just believe in me." A good point
               there. Afterall, he was the Walrus.

     He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it.

</b>               My uncle went to Canada to protest

               got drunk and told my Dad he felt
               guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam.
               So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle
               Jeff? In wartime you want to be a
               pacifist and in peacetime you want
               to be a soldier. It took you twenty
               years to find out you don't believe
               in anything?"
                          (snaps his fingers)
               Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks.

               Be careful when you deal with old
               hippies. They can be real touchy.

     He opens his door.

     puts it on. He drops the towel.

     He walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his
     underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the
     top of the dresser. He picks it up.

     He pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he
     speaks.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a
               serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I
               like him. I'm probably his only friend.
               I do what I can for him. I mean, if
               I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others,
               right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.
               His father's dead and his sister's rumored
               to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit.
               She only puts out so people will hang out
               with her. It's sad but I don't hold it
               against her. Better to hold it against the
               guys who use her and don't care about her.
                          (pause)
               My parents never allowed Garth over here.
               It was because of his family. Mainly his
               older brother. He's in jail. I could see them
               not wanting his brother here because he is
               a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.
               I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of
               artificial fruit just so he could see what
               it was like to have his stomach pumped.
               But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault
               that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights
               with the parents on that point. I always felt
               for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once
               and I was laying on the dark worrying that
               his brother was going to come in and hack me
               to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.
               I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing".
               ... Nothing was wrong. There was no
               specific thing he was crying about.
               In fact, he wasn't really even aware that
               he was crying. He just cried himself to
               sleep every night. It was a habit. The
               guy's so conditioned to grief that if
               he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How
               could you possibly dump on guy who has to
               deal with that kinda shit? My parents
               acknowledge the trudge of the situation
               and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel
               for him but still the guy's banned from
               our house.

     He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet
     door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his
     speech as he disrobes.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Unfortunately, now my parents have a
               legit argument. Garth doesn't need his
               brother to give him a rep anymore. He's
               getting one on his own. He's lost. It's
               over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from
               school. Gone from life. His legacy is
               a gas station.

               nothing to do. TV and food. I myself
               have ditched and gotten so bored I
               did homework. Figure that shit out.

     he wants.

               The guy gave it up faster than
               a drunk Catholic girl. I hope my

               Of course, if they didn't, they'd
               be dumb and abnormal and they'd
               probably never move out of my

               until I die. I take it back.

               Dad? All this talking has made me

     A stunningly beautiful girl, SLOANE PETERSON, is sitting at
     her desk in a history class. She's staring out the window as
     a tweedy MALE TEACHER delivers a dry, dusty lecture.

<b>                              TEACHER

                          (sneezes)
               Pardon me.

     The classroom door opens and the school NURSE walks in. For
     a moment, the teacher thinks she's come in because she heard
     him sneeze. She crosses to him and whispers in his ear.

<b>     SLOANE
</b>
     She, like the others, watches the nurse curiously.

     The teacher's face drops as he's delivered an obvious piece
     of disturbing news. He nods grimly to the Nurse. She looks
     at the kids.

</b>               Sloane Peterson?

     Sits up in her seat.

     She's a picture of compassion and understanding.

     A smile curls across her lips. As she gathers her books she
     looks to the GIRL next to her.

     him.

</b>               That's what Mr. Peterson said. I

</b>               It's so hard to tell. I see her

     As the secretary starts out of the room, Rooney's phone
     rings. She stops and answers the desk phone.

<b>                              SECRETARY
</b>               It's Mr. Peterson.

     Rooney is startled. He thinks for a beat then reaches for
     the phone.

<b>                              SECRETARY
</b>               Do you still want his number?

     Rooney answers her with an annoyed look. She smiles and
     backs out. He punches the phone button.

     Rooney rolls his eyes. It's so obvious it's not Mr.
     Peterson.

<b>                              ROONEY
</b>               I heard. And, gosh, I'm all broken

               and I'll release Sloane. I want to
               see this dead grandmother firsthand.

     The secretary stops cold in the doorway. She turns to Rooney
     in horror. He covers the phone.

     line.

     Mrs. Froeling takes the bonds with a hearty smile. The

     drive.

     He's spooked by the games playing. He scans the bank
     nervously. He blinks, focuses, blinks again.

<b>     HIS POV
</b>
     Joyce is with a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE and their bored,
     sour-puss teenage son, BOYD. He's sitting in a chair with
     his legs slung over the sides waving a Bic lighter back and
     forth across his rump. The parents are Joyce's clients from
     Vermont. A LOAN OFFICER is discussing the local financing
     situation with them. His is an open office adjacent to the
     teller windows. Joyce's back is to the tellers.

<b>     CU. CAMERON
</b>
     It's like he's just witnesses an ax murder.

     Her back is to the teller windows. She's conducting her
     meeting. Behind her we see Cameron grab Ferris and point her
     out to him. He waves. Cameron slaps his arm.

</b>
     Mrs. Froeling shows Ferris the savings bonds.

<b>                              TELLER
</b>               These bonds aren't mature. If you hold

               an additional four dollars...

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               I'm aware of that.

               going for these days?

<b>     INT. BANK. JOYCE
</b>
     She concludes her meeting. She shakes hands with the loan
     officer and stands. The Vermont Couple stands. Boyd scrapes
     the bottom of his shoe on the desk, leaving a glob of mud
     behind and he stands. Joyce turns into the bank. Ferris,
     Cameron and Sloane are gone. She escorts her customers out.

<b>     INT. BANK. DOOR
</b>
     Joyce and the Vermont Couple approach the doors. Boyd lays a
     luggie in the drinking fountain. Mrs. Froeling passes with
     the savings bonds. She stops when she sees Joyce.

<b>                              JOYCE

               Say, you must be very proud.

     Joyce doesn't know what she's talking about.

</b>                          (whispers)

</b>               She told me everything. Keep me posted,

     She toodles on her way. Joyce and the Vermont Couple are
     completely baffled.

     Joyce and the Vermont Couple walk along the side of the
     bank, heading for the parking lot. Boyd's tagging along
     behind. He picks up a stone and hurls it into the parking
     lot.

<b>                              JOYCE

               back to the office, I'd like
               to just run in and check up on him.

     We HEAR A METALLIC PING! as Boyd's missle hits a car.

<b>                              MOTHER
</b>               Of course.

     They pass a show window. As they pass, we hold on the
     window. It's promoting saving for college educations. A
     mannequin father is congratulating his mannequin son in a
     mortar and gown as a stiff Sloane, Ferris and Cameron look
     on proudly.

     The Attendant very gingerly gets into the car. Ferris turns
     to Cameron. The Ferrari pulls into the lot very slowly, very
     carefully. No squealing tires, no revving engine.

     He's skinny, tall, with a huge knit hat willed with dreads.

     A middle-aged man, Cameron's father, HORACE FRYE, is
     standing on the street corner. He's lean, clean, tough and
     humorless. He's wearing a puzzled look on his face.

     Ferris looks around at him.

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               If your blood's not compatible,
               you could produce a pinhead. The
               state requires a blood test.

<b>                              FERRIS

               awkward about being the only cheer-

     Ferris and Sloane look at him curiously.

<b>                              CAMERON

               make it right. Are you comfortable
               with it?

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               No. It's not something I can get comfortable
               with. I've tried. Are yours divorced?

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               They may as well be.

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               Do you think they're staying together
               because of you?

     Cameron hasn't seen it that way. He shrugs.

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               Do they like you?

     It hasn't occured to Cameron that his parents might not like
     him. That parental love might not be a given.

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               Yeah. Sure.

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               Consider this...my father canned me
               and my brother and my Mom for a
               twenty five year old dipso with fake
               tits. He dropped us like a rock. Everything
               was cool at our house. I thought so.

               It was pure selfishness. When I have
               a kid, I don't care how much I want
               something, if it's gonna screw-up the
               kid, forget it.

<b>                              CAMERON

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               Yeah. But I'm gonna try not to.
               I'm gonna think about it. I'm
               gonna try to prevent it.

<b>                              FERRIS

<b>                              CAMERON

</b>               Frightening choice of words.

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               They call the shots. When you split
               from them, you call the shots.

<b>                              CAMERON

               does whatever he wants, whenever he
               wants and he never gets nailed.

               Well, babe, today I'm the hammer.

     She yanks angrily on the velcro strap on her sneakers. The
     straps rip off in her hand.

               you have no taste. Ferris is not cute.
               He's not charming. He's not nice. He's
               not a wonderful person. He's an ignorant
               mule and the sooner everybody in this
               school comes to that realization the
               better off we'll all be.

     Ferris is standing at the urinal.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               She's a person who views life as
               an ordeal that must be endured. Her
               body is a transport vehicle for her
               anger. I don't know where she gets
               this shit. Basically, the family's
               pretty cool.

     He looks down at the urinal.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               I wonder if everybody shoots at
               cigarette butts in urinals? Probably
               not many women.
                          (continues)
               I used to think that my family was
               the only one that had weirdness
               in it. It used to worry me. Then I
               met Cameron and I saw how his
               family functioned.

     He zips this trousers and steps away from the urinal.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Cameron's home life is really shit.
               He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick
               all the time. It really upsets him.
               What he said about his parents hating
               each other? I refuse to sleep over at
               his house. His parents fight all the
               time. Even when I'm there. Is there
               anything worse than being at somebody's
               house when their parents are fighting?
               It's the absolute height of social
               discomfort.

     He checks his hair in the mirror.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               When they go after each other, Cameron
               tightens up. It's scary. He gets so
               wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns
               apart with a crowbar. The thing with
               taking his old man's car? It's good
               for him. It teaches him to deal with
               his fear. Plus, and I must
               be honest here, I love driving it.
               I highly recommend picking one up.

     He exists the men's room. We hold a beat. A toilet flushes.
     Another beat and Tom walks out of the stall. He crosses to
     the sink.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               You got me. I don't speak French.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               I think it's a land-based beefoid

</b>               Good?

     Sloane and Cameron shrug. It's not bad. A WAITER passes.

</b>               Yo, Clouseau!

     sidewalk. Rooney's dress shoe steps out onto the pavement.

     around like he's Dirty Harry. In his mind he is Dirty Harry.

     Rooney wipes his face. Behind him is the kitchen and a
     grease-covered TV set broadcasting a Cubs baseball game.
     There's a long foul ball. The TV camera follows the ball
     into the stands. A kid makes a stab at the ball. Rooney
     wipes his suit off. The TV camera zooms in on the boy
     triumphantly holding the foul ball aloft. It's Ferris.
     He does a little celebration dance. Rooney wads up the
     napkin and tosses it in a trashbin. The TV camera returns to

     They walk on for a few beats. We HEAR "TWIST AND SHOUT"
     GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER. The sons is taking over all the
     other tunes in the band. It's infecting the entire parade.

     It fills the frame and stops. We MOVE UP to reveal Rooney
     behind the wheel of his car.

<b>     EXT. FERRIS' HOUSE
</b>
     Rooney gets out of his car. He looks at the house, looks up
     and down the street, then crosses to Ferris' house.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Who is it?

     Rooney presses the intercom.

<b>                              ROONEY
</b>               This is Ed Rooney, Ferris. I'd
               like to have a word with you.

<b>                              FERRIS' VOICE
</b>               I'm sorry I can't come to the door

               afraid that in my weakened condition,
               I could take a nasty spill down the
               stairs and subject myself to further
               school absenses.

     There's a pause. Rooney presses the intercom again.

<b>                              ROONEY
</b>               B.S. Come down here.

               for my well-being. It will be remembered
               long after this illness has past.

     His voice clicks off. Rooney presses the intercom again.

</b>               I'm not leaving, Ferris.

     There's no response. Rooney rings the doorbell again. The
     pre-recorded litany starts over.

<b>                              FERRIS' VOICE
</b>               Who is it?

     Rooney doesn't realize that he's listening to a recording.

<b>                              ROONEY
</b>               Don't get smart with me Ferris!

     Rooney leans back from the door. He can't quite figure out
     what's going on. But's it's highly suspicious.

<b>143  INT. HOUSE. LIVING ROOM                                     143

     Rooney steps through the hedges and peeks in the windows. We
     HEAR FERRIS' VOICE inside.

</b>
     A black rubber doggie door. The type that allows a dog to
     come and go as it pleases. Rooney is crouched down. He lifts
     the doggie door and peeks in the house.

<b>     HIS POV
</b>
     Along the kitchen floor. Through the kitchen, into the
     dining room. We hear a LARGE DOG GROWL.

<b>     CU. ROONEY
</b>
     He's peaking through the door. He hears the dog. His face
     freezes.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Have a nice day.

     A Rottweiler bursts through the doggie door in a fury of
     gnashing teeth and foam.

<b>     CU. CAMERON, FERRIS AND SLOANE
</b>
     They're sitting in a booth in the garish, nearly deserted
     strip joint. Cameron's mouth is open in amazement. Sloane is
     embarrassed and revolted.

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               How does she do that? One goes
               one way, one goes the other.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               She's probably schizophrenic.

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               Ferris, this is nauseating me.
               Really. I'm losing respect for
               you by the bucket.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               You don't think it's amazing that
               we got in?

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               Who wants to get in?

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Cameron looks like a toddler, for
               Christ's sake. I'm talking about
               a major achievement in false
               identification.

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               I'm not interested in watching
               someone jiggle their mammary glands.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Point well taken. But consider why
               she does it. Why she does it and
               you don't.

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               I'm not a tramp.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Maybe her life fell apart. Maybe she
               lost somebody. A lover. A boyfriend.
               A parent. A child...
                          (to CAMERA)
               This kind of thing makes me a little
               depressed. You may think because I'm
               the age I am that I'm a sex maniac.
               That sex is all I think about.
               But that's not true. I'm a romantic.
               I think alot of people my age are.
               We think about love and matters of
               the heart. And SAT scores and acne
               aside, we worry about lonliness. It's
               a terrible thing. And we feel it. I
               feel it.

     He flips his collar up, curls his lip and affects an Elvis
     impression. A sappy, do-wop track FADES UP. The club lights
     go down. Cameron and Sloane disappear into darkness. Ferris
     stands up from the booth. He strolls slowly through the
     empty club as the stripper bumps and grinds in a pool of
     blue light.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               You know, someone said the world's a
               stage and each must play a part.
               Fate had me playing in love, with you
               as my sweetheart. Act one was when we
               met. I loved you at first glance. You
               read your lines so cleverly and never
               missed a cue. Then came act two. You
               seemed to change. You acted strange.
               And why, I've never known.

     He climbs up on the little runway. The stripper disappears
     in darkness as Ferris takes over the spotlight.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Honey, you lies when you said you
               loved me and I had no cause to
               doubt you. But I'd rather go on
               hearing your lies than to go on
               living without you. Now, the stage
               is bare and I'm standing there with
               emptiness all around and if you won't
               come back to me, then they can bring
               the curtain down...

     Elvis fades up. The orignal recording. Ferris lip synchs
     with the big, dramatic florish that was the King's trademark
     ballad sign-off.

<b>                              ELVIS

     Ferris drops his head. Like the King would.

     Cameron's father is looking at the car. He's studying it. It
     looks terribly familiar. He leans into the open car and
     reaches for the glovebox to see if the contents will confirm
     if it's his. He freezes. He looks up slowly.

     The Attendant and the Rastaman are glowering at him. They're

     He leans forward and reads the driver's name off the city
     license.

     freezes.

     alongside another cab. In that cab is Tom. He's about a foot
     from Ferris. He turns and looks right into CAMERA.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               I'm going to tell a massive lie here.
               It's going to by very thick and very
               steamy. I think radio's a facinating
               medium, it challenges the imagination.
               Unlike television which provides the
               images, radio...
                          (pause)
               You know this. Anyway, it's always been
               a dream of mine to be on the radio.
               I have what I consider to be an excellent
               broadcast voice. I practise it in the
               bathroom all the time. I used to play
               records and do introductions to them.
               But I've never had the chance to sit
               behind a microphone and try it out
               for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet.
               I'm going out to several million people
               so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant
               groove right now.

               in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail
               box, which was not in any way, shape
               or from my fault. I was putting out a
               cigarette, like I was told. It was weird.
               I'm so used to getting in a car and
               lighting up, because I'm not allowed to
               smoke at home, that I got in the driver's
               ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out
               of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller
               looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny
               out of my nose or something and I realized
               what the hell I was doing and I went to
               put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway,
               I was so pissed off at her reaction to
               the whole thing that I considered running
               an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school
               teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna
               use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost
               too much. I took it again and passed. But
               I had to work at Burger King to get the
               cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The
               car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and
               I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I
               can't prove it? I'm in high school, remember?

               a little keyed-up. All I wanted to do
               was give him a good day. We're
               gonna graduate in a couple of months.
               Then we have the summer. He'll work
               and I'll work. And we'll see each
               other at night and on the weekends
               but then he'll go to one school and I'll
               go to another. And basically that'll
               be it. As much as we like each other,
               the process of growing up will
               separate us.

               least no one's ever been in love
               with him. He's gonna marry the first
               girl he lays. And she's gonna treat
               him like shit because he's gonna
               kiss her ass for giving him what he's
               built-up in his mind as the end-all,
               be-all of human existance. She won't
               respect him because you can't respect
               someone who kisses your ass. It just
               doesn't work.

<b>     INT. GARAGE
</b>
     Ferris and Sloane exchange baffled looks. They look at
     Cameron. He's proud and bold.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               What was that about?

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               This has to be a dream.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Cameron? One quick question.
               Why'd you do that?

     Cameron holds his proud posture for a beat. Then a look of
     bewilderment comes over his face. He shoots a look to
     Ferris. A puzzled look.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               You trashed the car.

     Cameron looks across the street.

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               Why?

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               I took a stand.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               No, Cameron. You wrecked a car.

     Cameron thinks for a moment. Then he regains his confidence.

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               It's okay.

     Ferris looks across the street at the car.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               I have an idea. If you're interested.

     Cameron looks at him. He shakes his head.

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               I'm gonna handle it.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               I think this could work.

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               No, thanks. I want to deal with
               it by myself.

<b>                              SLOANE
</b>               What about your one word?

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               You already did it. If I need it
               again, I'll use it.

     He smiles. He raises am impish eyebrow.

<b>                              CAMERON
</b>               It's cool. I'm loose.

     Joyce is talking with the juvenile officer. Outside the
     office, on the bench, we see Jeanie and the boy making out.

</b>               She's never been in trouble before.
               This is a shock to me. First, I
               don't know why she wasn't at school.
               Second, I don't know why she'd call
               you with this story about a rapist.

<b>                              JOYCE

</b>               Oh, by the way, I hope you son's

     Jeanie quickly breaks the embrace with the boy as Joyce
     steps out of the juvenile officer's room. She's still a
     little bewildered that everybody knows Ferris was ill.
     Jeanie wipes her lips and sits up straight. The boy adjusts
     his pants to better hide his passion.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Sure. He had to so it, I guess.
               His old man had it coming. He'll
               be okay. I'd be worried if he'd
               taken my idea.

     Sloane smiles knowingly.

</b>               I'll call you tonight.

     Sloane nods. Ferris jumps the fence and takes off across the
     backyards. Sloane watches him go. A huge smile spreads
     across her face.

     Ferris vaults a fence. He runs directly for a swimming pool.

     and peels off his shirt. He climbs into bed. No sooner are
     the covers over him than the bedroom door opens and Joyce
     and Tom walk in. They walk over to the bed. Joyce sits down.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>                          (deathly gasp)
               150% better, thank you.

     Tom and Joyce hover over him with deep concern.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               I'm much better, really. Please,
               don't make me stay home again. I
               want to go to school. I'm graduating
               in June and I...

<b>                              TOM
</b>               Ferris. You're sick. There's no point
               pushing yourself and making it worse.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Maybe you're right, Dad.

<b>                              TOM
</b>               I know I'm right.

     Joyce leans over and kisses him forehead.

<b>                              JOYCE
</b>               How did you get so sweet?

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               Years of practice.

     Tom pats Ferris on the rump. He and Joyce exit.

<b>     CU. FERRIS
</b>
     The hideous face. A beat and we HEAR THE BEDROOM DOOR CLOSE.
     Ferris looks at CAMERA.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>                          (happy sigh)
               Yeah, life is a carousel. A
               great big crazy ball of pure
               living, breathing joy and delight.

     He rolls over on his back and puts his hands behind his
     head.

<b>                              FERRIS
</b>               You gotta get one.

     He smiles.
