There were five on her list.
Now it's three.
O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green were the first to fall, now The Bride is out to finish the job by killing Elle Driver, Budd, and last of all, Bill.
If the final three aren't afraid now, they better start, because she's coming for them.
However, something has thrown off her plans a bit.
Her daughter (whom she was pregnant with as she was getting married) is still alive.
What affect this will have on her quest for vengeance is unclear, but the question is, will The Bride have actually succeeded in completing her ultimate goal, to kill Bill?
