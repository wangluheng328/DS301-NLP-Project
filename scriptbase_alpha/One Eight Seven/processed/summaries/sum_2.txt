After a student almost kills him in the hallway Garrfield relocates to Los Angeles, but the trouble starts again when he becomes a substitute to a class containing a tag crew by the name of K.O.S.
Their murderous leader, Benny, tells Garfield that there will be no mutual respect between them.
The tension mounts when a fellow teacher, Ellen Henry, confides that Benny has threatened her life.
