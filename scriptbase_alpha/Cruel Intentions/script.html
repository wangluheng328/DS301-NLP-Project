<b>                           CRUEL INVENTIONS
</b>
                           by Roger Kumble



             based on the novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses

                        by Choderlos De Laclos




                                                 February 10, 1998





<b>1    EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1
</b>
     We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and
     closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the
     melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM
     into a window.

<b>2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2
</b>
     A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at
     her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and
     Freud line the shelves.

     A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front
     of her looking impatient.

     The therapist continues to write notes.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               Jesus. We've been at this for six
               months.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I know.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               And you haven't made an ounce of
               progress.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I know.

     Sebastian takes out a cigarette.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>                    (not looking up)
               There's no smoking in my office.

     Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.
     Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking
     her head.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               What do you want me to say? That I'm
               supposed to feel remorse because I act
               the way I do? The truth is I don't.

     Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Look, I'm not like all the other kids
               in high school. I don't care about book
               reports and extra-credit. Teachers
               are idiots anyway. The only challenge
               out there for me is women. You see a
               girl you like. You pursue them. You
               conquer. You move on. It's exciting.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               But you said you have the worst
               reputation.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I do.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               Don't you want to change that?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Let me tell you something, doctor.
               Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.
               They say they don't, but they don't
               mean it. They all think that they're
               the ones that are going to "save me."
               The trick is to let them think it's
               true.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               I think that's all the time we have
               for today.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Same time next week?

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               No. This is going to be our last
               session.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Why? I like spending time with you.
               You know, you're quite attractive for
               a woman your age. You have killer legs.
               Killer.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a
               lot of money to send you here. I'm
               trying to help you.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big
               help.

     Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               He was a coke addict, you know.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               You think you can come in here with that
               cute little smirk on your face and try
               and flirt with me. It doesn't work,
               Sebastian.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               It works a little.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               No it doesn't. I see right through you.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               You do?

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               I hope for your sake you grow out of
               this immature phase. It's going to get
               you into trouble.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Well, you don't have to get nasty about
               it.

     Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               My daughter, Rachel.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Yummy.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               Don't even think about it. Rachel is an
               exceptionally well rounded young
               woman, who happens to be attending
               Princeton this fall. She's way too
               smart to fall for your line of b.s.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Really? Care to make a wager on that?

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               Good luck, Sebastian.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               What, nervous I'm going to win?

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               Would you please leave.

     Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Asshole.

     The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her
     desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of
     Benson &amp; Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo
     of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Rachel, it's mom.

<b>                                                  INTERCUT WITH:
</b>
<b>3    INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                3
</b>
     RACHEL, Doctor Greenbaum's daughter sits at her desk,
     crying while holding the phone.

<b>                              RACHEL
</b>               Hi, mom.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               Honey, is something wrong?

     Rachel cries for a moment.

<b>                              RACHEL
</b>               He told me he loved me and I believed
               him.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               Who told you?

<b>                              RACHEL
</b>               You don't know him. I'm so stupid.

     She continues to cry.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep
               breath, and step out of the circle.

<b>                              RACHEL
</b>               Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit,
               mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.

<b>     WE PAN OVER TO HER COMPUTER CONSOLE. CLOSE ON: COMPUTER
</b>     MONITOR - A nudie web-sight. The title reads "Ivy League
     Bound." Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to
     a bed and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her
     privates.

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               What kind of pictures?

<b>                              RACHEL
</b>               Nudie pictures, what do you think?

<b>                              DR. GREENBAUM
</b>               Jesus Christ, how can you be so
               stupid?

               killer legs and how we wanted to
               photograph them. Things just got out
               of hand from there.

     Doctor Greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots
     Sebastian standing in the elevator.

     Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several
     people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her
     expressionless as the elevator doors close.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               You're gonna pay for this you little
               shit. You hear me.

     A DENTIST peers outside of his office to see what's
     going on. He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Fuck off, Harold.

     He gasps.

     A METER MAID is writing a ticket on a car when a Porsche
     pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red

     money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering
     the townhouse.

     KATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain

     BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite
     talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful

                    (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese)
               Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be

<b>                              KATHRYN

<b>                              MRS. CALDWELL
</b>               How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring

</b>               Cecile, is that the best you can do?
                    (to Kathryn)
               You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never
               been in a co-educational atmosphere before.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Don't worry, it's totally understandable.
               Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood
               are very upstanding gentleman, however
               there are the occasional bad apples.

<b>                              MRS. CALDWELL
</b>               Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't
               believe they didn't expel him after what he
               did to the school nurse.

     Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the
     doorway. He walks over and takes a seat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               But I thought high school is only four years.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.

     He winks at Cecile.

<b>                              MRS. CALDWELL
</b>               I think we'll be going now.

<b>                              MRS. CALDWELL
</b>               Let's go, Cecile. Now!

     Cecile follows Mrs. Caldwell out the door. Kathryn
     closes the door behind them.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

     Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews
     her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the
     bottom part a small vial of coke.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               The parental units called while you were out.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a
               mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my
               inheritance per usual?

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Hopefully, though she suspects that your
               decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the
               maid.

     Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a
     bump.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with you today? Therapy not

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               It was fine.

     He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid
               Manhattan Debutantes.

     He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nothing shocks them anymore.

     He scratches the nude's pubic area.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my
               touch.

     He kisses it.

               an uncharted pootie.

     Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               That was just simple revenge. What I

     He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn
     picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."

</b>               It just so happens we're not in Kansas
               anymore. Our little angel's father has
               accepted the new headmaster position at
               Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up
               in Connecticut while Daddy sells his
               house. Can you imagine what this would
               do for my reputation? Screwing the new
               headmaster's virginal daughter before
               school starts? It will be my greatest

     She approaches him.

<b>                              KATHRYN

               bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar
               car.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Because I'm the only person you can't
               control and it kills you.

     Sebastian sneers at her.

               Do we have a deal?

     She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.

     Sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand.

<b>                              AUNT HELEN

     Annette throws her a concerned look.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               In any event, I want you to consider

     BANG! A shotgun sounds in the distance.

               Die motherfucker!

     He fires the gun, missing the target.

               Shit, shit, shit.

     perks up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Kitty. Kitty.

     He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW
     again. Sebastian searches for the cat.

               Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss.

     Annette riding over to him. He waves.

     Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I don't know. Relationships seem too

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Nice.

     She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.

<b>                              ANNETTE

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I was just being honest. You happen to
               have a nice ass. Sorry.

     She shakes her head and continues with her chore.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

<b>                              ANNETTE

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I must say I found it rather appalling.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               That's a first. Most people praised me
               for it.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Most people are morons. I mean who are
               you to knock what you've never experienced?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my
               belief that people shouldn't actually
               experience the act of love until they are
               in love and that people our age are too
               immature to be in touch with those
               emotions.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Oh really?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Take yourself. You've slept with several

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

               women?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               A friend wrote me.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>                    (pissed)
               Well maybe you should get to know the
               person before you judge them instead of
               listening to some bullshit gossip.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...
               but you still didn't answer the question.

     An uncomfortable silence falls between them,

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Who the hell is taking the time to write

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               It's not really important.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're
               not going to be friends.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Why are you being so dramatic?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm
               trying to deal with them and the last
               thing I need is people spreading shit
               about me.

<b>                              ANNETTE

               Can we start over again? I think we've
               gotten off on the wrong foot.

     She approaches him and they shake.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since

<b>19   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      19

     CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.

<b>                              RONALD (O.S.)
</b>               That's good, that's good.

<b>     WE PULL BACK
</b>
     Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD
     CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African
     American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a
     music lesson.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now let's try the A minor scale.

     Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly.

     Kathryn enters and shudders in silence.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Once more, and remember the third note
               is flat.

     Cecile tries again and once again screws up.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               Oh, I suck. I suck.

<b>                              RONALD
</b>               Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.

     Cecile takes a deep breath

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               You're concentrating too much on your
               bowing. Let it flow.

     He stands and sits behind her.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Here, let me help you.

     He places his hand over hers.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and let's try again.

     She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds
     much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's
     face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.

     ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses
     her face.

     Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach
     Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes
     his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens
     her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.

     ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table
     which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.

     Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
               Your playing was beautiful.

     Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's
               giving me music lessons over the
               summer.

     Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand.

<b>                              RONALD
</b>               Pleased to meet you.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Likewise I'm sure.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               Ronald is one of the few high school
               students attending Juliard. He's
               composing his first opera.

<b>                              RONALD
</b>               It's based on the life of Doctor
               Martin Luther King.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               Doctor King is my favorite.

     Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him
     and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.

<b>                              RONALD
</b>               I guess our hour's up. Same time
               tomorrow?

     Cecile nods.

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               Any ideas who it could be?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Blaine, if I knew who it was that person
               wouldn't be alive right now.

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               Where did you say she's from?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               Greg McConnell.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               The football stud?

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be
               surprised if he was your rat.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               It would make sense. McConnell hates me.
               I fingered his girlfriend at the game
               last year.

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               I don't think that bothered him.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               What do you mean?

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight
               ends on and off the field.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Are you shitting me?

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak
               in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd
               go at it for a while, then as soon as
               he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You
               know -
                    (imitating Greg)
               "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag.
               I'll kick your ass if you say anything."
                    (beat)
               It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're
               gay, deal with it. The only reason why
               I let him continue with his charade is
               because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               Not anymore. Football team started
               practice last week. He's already called
               me to hook up.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

               my behalf?

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing
               Spartacus on television tonight.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Outstanding.

<b>                              BLAINE
</b>               Don't think it's not going to cost you.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               No problem. Just make sure your front
               door is unlocked. Shall we say the
               "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?

     Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.

     Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies
     around them. Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and
     a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind
     Cecile and braids her hair.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               So, rumor has it that you went on a date
               with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very
               nice.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               He's alright.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               Eww. No. That's gross.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               It's not gross. How else do you think
               girls learn? Here turn around and
               face me.

     Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and wet your lips.

<b>                              CECILE

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               I guess. It still sounds gross.

     Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses
     her on the mouth.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               See that wasn't so bad.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Let's try it again, only this time I'm
               going to stick my tongue in your
               mouth. When I do that I want you to
               massage my tongue with yours. That's
               what first base is.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>                    (reluctant)
               Okay.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Eyes closed.

     Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her
     again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her
     then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does
     as instructed and they start to make out.

     Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands
     are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and
     continues her seduction.

     She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under
     her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.

     Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other
     and smile.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Not bad.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Maybe you should try it on your friend

     Annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. She sits by the
     pool as Sebastian treads water away from her.

               You know it amazes me that someone as
               bright as you can be so horrible.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

               never taken a single step or spoken a
               single word without some dishonorable
               or criminal intention. Every young girl
               he has successfully pursued has
               regretted it.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

               me so I might have the opportunity to
               confront them face to face. How do you

     then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece
     bathing suit underneath.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               No, it's okay. I mean I look at you

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Do you deny that there's an attraction

</b>               You don't find me cute? Come on, look

     He flexes for her. She laughs.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

</b>               Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
               that.

     He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs
     him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.

<b>                              ANNETTE

     Annette climbs out of the pool.

               Jesus Christ, I was only kidding.
               What do you think, I'm gay? My God,

<b>                              BLAINE

<b>                              GREG

     Blaine and Sebastian laugh.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I'll leave you guys alone.

               Score one for the team, Greg.

     Sebastian leaves the room, then re-enters.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Come to think of it, there is
               something you can do for me.

<b>30   EXT. ESTATE - ROAD - DAY                                   30
</b>
     Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY
     YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and
     lands on the road. Sebastian is driving.

     Annette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to
     her.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Need a lift?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               No thank you.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               How are you today?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Give it up.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Oh right, last night. I guess I owe
               you an apology.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I'm not going to speak to you till you
               realize that you can't intimidate me.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I said I was sorry.

     She continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice sleep last night?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               It was fine.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I wish I could say the same for
               myself. I was up thinking about you
               all night.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I thought we agreed that we were going
               to be friends.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Yes, well unfortunately I can't just
               switch the "on" button to "off." The
               sad fact of the matter is that you've
               unintentionally rubbed off on me.

     Annette stops running and turns to him.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               And that's a bad thing?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I'm trying to better myself, but the
               one person who can help me is the same
               one pushing me away.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your
               savior.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Well try this one on for size. I think
               I'm falling in love with you.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               You don't even know me.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Don't you believe in love at first sight?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this
               is far from mutual.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Ouch. Do you think we could spend some
               time together this morning?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I can't. I'm seeing a friend.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Who?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               That's none of your business.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               How about tonight?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I'm busy.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Doing what?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               That's also none of your business.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I
               win your heart. I'll do anything. I
               can't get you out of my mind.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               You truly want to do something to make
               me happy?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Yes.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               And you promise to abide by it?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Without question.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Alright.
                    (beat)
               I want you to leave and go back to
               New York.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               What?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               If that's a problem, then I'll make
               arrangements to stay with some friends.

     Sebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               It's not about being happy. You and I
               can't -

     He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away.

     ocean.

<b>                              GREG
</b>               He told you he's failing in love

               say those words before.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Really? I thought he said it all

               mostly bullshit.

     He's met with no resistance.

</b>               I hate when things don't go my way. It

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I hate it too.

     He takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her
     skirt.

     She takes his hand out from under her pants.

               No pootie.

     Kathryn smiles.

</b>               Of course. The animals. How silly of

</b>               Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't

               her reputation at Oakwood and I don't
               want to see her get hurt.

     Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales
     counter.

               I hope I did the right thing in telling
               you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things

<b>                              MRS. CALDWELL

<b>                              SALESWOMAN

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home.

<b>                              MRS. CALDWELL
</b>               Let me get that for you.

<b>                              KATHRYN

     She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful
     of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on

               to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl
               it's wrong. Well let me tell you
               something, I didn't ask to be a girl.
               Do you think I relish the fact that I
               have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty
               four seven, so I can be considered a
               "laaaady." Do you think I take great
               delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so
               wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child."
               "Kathryn is going to make an excellent
               wife one day."

               I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the
               upper East Side and sometimes I want to
               kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy
               being a part of the weaker sex and for
               that reason everyone around me is going
               to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis
               Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you
               out?

     Sebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and
     dials.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright,
               stop crying. I understand. Hold on for
               Sebastian.

     She hands the phone to Sebastian.

</b>               Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me
               very carefully. I have a letter from
               Ronald that he asked me to give to
               you. Now I can't exactly bring it to
               your house, since your mother

     The clock reads 1:30. A large collection of antiques
     and stuffed animals line the room and walls. Cecile
     lies in bed, eyes wide open. She crawls out of it,
     dressed in sweats.

</b>               He'll love it.

     He points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo.

<b>                              CECILE

</b>               Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes
               don't do you justice. Why don't you
               take them off.

     Cecile gasps.

</b>               I'm getting out of here.

     She stands to leave. Sebastian blocks her path.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

     He moves toward the phone

</b>               Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               My mom? Don't call my mom.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't 
               know you're here. In fact, you're
               grounded. Jesus, you could get in a
               shitload of trouble for this.
               I think I should call her anyway.

     Cecile runs over to him, sobbing, and wraps her arms
     around his legs.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               Please please please. I'll do

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Cecile, all I want to do is give you a

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               And then I can go home?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Of course. I'm not a monster.

     Cecile breathes a sigh of relief. He pulls her up to her
     feet.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               Just a kiss, right?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I swear.

     She closes her eyes, then puckers up. Sebastian takes the
     string holding up her sweats and pulls it open.

     Cecile bolts up.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               What are you doing?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               You promised to let me kiss you.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               But -

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>                    (pointing at her lips)
               I don't want to kiss you here. I want
               to kiss you there.

     Sebastian points to her crotch. She moves her hands to
     her sweats and looks up at him. Sebastian shrugs.

     Cecile pulls the string to her sweats. They fall to the
     floor.

     Cecile stands in front of her mirror, crying. She applies
     make-up to several hickeys on her neck. She XXX down
     her shirt and grimaces. She sticks her finger the make-
     up bottle, then puts her hand down her shirt.

</b>               It's weird. I actually feel good about

</b>               You must take me for a real idiot.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               You're going to tell me that you had a

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I did. We played three games of backgammon

     She throws him a look.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Alright. I was bored out of my fucking

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Yes it does.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being

               I can't win with you.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               It's not about winning. You know what
               your problem is? You take yourself way
               too seriously.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I do not.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Lighten up.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Fine.

     They drive on in silence. A smile comes over Annette's
     face. She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a
     face. Sebastian looks over.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               What are you doing? Stop it, it's

     She holds the face. Sebastian starts to laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Cut it out.

     He continues to laugh. She stops making the face.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Oh dear, are you actually laughing?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               No.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               No?

     She makes the face again. He laughs.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Stop that.

     She laughs with him.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               There's hope for you, yet.

     there with a worried look on her face.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               I... I don't think you want to know.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Cecile, you have to tell me.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               It involves your brother. He... took

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Does your mother know?

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               If she knew, she'd kill me. It
               happened at your house last night.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Why didn't you do something?

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               I don't know.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               So, let me get this straight. You
               came over to our house late last night
               and he forced intercourse on you.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               Well... not exactly.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               He made you give him a blow job.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               No.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Well what then?

     Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               He ate you out?

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               If that's what you call it.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Cecile, I think you're going to have
               a hard time crying rape if that's all
               he did.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               What do I do then?

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Well did you like it?

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               Well... I don't know - it was weird.
               At first it felt icky, then it felt
               kind of okay. Then, I started getting
               really hot and then I started shaking
               and then like, I don't t know... it
               felt like an explosion, but a good one.

     Kathryn laughs.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Cecile, you had an orgasm.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               I did?

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a
               woman.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               I am?

     Kathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Now listen. Now that you're on your
               way, it would be stupid of you to stop.
               Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him
               instruct you.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               I don't love him. I love Ronald.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               So? Don't you want to make Ronald a
               happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,
               Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as
               many people as possible.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               But that would make me a slut.
                    (beat)
               Wouldn't it?

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
               that nobody talks about it.

     Cecile takes the information in.

<b>                              CECILE
</b>               It's like a secret society.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               That's one way of looking at it.

<b>                              CECILE

     The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully
     grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian
     tickles her back.

     They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on
     top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and
     Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she
     pushes him off her.

     Sebastian stands.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Because I'm in love with you.

</b>               I thought you said we were going to be
               friends.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I can't handle it. I can't keep my
               feelings bottled up like you. Can you
               honestly tell me that you feel nothing
               for me? ... Tell me!

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I have feelings for you.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Then what's wrong? I love you Annette.
               It's not like you have a husband,
               unless your married to Jesus.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               That's not fair.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Why can't we be together?

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               It's because I don't trust myself with
               you.
                    (beat)
               I took a vow and because of you I'm
               tempted to break it. Don't destroy that

     waves.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I just came to say goodbye.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

</b>               Well, I'm afraid you don't have a

               sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't
               associate with hypocrites.

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Oh please Annette. You spend all your
               time preaching about waiting for love.
               Well here it is. Right in front of you,
               but you're going to turn your back on
               it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age
               where we can get married. If we were,
               I'd propose, but that's not going to
               happen. So I guess we're just fucked.
               I'll move on, but you... you're going
               to have to live with yourself knowing
               you've turned your back on love. And
               that makes you a hypocrite.

     Sebastian heads to the door.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice life.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               I... I want you.

     Sebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed.

     She lies down and starts to unbutton her dress. Sebastian
     stands over her watches her. Her crying does not let up
     as she continues to undress.

     Sebastian stands, stunned and watches her.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

     He wipes his eyes, which are starting to water. He goes
     over to a mirror at looks at himself.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

     and looks up to see Kathryn staring down at him.

               go with Mrs. Jesus?

     Sebastian sits up in bed.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

<b>                              KATHRYN

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Exactly the opposite.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               So what went wrong?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I don't know. She was lying on the bed,
               ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I
               was... I just didn't feel right about
               it.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               You're telling me you had the chance to

</b>               Ooops.

     They both laugh. They kiss some more, then start to
     unbutton each other's clothes. Sebastian struggles with
     her pants' button.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Fuck this.

     He picks her up again and moves to the bed. They
     collapse on the bed and he accidently falls off it.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Suave.

     Annette cracks up. Sebastian reaches up and YANKS her
     down on top of him. They both laugh, then kiss.

     wearing only her bathrobe.

               witness your little adventure or else
               you wouldn't have invited me in.

     Sebastian walks toward the closet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Who is our little friend so
               inexperienced that you have to resort
               to the alphabet game?

     He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there
     covering his genitals with his hands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)

     Ronald picks up his clothes. As he leaves:

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Say hi to Cecile.

     Ronald's head drops as he closes the door behind him.

     Sebastian throws Kathryn a look.

               You can't have all the fun.

     Sebastian sits on the bed.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

               Soleil acrobatics, just standard
               missionary stuff, but it was... ah
               forget it. I'm going to sound like a
               Hallmark card.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               No, tell me.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               It was... it was like the emotional
               part outweighed the physical part.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear
               the birds chirping.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Mock, mock, mock.

     She places her hand on his crotch.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               So I assume you've come here to make
               some arrangements.

     Sebastian stands.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Some other time.

<b>                              KATHRYN

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I'm not in the mood.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               And that's why you're leaving?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               I want to fuck.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               And I don't.

     He leaves and slams the door behind him.

     Sebastian talks on the phone.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I'll pick you up in an hour. I love

     He hangs up the phone. Kathryn stands in the doorway.

<b>                              KATHRYN

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               No, I'm not.

<b>                              KATHRYN

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               What's wrong with you? Why are you
               acting this way?

     Kathryn starts to cry.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're
               in love with her. You don't love me
               anymore.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a
               contest.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               At first it was, but now it's become
               something bigger.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Kathryn, you know I love you. I've
               always loved you.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I can't believe you're reacting this
               way. You're just saying this because
               you lost the bet.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Is that what you think?

     He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her
     underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it
     aside, spreading her legs.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright, come on, let's get it over
               with. But mark my words, this is the
               only time it'll happen.

     She picks up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in
               me. While you're doing that I'm gonna
               make some phone calls.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               That's not fair. You're taking all the
               fun out of it.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Then do me a favor and get rid of her.
               If not for me, then do it for you.
               Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's
               turned you into jelly. What do you want
               to be, one of those losers who walk
               down the halls holding hands and
               smiling. People used to respect you.
               They feared you and now you're going to
               throw that all away.

     Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but

               time were madly in love with each
               other. But she had this huge weight
               problem. His friends taunted him
               mercilessly about it. You know, "How
               do you breathe when she sits on your
               face?" "It's embarrassing for you to
               be seen with her." Finally he couldn't
               take it anymore and decided to dump
               her. She flipped and he went on the
               defensive. I distinctly remember him
               saying the same thing over and over
               again. "I'm completely fucked up."
               "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm

               Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think
               it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm
               completely fucked up.

     Annette bursts into tears.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               Why are you trying to hurt me?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I'm just being honest. I just wanted to
               see what you were like in bed.

     She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off.
     He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with
     his hand.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea
               would appreciate you acting like a
               total psychopath.

     She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               You don't know how to love.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               You don't even know me. The fact of the
               matter is there is some one I love.
               She's smarter, prettier... you don't
               even compare to her. The only reason I
               am here is because she wants us to be
               exclusive.

<b>                              ANNETTE
</b>               But you knew this was important to me.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               What, your virginity? Well that's over
               now.

     Annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob. He moves
     towards her.

<b>                              ANNETTE

</b>               Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.

     He leaves and closes the door behind him. Annette
     continues to sob.

     Sebastian is sitting in a chair, wearing his shades,
     journal in hand.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               A little melodramatic, don't you think.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Annette?

     He takes off his glasses. We can tell he has been
     crying.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Devastated beyond repair. I doubt

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Well done.

     He holds up a bottle of champagne.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I thought we should celebrate.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Ronald?

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Not that it's any of your business but

     Sebastian holds up a letter.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               From Ronald.

     Kathryn takes the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I haven't had a chance to read it, but
               I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah
               yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me.
               Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be
               friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
               You see, I expected your sort of
               bullshit so I took the liberty of
               phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now
               they're having a little get together
               in my love shack at the Grand Central
               Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile
               over you, but I promised him I would
               see you through your crisis.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Well done.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Thank you. Now, where were we?

     POP goes the champagne cork.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oh yeah, the celebration.

     He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them
     and hands one to Kathryn.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What shall we toast to?

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               To my triumph, of course.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Not my choice of toast, but it's your
               call. To your triumph over Annette.

     Kathryn giggles.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Come again?

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               You were very much in love with her and
               you're still in love with her. But it
               amused me to make you ashamed of it.
               You gave up on the first person you
               ever loved because I called you names.
               Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that
               you chose me over her, but please
               understand, I never loved you,
               Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little
               toy I play with. And now you've
               completely blown it with her. I think
               that's the saddest thing I've ever
               heard.
                    (smiles)
               Cheers.

     She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't
     drink. He looks ill.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               In any event, you still owe me my

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't

     Sebastian slaps her across the face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You motherfucker!

     She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They
     fall to the ground.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Nobody hits me.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

     He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Get off me!

<b>                              SEBASTIAN

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Fine! Get off me!

     He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their
     breaths.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               I accept. Now get out.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Get out? We had an arrangement.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               Didn't you hear what I said?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               I don't care what you said, we had an
               agreement. You've slept with half of
               the borough so don't tell me you're
               being choosy.

<b>                              KATHRYN

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               And if I don't?

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               Then I will consider it a declaration
               of war. One. Two... three.

<b>                              KATHRYN
</b>               I think you have your answer.

<b>                              SEBASTIAN
</b>               War it is.

     He grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind
     him.

</b>               It's desperate that I talk to her.

     Sebastian walks the streets of New York. He seems sad
     and lonely.

</b>               Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded
               in hurting the first person I loved. I
               wish more than anything I could take it
               back, but I guess that's not possible.

               collection of my conquests. If you

               we have a summer home. Nothing would
               make me happier than if you joined me.
               I'm a fucking wreck without you. If
               you're interested please meet me
               outside my building at nine. If not, I
               understand. Love, Sebastian.

     Sebastian says nothing.

               It's true, isn't it?

     top of him and hits in the mouth.

     He knees Ronald in the groin. Ronald screams in pain and
     falls over. Sebastian climbs to his feet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why don't you give me a chance to

               Don't you get it? We were all part of
               her game.

     Sebastian pins him to the ground. Ronald struggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm gonna let you up, but you have to
               give me a chance to explain. Understood?

     Ronald nods. Sebastian releases him and Ronald catches
     his breath. Sebastian looks up and SEES -

     Annette, standing across the street, witnessing the
     event.

     Sebastian looks up just as -- WHAM! The taxi HITS him
     dead on, sending him flying over the car and onto the
     street.

     Annette SCREAMS. The cab SKIDS to a stop. Annette runs
     into the street and over to Sebastian, who lies in shock,
     He sees her and grabs her hand. She starts to cry.

               Kathryn, please. Crying? Didn't you
               once say that crying is a sign of
               weakness? I'm very disappointed in you.

     Kathryn continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Alright, stop crying. There's a bright
               side to this you know.

     Annette puts a comforting arm around her.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're going to be my pet project next
               year. You're going to do what I tell
               you to do, wear what I tell you to
               wear. You're going to befriend the
               unpopular, sleep with the insecure.
               Think of the social ramifications it
               will cause. You and I are going to turn
               this school around. And do you know why
               you're going to do it?
                    (beat)
               Cause your ass is mine.

     Annette grabs Kathryn by the face, KISSES her forcefully
     on the mouth, then shoves her back. Kathryn looks at her
     in horror.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We'll be in touch.

     She winks at Kathryn then leaves.

     CLOSE ON: Kathryn. She sits down on Sebastian's bed,
     utterly defeated.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Forgot something.

     Annette steps back into frame and takes the car keys out
     of Kathryn's hands.

     Annette races down the highway. She opens up the glove
     compartment and rifles through some cassettes. She takes
     out The Carpenter's Greatest Hits and inserts it.

     CUE UP: The Carpenter's singing "Goodbye To Love."

     Annette reaches down and takes out Sebastian's
     sunglasses. She puts them on and checks herself out in
     the rear-view mirror. A grin crosses her face.

     We MOVE off the Porsche and ascend into the air. The
     Porsche weaves through traffic as it disappears into a
     sea of cars. WE SEE the Manhattan skyline in the background
     as WE -
