THE COMPANY OF WOLVES

unauthorized transcript

of the film by

Neil Jordan and Angela Carter

EXT. WOODS -- DAY

High angle crane shot of an old well, crumbling, surrounded by dead trees
and brown leaves. Crane down to ground level as a large German Shepherd runs
around from behind the well and noses at something hidden in the long dry
grass at the base of the old well.

CLOSEUP of a Victorian china BOY doll lying in the grass, the dog's nose
nuzzling at it.

The dog runs off left.

Brow of hill: dog races up towards camera and runs past.

Bare ground and a blasted tree; camera tracks left as the dog runs through
shot and off left.

A rotting fallen tree; the dog leaps over it into camera and runs past,
dislodging a large toad which falls out of shot.

A stream running between low banks; the dog leaps from right bank to left
and out of shot, startling a large raven into the air.

Bare trees; tilt down to show a roadway and a silver bmw speeding towards
camera.

Tracking shot (as if from car) following the dog as it races through the
trees beside the road; slow zoom in on dog.

The roadway; in extreme foreground a large rat scurries away off left as the
bmw approaches.

EXT. HOUSE -- DAY

The rear of a large three--story country house, cream--coloured and
resplendent in an expanse of green lawn and trees. ALICE, an adolescent girl
in a long white dress runs away from camera towards the house and up the
back stairs.

The front of the house seen through open, ornate wrought--iron gates; the
silver BMW comes into shot at left and wheels away down the drive towards
the house. The dog races into shot in close pursuit.

The dog dashing along the drive.

Low angle (as if from the dog's pov) of the car turning in the drive.

The dog runs after it.

Rapid track in on the rear of the car as it pulls to a stop in front of the
house.

The front entrance as ALICE emerges and runs down the front steps; track
back to include the car as the passenger door opens and MOTEER emerges,
wearing a smart grey suit, and kisses ALICE.

ALICE: Hello, mummy!

MOTHER: Hello, darling.

ALICE: Any presents for me?

MOTHER: A surprise.

ALICE:  What?

MOTHER: You know!

ALICE: No I don't - what?

They move to the back of the car, where FATHER has opened the hatchback
trunk and is unloading bags of groceries. MOTHER pulls out a small potted
palm wrapped in brown paper and hands it to ALICE.

MOTHER: Where is she? Did she miss tea again?

ALICE as she takes the plant; we notice that she has a small silver crucifix
on a chain around her neck.

ALICE: She said she had tummy--ache. . .

FATHER and MOTHER continue to unload the car.

ALICE: (os). . . so she's sulking in her room.

FATHER It's her age.

ALICE: She's a pest!

MOTHER: So were you once! Now go and wake her.

plant down onto a table beside a large divan, drops the carrybag onto the
divan and runs up stairs at left.

FATHER: Well, I have - I've tried. . . I've been upstairs to see her. . .

FATHER: She always tells me I don't understand her.

MOTHER: Oh, that's ridiculous.

FATHER: Well, she's right.

INT. HOUSE

The landing as dog runs up stairs past old wooden furniture, a large house
plant on a small table, and goes off left.

stairs and off left.

camera tracks back in front of dog. Old, peeling radiators.

Reverse low angle shot (as if dog's pov): camera tracks quickly along the
corridor, which has an old faded carpet and large, dark oil portraits
propped up on the floor against the walls on either side.

Dog stops outside ROSALEEN's room and sniffs at the door.

ALICE runs along the downstairs corridor away from camera, past the old
furniture and the house plant, and mounts the stairs.

The dog is sitting outside the door as the ALICE reaches the top of the
stairs in bg. and runs towards the camera. She reaches the door and pushes
irritably at the dog.

She shoves at the dog impatiently.

ALICE: Go away!

She knocks sharply at the door.

A white dress hanging on the back of the door; grandMOTHER doll visible at
the left of the door.

alice (off): They want you downstairs! You have to come out sometime - you
can't sulk in there forever! Open the door! Open it! You've been at my
lipstick too, haven't you! Pest!

During this the camera tracks in and pans slowly left to show the
grandMOTHER doll on a shelf beside the door; then an antique dresser with an
oval mirror, in which we see ROSALEEN reflected asleep on her bed; a clock,
a disarranged box of Kleenex, then the bed itself with ROSALEEN fully
dressed atop it, curled asleep.

INT. HALLWAY

ALICE at the door.

ALICE: What makes you so different anyway! Buck Teeth! Come on out -

her breast. MOTHER kisses ALICE's forehead, looks at her sadly, then reaches
down to remove the crucifix and chain from around ALICE's neck. Camera pans
up with MOTHER as she stands to put it around ROSALEEN's neck. We see GRANNY
at right of shot, other mourners behind.

MOTHER: Say goodbye to your sister now, so you'll never forget her.

ROSALEEN looks uncertainly at MOTHER, stoops down to kiss ALICE's forehead,
glances again at MOTHER, looks down miserably.

Resume on ALICE, as a coffin lids slides up into shot to hide her face.

FATHER and PEASANT pass in front of the camera, blacking out the screen
momentarily.

Dark screen which is disclosed as dark tree trunk as camera pans left to
disclose the village in LS, well in the centre. Crane down as cart comes

her.

She moves off left.

EXT. WOODS - EVENING

GRANNY and ROSALEEN appear in the distance walking along the path. Dark
music.

GRANNY: It's a long way through the wood, but safe by daylight. Safe if you
keep to the path. . .  (music drowns out her words)

GRANNY stops and goes to a small shrub, picks something.

GRANNY: There's lots more of these in the wood, if you know where to look!

ROSALEEN:   (looks off right) Berries!

She darts away.

Shot past a bush of berries in f.g. to ROSALEEN and GRANNY in b.g. ROSALEEN
picks a berry and pops it into her mouth. GRANNY flies forward, grabs
ROSALEEN and drags her back.

GRANNY: Don't. . .

CLOSE MEDIUM SHOT as she pulls ROSALEEN up from screen left.

GRANNY: . . . stray from the path, girl! Did you not hear what I told you?
Once you stray from the path you're lost entirely!   (she leads ROSALEEN
down the path) The wild beasts know no mercy. They wait for us in the wood,
in the shadow, and once you put a foot wrong -

EXT. COTTAGE

In the yard is a small apple tree. ROSALEEN bends down and picks up a fallen
apple from under the tree.

ROSALEEN: Granny, can I have one?

GRANNY: I can't see why not.

ROSALEEN bites into the apple, grimaces and spits it out.

close shot of the apple in her hand. A large worm wriggles inside the bite
mark.

GRANNY:   (chuckling) You've got a lot to learn, child.

She takes the apple and tosses it away.

GRANNY: Never stray from the path, never eat a windfall apple . . .

She picks another apple from the tree and gives it to ROSALEEN.

GRANNY: . . . and never trust a man whose eyebrows meet!

She strokes ROSALEEN's cheek and goes into the cottage. ROSALEEN bites
hungrily into the apple and follows her.

EXT. GRANNY'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

A white owl in a tree.

The cottage, chimney smoking, under a luminous full moon.

INT. GRANNY'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

A cheery fire burning. ROSALEEN is sitting on the floor beside GRANNY in her
chair. GRANNY is rolling up a ball of bright red wool.

GRANNY: The best winter wool, pet, woven across the valley - so good, so
soft I thought I'd knit a shawl for your sister. But now, you know what I'll
do?

ROSALEEN: What, Gran?

GRANNY: I'll make one for you! A very special shawl for a very special lady.

She rubs the wool against ROSALEEN's cheek.

ROSALEEN: Soft as a kitten.

GRANNY smiles down at her, her spectacles lit by the fire; then her
expression hardens.

GRANNY: There's something I should tell you.

ROSALEEN:   (startled) Yes?

GRANNY: But maybe you`re too young.

ROSALEEN: Tell me, Gran!

GRANNY: Too young to understand.

ROSALEEN: Oh, go on, Gran, tell me!

GRANNY: Maybe no child is ever too young.  (pause) A wolf may be more than
he seems. He may come in many disguises.

ROSALEEN: What's that?

GRANNY: The wolf that ate your sister was hairy on the outside. But when she
died she went straight to Heaven. The worst kind of wolves are hairy on the
inside, and when they bite you, they drag you with them to Hell!

ROSALEEN: What do you mean, hairy on the inside? Like a furry coat?

GRANNY: Hush now, foolish child, and listen. Once upon a time there was a
WOMAN in the village, and she married a travelling man. . .

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Jubilant fiddle music. villagers dance down the path, all garlanded with
flowers, surrounding the happy BRIDE and GROOM.

He sweeps her into his arms and carries her over the threshold of an
isolated cottage.

INT. BRIDE'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

The BRIDE and GROOM stand in their night dress before an open window which
admits bright moonlight. The BRIDE still has her garland in her hair.

GROOM: (turning from the window) They've all gone now.

BRIDE: It's a shame your people missed the wedding.

GROOM: (cryptically) Maybe it is and maybe it isn't.

She turns and goes to the bed, turns back the covers.

close shot as the covers turn back, revealing a tiny hedgehog in the middle
of the bed.

She laughs and scoops it up to show him.

BRIDE: My brother`s idea of a joke!

The GROOM stares at her.

BRIDE: Why are you staring like that?

GROOM: Because I've never seen anything like you before.

BRIDE: Don't they have girls where you come from?

GROOM: Not like you.

She slowly removes the garland of flowers from her hair and puts it aside
tenderly.

In the shadows the GROOM removes his nightshirt.

BRIDE: Come out of the shadows. Let me see you, my love.

He walks forward slowly, the candlelight glowing on his bare chest.

BRIDE: Are all travelling men as handsome as you?

GROOM: So you think I'm handsome?

BRIDE: The first thing I noticed about you - was the way your eyebrows meet.

GROOM: Does that spoil me then?

BRIDE: Come to me and I'll tell you.

He bends to kiss her. There is a screech and he yelps in pain.

The hedgehog on the floor under his feet.

He seizes it and goes to the door to throw it out into the yard.

The opened door reveals the full moon. Music.

The GROOM stops to stare at the moon, leaning weakly against the door jamb.

BRIDE: My dear?

GROOM: (thickly) I must . . . just go into the yard. . . for a moment. . .

BRIDE: Why ever for?

He turns his head towards her; his pupils are bright red.

GROOM: Call of nature.

He goes out, shutting the door behind him.

She smiles uncertainly, gets into bed and snuggles down against the pillow
to wait for him.

INT. GRANNY'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

GRANNY: So she waited. . . and she waited. . .

INT. BRIDE'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

GRANNY (vo): . . . and she waited again.

The BRIDE sits up and gets out of bed.

BRIDE: (to herself, uncertainly) Surely he`s been gone a long time?

She walks toward the door. A wolf howls outside.

She freezes in terror, then forces herself towards the window.

EXT. BRIDE'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

Several wolves in the yard under the blue full moon; one atop the low stone
wall barks in answer to distant howling.

INT. BRIDE'S COTTAGE - NIGHT

BRIDE: No! It can't be!

EXT. WOODS - DAWN

VILLAGERS armed with rifles searching through ground mist, moving through
the trees towards camera.

MAN: He upped and ran, that`s all. It was in his blood. Wasn't he a
travelling man?

CLOSE SHOT: BRIDE's hand lifting a dead leaf from the ground to reveal a
deep wolf print in the wet earth below.

BRIDE bent over at edge of pond. In the pond wades another villager probing
the bottom with a long stick. He shakes his head. She looks up right, jumps
to her feet.

villagers approach down the path at right.

BRIDE: Anything?

MAN: Not a hair nor a hide of him. Nor a footprint.

She pushes him in the chest angrily, runs back to point to the edge of the
pond.

BRIDE: What's that, might I ask? I told you I heard a wolf last night! They
came and took him while he was making water, when a man. . .

She sinks to her knees.

CLOSE SHOT as she lowers her head.

BRIDE: . . . is at his most defenseless.  (looks up in tears) Murderers!

Pan up to stool on which stands an alarm clock, chiming delicately. The
BRIDE's hand reaches out from under the eiderdown to turn it off, then
retracts under the eiderdown, her laughter mingling with that of her

children, all tearful.

granny (v0) First time passed, happily enough.

The BRIDE wipes one baby's face, puts it down.

BRIDE: What a mess!  (baby wails) Oh, don't start!

She picks up another baby and dandles it while she peels potatoes angrily.
The first baby wails.

BRIDE: Shut up! Here.

She gives the baby a bit of peeled potato.

granny (vo) Time passed, and she gave him children. And that was a bad time
for wolves, those years, oh yes! Not a sheep or a cow was safe. But for
herself all went right as a trivet - until. . .

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT

granny (vo) . . . one winter's night. . .

Camera pans and tracks through dark trees to show the lighted window of the
cottage. Wolves howl in the distance.

A ragged figure with long matted hair limps out of the darkness towards the
cottage.

He rubs his hand over a dirty window pane; in the cleared space we see the
BRIDE within feeding her children at the table.

He limps around the side of the cottage.

INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT

The BRIDE feeding fresh wood into the fire. A heavy knock on the door. She
gets up andpens the door to reveal the waiting figure.

Her astonished face.

The disheveled GROOM walks in slowly. She stares at him.

BRIDE: My God. . .

He glares at the children, sits heavily at the table.

GROOM: I'm starving.

One of the children bursts into alarmed tears. She quickly scoops it away
from the table.

BRIDE: Do you want something to eat?

GROOM: Didn't you hear me the first time!

She ladles out a bowl of soup. He pulls his hair away from his face, leans
forward and spoons it up. Baby cries loudly.

GROOM: Where did these three spring from?

BRIDE: Out of my belly!

GROOM:  (snarling) Your children - but not my children! Whore! Adulteress!

She backs away from him.

GROOM: You hoped I'd never come back!

He overturns the table.

BRIDE: I thought the wolves had taken you!

GROOM: Better a wolf than a whore! If I were wolf once more, I'd teach this
whore a lesson!

He tears his shirt open.

She throws a ladle full of soup in his face.

He screams and covers his face with his hands.

She stares at him.

He rips away the skin from his face.

She stares, transfixed with horror.

He rips the skin from his face and neck with a skeletal hand.

The hand claws at her; she beats it off and backs away behind a post.

The hand peels his face entirely away, revealing a bloody grinning skull.

She cowers.

The hand rips his hair off; the naked bloody skull turns.

It howls.

She screams.

The skull elongates into a wolf's skull.

The BRIDE straightens and walks across the room to stare down at the bucket.

The SECOND HUSBAND watches her darkly.

She kneels down beside the bucket.

Her hand touches the floating head gently.

BRIDE  (wondering) He looks just the same. . .

ROSALEEN: That's a horrid story! I didn't like it at all.

GRANNY: It's not a story, child, but God's own truth. So if you should spy
on a naked man in the wood, run as if the Devil himself were after you!

The OLD PRIEST comes out of the rectory carrying heavy pruning shears. He
takes off his hat and plops it over the top of the tombstone next to GRANNY
and climbs up the ladder against the tree.

ROSALEEN: (whispers) The Devil's one thing, but a priest making babies is
another! I don't think our priest would have it in him.

GRANNY: (loudly) You can't trust anyone, least of all a priest! He's not
called FATHER for nothing! And don't bother to whisper - he's deaf as a
post!

Up in the tree the OLD PRIEST chops at a branch.

GRANNY holds out the red shawl.

GRANNY There - isn't that lovely? All we need is a nice border and fringe.
See how soft it feels!

She holds it out to ROSALEEN who tries it on delightedly.

ROSALEEN: Soft as snow!

GRANNY; Red as a berry!

monkey! FATHER!

The OLD PRIEST goes on pruning branches.

GRANNY FATHER, are you climbing up to Heaven and chopping the rungs of the
ladder after you? Watch what you're doing! Can you hear me?

OLD PRIEST Don't make so much clamour in the garden of God's house, you
irreverent old woman! I heard every word!

GRANNY   (indignantly) Well, what a silly game!

MOTHER: Daddy, leave her be!

ROSALEEN jumps up from the window seat and takes the bouquet from him.

ROSALEEN: He only asked me to walk with him. What's wrong with that?

MOTHER: All the same, I don't know. It's not as if ==

FATHER: Ah, where's the harm in it, he's our neighbour's son, she's known
him since she was a baby. She still is a baby.

MOTHER: So was our Alice once.

FATHER: She'll be gone soon enough, she's so pretty. What is it they say -
it's not losing a daughter, it's gaining a son?

ROSALEEN and MOTHER.

MOTHER:   (astonished) Where did you hear a story like that?

ROSALEEN: It's not a story, but God's honest truth! Granny told me.

MOTHER reacts.

ROSALEEN: And after that, the WOMAN made the wolves come to sing to her and
the baby at night. Made them come and serenade her.

MOTHER:   (laughing) But what pleasure could there be in that? Listening to
a lot of wolves! Don't we have to do it all the time?

ROSALEEN: The pleasure would come. . .

FATHER enters and throws his rifle down into the corner. MOTHER rushes to
close the door after him.

MOTHER:   (crosses herself) Praise be to God!

FATHER sits heavily at the table and holds up something wrapped in a cloth.

FATHER: When I cut it off the carcass for a trophy it was the forepaw. . .
the forepaw of the biggest wolf I ever saw.

MOTHER backs away and goes to ROSALEEN.

MOTHER: The wolf that killed our Alice?

FATHER: Aye, may be.

He puts the bundle on the table. MOTHER and ROSALEEN stare at it.

FATHER: When I cut it with the knife it was a forepaw, I swear, of a grizzle
giant wolf. . . and then before my very eyes. . .

He unwraps the bundle. MOTHER gasps and clutches ROSALEEN.

It is a severed man's hand, with a large ring on one finger.

ROSALEEN: Whose is it, Daddy? Is it someone you knew?

FATHER: What do I know whose hand it is! All I know is what I see.

MOTHER: Get it out!

ROSALEEN: Was it a man or a wolf you killed?

FATHER: When I killed it it was a wolf, and it turned into a man. Seeing is
believing.

ROSALEEN:  Is it? What about - touching?

Snow on the ground. The smith working the bellows of his forge.

The SMITH takes a glowing horseshoe out of the forge with long tongs and
carries it right to the anvil, where the BOY stands waiting to steady it
with another set of tongs. SMITH hammers at the horseshoe while we see
ROSALEEN emerge from the cottage in b.g., wearing an apron; the BOY looks up
and sees her. She bends down to throw grain to the geese, then goes back
inside.

The BOY uses his tongs to dip the horseshoe into a bucket of water; steam
hisses up. He holds up the horseshoe and examines it critically, looks o.s.
after ROSALEEN and smiles.

INT. COTTAGE

MS of MOTHER and ROSALEEN, ROSALEEN now wearing her red wool shawl; MOTHER
is packing a basket of food.

MOTHER: You're besotted with that old lady, and her old wives' tales. Maybe
you shouldn't go.

ROSALEEN: Daddy killed the great wolf. I'll be safe in the forest now,
Mummy.

MOTHER: Mind you don't stray - and take something to protect yourself with.

ROSALEEN picks up a long sharp carving knife.

ROSALEEN: How about a knife?

MOTHER: You're not afraid of anything, are you? You're a fearless child,
I'll say that. I suppose your Granny will ask you to stay the night. You
always were her favorite.

ROSALEEN: Of course I'll stay the night if she asks me - it'd be rude not
to. She is my grandmother, and she may not have a kind word for you, but
she's always been good to me. She's all alone out there, Mummy.

MOTHER takes down a black stoppered bottle.

MOTHER: Maybe you're right and maybe you're not.  (puts bottle into basket)
Give her that from me. And don't stray now, Rosaleen! I trust you. You won't
be lucky twice.

MOTHER opens the door and ROSALEEN goes out, carrying the basket.

EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

The BOY stands by the smithy whittling at a stick with his pocket knife. He
ducks out of sight as ROSALEEN emerges from her house in b.g., and dodges
round behind the smith to see where she is headed. He takes a few last cuts
at his stick, then hurries after her, dodging past men pushing heavy carts.

ROSALEEN walks along the snowy path, past a large white rabbit.

She walks past men pushing heavy mine carts filled with ore. The BOY runs
after her.

BOY ROSALEEN!

She stops and turns as he runs up.

BOY Where are you going?

ROSALEEN: To see my Granny.

BOY: It's a long ways through the woods! Let me come with you - you'd be
safe with me!

ROSALEEN:   (scornfully) Go into the woods with you? After what happened
last time?

BOY   (brandishing his knife) I'll protect you!

ROSALEEN smiles and produces her own, larger knife.

ROSALEEN: No. I've got this to protect me.

She brushes past him and runs off., He tries to follow but his path is
blocked by men pushing carts.

ROSALEEN crouches down beside it.

The toad leaps away abruptly.

ROSALEEN looks up in alarm, reaches for her knife, stands up warily.

She backs up, spins around.

HER POV: a bird flies off through the woods.

ROSALEEN backs up in the other direction - directly into the HUNTSMAN
standing smiling behind her. She whirls round in fright. He doffs his hat to
her with exaggerated courtesy, speaks with a distinct Continental accent.

HUNTSMAN: Miss?

ROSALEEN: Where did you spring from?

HUNTSMAN: Did I scare you? I am sorry.

ROSALEEN: At least you have your clothes on. Huntsman, are you? Lost your
horse?

HUNTSMAN: Lost my horse and lost my companions, young lady.

ROSALEEN: And lost your way too.

HUNTSMAN: I do believe I just found it.

She backs away.

HUNTSMAN: I say, do you think you could spare me a drink out of that?

ROSALEEN: It's for my Granny.

HUNTSMAN: I know the very place up the way for a picnic!

He takes the basket from her, offers her his arm, and leads the way.

CLOSEUP of the toad on the snow.

EXT. CLEARING - DAY

The HUNTSMAN and ROSALEEN sitting in the shelter of a few large trees, where
the snow is not so deep.

HUNTSMAN: I have the most remarkable object in my pocket. That means I never
lose my way in the woods.

ROSALEEN: In your pocket, you say?

HUNTSMAN: This object goes everywhere with me - that is, whenever I wear my
trousers.

ROSALEEN hands him a crisp cake. He bites into it hungrily.

HUNTSMAN: Umm.  (holds it out to her) Go on, bite it.

She leans forward; he retracts his hand puts the cake into his mouth,
extends it to her. She nibbles tentatively from the protruding end and then
backs quickly away. He smiles, uncorks the bottle, swigs from it.

ROSALEEN: Don't you know how strong that stuff is? A man in our village
keeps a still - he's the reddest nose you ever saw. He tells lies, too. Like
you. I don't believe there is such a thing.

The HUNTSMAN springs to his feet.

HUNTSMAN: Seeing is believing.

He takes something out from his trousers pocket, kneels down beside ROSALEEN
and holds it out to her. She looks. He opens it: a pocket compass.

HUNTSMAN: The little needle always points north, no matter where I go, so I
always know exactly where I am.

ROSALEEN takes the compass and examines it.

ROSALEEN: I don't believe it, even though I see it.

HUNTSMAN: It was this compass that brought me safe through the wood.

ROSALEEN: But you lost your way in the wood.

HUNTSMAN:   (caressing her hair) But I found you. Are you sorry?

ROSALEEN: I'm not sorry. They're clowns, the village boys.

HUNTSMAN: Well, then.

ROSALEEN: But don't you know you should never leave the path?

HUNTSMAN: I just got onto the path. I was perfectly safe before.

ROSALEEN: Aren't you afraid of the wolves?

HUNTSMAN: Why should I be frightened of wolves?

ROSALEEN: You must know the worse wolves are hairy on the inside.

He leaps to his feet in indignation.

HUNTSMAN: Old wives' tales! Peasant superstition! What, a bright young girl
- pretty, intelligent girl like you believing in werewolves!

ROSALEEN: But my Granny said that -

HUNTSMAN: For believing in old wives' tales, you deserve . . . to be
punished!

He seizes ROSALEEN and kisses her, rolling her onto the ground. She laughs.

HUNTSMAN: I'll show you I'm not afraid of the wolves, ROSALEEN. I'll make a
bet with you. I'll bet you anything you like that I get to your Granny's
house before you do.

ROSALEEN: How?

HUNTSMAN: I'll use my compass to help me cross the country while you trudge
along the dreary path!

ROSALEEN: Bet me your compass.

HUNTSMAN: Bet me your heart's desire.

ROSALEEN: And if I lose?

HUNTSMAN: You can give me . . . a kiss!

They sit up.

HUNTSMAN: Here - take my hat as a token of good will. Wear it, until we meet
again.

He puts it on her head, gets up and goes without another word.

ROSALEEN looks at herself in her hand mirror, the hat perched jauntily atop
her head.

She gets up and hurries along the path.

Snow falling. Owls hoot. The HUNTSMAN moves rapidly and surely through the
woods.

He approaches the cottage, goes through the gate.

He pauses, puts his hand to the game dangling from his belt, puts a finger
to his mouth - leaving a smear of blood on his lips.

Drops of blood fall onto the snow at his feet.

He moves on towards the cottage, his eyes aflame.

GRANNY staggers to her feet, holding her Bible in front of her like a
shield.

GRANNY Get you back to Hell from which you came!

HUNTSMAN: I don't come from Hell. I came from the forest.

GRANNY What have you done with my granddaughter?

HUNTSMAN: Nothing she didn't want!

She hurls the Bible at him.

He ducks.

It falls open against the far wall.

She grabs his gun and knocks him onto the floor with it. He howls in pain
and fright.

She looks down at him.

He turns his head, extending an impossibly long tongue.

She recoils in horror.

She turns and seizes the poker out of the fire, swinging it at him with all
her strength as he bounds to his feet.

He grabs the red-hot end of the poker and screams in pain.

He drops it, extending his smoking palm.

He turns and aims a blow at her.

The blow knocks her head off.

ROSALEEN enters and stares at the HUNTSMAN.

ROSALEEN: So. You got here before me just as you said you would.

HUNTSMAN: I did.

ROSALEEN: Where's my Granny?

HUNTSMAN: Gone out to the woodpile, to fetch more logs.

ROSALEEN: A real gentleman would never let an old lady go out, not on a
night like this.

HUNTSMAN: She won't be long.

ROSALEEN goes to the window and pulls back the curtain.

ROSALEEN: She's not there.

She turns and looks at him, then darts for the door, but he leaps up into
her path. She backs away from him.

Her heels comes down onto GRANNY's glasses, smashing them.

She looks down at them, then across at the fireplace.

her pov: grey hair burning in the grate.

ROSALEEN: Is that all you left of her? Your kind can't stomach hair, can you
- even if the worst wolves are hairy  on the inside!

HUNTSMAN: What do you know about my kind?

ROSALEEN: (groping behind her) My GRANNY told me plenty!

Her hands find the knife in the basket behind her. She brandishes it, and he
leaps forward to seize it.

HUNTSMAN: Are you very much afraid?

ROSALEEN: It wouldn't do me much good to be afraid, would it?

He forces her down onto her knees on the floor.

ROSALEEN: What big eyes you have!

HUNTSMAN: All the better to see you with.

ROSALEEN: They say seeing is believing, but I'd never swear to it.

HUNTSMAN: You must be wet through. Why don't you take off your shawl?

She shudders. He gently unties it, pulls her to her feet and removes the
shawl.

ROSALEEN: What should I do with it?

HUNTSMAN: Into the fire with it - you won't need it again.

She kneels down and puts it into the fire.

ROSALEEN: Your kind can't stomach clothes either.

CLOSEUP of the red shawl burning. Wolves howl outside.

She looks up.

ROSALEEN: who's come to sing us carols then?

so.

back my gun, my dear.

He moves towards her.

She shakes her head and fires.

An ornament on the shelf shatters into fragments.

He falls to the floor, howling in fear.

He looks up at her.

ROSALEEN: Are you our kind, or their kind?

HUNTSMAN: Not one kind or the other. Both.

ROSALEEN: Then where do you live? In our world, or in theirs?

HUNTSMAN: I come and go between them. My home is nowhere.

ROSALEEN: Are you only a man when you dress that way - like GRANNY said?

He looks down, unbuttons his shirt and pulls it off, spreading his bare
arms.

ROSALEEN: My, what big arms you have.

HUNTSMAN: The better to hug you with.

He rises and approaches her slowly.

ROSALEEN: Well. . . perhaps. . . you did win your bet, didn't you - you
gentleman, you fine gentleman. They say the Prince of Darkness is a
gentleman. They're right. A fine gentleman.

HUNTSMAN: (smiling) Gentlemen always keep their promises. Do ladies keep
their promises? Indeed I won my bet. So now, you owe me. . .

ROSALEEN: I remember.

HUNTSMAN: . . . a kiss. Will you be honourable and pay me, or not?

He slowly takes her face into his hands and kisses her. She suddenly pushes
him away; he stumbles to the floor.

ROSALEEN: Jesus, what big teeth you have!

HUNTSMAN: All the better to eat you with.

ROSALEEN seizes the rifle and fires at him. He clutches his shoulder and
