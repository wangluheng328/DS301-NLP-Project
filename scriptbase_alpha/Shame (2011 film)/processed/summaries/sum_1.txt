Thirty-something Brandon Sullivan is a New York yuppie.
He is also a sex addict who thinks about sex all the time when he's not having sex.
He surfs for porn on his work computer, masturbates often even in his office's men's room, and eyes strange women in whatever situation he's in in the hopes of having quick anonymous sex with them.
He hides his sex addiction from those few people in his life who he lets in in an emotional sense, unlike his married boss, David Fisher, who is open about his marital infidelities to his male work colleagues.
And the act of sex holds no emotional connotation whatsoever for Brandon.
The arrival back into his life and his apartment of his sister Sissy Sullivan, from who he was estranged due to the emotional baggage associated, changes Brandon's life, especially in what he can do in what used to be the privacy and sanctity of his apartment.
Sissy, unlike Brandon, sees sex and emotional attachment as one in the same.
Brandon's life begins to spiral out of control following Sissy's arrival.
He gains a better understanding, albeit an unpleasant one, of his life following an incident involving Sissy.
