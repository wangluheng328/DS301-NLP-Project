In New York, the empty thirty something year-old Brandon is a sex-addicted man that works in an office.
His longest relationship lasted only four months and Brandon does not have any friends.
Brandon has casual sex with women that he meets in bars; has sex also with hookers; visits porn websites and collects sex magazines.
However, he is unable to have sex with a potential girlfriend once they become close.
When his also dysfunctional younger sister Sissy unexpectedly moves to his apartment, she has one night stand with Brandon's boss and the world of Brandon turns upside-down.
