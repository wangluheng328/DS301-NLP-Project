In 1962 an eccentric scientist who, like so many people at the same, thought that a nuclear war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union was possible, built a bomb shelter in his basement.
During the Cuban missile crisis, when he thought things were going escalate took his pregnant wife into the bomb shelter.
When a plane flying over lost control, the pilot bailed out and the plane crashed into their house which activated the shelter's locks (designed not to open for 35 years).
She gives birth to a boy whom they name Adam.
So Adam grows up being taught and exposed to all culture up to 1962.
When the locks open, they're shocked to see how the world has changed they decide to stay inside.
However their supplies have run out, so Adam goes out to get some more but gets lost and is helped by a girl called Eve.
