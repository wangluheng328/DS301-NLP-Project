</b>      <title>BLAST FROM THE PAST - by Bill Kelly and Hugh Wilson</title>
<b>
</b>


<b>
</b><b>   </b><pre><b>
</b>

<b>       FADE IN:
</b>


<b>       SCENE 1 OMITTED
</b>
<b>       EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
       OPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the
       distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it.
       BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture.
       PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words "THE
       BLAST" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT
       EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words "FROM THE
       PAST" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily
       shakes.

<b>       INT. JET
</b>
       The PILOT feels the jet shake. But he looks at his
       indicators and everything appears to be normal. He
       relaxes.

<b>       EXT. JET
</b>
       We begin with a WIDER REAR SHOT of the jet and allow the
       plane to move away. Then SUPER: "LOS ANGELES, 1962"
       before continuing the main titles. A popular recording
       from that period has been playing throughout.

<b>       EXT. CALVIN'S WORK SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
       Start on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and
       THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We
       can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's
       Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where
       we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work
       bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The
       music becomes source.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got
                 guests!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling
                 with this darn rheostat.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Well, put it down and come in!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 You bet, hon!

       They exit the workshop for the house.  Calvin has left
       the ham radio on.




<b>                           NAVY PILOT (ON
</b><b>                           RADIO)
</b>                 Tower, Wolf One is five miles from the
                 overhead.

<b>                           TOWER (ON RADIO)
</b>                 Wolf One, Tower. Report the numbers.
                 You're number one for the overhead.

<b>                           NAVY PILOT (ON
</b><b>                           RADIO)
</b>                 Wolf one.


<b>       INT. COCKPIT OF JET - SAME TIME
</b>
       The YOUNG PILOT looks down at the flashing red light on
       his control panel. He speaks into the oxygen mask that
       hangs loosely from his helmet.

<b>                           PILOT
</b>                 Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem
                 here.

<b>                           TOWER (OC)
</b>                 Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you
                 declaring an emergency?

<b>                           PILOT
</b>                 Stand by. One.

<b>       INT. DINING ROOM
</b>
       DAVE, BETTY, BOB, and RUTH (30's) pass around the buffet
       table. Another period song is playing on the phonograph.

<b>                           BETTY
</b>                 Just remember: don't mention the
                 communists!

<b>                           DAVE
</b>                 Calvin's a great guy, but he's a
                 little, you know...

<b>                           BETTY
</b>                 Nutty.

<b>                           RUTH
</b>                 What's his wife like?

<b>                           BETTY
</b>                 Oh, you know, housewife.

<b>                           DAVE
</b>                 Likes to cook. Pregnant.

<b>                           RUTH
</b>                 Normal, then.

<b>                           BETTY
</b>                 Well, I wouldn't go that far.
                     (then)
                 Helen!

       Helen has entered from the kitchen with more food. She
       favors June Allison.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Hi, Betty!  Dave!

<b>                           BETTY
</b>                 Just look at you!

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Any day now!

<b>                           BETTY
</b>                 This is my sister and her husband.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Oh, hi! Welcome!

<b>       INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
       Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make
       Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a
       chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 So anyhow this duck says to the clerk,
                 "I'd like to buy this lip balm."  And
                 the clerk says, "Will that be cash or
                 a check?"  And the duck says, "Just
                 put it on my bill!"

       Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's
       sight-line rolls his eyes.

<b>       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB
</b>
       with drinks. Helen is in the b.g., rushing around, over-
       serving everyone.

<b>                           DAVE
</b>                 He was the golden-boy professor at Cal
                 Tech.  But then he starts inventing
                 things.

<b>                           BOB
</b>                 What kind of things?

<b>                           DAVE
</b>                 You got me.  Some kind of special
                 synthetic rubber.  And some kind of
                 automated machine.  Anyhow, suddenly
                 he gets rich.  I mean rich!  And quits
                 teaching.

<b>       ANGLE - CALVIN
</b>
       as his guests sample their Rob Roys.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 How's that?

<b>                           GUEST
</b>                 Just what the doctor ordered!

       Calvin gives the man his patented thumbs-up sign.

<b>       ANGLE - BETTY AND RUTH
</b>
       over by the patio doors. We can see Calvin's shop through
       the window.

<b>                           BETTY
</b>                 With all his money they could have
                 moved to Beverly Hills, but they
                 decided to stay in the Valley.  Calvin
                 spends all his time tinkering out
                 there in his workshop.  If you ask me
                 it's all very strange.

<b>                           WOMAN GUEST #1
</b>                     (chiming in)
                 He dug a huge hole out there for a
                 swimming pool. Then he decided he
                 didn't want it and filled the thing
                 in. And what's that big, high fence
                 for?

       The women look at Calvin.



<b>       ANGLE - CALVIN
</b>
       with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 There currently exists a type of neon
                 light that lasts five years.  But you
                 won't see it on the market. Same is
                 true of batteries. I could take your
                 simple yacht battery and rig it to
                 last a decade, easily.

<b>                           HAROLD
</b>                 Well, what the heck kind of a
                 marketing system can't get great new
                 products like that out to the public?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                     (intense)
                 A veeeery good one, Harold. Free
                 market capitalism may not be a perfect
                 order, but it's the best we've got, or
                 will ever have.  And why?  Three
                 reasons!

       Poor Harold.

<b>       INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME
</b>
       Most of the guests are women, gabbing and helping Helen
       out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily
       jumps around the kitchen.

<b>                           WOMAN GUEST #2
</b>                 Say, Helen?  What does Calvin think
                 about this trouble down in Cuba?

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                     (rolling her eyes)
                 Oh, please don't bring that up!

<b>       EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       A late guest named RON hurries up the walkway and into
       the house.





<b>       SCENE 8 OMITTED
</b>
<b>       INT. LIVING ROOM - A SECOND LATER
</b>
       Calvin is with another guest.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I'd say my baseball card collection is
                 as complete as any one I've ever seen.

       Ron pushes his way through the crowd.

<b>                           RON
</b>                 Calvin!  Hey, Calvin!
                 		(pointing over his shoulder)
                 Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with
                 Khrushchev on the television!

       Calvin immediately heads for the family room. Others
       follow.

<b>       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       Everyone is huddled around the JFK TV press conference.
       There seems to be a lot of smokers. Helen appears
       shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand.

<b>                           JFK
</b>                 ...this sudden, clandestine decision
                 to station strategic weapons for the
                 first time outside of Soviet soil, is
                 a deliberately provocative and
                 unjustified change in the status quo
                 which cannot be accepted by this
                 country.

       Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns
       it.

<b>       EXT. JET - NIGHT
</b>
       The plane swoops over the Valley and we see the
       spectacular lights of L.A. sprawl.  There is a TRAIL OF
       SPARKS coming from the jet's engine.

<b>       INT. JET COCKPIT
</b>
       The plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a
       very hard time controlling it.

<b>                           TOWER
</b>                 Wolf One -- say intentions.

<b>                           PILOT
</b>                 I've got secondaries of an engine fire
                 and I'll need to find a clear area to
                 eject.

<b>                           TOWER
</b>                 Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to
                 the ocean?

<b>       EXT. JET
</b>
       The trembling plane circles to the west.

<b>       INT. FAMILY ROOM
</b>
       Return to TV.

<b>                           JFK
</b>                 ...we will not prematurely or
                 unnecessarily risk the cost of
                 worldwide nuclear war, in which even
                 the fruits of victory would be ashes
                 in our mouth.  But neither will we
                 shrink from the risk at any time it
                 must be faced.

<b>       INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/ EXT. HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the
       guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and
       purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere
       in the middle we cut outside.


<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I'm sorry everyone, but given this
                 extraordinary turn of events, I think
                 it's prudent that we cut the evening
                 short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will
                 resolve itself, but in the
                 meantime...I'd suggest taking a
                 prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 We'll do this again! Maybe next week.
                 Here's your hat. Could I wrap
                 something up for you? Did you have a
                 coat?

       Helen can barely get a "good night" out before Calvin
       shuts the door.

<b>       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB
</b>
       Following their wives out.

<b>                 			DAVE
</b>                     (sotto to Bob)
                 What'd I tell ya?!

       Bob whistles softly. Calvin's a nut all right.

<b>       INT. FRONT DOOR
</b>
       Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 It's time.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                     (misinterpreting, holding her
                      stomach)
                 Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time
                 yet. I still have--

       He points down.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Oh, that time! You know Calvin, I'm
                 not sure I'm really ready for this.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 On the contrary, I think we're the
                 only ones who are.

       He leads her out of shot.

<b>                           HELEN (OC)
</b>                 Calvin I'm sure everything's going to
                 be all right. I just know it is!

<b>       EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and
       hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player
       has been left on:  "How Much Is That Doggie In The
       Window...?"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is
       wrapped in foil.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Well, I'm certainly not going to let
                 the pot roast go to waste. Could you
                 just put that seat cover back on that
                 lawn chair?

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Shouldn't we at least turn off the
                 phonograph?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 It shuts off automatically.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Did you rig it to do that? You're so
                 clever.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 No.  They all do.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 I never know anymore.

       The SOUND OF THE TRAINER JET makes a low pass over
       Calvin's house.  Calvin sticks his head out the door and
       looks up.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I bet that's a fighter jet on his way
                 to Key West!  Good luck, amigo!

<b>       INT. WORKSHOP
</b>
       They enter. The place is full of tools and gadgets--
       mostly construction equipment. The ham radio is still on.

<b>                           TOWER
</b>                 An emergency has been declared. I
                 repeat, an emergency has been
                 declared.

       Calvin and Helen speak over the Tower who is telling
       other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 You hear that?!

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Yes.

       Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 We can listen to the rest downstairs!

       He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the
       floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel.  Then
       he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light.
       Red submarine light shines up from below.  All the while
       he and Helen are chatting:

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Calvin, I wish you would have at least
                 let me do the dishes. It's not going
                 to be that easy getting all that dried-
                 on food off my nice plates.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I just hope those plates aren't
                 radioactive by tomorrow morning.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Cheese is particularly troublesome.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that
                 Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember
                 that?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast
                 and watch your step.  I'll come back
                 for the radio.

       She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder.


<b>       INT. JET - NIGHT
</b>
       The young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey
       cockpit.

<b>                           PILOT
</b>                 Tower, say again!!

<b>                           TOWER
</b>                 The SAR HELO is airborne with you in
                 sight.

<b>                           PILOT
</b>                 I'm marking the 180 radial for five
                 and ejecting.

<b>                           TOWER
</b>                 Roger, Wolf One.




       The pilot rights the plane; points the joy stick; and
       reaches for the ejection handles between his legs.

<b>       EXT. JET
</b>
       The pilot ejects.

<b>       INT. EMPTY COCKPIT
</b>
       This is the pilot's POV (were there a pilot.)  We see the
       coastline and we notice that the plane is making a... U-
       turn, away from the water and back towards the Valley.

<b>       EXT. JET
</b>
       Streaking back to the Valley with a dramatic tail of
       sparks.

<b>       EXT. THE PARACHUTING PILOT
</b>
       He notices that his plane is headed directly at him.  It
       misses him by a matter of yards.

<b>       INT. LADDER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Taking the liberty of a CUTAWAY SECTION, we follow them
       down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube.
       On either side of the tube we see layers of dirt.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 How long will we have to stay down
                 here?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I don't know. For this thing to blow
                 over, it could take days.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Days??

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Rather safe than sorry. That's my
                 motto!

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 But, what if I go into labor? That
                 could happen any time.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I've read up on it. I'll deliver the
                 baby myself if I have to.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Now you listen to me Calvin Webber,
                 when this baby comes, you're going to
                 be out in the waiting
                 room smoking yourself to death with
                 all the other fathers.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                     (chuckling)
                 Yes, dear!

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 As long as we've got that straight.

<b>       EXT. JET - SAME TIME
</b>
       It COMPLETES ITS TURN and STREAKS SKYWARD at a 90 degree
       angle to the ground... until it SPUTTERS and the ENGINES
       STOP.  Then, after a Road Runner-like beat or two, it
       begins to FALL DIRECTLY BACK TO EARTH, tail first.

<b>       INT. SMALL ANTEROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
       The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like
       chrome hatchway.  Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by
       pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the
       roast.

<b>       EXT. JET - NIGHT
</b>
       With only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as
       the lights of the Valley rush up to meet it.



<b>       INT. SHELTER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       They step into a darkened room.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                     (with arms spread)
                 Home sweet home!

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 To you maybe.

       Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF
       LIGHTS COMING ON.  The echoes of the sounds suggest a
       large, cavernous space.  All we can see is the cinder
       block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin
       begins to shut by putting his body into it.

       Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM
       ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs
       on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) The
<b>       LADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCK
</b>       BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles
       to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick
       of time.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 What was that?!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Are you all right?!

       Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be
       brave.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Yes, I think so.

       Calvin hurries to a bright RED METAL BOX on the wall.
       Next to the box is a LARGE THERMOMETER OR GAUGE that's
       labeled "Radiation Count."  There are OTHER GAUGES that
       are dropping to zero.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Oh, no!  It's happened!  Look at that
                 heat!!  All my surface indicators are
                 knocked out!  Oh, my Lord...it's
                 actually happened!!

<b>       INTER CUT - CU OF BOX AND THERMOMETER
</b>
       The box has a dial on it, next to which is a large lever.
       A foreboding sign reads  HATCHWAY TIME LOCKS, USE EXTREME
       CAUTION.  Calvin pulls the lever.

<b>       BACK TO SCENE
</b>
       The chrome and steel EXIT HATCHWAY AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS
       with great noise, precision and...finality. There is the
       SOUND OF A REAR DOOR doing the same thing.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 What's that noise?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 The locks.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 The locks?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 To keep us from trying to leave. After
                 an atomic blast there's a radiation
                 half-life that lasts thirty five
                 years.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Thirty -five years!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Then after that it's safe.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 It's safe.

       She continues to stare at him.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 To go up.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 To go up.

       She continues to stare at him.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                     (confidently)
                 Hey, honey. Don't you worry. We're
                 going to be just fine.

       Helen bursts into tears.

<b>       EXT WEBBER PATIO - DAY
</b>
       Two police detectives, LEVY and ATKINSON, exit the house.
       Uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet
       from the crash site. The detectives lead us to what's
       left of Calvin's shop. It's mostly a charred crater.

<b>                           LEVY
</b>                 According to Caltech, this Webber guy
                 was a bonafide genius and a borderline
                 nutcase.

<b>                           ATKINSON
</b>                 Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have
                 been out here when the plane hit.

<b>                           LEVY
</b>                 Unless we get a postcard or somethin',
                 that's my guess.

<b>                           ATKINSON
</b>                 What about relatives?

<b>                           LEVY
</b>                 All back East.

<b>                           ATKINSON
</b>                 The neighbors over there said the guy
                 spent day and night out here. She'd
                 bring him sandwiches and hot Dr.
                 Pepper.

<b>       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME (12 HOURS AFTER BLAST)

       Helen awakes alone and still dressed. She sits up and
       trys the phone on the night table. It is dead. She hangs
       up and exits.

</b>
       Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast. Two empty
       Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin
       is heating the soda. He sees Helen enter the livingroom.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Hi, honey! Feeling better?

<b>                           HELEN

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 We have to be strong, sweetheart. If
                 not for ourselves, for the child.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 All our friends...

       He enters with her sandwich and a cup of Dr. Pepper.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Burnt to a crisp.
                     (indicating sandwiches)
                 I've given you the most well-done cut.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 I'm not hungry.

<b>                           CALVIN

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Really?

       She walks out onto the patio. She rubs her arms as if
       cold.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 A bit chilly? Shouldn't be.
                 Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.



       He follows her out to the patio.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Maybe I've just got the creeps.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 How could you?! This is just like
                 home!

       A reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the
       fallout shelter -- which looks very different from
       "home". Perhaps she starts to cry again.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 No. No! Calvin, this is different!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Would you like a tranquilizer?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I told you! I've got everything!











        Helen groans in pain.

<b>                           HELEN

       Helen's pain, followed by Adam's cry, followed by
       Calvin's rejoicing.

</b>
       Calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights.
       Then he checks out all the tiny fish swimming in the six
       feet by six feet tank.  When he hears a baby's cry he
       hurries away.(Music continues)

       Calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his
       family:  Helen and a NEWBORN SON cradled next to her in

<b>                           CALVIN

       Calvin shrugs.

                 Well, I was thinking...in light of the

                 Adam.  That's not sacrilegious is it?

<b>                           CALVIN

                 Well, it's pretty clear that the front
                 entrance caved in when the bomb went
                 off. So, you know, when the time is
                 up, we'll have to return to the
                 surface using, you know, this back
                 entrance.  Which is very nice because

<b>                           HELEN

<b>                           CALVIN

       She sets Adam (one year old) down on his wobbly little

                 It's not life worth living perhaps,
                 but believe me, something's moving

                 Nothing in the world is more fun than
                 learning new things.

<b>       INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
       The family watches the same "Honeymooner" clip they
       watched before. Calvin still finds it funny. Helen
       wonders about that.

<b>       INT. BEDROOM - LATER

       Helen is pouring cooking sherry into an empty Listerine
       bottle.

       Other buildings have been constructed around the malt
       shop. Foot and car traffic are heavier.

<b>       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME TIME
</b>
       The clean-cut kids have been replaced by FLOWER CHILDREN.
       Mom hasn't put a lot back into the decor, but she has
       made concessions to the fashions of the time. The jukebox
       plays something appropriate. Mom and the Jerk are five
       years older.

<b>                           MOM

       Calvin (40) is giving Adam (8) a boxing lesson. They work
       from a "How To" book and use gloves made from living room
       pillows. Adam's pretty good. Helen appears and watches
       with pride. Then she interupts.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Boys! Excuse me, but I believe it's my

                     (holding out her hand)
                 Adam?

       He goes to her.

<b>       INT. SHELTER - MINUTES LATER
</b>
       The hydroponic garden area is empty. A Perry Como song
       begins and Adam and Helen enter waltzing. Adam has
       changed shirts and combed his hair. Somewhere, Calvin is
       watching with pride. After a while Calvin cuts in. He and
       Helen dance beautifully. Then they kiss. Somewhere, Adam
       is watching with pride.

       The acid rock song ends and an early, bad disco hit comes
       on the jukebox.

<b>                           MOM
</b>                 What the hell kind of music is that?!

       The Jerk puts his hands to his ears, he so hates the new
       music.

                 in paper.  Or you can have an
                 "investment."  These are stock
                 "certificates" that we bought in your

       They pass Helen who is absentmindedly poking at the puck
       with a stick. She's not having a very good day. She wears
       her hair dryer but it's not plugged in.

       Start close on flashing roller skates. Then cut wider to
       show Adam roller skating. He passes Helen who has fallen
       asleep knitting in one of the lawn chairs. Then Adam
       passes Calvin who is on a ladder soldering a leaking

       Helen has prepared a birthday cake. Having no birthday
       candles, she's used three votive candles. We can hear
       Calvin and Adam talking in the dining room. (She and
       Calvin are now in their 60's.)

<b>                           CALVIN (OC)

<b>                           CALVIN (OC)
</b>                 Because he's forced out at third! It's

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 You bet.

       Calvin leaves while Helen lights the candles. The whole
       shelter goes dark. Calvin returns with two presents
       wrapped in whatever is available.

<b>       INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday. We see the
       ADULT ADAM for the first time in silhouette. His handsome
       face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before
       him.

<b>                           ADAM

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Make a wish!

       He does both. His parents clap. Helen takes one of the
       presents from Calvin and gives it to Adam. He unwraps it.
       It's a green coat.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Oh, boy! A jacket!

<b>                           CALVIN

<b>                           HELEN

                     (aside, to Calvin)
                 Who else would have done it?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 And I made these!

       He gives Adam the second present. Adam tears off the
       paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has
       redesigned. The new skates look kind of like
       rollerblades.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Your roller-skates! I redesigned them!
                 I think this new design will work even
                 better!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 These are really swell! I mean swell!

<b>                           HELEN

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 If he tells, it won't come true!

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I wished I could meet a girl.

       His parents don't have a reply for that.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Oh. A nice one, I hope.

<b>                           ADAM

       The room is quiet and empty.  The star-burst WALL CLOCK
       on the paneling says 6:15.

<b>       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - SAME TIME
</b>
       Also empty.

<b>       INT. STOREROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
       Also empty.  And with MEAGER SUPPLIES on the shelves.

<b>       INT. POWER AND PUMP ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
       The old pipes are rusted and patched. Some are leaking
       badly.

<b>       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
       Calvin wakes up. He looks over at Helen's bed.

<b>       ANGLE - HELEN
</b>
       She wakes up. Then jumps out of bed.



<b>       SCENE 67 OMITTED
</b>


<b>       CLOSE ON THE RED METAL BOX
</b>
       that has been ticking on the wall for thirty-five years.
       Suddenly it STOPS TICKING and a rather annoying ALARM
       GOES OFF.  Calvin's hand reaches up and turns it off by
       throwing the lever up.

       ANOTHER ANGLE shows us the mechanism on the FRONT
       HATCHWAY switch to OPEN with a loud, vault-like move.

<b>       ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
       reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of
       the front hatchway and red box.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 So...we just open this door and go up?



       Calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength, opens
       the front entrance hatch. And then must jump back when
       nothing but earth and rock pour into the room.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Um...is that supposed to happen?

       His parents take a beat then race off like maniacs
       through the entire shelter to the back hatch door.  They
       knock over whatever gets in their way as they go. Adam
       follows.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Hey, where are we going?!  Is
                 everything all right?!

<b>       INT. BACK HATCHWAY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       Calvin and Helen arrive followed by Adam who can't
       possibly share his parent's deep concerns. Everyone is
       out of breath.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Should we say a little prayer first?

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Just open the door.

       Calvin attempts to open the big hatch, but can't.  Adam
       helps him.  Helen pitches in.  Slowly, with lots of
       squeaking, the DOOR OPENS. He steps through the hatch and
       flips a wall switch.  Red submarine LIGHTS COME ON....
       And the service elevator is intact.

<b>       INT. ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Helen steps through and embraces Calvin joyfully.  The
       old folks break into a dance as Adam enters.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Well, do we just go on up?!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                     (quickly back to business,
                      and way too dramatic)
                 No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is
                 precisely when... we must be at our...
                 most cautious.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                     (barely a whisper, but
                      definitely tired of his
<b>                      B.S.)
</b>                 Oh, shit.

       Helen's eyes widen and her hand flies up to her mouth.
       She is just as shocked as Calvin.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have
                 been down here a little too long!
                     (to Adam)
                 Please excuse her French.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Shit is a French word?

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Yes, yes it is!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly
                 meaning..."good".

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Yes! That's right!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Oh.
                     (then)
                 Well...then...shit!

       There is a pause, then:

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 C'est bon, Monsieur.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Merci!

<b>       SCENE 71 OMITTED
</b>


<b>       EXT. THE MALT SHOP - NIGHT
</b>
       Cars flash by in a rare L.A. DOWNPOUR.  All that's left
       of Mom's is an EMPTY BUILDING with a painted-out front
       window and a "For Sale or Rent" sign.  There's ANOTHER
       SHOP attached to it CAMERA RIGHT but we can't see what it
       is.  The alley way on the left has always been there.

<b>       INT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       TWO DRUNK BUMS are sharing a bottle. One of them is the
       Soda Jerk, now a  dissipated middle-aged man (with a
       tattoo on his forehead.)

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 ...all of these things...Alcoholics
                 Anonymous...Cocaine Anonymous...Heroin
                 Anonymous.

<b>                           OTHER BUM
</b>                 There's a Heroin Anonymous?

<b>                            SODA JERK
</b>                 Shut up! All of these things... ask
                 you to believe in a power greater than
                 yourself! Some sort of God on High!
                 Well...I have lifted my eyes skyward a
                 time or two... and I have certainly
                 not seen anything coming from up there
                 except a goddamn airplane -- that I
                 can't afford to get on!

       The cement FLOOR of the old Malt Shop begins to QUIVER
<b>       AND RUMBLE.
</b>
<b>                           OTHER BUM
</b>                 Earthquake!  Another earthquake!

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Let her come!  Let's get this over
                 with!  And please, if there is a God,
                 let it be worse in Bel Air!!

       The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back
       window.  Soda Jerk is fearless.  Until finally the
       HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with
       an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO
       FLYING.  Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by
       Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter
       ticking.

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Oh, God!  Oh, God!!  Oh,God, save me!!
                 For I have seen the light!!

       Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I come in peace!!

       The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea
       diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to
       the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his
       flashlight.  He is horrified by what he sees.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 My, gosh...

       Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back.  He
       moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)
       reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic
       container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH
       BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and
       breathes the air.  It stinks in there.

<b>       EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAINING
</b>
       Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly
       pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to
       find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the
       avocado trees should be.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Where is my backyard?

       He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY
       to his left.

<b>       EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAINING
</b>
       DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a
       fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present
       condition.  In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-
       plated word "Toyota."   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search
       through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the
       avenue.

<b>       SCENE 76 OMITTED
</b>
<b>       EXT. MALT SHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER, RAIN
</b>
       Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt
       Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai
       restaurant.)

<b>       CLOSER ON HIM
</b>
       watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue.  Suddenly, a
       cross-dressing STREET WALKER steps up to him with a
       cigarette.

<b>                           STREET WALKER
</b>                 You got a light, honey?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a
                 light!

<b>                           STREET WALKER
</b>                 Good.

       Fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with
       one of his kitchen matches.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 So...you...survived the blast, did
                 you?

<b>                           STREET WALKER
</b>                 The blast?  Honey, I have survived a
                 host of things. Like the song says: "A
                 country boy can survive!"

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has
                 it been...hell up here?

<b>                           STREET WALKER
</b>                 "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell
                 up here, down there and over yonder!
                 Hell everywhere.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Yes, I can tell that just looking
                 around.
                 		(then)
                 "Boy?"  Did you say you were a
                 "country boy?"

<b>                           STREET WALKER
</b>                 Cute Little Old Man, if you want a
                 boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want
                 a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be
                 anything you want me to be!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Really?

<b>                           STREET WALKER
</b>                 Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the
                 remarkably low price of only $200!
                 And if you act now, I might even throw
                 in some free lawn furniture.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                     (stumbling away from her)
                 No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to
                 go!  I have to...

       He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy
       BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a
       hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to
       stay out.  Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the
       curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY
       full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom
       BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at
       Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the
       ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger
       and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol
       is really a water gun.

<b>       INT. ADULT BOOK AND VIDEO STORE
</b>
       Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the
       PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Hello!  How are you this evening?!
                 Mind if I, you know, browse around?!

       The clerk just watches him.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Thank-Q very much!

       Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the
       material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS
       back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.

<b>       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER
</b>
       Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard
       and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great
       concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in
       the corner.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I'm going to give it to you straight.
                 There's no point in beating around the
                 bush. There were survivors.
                 Apparently,
                 the fallout has created....a
                 subspecies of mutants.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Mutants?!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out
                 of garbage cans.  Others are...cover
                 your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that
                 literally and I mean right now!

       ADAM covers his ears and hums.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Others are...multi-sexual.  It
                 seems...they can be both masculine and
                 feminine...simultaneously.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 No.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 I don't believe it!

       Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things
       that don't need to be done.


<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Believe it. He tried to sell me his
                 body, Helen.
                 		(beat)
                 They offer lawn furniture as a come
                 on!

       She slumps, then resumes her needless activity.  Calvin
       takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops
       humming.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 They've done a lot of re-building but
                 society, at least as we knew it, has
                 utterly collapsed. People throw up in
                 the streets. Others point guns.
                 There's something terribly wrong with
                 the automobiles and...and I...I can't
                 tell you the rest.  I just can't.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So,

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 We stay down here.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 We do?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Excuse me.

       She hurries into the living room.

<b>       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen let's out a silent scream, then hurries back into
       the kitchen.

<b>       INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 For how long?  We've just about run
                 out of everything!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion
                 that these mutants will eventually
                 kill each other off and then--

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                     (rising)
                 No, Calvin.  We're not going to make
                 do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going
                 up no matter what!  We deserve it.

<b>                           CALVIN

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 --do as I say!

       Breathing heavily, Calvin suddenly clutches at his chest
       in great pain and collapses.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Dad!

       Adam paces.  Then Helen comes out.  Behind her, we can
       see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living
       room. He follows.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 He seems to be doing all right now.  I
                 don't know if he's had a heart attack
                 or just... a horrifying experience.
                 But we  need supplies and I've got to
                 stay with him.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'll go up.

       They go through the living room and cross to the patio.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 I'm afraid you've got to.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'll be all right.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                     (patting his cheek)
                 You're my brave boy.



       Helen hands him a pencil and pad. Adam follows her to the
       fish farm.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Just act normal.  If anybody asks,
                 simply say you're from out-of-town,
                 and that you're in town on business.
                 Write that down.

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 I'm going to give you a shopping list
                 and some money.  We need just enough
                 things to get us through the next year
                 or two.  And you'll find most of these
                 items at what used to be called a
                 grocery store or a hardware store.
                 Write that down.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, ma'am.

       At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is
       attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly
       opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred
       dollar bills. Helen takes half of it.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 I don't know how far you'll have to
                 travel to find supplies, but if you
                 can't get home by nightfall, I want
                 you to look for something called a
                 Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a
                 hotel. There might still be one
                 standing.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, ma'am.


<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Let's get you packed.

       She heads back for the house. He follows.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Right.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                     (indicating money)
                 I just hope this is still good up
                 there.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Mom?


<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Yes?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I was thinking that, uh...you know,
                 while I was up there and all...that
                 maybe I could, you know...try to meet
                 a girl.  I've, been thinking about
                 that a little...just these
                 last...fifteen years or so.

       They have stopped by the garden.


<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if
                 you could find a girl. One who's not a
                 mutant...and hopefully comes from
                 Pasadena. Nothing against Valley
                 girls,
                 but in my day anyhow, the girls from
                 Pasadena, I don't know...always just
                 seemed a little nicer.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, ma'am.

       They hug.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Oh, there's also a thing called a
                 liquor store. Write that down.

<b>       INT. ADAM'S ROOM - AN HOUR LATER
</b>
       He is packing. He looks at his cigar box and opens it. He
       studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and
       an old photo of his parents. He decides to pack the box.
       Helen enters with a long shopping list.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Here's the shopping list and $3,000
                 which should take care of everything.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, ma'am.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Your father has a few final words for
                 you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw
                 for you - he loves you so much. We
                 both do.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Heck, I know that mom! You're my
                 parents.

<b>       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed.
       He sits. At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her
       apron.  Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to
       Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, father?! Yes?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 ...the pipe tobacco.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, sir.  Is that all?

       Calvin nods. Adam rises and starts for the door. But
       Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak
       weakly into his son's ear.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Also...stay out of the "Adult
                 Bookstore."

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Adult Bookstore.  Why?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I promise. Is that all?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 One more thing. If you find a healthy
                 young woman, bring her back with you.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'll try.

       And then Calvin closes his eyes and sleeps.

<b>       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME DAY
</b>
       The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious
       shrine.  He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry
       and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and
       around the broken cement.  Currently he's on his knees,
       rocking back and forth as he prays.

       And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very
       bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth
       followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and
       delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance
       caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his
       face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the
       man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Are you all right?

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes!
                 But  where is the one who came last
                 night -- all in yellow?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my
                 father!

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father!
                 Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for
                 my wasted life?!  Everything has been
                 so awful!!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (comforting him)
                 I know it has been terrible.  But it
                 wasn't your fault. And now all the
                 decay is over with and things are
                 going to get better. You understand?

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I've got to go, now.

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Of course you do.  I'll stay here and
                 pray.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (picking up his suitcase)
                 That's always a good idea! Would you
                 like some money? I have a great deal
                 of it.

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 No. I don't need money anymore -- I
                 see that now.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 How do I leave here?

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 The front door is open.  Will you be
                 back?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I promise.

       Adam turns and leaves. The Soda Jerk falls to his knees
       and shakes all over.

<b>       EXT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on
       him much brighter than anything he has ever seen.  He
       looks at it on the arm of his coat and then, slowly, he
       looks up at the sky.

<b>       INTERCUT - LOVELY CLOUDS AND BLUE SKY
</b>
       And now it is Adam who is dumbstruck. BYSTANDER #1
       appears and sees Adam looking up.

<b>                           BYSTANDER #1
</b>                 What?  What is it?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 The sky!!!

<b>                           BYSTANDER #1
</b>                 The sky?  Where?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (pointing)
                 Up there!!

<b>                           BYSTANDER #1
</b>                 I don't see anything!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Just look!!

       Adam becomes momentarily interested in a parking meter.

       A MOTHER and her CHILD approach from the other direction.

<b>                           WOMAN
</b>                 What is it!

<b>                           BYSTANDER #1
</b>                     (pointing)
                 He sees something.

<b>                           MOTHER
</b>                 What?

<b>                           CHILD
</b>                 I see it, mommy!

<b>                           BYSTANDER #2
</b>                 Where?!


       Several more people are drawn over. A CONVERTIBLE goes by
       in the foreground with passengers who are looking up.

<b>                           WOMAN
</b>                 What is it?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I have never in my life seen anything
                 like this!!!! Nothing even comes
                 close!!

       Adam continues down the sidewalk,looking up. A BLACK
       WOMAN POSTAL WORKER passes by.

<b>                           POSTAL WORKER
</b>                 Whatcha looking at?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!

<b>                           POSTAL WORKER

                 Say what?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (offering his hand)
                 How do you do, ma'am.

<b>                           POSTAL WORKER
</b>                     (leary, but taking his hand)
                 I do alright.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Good!

       The Pakistani exits the Adult Bookstore.


<b>                           PAKISTANI
</b>                 What is it?!  What do you see?!

       When Adam looks down to answer the man he sees the "Adult
       Bookstore" sign.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Oh, no!

<b>                           PAKISTANI

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Poisonous gas!!  Run for your life,
                 it's invisible poisonous gas!!!

       And everyone does run away, including Adam. The avenue is
       left totally deserted.



<b>       INT. KITCHEN NOOK - SAME DAY
</b>
       Helen sits sipping tea, deep in thoughts of concern for
       Adam. Behind her Calvin appears in the open window.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 You know--

       Helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the
       place.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 I just wanted to say that I think he's
                 going to be just fine.

<b>                           HELEN

                 Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very
                 much.

       Calvin leaves, then comes back.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 He's smart.

<b>       SCENE 85A OMITTED

<b>       EXT. CORNER BUS STOP - AFTERNOON, SAME DAY
</b>
       An L.A. bus comes directly at CAMERA.



<b>       ANGLE - THE DRIVER
</b>
       is startled. He reacts.

<b>       ANGLE - DRIVER'S FOOT
</b>
       slamming down the brake pedal.

<b>       ANGLE - ADAM
</b>
       in profile. The braking bus stops an inch from his nose.
       Adam smiles. (Have him head for bus door in this angle.)

<b>       ANGLE - THE DRIVER
</b>
       from over Adam. He is in shock.



<b>       INT. BUS - A MOMENT LATER
</b>
       Start on a MOVING STEADY CAM SHOT on Adam's POV of bus
       passengers as he heads for a seat. The passengers look at
       him in amazement and some fear.

<b>       ANGLE - ADAM
</b>
       going to his seat; smiling at the passengers. (He is
       carrying a $100 bill.)

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Hello! Hi. Good afternoon! Howdy.

       Adam finds a seat next to a heavily perspiring young
<b>       PSYCHO HEROIN ADDICT.
</b>
<b>       ANOTHER ANGLE OF THEM
</b>
       Adam shows the Psycho the $100 bill.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I tried to give the driver this but he
                 wouldn't take it. He seems angry. A
                 lot of people do.

       The bus pulls out. It gets up to about twenty miles an
       hour.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Oh, boy! Here we go! We're moving!

                 So this is public transportation. My
                 Dad says that it becomes more and more
                 important because of pollution --
                 which is more and more carbon dioxide
                 and other hazardous gases in the air.
                     (then, confidentially)
                 Do you have a gun, by the way?

       The increasingly nervous Psycho looks around, then nods
       that he does.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Well, thanks for not waving it around.
                 And for not vomitting, for that
                 matter. Wow, we're really flying. Say,
                 do you know where I could find a
                 grocery store?

       The psycho shakes his head.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I have to find that. And a hardware
                 store  and a liquour store and a
                 standing Holiday Inn. Although, I may
                 not need the Holiday Inn. That's still
                 kind of up in the air. It depends
                 really on how things go.

                 There's a grocery store coming up.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Thank-Q!
                     (jumping up)
                 Driver! Please stop the bus
                 immediately! I have to get off!
                     (then an aside to the psycho)
                 Do you think I should get a gun?

                 Driver! Please stop, sir!

<b>       INTERCUT - DRIVER IN THE REAR VIEW
</b>
       He's not going to stop until he wants to stop.

<b>       ANGLE - OLD JEWISH COUPLE PASSENGERS.
</b>
       who are anxious for Adam to leave.

<b>                           OLD JEWISH MAN
</b>                 For the love of God! Let him off the
                 bus!! Can't you see he's meshugina!

       Adam leans in close to the OLD MAN.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'm sorry, what did you call me?

       The man and his wife take that the wrong way and start to
       scream.

<b>       ANGLE - THE DRIVER'S FOOT
</b>
       hitting the brakes.

<b>       EXT.- BUS
</b>
       stopping suddenly. Through the windows we see Adam go
       down.

<b>       INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       The back door opens as Adam gets up.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!

       Adam exits the bus. Everyone, including the Psycho,
       heaves a huge sign of relief.

<b>       INT. SUPER MARKET - MINUTES LATER
</b>
       Adam enters and (after getting over the automatic doors
       and the check-out technology) is overwhelmed by the
       magnificence of the postmodern California supermarket.
       The check-out counters alone are amazing. Seeing others
       do it, he takes a cart, placing his suitcase in it.

<b>       INT. BAKERY COUNTER
</b>
       Adam passes the baked goods, paying particular attention
       to the elaborate birthday cakes.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Is that a birthday cake?!

<b>                           CLERK
</b>                 Yes, it is.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Gee-ma-nee!

       Adam leaves. The clerk turns to a fellow worker.

<b>                           CLERK
</b>                 Bakersfield.

<b>       INT. AISLE
</b>
       Adam marvels at the abundance and variety. He passes a
       mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds
       him of his own mom -- when she used to let him ride that
       way.  Then he is surprised to see a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE so
       casually dressed in public. She (overweight) is in an
       unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination.  He
       (hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing
       trunks.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (to himself)
                 My first mutants.

<b>       INT. FRESH PRODUCE
</b>
       Adam picks up one of those huge California cucumbers that
       always amaze Easterners.  He shows it to the JAPANESE-
<b>       AMERICAN CLERK.
</b>
<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Is this because of the radiation?

<b>                           CLERK
</b>                 What?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Nothing.

<b>       INT. MEAT COUNTER
</b>
       Adam is looking at the live lobsters as a BUTCHER steps
       up.

<b>                           BUTCHER
</b>                 Help you?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, please.
                     (consulting his Mom's list)
                 I'm looking for all beef patties.



<b>                           BUTCHER
</b>                 Fresh or frozen?

       Adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Come on. Frozen. How much are they?

<b>                           BUTCHER
</b>                 Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in
                 the three pound box.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Then I'll need, twelve into nine
                 hundred, seventy-five boxes. And
                 that's almost...five hundred dollars
                 just for the hamburger! And my Mom
                 only gave me three thousand dollars
                 for everything! The yacht batteries!
                 The diesel oil! The birthday candles!

<b>                           BUTCHER
</b>                 You could have a meat order that big
                 delivered to your home.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>
                 Really?!

<b>                           BUTCHER
</b>                 Sure.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Well, that's great then!
                 Terrific...except...it just occurred
                 to me. I don't know where I live! I'm
                 lost! I don't know where home is!
                     (then)
                 Would you excuse me?

<b>                           BUTCHER
</b>                 Gladly.

       Adam hurries away.



<b>       SCENE 93 OMITTED

<b>       SCENE 94 OMITTED
</b>


<b>       A MONTAGE
</b>
       of Adam on another bus. He looks frantically out the
       window. We see his POV of shops and stores and people. At
       one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders
       about. Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually
       late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more
       depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps
       up and tells the driver:

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Driver! Stop this bus immediately!
                 Please sir!!

<b>       EXT. - VENTURA BLVD - NIGHT
</b>
       The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the
       street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the
       other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his
       attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one
       we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but
       when he looks next door he sees he's in a different
       place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk
       until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to
       see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost
       NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some
       time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself
       he turns and begins to walk south.

<b>       ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
       of him as he passes a BODY PIERCING STORE and wonders
       about that. Then he sees something that blows his mind.

<b>       WIDER ANGLE
</b>
       of a STRAY DOG passing by. Adam reacts.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh,
                 my...Oh. That is so great!! Man alive!

<b>       ANGLE - CU OF BASEBALL CARDS STORE WINDOW

       A sign says: COMIC BOOKS &amp; BASEBALL CARDS BOUGHT, SOLD &amp;
<b>       TRADED.
</b>
<b>       INT. CARD AND COMIC STORE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar
       box in the other.  He steps up to the counter where the
       owner (JERRY) sits reading the newspaper. He has a
       fondness for Navajo jewelry.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Hello.

<b>                           JERRY
</b>                     (gives him a look, then goes
                      back to reading)
                 Hi.

       A YOUNG WOMAN enters from the back of the store and goes
       to another counter.  Neither man notices.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 The name is Adam Webber and I see you
                 buy baseball cards and although these
                 are a lot older than the ones in the
                 window, I was hoping you still might
                 be interested.

       He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches
       beyond his wildest dreams.  Jerry actually moans and then
       must pretend the moan was a cough.

<b>                           JERRY
</b>                 How--how much do you want for the
                 Mickey Mantle, rookie season?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I was thinking of selling all the
                 cards.

<b>                           JERRY
</b>                 Really? No kidding?

       He reaches in and looks through the cards.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 See, my problem is, all I have are
                 hundred dollar bills and I need
                 something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens.
                 Like that.

<b>                           JERRY
</b>                 I see what ya mean. Tell you
                 what...I'll give you five hundred
                 dollars in small bills for the whole
                 box.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Oh, that would be wonderful!

<b>                           JERRY
</b>                 Well, we're here to help!

       A woman steps into the shot. She has come from the back
       of the store and her back is momentarily to us.

<b>                           EVE (OC)
</b>                 Oh, shit!

       Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We
       reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her
       purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.


<b>                           JERRY
</b>                 I'm workin' here, Evey-poo.  Don't
                 screw me up.


<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Bon soir, mademoiselle!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Are you French?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No.
                     (then, thinking fast)
                 I'm from out of town.
                     (then sensing the need for
                      further clarification)
                 I'm here on business.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, your business must not be sports
                 memorabilia, because this one Mantle
                 card right here--
                     (holds up a card)
                 --is worth six thousand dollars all by
                 its little self.


<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Get out of here!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 No, you get out of here.

       She closes his cigar box and gives it to him.




<b>                           JERRY
</b>                 Terrific...you're fired! You know
                 that?!



<b>                           EVE
</b>                 No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry, I quit.

       She walks back to the counter to get her coat.

<b>                           JERRY
</b>                 Oh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair
                 salon guy and the Chevy dealer!  You
                 know why you can't keep a goddamn
                 job?!  Because you can't keep your
                 goddamn mouth shut!  That's why!

       Jerry is surprised when Adam suddenly takes his arm
       firmly.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Sir? I would really appreciate it if
                 you wouldn't take the Lord's name in
                 vain again.

<b>                           JERRY
</b>                     (looking at Adam's hand)
                 Oh, you got a problem with that?


<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I have a big problem with that.

       Eve sees a fist fight coming. She takes Adam by the arm.



<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to
                 the corner.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.



<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Just come on.

       They head for the door and exit.

<b>                           JERRY
</b>                 Hah!  Adam and Eve!  The perfect
                 match!  I hope you two will be very
                 happy together!  Mazel-fuckin'-tov!
                 Don't try coming back, Ms. Big Shot!
                 I'm serious this time! You're finished
                 in the hobby business! Take that to
                 the bank, why don'tcha!

       Adam re-enters.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I didn't want to leave without saying
                 how much I admire your jewelry.

<b>                           JERRY
</b>                 Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your
                 butt?

       Adam walks towards the man smiling.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 How 'bout you what?

       Jerry takes a nervous step backwards, but Eve steps back
       in and pulls Adam out.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I said come on!



       Adam exits. Jerry doesn't know what to say.

<b>       EXT. CARD STORE - NIGHT
</b>
       They exit the store.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Where are we going?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 We? I'm going home. And, judging by
                 that coat, I'd say you have to get
                 back to the barber college.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No, I'm lost.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You're lost?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Say,...did you just lose your job
                 because of me?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Forget it.  I'm sick of working for
                 that dickhead.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Dickhead?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 A walking penis capable of intelligent
                 speech.  A dickhead.

       A mental picture of that causes Adam to slump against a
       store window and drop his box of cards.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 What's wrong with you?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I just had a mental picture of...

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Here, pick these up!

       Together they pick up the cards.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Where are you parked?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I came on a bus.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Why doesn't that surprise me?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I don't know. Why doesn't it?

       They rise.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, I guess because I'm a little
                 psychic...I have this thing.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Oh, that's nice.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Let me guess something. This is your
                 first visit to La La Land. You're
                 staying somewhere over in Hollywood
                 because, like an idiot, you thought
                 that would be an exciting place to
                 stay.  Right so far?



<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (could be a question, could
                      be an answer.)
                 So far?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Yes, I'm right?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Right.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus
                 and before you know it, you're out
                 here in the San Fernando Valley
                 without a clue.  Which brings us to
                 here.  Correct again?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Again.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Where are you staying? The Holiday
                 Inn?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's
                 exactly right!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but
                 pretty much. That was pretty good,
                 wasn't it?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It was amazing.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a
                 bus for you to get on.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Do you own a car?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I'm not taking you there, Sweetie.
                 Rule Number One in North America: No
                 strangers in the car.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 If it will make you feel any better, I
                 don't have a gun.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You don't?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Nope.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, that changes everything. Get the
                 fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!

       She races around the corner.  He goes after her.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'm sorry!  I said something wrong,
                 didn't I!  Please forgive me!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Get away from me!!

       She runs into a parking lot.  He follows.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal
                 with you!  I'll give you a Rogers
                 Hornsby, if you'll take me to the
                 hotel!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Rogers Hornsby?!?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 He's all yours. I was holding him
                 back.

       Adam takes a Hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows
       it to her.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Rogers Hornsby's worth like four
                 thousand dollars!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 So what?!  I've got two of him!
                 		(removing more cards from his
                 		 pocket)
                 And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons.
                 I was holding these out, too.

       She arrives at her car (dirty GEO) and anxiously unlocks
       the driver's door.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 So for four thousand dollars, all I
                 have to do is drive you to your hotel?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 And that's it?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I don't have to take a physical in
                 your space ship?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Heck, no!  What?!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal.
                 Get in.

       She gets in. He gets in the back seat behind her.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 The front seat!

       He runs around to the front while Eve chats with herself.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Why am I doing this? What in the hell
                 is wrong with me? That's what I'd like
                 to know.



<b>       SCENE 99 OMITTED
</b>


<b>       EXT. HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER
</b>
       Traffic is moving at fifteen miles an hour. The dash
       lights fascinate him but the car scares him.  She notices
       that he is gripping the seat belt for dear life.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 So...Mister Andretti, your first time
                 on the freeway?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It's Webber.  Adam Webber.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Mind if I change the station?
                 Better traffic reports on AM.

       She switches over to AM and runs by a Perry Como record,
       "Round and Round", looking for traffic.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Wait!  Wait!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 What is it?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It's Perry!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Perry?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back!
                 Go back!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Okay, okay!  Take it easy!

       She gets Perry.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 How's that?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (star-struck)
                 Oh, I could die...

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Over this?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yeah! Listen to this part. This is
                 where it really takes off!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You are one scary son-of-a-gun.




<b>       EXT. FREEWAY
</b>
       Eve's car splits for the exit ramp.

<b>       INT. EVE'S CAR
</b>
       The sudden speed scares Adam.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Hey, what are you doing?!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I know a short-cut.

<b>       EXT. OFF RAMP
</b>
       She comes off, catches the light and whips onto the
       surface street, tires squealing.

<b>       INT. CAR
</b>
       Adam is hanging onto his seat belt. Eve puts the pedal to
       the metal.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I can't help it. Perry Como always
                 does this to me! I just get so
                 cranked!

       She turns Perry way up.

<b>       EXT. AVENUE
</b>
       Eve does a dandy job of trading lanes and passing.  The
       little Geo's engine screams. Adam's sort of getting into
       it.

<b>       EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - TEN MINUTES LATER
</b>
       The Geo flies up to a quick stop.

<b>       INT. CAR
</b>
       Eve turns to Adam, who has had A Life Experience.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Card, please.  End of service.

       He hands over the card like someone in a post-sex stupor.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 That was...wonderful!  I've never felt
                 anything like that in my life.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Yeah, same here. Don't forget your
                 suitcase.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Right.

       He gets out with the suitcase, and after shutting the
       door leans down to speak to her.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 You know--

       She tears off, leaving him there.

<b>       INT. HOTEL REGISTRATION - MINUTES LATER
</b>
       Adam addresses the clerk.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Good evening. I want to stay at this
                 hotel.

<b>                           CLERK
</b>                 Fill this out please. And I'll need a

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 A card?

<b>                           CLERK

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Of course!

       Adam gives him a baseball card.

<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT

       A BELLBOY ushers Adam in and sets down his bag.

<b>                           BELLBOY

                 The hotel.

                 You've been very, very nice.

       He offers two dollars.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I was able to get some change
                 downstairs and my father taught me
                 that it's customary to tip in a
                 situation such as this.

<b>                           BELLBOY

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 My father is a genius.

<b>                           BELLBOY

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let
                 the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom

                 		(choking up)
                 ...who I'm really beginning to miss.
                 I'm sorry.  It's my first night away
                 from home.

<b>                           BELLBOY

<b>                           ADAM

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                 You don't look thirty-five.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 How old do I look?

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                 Twenty-five? Around there.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I guess living up here makes people
                 look older.

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                 Up here on the fifteenth floor?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (catching himself)
                 Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor.
                 Goodnight.

<b>                           BELLBOY
</b>                 Goodnight.

       Adam abruptly shuts the door in the man's face.
       He goes to the window and looks out. The height scares
       him to death. He jumps back.



<b>       INT. SHELTER, DINNER TABLE - SAME TIME

       Adam's parents pray.

<b>                           CALVIN

<b>                           HELEN

       She begins to tear up and he pats her hand.

<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN
</b>
       Adam sits by the window watching his first dawn.

<b>       EXT. HOLIDAY INN - MORNING
</b>
       It's another bright, smoggy day.  And here comes Eve,
       marching from the parking garage to the hotel entrance.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (skyward)
                 What in the hell am I doing here?!
                 That's what I'd like to know! Somebody

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 All I know is that his first name is
                 Adam.  No!  Adam Webber!  That's it.

       He is seated on the bed, transfixed, watching a
       television commercial.The PHONE RINGS loudly.  Adam
       nearly jumps out of his skin.  After he figures out where
       the ringing is coming from, he answers the phone.

                 the butt or the hair.  Or some
                 combination of the above.

<b>                           ADAM

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Okay, if you promise to leave me
                 alone, I'll tell you.

<b>                           ADAM

<b>                           EVE

                 are very good looking, but
                 even more shallow than I am, if you
                 can picture that.

<b>                           EVE

<b>                           EVE

<b>                           ADAM

<b>                           EVE

       She drives the truck to a stop. He keeps the beat to the

<b>                           EVE

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It does?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Sure.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I didn't know that.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced
                 sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and
                 dad.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 They're all divorced?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Everybody's divorced.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It didn't used to be that way.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I wouldn't know.
                     (then)
                 What kind of wife are you looking for?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 One who's not a mutant.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 No dogs, huh? Okay.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 And if possible, I'd like to marry
                 someone from Pasadena.

       She is speechless. Then:

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 When do you need her by?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Two weeks.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, I could probably get you laid in
                 two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant
                 wife from Pasadena...that could take
                 some
                 time.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 That's what I was afraid of.


<b>       INT. DINER - LATER, SAME DAY
</b>
       Adam and Eve are in a booth. The WAITRESS approaches with
       sandwiches and drinks.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 What do you mean, you can get me laid?

       He and the waitress look to Eve for an answer.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Could we talk about that a little
                 later?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Of course.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (sugary, to waitress)
                 Thank you.

       The amazed waitress leaves.  Adam automatically lowers
       his head and says grace.  Two HAPPENIN' GUYS at the
       counter look over and chuckle at the rube.  Eve flips
       them a mean bird and mouths the words "fuck you" as Adam
       continues to pray. The guys shut up.

<b>       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY
</b>
       Eve shares a frame Santa Monica bungalow.  It's in a
       pretty nice neighborhood on a quiet street.  Her GEO
       FISHTAILS into the picture and comes to rest half in the
       street, half on the curb.  Adam is driving.

<b>                           EVE

       She rips the keys out of the ignition.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Now, get out!!

       They get out.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You almost got us killed!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I told you I've never driven before!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Never drive again!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 You said it would be easy!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I was wrong!!

<b>                           ADAM

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I like it.

       She storms off for the house where a YOUNG MAN is coming
       out the front door in a cut-off T-shirt and spandex
       exercise shorts.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Swell!


<b>       EXT. PORCH

       CLIFF is leaving with a cardboard box full of clothes.
       He is exceedingly GOOD LOOKING AND IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.
       Eve and Adam come up the steps.

<b>                           CLIFF

</b>                 Your stuff?  Let me see that.

       She looks in the box.  Holds up a pair of old briefs.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You came back for these?

                 Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam.
                 Nice coat!

       Cliff smiles and bounces down the steps.

<b>                           ADAM

                 together for about six months.  And
                 yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind
                 of got a thing for him.
                     (entering the house)
                 That's what you wanted to know, isn't
                 it?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (following)
                 Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff
                 likes to wear another man's
                 underpants.

<b>       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
       Very good music is playing. Adam listens to one speaker
       then crosses to listen to the other. Then he goes back to
       the first.

<b>       INT.EVE'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME
</b>
       Eve is pouring champagne into a glass that contains two
       sugar cubes.  Next she adds several dashes of bitters.
       TROY, HER GAY ROOMMATE, throws together a tray of
       appetizers as dinner cooks on the stove.


<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (sotto)
                 Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I knew you'd like him.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think
                 about it!  The guy's got all this
                 easily negotiable property. He's
                 obviously setting something up very
                 big.  Like a self-sustaining island
                 off the coast of South America, for
                 instance. Or perhaps he's the head of
                 a cult that's doing weird things with
                 poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard
                 worse.

       He rushes out with the tray.

<b>       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Troy enters with sushi appetizers. Adam is looking at the
       ceiling.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 You have very nice ceilings.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Not particularly.

<b>                           TROY

                 urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori"
                 if you prefer. I love sushi.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.

<b>                           ADAM

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I thought only hookers drank those
                 things.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

       Eve and Troy look at each other as she hands him his
       wine.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Dinner in fifteen minutes. Why don't
                 we sit and chat.

       They do.



<b>                           TROY
</b>                 So, Adam...where on earth are you
                 from?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It's a very small place. People don't
                 even know it's there.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 And it's called...?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.

<b>                           TROY

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (defensive)
                 Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm
                 Springs.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Oh, yes.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Right on the button.

<b>                           TROY

                 town.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Give me your hand.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (to himself)
                 Oh, my God...

       Adam holds out his hand and she takes it, rubbing her
       finger slowly and gently around in his palm.  For her,
       it's psychic stuff.  For him, it's spine-tingling.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Okay, let's see...I'm not promising

                 and... you've definitely come down
                 here for food and supplies and... to

<b>                           ADAM

       gulp.

<b>                           TROY

                 closer?

<b>                           EVE

</b>                 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2
                 million dollars for it. A tidy sum
                 then, as well as now. I'm quoting my
                 father, of course.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What's the capitol?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Juneau.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Sorry, that's the largest city.

       Troy jumps up and runs out of the room.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Where's he gone?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 He's gone to check your answers on his
                 computer.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 He has a computer?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Sure.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 In the house?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of
                 course, in the house.  It's in there.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 May I please be excused?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Uh...yeah.

<b>       TROY'S OFFICE
</b>
       He has "Alaska" on his computer screen.  Adam enters and
       looks at the computer, which captivates him.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 This must be very new.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Yeah.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It's so small.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What are you talking about? This is
                 the new Mac. You a hacker?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I don't think so.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 You don't have a computer in your

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 How do you get through those winters?
                 		(reading screen)
                 Well, you're right.  Juneau.
                 		(then, covering the
                 		 screen with his hand)
                 What's the highest peak?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest
                 point in North America.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (after peeking at the screen)
                 Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go
                 eat!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (indicating computer)
                 That would knock my father out.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Yeah?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Oh, yes.
                     (to himself)
                 It would probably kill him.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 He's a Windows guy then, huh?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes. He likes windows.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Well, I think Windows stink. What do
                 you think of that?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 ...I guess it's...just a matter of

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 True.

       Troy exits. Adam follows.


       (EDITORIAL:  Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene
       134 rather than precede it.)








<b>       INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
       Calvin Webber is sleeping soundly.  Helen stands quietly
       at the door looking at him. She finishes off her
       champagne cocktail and very quietly shuts the door.

<b>       INT. ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       Helen goes into the elevator. Obviously, she's had too
       much to drink.

<b>       INT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       The floor rumbles and the metal doors open emitting the
       red light.  Soda Jerk and TEN OF HIS FOLLOWERS stand up
       expectantly and anxiously.  Helen appears--and looks at
       this terribly odd assortment of people.

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Who are you?!

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                     (beat, then)
                 I'm the mother.

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 It's the mother!!

       And they all fall down on their knees and worship her
       with much wailing and rejoicing.  Several speak in
       tongues. Helen stares at them wide-eyed, presses the
       button on the control box, and goes back down.


<b>       INT. DINING TABLE - NIGHT
</b>
       Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's
       and Troy's utter lack of same.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 But first, you have to start with the
                 clothes!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Exactly.
                 		(then to Adam)
                 You understand that, don't you?  You
                 have no chance of meeting a woman
                 dressed like that.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 All right.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (to Troy)
                 So, what are you seeing?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (looking Adam over)
                 I don't know.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Money is no object.  He's got cards up
                 the wazoo.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 The what?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Wazoo!  Try to listen.
                     (then to Troy)
                 Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip-
                 hop, Euro trash?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 You're serious, aren't you?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 What's that supposed to mean?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 It means that your taste in men's
                 apparel is as bad as your taste in
                 men.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, that's blunt!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 And I suppose you see him in some sort
                 of strapless  thing, don't you?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 I see "elegant."

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 That's what I'm sensing.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 The guy with the underpants!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 That's boring!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (indicating Adam)
                 Not on him.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'm not wearing his pants.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Why not? He has great pants.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I just don't want to.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Okay.

<b>                           EVE
</b>
                 Why don't you take him and pick out
                 his clothes?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Alright, I will.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (talking with her mouth full)
                 I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to
                 buy six thousand paper napkins.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What do you think, Adam?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 About clothing?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Yeah.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Whatever you two want. If you've got
                 the time, I've got the wazoo.

       Eve and Troy watch him eat for a beat or two.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Isn't it a little tiring to sit up
                 straight like that?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 What about holding your right arm up
                 like that all the time?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It's fine. Just give it a try.
                 And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot
                 off the chair!

       She does. Eve and Troy emulate Adam.

<b>       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
       Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of
       packages. They head for the house.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I guess a lot of those tall buildings
                 we saw this morning are new.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Almost all of them.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 The recovery is very impressive.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they
                 rebuilt the freeway in six months.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Amazing. I'm very impressed.



<b>       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - SAME DAY
</b>
       Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy
       enter. Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks
       terrific. Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other
       packages and garment bags. We see names like Gucci,
       Armani and Lauren. Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's
       makeover.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Well, what do you think?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I think...it...works.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Let me show you the entire trousseau!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 But first let me show her these!

       He reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains --
       a pair of rollerblades.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Eve, can I skate around your block?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (making it sexual)
                 How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around
                 your block?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (beat, then)
                 No.

<b>       SCENE 138 OMITTED
</b>



<b>       EXT. VENICE BEACH - LATER, SAME DAY
</b>
       There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach
       that is completely covered by graffiti. Eve and Troy sit
       at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all
       over the place. He wears spandex workout pants and a T-
       shirt.



       The starting CRANE SHOT begins on the nearly deserted
       commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to
       the band shell.

<b>       ANGLE - CLOSER
</b>
       of him skating and them watching.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 He's going to kill himself.
                     (then, to Adam)
                 Go skate out on the bike path! It's
                 that way!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Okay!

       He heads out of the band shell. We follow him as he
       skates into an area that has been given over to the
       homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and
       blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by. He
       takes them to be more mutants.

<b>       EXT. BIKE PATH - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty
       girls skating in their tiny bikinis. A nearly nude body-
       builder guy goes by on a bike. Then Adam sees the ocean.

<b>       ANGLE - WAVES
</b>
       breaking on the beach and rocks.

<b>       EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS
</b>
       Adam tosses off his roller-blades and walks trance-like
       towards the waves.

<b>       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE
</b>
       appear on a dune behind him and watch.

<b>       ANGLE - ADAM
</b>
       Adam raises his arms to greet the ocean, perhaps like a
       Plains Indian would. Then he joyously runs into the surf
       and dives.

<b>       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE
</b>
       watching.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 That water's freezing!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 He's from Alaska.

<b>       ANGLE - ADAM
</b>
       He surfaces and throws his fists in the air.

<b>       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE
</b>
<b>                           TROY
</b>                 That's why little things mean so much
                 to him.

<b>       ANGLE - ADAM
</b>
<b>                           ADAM
</b><b>                 I LOVE THIS!!

<b>       INT. EVE'S LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY
</b>
       Eve enters from her morning shower to find Troy and Adam
       goofing to The Village People song. She gives Troy a
       disapproving look.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (defensive)
                 What?! He wanted to hear some
                 standards!

       (My hip daughters tell me that "YMCA" is enjoying a huge
       rebirth of popularity at their parties. Apparently they
       line dance to it.)

<b>       EXT. FREEWAY - SAME DAY
</b>
       A helicopter shot follows the U-Haul in traffic.
       (Continue music.)

<b>       EXT. SELF-STORAGE - SAME DAY
</b>
       Adam and Eve fill a second storage site. (Continue
       music.)

<b>       EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, PUBLIC PARK  - DAY
</b>
       We see the infield of a gay softball team wheel a double
       play.

<b>       ANGLE - TROY AND ADAM

       She looks out the back window at the rain and shakes her
       head. She exits the back door with an umbrella.

       Eve hurries to Adam who is sitting on a lawn chair in the
       middle of the small back yard, enjoying the rain. She
       holds the umbrella over her head.

</b>                 Hey, Eve!

<b>                           EVE

                 hasn't got enough sense to come in out
                 of the rain?"

<b>                           ADAM

                     (then watching the rain hit
                      the palm of his hand)
                 You know, my father -- who is a
                 scientist -- says that everything is a
                 miracle. Everything. Until recently I
                 wasn 't sure what he meant by that.

<b>                           EVE

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Then just help me find a girlfriend!
                 That's all I ask.
                 I'll give you every single card I've

<b>                           EVE

       He hugs her.

       This hip, up-market club is based on a 1940's theme.
       Establish the YOUTHFUL RICH arriving in their black four-
       wheel vehicles and silver Porsches. Coats and ties. Eve,
       Troy and Adam arrive on foot. Adam notices the valet
       parking.

       Eve looks like she owns the place.

<b>       INT. NIGHT CLUB ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

       Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND
       HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's. Adam, Eve and
       Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward.
       Adam's got on that terrific dark suit. Women notice. Eve
       notices them noticing.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 My goodness gracious!  This place is

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Bored even.

       Adam gives it a shot and goes too bored.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Vaguely bored!

       He gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Unimpressed, but still interested.

       He tries that. It's like watching a neon sign switch back
       and forth:  First interested, then not.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 No!  Not crazy!

<b>                           ADAM

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Be loose.

       He overplays that.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Just be yourself.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Always good advice.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 For him. It doesn't work for the rest
                 of us.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place

       Adam enters the main room. Eve and Troy follow.



<b>       INT. MAIN ROOM
</b>
       There is a bar, a seated section, and a dance floor with
       a DJ booth. The DJ is in a white dinner jacket and does a
       perfect Humphrey Bogart impression as he ad libs his
       speel between records.

<b>       ANGLE - BAR

       JASON and JONATHAN wave when they see Eve and Troy
       approaching. They ad-lib hellos. Here, and at the tables,
       the recorded MUSIC IS SO LOUD THEY MUST SPEAK OVER IT.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam! Adam,

       They shake.

</b>                 How do you do?! It's very nice to meet
                 you, Jason and Jonathan!
                     (confidentially, to them)
                 My mother always told me that if you
                 meet a person for the first time it's
                 easier to remember their names if you
                 use those names right away.

       Jason and Jonathan just stare at him.

<b>                           TROY

                 Oh!

       A slightly drunk beauty named SOPHIE appears behind Eve.

<b>                           SOPHIE

</b>                 Get lost, Sophie.

       Sophie pushes her way right up to Adam.

       Eve steps in and takes Adam's hand, drawing him away from
       Sophie.

<b>                           EVE

                 I was wondering if you might help me.
                 I...I seem to have lost my
                 Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere
                 around here.

       Miss Sweet stares at him for a beat or two, then
       chuckles.

<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 Oh, now, that's a great one!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (big smile)
                 You like it?

<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                     (a little clap)
                 Bravo!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Thank-Q!

       They both laugh.

       Stunned...as they watch Adam and Miss Sweet. Another
       pretty young woman (HEATHER) joins Adam.

<b>       ANGLE - ADAM AND GIRLS
</b>
       Heather is a friend of Miss Sweet's.

<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 This is my new friend...

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'm Adam Webber.

<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 He's really funny!

<b>                           HEATHER
</b>                 Hi!  I'm Heather!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 "Heather?"  I don't believe I've ever
                 heard that name before.

       There's a slight beat before both girls laugh.

<b>                           HEATHER
</b>                 Yeah, right!

<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 I told you!  He's funny!

<b>       ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

       More stunned. Eve finds that she very much hates watching
       Adam having a good time with other healthy non-mutants.

</b>
<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're
                 both professional dancers.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Really?

<b>                           HEATHER
</b>                 You dance?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I took a dance lesson everyday of my
                 life until a couple of days ago.

<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 You're kidding!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No, I'm not! My mom taught me.

<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 Your mom was a dancer?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You
                 would like her very much! Shall we
                 dance?

<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 Sure.


       They head for the dance floor.

       watching.

<b>       ANGLE - THE FLOOR
</b>
       A jitterbug song comes on and so does Adam.



       He and Miss Sweet are a little rough on take-off, but
       they hit smooth sailing soon enough. He's terrific at
       picking up the new stuff she shows him.

<b>       ANGLE - EVE &amp; TROY
</b>
       They are shocked.

<b>       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR
</b>
       Heather cuts in on Miss Sweet as the other dancers stop
       to watch someone who is so much better than them. The
       three of them begin to dance together.

       Adam dances beautifully with the two women. We CUT BACK
       AND FORTH between them and Eve.

<b>       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR
</b>
       Adam, Miss Sweet and Heather complete their dance with
       great aplomb.  Other dancers applaud them. Someone is
       WHISTLING LOUDLY OFF CAMERA.  Adam and his dance partners
       look over to:

<b>       ANGLE - EVE
</b>
       She is whistling like a guy calling his dog.  Troy is
       embarrassed.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Must you...

       Eve points at Adam and beckons broadly for him to come
       over -- a basketball coach calling her player off the
       floor.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What in the hell is wrong with you?!!

</b>
<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 Is that your girl friend?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No. Would you please excuse me?

<b>                           HEATHER
</b>                 If you'll please come back.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I will certainly try.  And thank you
                 both very much for the dance.

       He leaves.

<b>                           MISS SWEET
</b>                 When was the last time you saw manners
                 like that?

<b>                           HEATHER
</b>                 Yeah.  It's like meeting a foreigner
                 or something.

<b>       ANGLE - TABLE
</b>
       as Adam comes over. The music is not so loud now.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (to Troy)
                 Go to the bathroom.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Right here?
                 		(then, off her look)
                 Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't
                 sure!

       Troy rises and exits.  Adam arrives and sits down.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 You wanted to see me!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you
                 learn to dance like that?!  And there
                 are no starving people, are there?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Why are you suddenly so mad at me?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Don't change the subject! I want you
                 to tell me the truth about yourself.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I've never lied to you.  I've maybe
                 let you believe things that you wanted
                 to believe, but I've never lied.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't
                 you?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love
                 with you the first time I saw you.
                     (off her look)
                 I did. I think that you are the most--

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I want to know exactly who you are and
                 what you're really up to!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 All right. Let me tell you the whole
                 thing. In 1962--


<b>                           CLIFF (OC)
</b>                 Well, well, well.  Don't we clean up
                 nice?

       Cliff steps up to the table.  Adam, automatically a
       gentleman, rises and offers his hand.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Hello, Cliff, how are you this
                 evening?

       Cliff barely shakes his hand.

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                 Not bad.

       Then he sits in Adam's seat.

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                 But I do miss that green sport coat of
                 yours.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Thank you very much. But, Cliff,
                 that's my seat. And I was just--

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                     (to Eve)
                 How 'bout a drink at the bar?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (pause, then)
                 Sure.

       They rise.  Cliff gestures to the chair.

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                 It's all yours.

       Eve and Cliff go to the bar.  Adam sits down glumly.  He
       looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet
       who is seated at a table with Heather.  A GOOD LOOKING
       GUY is hitting on them.  CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between
       Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate.  Then
       she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam
       smiles back.  Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of
       Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.

       ANGLE - Troy

       returning from the restroom.  He is surprised to see Eve
       at the bar with Cliff.  When he looks back at the dance
       floor table, Adam is not there.

<b>       ANGLE - EVE AND CLIFF
</b>
       Sipping wine.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 So where is your roommate, the model?

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                 You know, I don't know.  And looking
                 at you, I don't care.  It's been too
                 long, Eve.

<b>                           ADAM (OC)
</b>                 Please excuse this interruption.

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                 Oh, brother...

<b>       WIDER - BAR
</b>
       Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and
                 please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't
                 Cliff just a butt with hair?

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                 What?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and
                 hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow,
                 as well?

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                     (the shallowest guy in the
                      world)
                 Shallow? I'm shallow?!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                 Yeah. Before I kick your ass.

       He gives Adam a shove.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to
                 defend myself.

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                 Do ya?

       Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and
       counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth,
       snapping his head back.  It's not a big punch, but very,
       very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason
       and Jonathan.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Stop it, you two!

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                     (slightly insecure)
                 I guess we shouldn't fight in here.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (lowering his guard)
                 Yes, I agree.

       Cliff draws back another right.  Adam flicks out a quick
       left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but
       not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes
       a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam
       pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his
       side.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Adam?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'm sorry.

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                     (increasingly insecure)
                 Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.
                 Fighting is pretty immature.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (lowering his guard)
                 It certainly is.  I agree with you
                 completely.

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                 Eve? I'm leaving.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I don't blame you!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (turning to Eve)
                 Eve, I'm sorry.

       Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another
       right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a
       short right jab.

<b>                           CLIFF
</b>                     (deeply insecure)
                 Well, good night, everyone.

       Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him.  Cliff
       walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both
       nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very
       subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I'm leaving, too.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 But, Eve, I would--

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you
                 out--because I quit!  This is
                 ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm
                 ridiculous!

       She exits. Adam looks over at Troy who shrugs.

<b>                           TROY

<b>                           EVE

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn

       He plops down on the chair.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 In the first place, I don't fall in
                 love with weirdos I've only known for
                 four or five days.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Yes, you do.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 And I don't fall in love with grown
                 men who collect baseball cards!!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Uh, yes, you do.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Or pee in their pants when they see
                 the ocean!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Yes, you do!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Or have perfect table manners.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (sitting up)
                 You know, I asked him about that. And
                 he said that good manners are a way we
                 have of showing other people that we
                 respect them. See, you'd eat like a
                 slob if you
                 were alone, but since another human
                 being is present, you show that person
                 respect by going to the trouble of
                 having proper manners. I didn't know
                 that. I thought it was a way of
                 appearing superior.
                     (then)
                 Know what else he told me?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (sitting on the bed)
                 What?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 He thinks that I am a gentleman and
                 that you are a lady!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, consider the source. I don't
                 even know what a lady is.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Exactly! I thought a gentleman was
                 somebody who owned horses. Turns out,
                 the short and very simple definition
                 of a gentleman or a lady is: someone
                 who always attempts to make the people
                 around him or her feel as comfortable
                 as possible. That's it! If you don't
                 do that, nothing else matters. The
                 cars, the clothes, the houses...

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Where did he get all that information?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 From the oddest place. His parent's
                 told him. I don't think I got that
                 memo.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 So now I suppose he's trying to make
                 those two dancers feel as comfortable
                 as possible.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 He didn't leave with them.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear
                 that.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 He left with Sophie.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 What?!!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 It's true.  She swept him out the door
                 whispering little French things into
                 his ear.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please
                 don't tell me that!!


<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What are you going to do? Go over to
                 her place and kick in the door?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You're goddamn right I am!

       She exits, then sticks her hand back in.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 You coming?!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (cringing)
                 I don't think so.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Coward!

       She exits.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Gentleman coward, to you.

<b>       EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide
       open.  She runs down the porch steps, across the yard,
       and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual
       fumbling.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Come on!  Come on, damn it!

<b>       INT. CAR
</b>
       She jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition.  Adam
       appears at the passenger window.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Hi!

       Eve SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she throws open her door and
       jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting
       her knee.  Adam runs around the car to help her to her
       feet. Dogs start barking in several houses.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Eve?!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You
                 stupid son of a bitch!!!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'm really sorry!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 What in the hell are you doing here!!
                 You're supposed to be over on San
                 Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex
                 with that slut Sophie!!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I know...and I'm really sorry.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, you should be!  Thanks to you,
                 my heart is in my neck!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 What?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Goodnight!

       Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Eve, if you'll let me, I can --

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is
                 that?!  What if this is for life?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I know first aid!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, you had better!!

       He chases her up the porch steps.

<b>       INT. LIVING ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER
</b>
       Lights are low and warm.  Adam is attempting to swab the
       abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat
       pants.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Wait a minute.

       She reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip,
       revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 There.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Thanks.

       He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the
       antiseptic to her knee with the other.  It stings and she
       flinches.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Steady. Steady.  It's going to be all
                 right in no time.

       He leans down and blows on the wound.  CU of that.  CU of
       his hand on her calf.  CU of her looking down at him,
       watching as he blows gently on her knee.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I went to Sophie's and she was very
                 hospitable.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Is that what you call it?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 But it just wasn't where I wanted to
                 be so I left as politely as I could
                 and found a taxi.  But I asked the
                 driver to drop me here instead of at
                 the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como
                 sings called "On the Street Where You
                 Live."  You know it?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Sing it to me.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (softly, saying it as much as
                      singing it)
                 "All at once am I--several stories
                 high-- knowing I'm--on the street--
                 where you live."  It's about a young
                 man who is overjoyed just to be
                 standing in front of the house of the
                 person he loves.

       She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws
       him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length.
       Then:

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Adam...dumb question, but humor me.
                 Have you ever had sex before?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No.


       She sits up.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 How is that possible?

       During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and
       lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is
       mental.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (sitting up)
                 In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on
                 Los Angeles, my parents were in our
                 fallout shelter.  That's where I was
                 born. We
                 only survived because it was a huge
                 shelter as fallout shelters go. My
                 father worked on it secretly for
                 years. When he had to, he used
                 contractors, but always from out-of-
                 state and always for just a portion of
                 the job. He told them it was a secret
                 government experiment done through
                 CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he
                 felt in this case he had no choice. Of
                 course, it had to be a secret, because
                 we had just enough supplies to last
                 three people thirty-five years. That's
                 also why I have no brothers or
                 sisters. The air vent was the really
                 tricky part, but he was able to cut
                 into a flood control sewer. What I'd
                 like to do Eve, is take you down into
                 the fallout shelter with me. We could
                 live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad
                 said if I found a healthy girl I
                 should "bring her on down". And you
                 look plenty healthy to me.


<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Uh-huh. Adam?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, Eve?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I want you to go back to the hotel
                 now.  I'll call you a cab.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Of course.  I shouldn't be over here
                 at this hour.

       He rises.  She gets up and leads him to the door.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 That's right.  And I'll see you in the
                 morning in the lobby.  Do you mind
                 waiting outside for the taxi?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Not at all.  And Eve thank you for
                 tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 My pleasure.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It was at least as good as the sky.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Really?  Okay!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 And I think better than the ocean. I'm
                 serious!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Neat. Goodnight!

<b>       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Adam comes out glowing with happiness. He looks
       heavenward. And does his patented thumbs up.


       Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front
       door.

<b>       EXT. VALLEY AVENUE - DAY
</b>
       A REFRIGERATED U-HAUL TRUCK lurches down the street.

<b>       INT. TRUCK

       Adam struggles with the gears as Troy worries about his
       driving skills.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Goddamn, Adam!


<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Wait a minute!

       He promptly pulls over and turns off the engine.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back
                 there!  I'll be right back!

       Adam jumps out of the truck and runs off.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Without question, the strangest man
                 I've ever met.

<b>       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam runs up.  The bookstore looks familiar.  Adam runs
       to the next store. It's a bar.  He runs to the next
       store.  It's the Malt Shop.  Adam is thrilled.  He tries
       the front door and at first it does not open.

<b>       INT. MALT SHOP
</b>
       The Soda Jerk is leading about twelve followers in
       prayers.

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Give us a sign!  That's all we ask!
                 Give us some sort of sign!

       The front door opens and Adam peers in.  He sees the Soda
       Jerk; smiles broadly at him and waves.  Then he closes
       the
       door.  The Soda Jerk grabs his heart and faints.  His
       followers rush to his aid.

<b>       INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam jumps in.

<b>                           ADAM

</b>                 How 'bout we check with Eve first?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 You bet!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 So, did you buy a movie?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 What?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the
                 bookstore.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (concentrating on his
                      driving)
                 No, I wouldn't go in one of those
                 places with a gas mask on.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                     (laughing in agreement)
                 I know what you mean!  I usually wear
                 a big hat and dark glasses.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Does that work?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Yeah...Seems to.

       Adam would not have thought that.

<b>       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER
</b>
       Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the
       deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind
       looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Hi, Eve!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 I'm Nina Aron, Adam.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 How do you do?

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Very well, thank you. I'm with the
                 County Family Services Department. Eve
                 tells me you've been living in a bomb
                 shelter most of your life.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Fallout shelter. There's a difference.

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my
                 associate -- Mr. Brown.

       BROWN appears from the kitchen.  He's good-sized man who
       dresses casually.  Adam becomes uneasy.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Hello.

       He nods politely.

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 We want you to come with us so we can
                 talk some more about your experiences.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Come where?

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 My office.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 For how long?

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Well, that depends...

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I thank you very much for the
                 invitation, but I'm quite busy today.
                 Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron.
                 It's the best thing.  The best thing
                 for you. I promise.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 ...All right, Eve.  If you say so.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 ...I do.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (to Aron)
                 Could I please just go home?  I was
                 lost, but this morning I found home
                 and I promise not to bother any of you
                 ever again.

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Let's go talk first, Adam.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, ma'am.



       The two come forward.  One opens the door and one beckons
       for Adam to step out.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Good-bye, Adam.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Goodbye.

       Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away. Adam exits.

<b>                           ARON
</b>                     (to Eve)
                 You'll be hearing from me.

       She shuts the door. Troy sits dejectedly.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well what was I supposed to do?! He
                 wants me to live underground with him!
                 That's like Silence of the Lambs,
                 don't you think?!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 I know...I know. You did the right
                 thing.

       Eve goes to the window and watches as WE SEE ADAM BREAK
       FROM BROWN AND RUN OFF with him chasing.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Oh, no!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What?!

       She runs out.  He follows.

<b>       EXT. STREET
</b>
       Adam races down the sidewalk.  He cuts left and runs
       between houses.  Brown is not as fast.

<b>       EXT. EVE'S FRONT YARD
</b>
       Eve and Troy run out to Aron who is dialing her cell
       phone.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Oh, my God!

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 He'll catch him.
                 		(then into phone)
                 Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run
                 away and I'm going to need police
                 assistance.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 I have to. If a complaint is made and
                 the person resists obser--

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 No, I can't have that! They'll come
                 with their cars and their guns and
                 their handcuffs--

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Calm down, please. This man needs help
                 and you need protection from him.
                 That's obvious.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You know, I don't think so. I'm
                 confused but you know, I don't think
                 he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd
                 hurt anyone.

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 And now you must let me be the judge
                 of that!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I was frightened and I didn't know
                 what to think! But you know-I believe
                 him. I think he just wants to go home.
                 Wherever the hell that is...

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Let's all remain calm. That's the key
                 thing.





       Suddenly Adam appears from the side of the house,
       startling everyone. He tosses his hotel key to Eve.


<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 The key to my hotel room!  I want you
                 to have my baseball cards!
                 		(running to the truck)
                 And please be sure to pay my bill!

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Young man, stop right there!

       Aron looks around for Mr. Brown.






       Adam jumps into the truck. Aron yells for him to stop.

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Stop, right now! Get out of that
                 truck!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Adam, you really shouldn't try to
                 drive that truck!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                     (starting the engine)
                 Bye, Troy!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Bye, Adam!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 And thanks for always being happy!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Gay.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Oh.
                 		(yelling to Adam)
                 Well, you're...certainly welcome!

       Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the
       driveway and into a parked car.

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a
                 bitch!!

       Getting the truck in first, Adam has to go down the
       sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto
       the street.  He clips two parked cars as he does.  Brown
       comes running from the side of the house.  His pants are
       torn.

                           ARON (cont'd)
                 Where the hell have you been?!

<b>                           BROWN
</b>                 I fell down!
                     (to Troy and Eve)
                 What's the license number of that
                 truck?!

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 Don't ask them!  They're as fucked-up
                 as the other guy!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Let's all just try to remain calm.
                 That's the key thing.

<b>                           ARON
</b>                 How 'bout I just knock the shit out of
                 you?!

       Brown has to grab her.

<b>       EXT. U-STORE-IT - LATER, SAME DAY
</b>
       Eve and Troy arrive in her GEO to see that the two locker
       doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried
       off.  Eve drops her head in disappointment.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 I guess he took what he could.



<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (putting her head in her
                      hand)
                 Good God...you don't think there
                 really is a bomb shelter, do you?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Fallout shelter.

       She gives him a look.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                 There's a difference.

<b>       INT. SHELTER, PATIO - LATER, SAME DAY
</b>
       Helen is using the hip-reduction machine while Calvin
       reads, How to Win Friends and Influence People. The
       distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their
       attention.  Then:

<b>                           ADAM (OC)
</b>                 Mom?!  Dad?!  I'm home!

       They jump up and race into the living room, meeting Adam
       halfway.   The parents kiss and hug their son before
       noticing that he's got the Soda Jerk with him.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I've got almost everything we need!

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.

       He promptly drops to his knees in supplication.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 ...and his church group have
                 volunteered to help us bring the
                 supplies down.  But we've got to
                 hurry.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Are you in trouble, son?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I think I'm being chased by a
                 psychiatrist.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 A psychiatrist?!

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 It happens.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 My goodness! How bad is it up there?!

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Horrible.

<b>                           CALVIN

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 I know.

<b>       INT. ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK
</b>
       Eve and Troy look around.  She opens a drawer and sees
       how nicely folded and put away things are.  Troy notices
       "TV Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page
       marker in it.  He opens the night table drawer and takes
       out the cigar box.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 This it?

       Eve nods.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What do you want to do with it?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Give it back to him.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 And if we can't find him?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 We'll find him.

<b>       INT. BATHROOM, ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM
</b>
       Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are;
       how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth
       paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the
       bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry.  It
       makes her very sad.  She picks up the toothpaste and
       holds it as if it were his ring.

<b>                           TROY (OC)
</b>                 Hey, Eve?  Eve?

       He enters with stock certificates and sees that she's
       very close to crying.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 What's wrong?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 I don't know.  Everything's so neat.
                 It's all just so...goddamn dear.
                 		(starting to cry)
                 Damn!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 See these?  Found them in the box with
                 the cards.  These are stock
                 certificates.  IBM.  AT&amp;T.  Polaroid.

       Instead of taking the certificates, she hands him the
       toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                     (looking at the toothpaste)
                 Ipana. I think I remember that brand.
                     (then)
                 Oh, here, you should read this.
                 "Trademark, 1961."

       He holds out the tube and she takes it to read.


<b>       EXT. REAR OF MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

       Adam, the Soda Jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly
       unload the truck, taking provisions into the back door of

</b>
       Their pal Jason is on the phone with Troy.

<b>                           JASON
</b>                 Purchased in 1958 and '59?  Ten
                 thousand shares of each?  They'd be
                 worth millions. Hell, I don't
                 know...millions upon millions upon
                 millions!  How 'bout that?

<b>       INT. HOTEL ROOM - EARLY EVENING
</b>
       Troy is on the phone.  Eve is standing, looking at the
       stock certificates.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Thanks, Jason.

       He slams down the phone and jumps to his feet.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Millions upon millions upon millions!
                 The cards. The stock!  The clothes!
                 The toothpaste!  The guy was on the
                 level!  And you blew it!  A man walks
                 into your life who is the kindest,
                 most polite, honest, trustworthy,
                 incredibly rich guy you have ever met
                 in your life!! And what do you do?!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Have him committed.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Yeah! That's thinking.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 He was always so "nice"! How was I
                 supposed to know that's a good thing?!
                 "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is
                 "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you
                 that.
                     (beat, then)
                 Was it ever?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 I don't know. I like to think so.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, at least I fell for him before I
                 found out he was rich! That's new.
                     (then)
                 Wait a minute! He said today he knew
                 where home was. What happened this
                 morning?! Where did you go?!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 To get some frozen poultry.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Then what?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 We came back to the house!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You didn't stop anywhere else?!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a
                 porno store.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 What?!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 An adult bookstore. He was very
                 excited about seeing it. You think
                 home is under a dirty bookstore in the
                 Valley?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Come on.

       She heads out.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Trendy address.

       They exit.


<b>       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
</b>
       Troy and Eve approach and enter.



<b>       INT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
</b>
       The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter.
       There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot
       on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound.  But it is
       solid.  She and Troy move about the store tapping their
       feet and finally jumping up and down.  The Pakistani and
       two customers become concerned.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (to Pakistani)
                 Have you got a basement?

<b>                           PAKISTANI
</b>                     (indicating merchandise)
                 Believe me, all the really good stuff
                 is right here.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Is there a back entrance?

<b>                           PAKISTANI
</b>                 Are you kidding?  Of course.

       He points to the rear of the store.

<b>       EXT. REAR MALT SHOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
       The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the
       lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed. Troy and
       Eve appear after the truck is gone.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Why would you put a fallout shelter
                 under a porno shop?

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 None of this stuff was here in 1962.
                 The Valley was mostly small homes and
                 fruit orchards.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Well, we've come a long way, haven't
                 we?  I want to go home.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.

       They turn left to get back to the avenue.

<b>       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
       The phone is ringing.  Then the recorder answers.

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a
                 message. And if you want to leave a
                 number don't say it fast! I hate that!
                 Say it slow. Thank you.

       Beep,

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Uh, Eve...this is Adam.  Look, I just
                 wanted to thank you for everything you
                 did for me...and I wanted to tell you
                 that I...uh...that I wish so many good
                 things for you. I wish so hard that
                 all of your dreams come true. Um...I,
                 uh...



<b>       EXT. AVENUE - NIGHT
</b>
       Eve lets Troy drive.  She clutches the cigar box and
       rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the
       curb in front of the bookstore.  A low rider passes them
       on the left.  Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the
       bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt
       shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at
       passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just
       used.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Adam!!

<b>                           TROY
</b>                 Where?!

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Stop!

       She rolls down her window.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Adam!!

<b>       ANGLE - ADAM
</b>
       Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.

<b>       ANGLE - EVE
</b>
       Running from the car.  The cigar box falls to the street
       and the contents scatter.  Eve could care less.  Besides,
       Troy is there to retrieve everything.

       In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race
       into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the
       lowlifes mentioned above.  Now the street looks more like
       Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to
       kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so
       aggressive.

<b>       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - LATER, SAME NIGHT
</b>
       Helen watches Calvin work on the timing device for the
       locks with a screwdriver.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 How long will you set it for this
                 time?

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 I thought ten years.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Well, that's...considerably shorter
                 than before.  I was wondering, Calvin,
                 why set the locks at all.  I mean the
                 radiation is gone and...

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 To keep what's up there from getting
                 down here! It's not the radiation I'm
                 worried about.

<b>                           ADAM (OC)
</b>                 Mom?  Dad?

       They turn to see Adam walking forward with Eve.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve
                 Rustokov.

       Calvin knows a Russian name when he hears one. But he
       chooses not to pursue it.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (stepping forward, offering
                      her hand)
                 How do you do, Mrs. Webber?  Mr.
                 Webber?

<b>                           WEBBERS

<b>                            EVE
</b>                 Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Well, please excuse us!  We...we

<b>                           CALVIN

</b>                 What can I offer you, Eve?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Mom?  Eve and I have to go.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 What?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 I can't explain it now.  But I want
                 you to set the locks for two months.
                 You have more than enough of
                 everything.  Then we'll be back to get
                 you.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 But, I don't understand.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 And, I'm asking you to trust me
                 without understanding why.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Well, in that case...of course, son.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Of course.

<b>                           EVE

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 We have to go.

<b>                           HELEN

<b>                           CALVIN

<b>                           ADAM/EVE

<b>       INT. BAR - AN HOUR LATER
</b>
       Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in
       1962. Adam is with him.

<b>       INT. - KITCHEN
</b>
       Helen races around, just like she did in 1962, getting
       the roast ready. Eve. watches.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Adam said I shouldn't mention the

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Oh, yes! Please, don't mention the
                 Communists!

<b>       INT. - DINING ROOM
</b>
       Helen hurries out of the kitchen to take her seat. The
       others are already there.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Eve. I hope I'm not being nosey, but

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Yes, Mrs. Webber we are.
                     (then)
                 I'm also from Pasadena.

       Helen nearly comes unglued. Calvin is pleased, too. He
       raises his tea cup.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 A toast! To Adam and Eve!

       The others also raise their cups and everyone clicks.
       Then they drink.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                     (gagging)

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don't know

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You know, they don't, do they?

       They begin to eat.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 What about grace?

<b>                           HELEN

                     (then)
                 I like your friend, Adam.

       They all join hands and lower their heads. Calvin leads
       them.

<b>                           EVE (VO)
</b>                 And you thought your parents were

<b>       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF LA - MORNING
</b>
       Adam and Eve are with a REAL ESTATE BROKER. The broker
       unlocks the gate of a chain-link fence and Adam and Eve
       step onto the property. The broker's Lexus is in the b.g.

<b>                           BROKER
</b>                 It's like the Garden of Eden, don't

       Adam and Eve respond but we can't hear them under Eve's
       narration.

<b>                           EVE (VO)
</b>                 You see, that night, Adam had a choice

<b>       SCENE 173 OMITTED

<b>       EXT. VALLEY PROPERTY - DAY
</b>
       Adam and Eve are working with a TEAM OF ARCHITECTS AND
       CONTRACTORS at the site of a new home. They have plans
       and are discussing dimensions.

<b>                           EVE (VO)
</b>                 It's truly amazing what you can get
                 done when you have unlimited funds.
                 Did you know you can have whole houses
                 built in just a matter of months. All
                 you have to say is this..."I don't
                 care what it costs."  And then, of
                 course, you've got
                 to really mean it, which no one ever
                 does.

<b>       EXT. NEW HOUSE - DAY

       Adam, Eve and Troy enter.

<b>       INT. RETRO STORE
</b>
       This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties.
       Adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with.
       There's a
       lamp (or something) that's just like the lamp (or
       something) from the Webber living room.

<b>                           ADAM

                 life..well, frankly...
                 a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You
                 understand?

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 We can make this work, Adam! Believe
                 me! I'm very good at making things
                 work!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 My mother's like that.

       They kiss again.



<b>       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY
</b>
       Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda
       Jerk.  In CU we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up
       with a big lighted sign that says "GIVE ME SHELTER."
       There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar
       have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet
       Hollywood).  Another drawing shows fashionable guests
       boarding the elevator.

<b>                           EVE (VO)
</b>                 It took a while to convince Archbishop
                 Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he
                 was pretty broken up about it, too,
                 until I showed him my plans for Los
                 Angeles' hottest and most original
                 night spot.

       Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and
       guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 You'll be a ten percent partner and
                 still retain ownership of the
                 entrance.

<b>                           SODA JERK
</b>                 Praise the Lord.  And I mean the real
                 one.

<b>       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF L.A. - TWO MONTHS LATER
</b>
       A 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through
       automatic gates that have signs on them saying:  PRIVATE
       ROAD and NO TRESPASSING. Troy drives the van. Eve drives
       the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.

<b>                           EVE (VO)
</b>                 Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
                 up to the surface very slowly.  Make
                 them very comfortable and then break
                 the bad news to them that there was no
                 nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't
                 kill them Adam's going to tell his
                 father about the Internet.

<b>       EXT. EXACT REPLICA OF THE WEBBER HOUSE - DAY
</b>
       The cars pull up and Adam lets his parents out. They go
       bonkers when they see the house.





<b>       INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       The parents enter first. They are thrilled, shocked, etc.

<b>       INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       As a demonstration, Troy removes a hot cup of coffee from
       the microwave.  Helen is happy to see this handy new
       device.  Calvin, the inventor, sticks his head into the
       machine to investigate its workings.

<b>       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
       Adam demonstrates the VCR to his parents as Troy and Eve
       look on.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 You put the tape in here and you get a
                 movie -- in your own home.

       We see the main title to Natural Born Killers come up on
       the screen. Troy and Eve rush forward.

<b>                           EVE/TROY
</b>                 No!!

<b>       INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
       It has been turned into an office for Calvin.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 This is your bedroom?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's
                 office.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 Well, where are you --

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 No.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes.

<b>                           EVE
</b>                 Is that all right?

<b>                           HELEN
</b>                 It's wonderful, dear! Wonderful!!

       They hug.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Calvin!  They're married!

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                     (offering his hand to both)
                 That's wonderful. We Webber guys have
                 mighty good luck when it comes to
                 women.

       Calvin points out the computer.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 What's that thing?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It's kind of a combination television-
                 typewriter-telephone-post office type
                 of thing.
                     (leading Calvin out)
                 I'll show it to you later.

<b>       EXT. PATIO - AN HOUR LATER
</b>
       Adam and Calvin exit the house. They wear baseball gloves
       and start playing catch. (Calvin notes the modern
       construction of his glove, but does not comment on it.)

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 This is great son, just great. By the
                 way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov,
                 that's not Russian, is it?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents
                 immigrated here.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Uh-huh.

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Dad, I don't know how to tell you
                 this. And I was going to wait a while,
                 but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.
                 A plane crashed into our backyard. I
                 looked it up in old newspapers.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                     (after a while)
                 You're sure?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed
                 without a shot being fired. The Cold
                 War is over.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 That's what everybody believes?

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes, sir. It's true.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 What? Did the politburo just one day
                 say - "We give up?"

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Yes. That's kind of how it was.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Uh-huh.

       Adam throws the ball, but Calvin makes no attempt to
       catch it.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 My gosh, those Commies are brilliant!
                 You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we
                 didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our
                 evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor
                 us!"  I bet they've even asked the
                 West for aid!  Right?!

<b>                           ADAM
</b>                 Uh, I think they have.

<b>                           CALVIN
</b>                 Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly
                 dissemblers! Those, uh...
                     (he can't think of another
                      description, so he moves on)
                 They've finally pulled the wool over
                 everybody's eyes!

<b>                           EVE (VO)
</b>                 Have you ever in your life seen a son
                 who did more for his parents?

       Helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails.

<b>                           EVE (VO)
</b>                 Adam says that this is simply how
                 things work.  First the parents take
                 care of the children and then the
                 children take care
                 of the parents. He says historically,
                 that's how it works.

<b>       INT. LIVING ROOM
</b>
       Eve and Troy are sitting by the window.  Adam and Helen
       come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve.

<b>                           EVE (VO)
</b>                 Whenever Adam gives me such obviously
                 incorrect information, I just smile,
                 slap him on the knee, and look out the
                 window.
                 Why spoil his dreams?  They're such
                 wonderful dreams.

       The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass
       doors. We see Calvin behind the house...measuring off the
       dimensions for a fallout shelter.

<b>       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
       Calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up.
       Perry Como sings "We'll Meet Again".
