After the Nazi invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Bielski brothers escape the slaughter and hide in the woods.
Soon they are joined by many others, all running from the savagery being inflicted on the Jews.
The eldest of the Bielski brother, Tuvia and Zus, disagree over what to do with the growing forest population.
Tuvye believes that they must welcome anyone who wants to join them while Zus thinks they should be fighting the Germans.
After a major falling out, Zus joins the local Russian partisans - with whom the Bielskis had already completed an informal truce - and Tuvia stays with their forest community.
