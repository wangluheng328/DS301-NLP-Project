<b>                                   SECOND DRAFT
</b>                                   July 20, 1984





<b>EXT. MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY
</b>

The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men
imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK
CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington.
His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white
sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late
thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio-
let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from
a glass of iced tea. Then:

<b>                          CRAWFORD
</b>           I should have caught you at the boat
           yard when you got off work. You
           don't want to talk about it here...

<b>                          GRAHAM
</b>           I don't want to talk about it
           anywhere.
                   (beat)
           If you brought pictures, leave them
           in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin
           will be back soon.

<b>                          CRAWFORD
</b>           How much do you know?

<b>                          GRAHAM
</b>           What was in the 'Miami Herald' and
           the 'Times.'
                   (beat)
           Confessions?

<b>                          CRAWFORD
</b>           Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He
           smashes the mirrors and uses the
           pieces.
                   (beat)
           None of them knew that;

<b>                          GRAHAM
</b>           What else did you keep out of the
           papers?

<b>                          CRAWFORD
</b>           Blond, right-handed, really strong,
           wears a size eleven shoe. The prints
           are all smooth gloves. He's on a
           full moon cycle. Both times. His
           blood is AB Positive.

<b>                          GRAHAM
</b>           Somebody hurt him?

<b>                          CRAWFORD
</b>           Typed him from semen. He's a secretor.

Crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham.

<b>2.
</b>Graham flips his cigarette into the surf.
<b>                           CRAWFORD
</b>           Will... you saw this in the papers.
           The second one was all over TV. Did
           you ever think about givin' me a
           call?

<b>                          GRAHAM
</b>           No.

<b>                           CRAWFORD
</b>           Why not?

<b>                           GRAHAM
</b>           The Bureau already has the best lab.
           Plus you have Bloom at the University
           of Chicago...

<b>                           CRAWFORD
</b>           And I got you down here fixing fuckin'
           boat motors.

<b>                           GRAHAM
</b>           You don't need me. I wouldn't
           be useful to you anymore, Jack.

<b>                           CRAWFORD
</b>           Last two like this we had, you
           caught.

<b>                           GRAHAM
</b>           That was three years ago. And by
           doing the same things you and the
           rest of them at the lab are doing.

<b>                           CRAWFORD
</b>           That's not entirely true, Will.
           It's the way you think.


<b>                           GRAHAM
</b>           I think there has been a lot of
           bullshit about the way I think.
                   (beat)
           I came down here to get away from
           all that.

<b>                          CRAWFORD
</b>           You look all right now.

<b>                          GRAHAM
</b>           I am all right.

Crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket. He keeps
them face down. They draw at Will. Crawford knows this.




<b>3.
</b><b>                            CRAWFORD
</b>            If you can't look anymore, I
            understand...

<b>                            GRAHAM
</b>            As long as they're dead...

<b>                           CRAWFORD
</b>            These are all dead, Will.


<b> PICTURES
</b>
 If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two
 snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck
 carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family
 behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling.


<b> CLOSE: GRAHAM
</b>
 looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he
 puts them down and looks along the beach.


<b> GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN
</b>
 KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the
 water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand.
 MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands
 watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen
 around her ankles. Her body language openly states
 hostility. It's towards Crawford.

<b>                           GRAHAM (O.S.)
</b>            Let's talk after dinner. Stay and
            eat.


<b>                            CRAWFORD (O.S.)
</b>            I'LL come back later. I got messages
            at the Holiday Inn to collect

 Molly starts walking forward. On it...
<b>                                                 CUT TO:
</b><b> INT. GRAHAM'S KITCHEN - MOLLY + GRAHAM - NIGHT
</b> are doing dishes. Graham wipes while Molly washes.

<b>                            MOLLY
</b>            He stopped by to see me at the shop
            before he came out here.

<b>                            GRAHAM
</b>            What did he want?






<b>4.
</b><b>                                 MOLLY
</b>                 He asked how you are.

<b>                                GRAHAM
</b>                 And you said?

<b>                                 MOLLY
</b>                 I said you are fine, he should leave
                 you the hell alone.

<b>                                 GRAHAM
</b>                 I'm a forensic specialist, Molly.
                 You've seen my diploma?
                          (sarcastic)
                 I got a diploma and everything.

<b>                                 MOLLY
</b>                 You mended a crack in the wallpaper
                 with your diploma.
                          (heat)
                 You are open and easy now... It took
                 you a lot of work to get to that...

<b>                                 GRAHAM
</b>                 We have it good, don't we?

<b>                                 MOLLY
</b>                 All the things that happened to you
                 before make you know that...

      There is a soft pleading in her voice.

<b>                                GRAHAM
</b>                 What the hell can I do?

<b>                                 MOLLY
</b>                          (after a pause)
                 What you've already decided. You're
                 not really asking.

<b>                                GRAHAM
</b>                 If I were?

<b>                                 MOLLY
</b>                          (facing him)
                 Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.
                 And Kevin.
                          (heat)
                 That's selfish, huh?

<b>                                 GRAHAM
</b>                          (touches the side

                 If we find him, the police will have
                 to take him down. Not me, I'm just
                 looking at evidence.

<b>5.

her breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's
smiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds
runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his
wife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He
looks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to

a large yellow envelope that says: "Follow the ribbon." A
big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope.

<b>                           GRAHAM
</b>           He may have a history of biting --
           barroom fights or child abuse.

          Most of the time in sex assaults the
          bite mark has a livid spot in the

          So, for him, biting may be a fighting
          pattern as much as sexual behavior.

<b>                           LOUNDS

Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford
tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham:

Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to
turn him around.

 Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under
 him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down. The
 impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The

 Lounds.

then we'll find him.

<b>		  CRAWFORD
</b>We're running it through the

into both families. Plus they were

a haystack.

</b>         As long as it's on soft paper.
         You may(Pause) find this curious.

 He pulls an EKG tape from a drawer and points to the
 spiky lines.

<b>                      DR. CHILTON
</b>         Here Lecter's resting on the
         examining table getting an
         electrocardiogram. Complained of
         chest pains. Pulse seventy-two.
         Here he grabs the nurse's head and
         pulls her down to him. Here he's
         subdued by the attendant and
         Lecter's shoulder is dislocated.
         Do you notice the strange thing?
                 (pause)
         His pulse never got over eighty-
         five. Even when he tore into her
         face.

 Dr. Chilton looks over at Graham, perhaps expecting a.
 response. There is nothing to read in Graham's face. It is
 a blank.

<b>                      DR. CHILTON
</b>         The consensus around here is that
         the only person who has demonstrated
         any practical understanding of Dr.
         Hannibal Lecter is you, Mr. Graham.
         Can you tell me anything about him?

<b>                     GRAHAM
</b>         No.

         able to reconstruct his fantasies?
         And did that help you identify him?

looks at Graham. Dr. Chilton has seen a lot of hostility.
Right now he's seeing some more.

<b>                      GRAHAM
</b>                (stands)
         I want to see Lecktor now.

</b>         Uh... sure...


<b>INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY
</b>
We hear three locks opening. The door opens. Graham enters.
An attendant behind Graham closes the door and we hear the
bolts lock again. As Graham is walking towards us, we WIDEN
and TRACK IN. It makes the b.g. disorienting as we get closer
to Graham's face. The CAMERA DROPS as Graham sits in a single
chair. We haven't yet seen what Graham looks at. Now:


<b>GRAHAM'S POV: BARRED CELL
</b>
A 6x10 cage. In the center of the bars separating Graham
from the Occupant is a three-foot-square perspex sheet. The
occupant can't get at someone sitting in front of him. In
the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer. In the
cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR. HANNIBAL LECKTOR. He
appears to be asleep. His back is to Graham. He has not
stirred. Then:

<b>                      LECKTOR
</b>         That's the same atrocious aftershave
         you wore in court three years ago.

<b>                      GRAHAM
</b>         I keep getting it for Christmas.


<b>CLOSE: LECKTOR'S HEAD
</b>
turns to us. His small eyes drill into Graham's brain.
Lecktor's attitude is professionally psychiatric, as if Graham
is the patient.
<b>                      LECKTOR
</b>         Did you get my card?

<b>                     GRAHAM
</b>         I got it. Thank you.
<b>26.
</b>

<b>GRAHAM' S
</b>struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his
emotional reactions.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      And how is Officer Stuart? The one
      who was the first to see my basement.

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      Stuart is fine.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      Emotional problems, I hear. He was
      a very promising young officer. Do
      you ever have any problems, Will?

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      No.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      Of course, you don't.
          (pause)
      I'm glad you came. My callers are
      all professional. Clinical
      psychiatrists from cornfield colleges
      somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      Dr. Bloom showed me your article on
      surgical addiction in the journal
      of Clinical Psychiatry.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      And?

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      Very interesting, even to a layman.

Lecktor rolls around and examines the term "layman" in his
head. Then:

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      A layman.., layman. Interesting
      term. So many experts on government
      grants. And you say you're a
      'layman?' But it was you who caught
      me, wasn't it, Will? Do you know
      how you did it'

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      You've read the transcript. It's
      all there.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      No it's not. Do you know how you
      Did it Will?

<b>27.
</b><b>        GRAHAM
</b>It's in the transcript. What does
it matter now?

<b>        LECKTOR
</b>    (smiles)
It doesn't matter to me, Will.

<b>        GRAHAM
</b>I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.

<b>        LECKTOR
</b>Yes, I thought so.

<b>        GRAHAM
</b>It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.

<b>        LECKTOR
</b>Yes .

<b>        GRAHAM
</b>You read about it, I'm sure.

<b>        LECKTOR
</b>In the papers. I don't rear out the
articles.
    (laughs)
I wouldn't want them to think I was
dwelling on anything morbid. You
want to know how he's choosing them,
don't you?

<b>        GRAHAM
</b>I thought you would have some ideas.

<b>        LECKTOR
</b>Why should I tell you?

<b>        GRAHAM
</b>There are things you don't have.
Research materials... I could speak
to the Chief of Staff...?

<b>        LECKTOR
</b>Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He
fumbles at your head like a freshman
pulling at a panty girdle.
    (laugh;)
He actually tries to give me a
Thematic and Apperception test.
Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to
come up. It's a card with a woman
in bed and a man in the foreground.
I was supposed to avoid a sexual
interpretation. I laughed in his
face.
    (beat)
Never mind, it's boring.

<b>28.
</b>
<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      You'll get to see the file on this
      case. And there's another reason.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      Pray tell.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      I thought you might be curious to
      find our if you're smarter than
      the person I'm looking for.

<b>               LECKTOR
</b>      Then by implication, you think that
      you are smarter than me, since you
      caught me.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      No. I knew that I'm nor smarter
      than you are.

<b>               LECKTOR
</b>      Then how did you catch me, Will?

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      You had disadvantages.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      What disadvantage?.

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      You're insane.


<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      You're very tan, Will.

Graham does not answer, If anything happens, there is a
tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to
Lecktor.

<b>               LECKTOR
</b>      Your hands are rough. They don't
      look like a cop s hands anymore.
      That shaving lotion is something a
      child would select. It has a ship
      on the bottle, doesn't it?

Another silence. Lecktor's eyes look as if they're drilling
into Graham's head, trying to find out things. Trying to
find a way to hurt Graham. He's very threatening. Then
relaxes:

<b>               LECKTOR
</b>      Don't think you can persuade me with
      appeals to my intellectual vanity.


<b>29.
</b>

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>     I don't think I'll persuade you.
     You'll do it or you won't. Dr.
     Bloom is working an it anyway, and
     he's the best...

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>          (interrupts)
     Do you have the file with you

<b>             GRAHAM
</b>     Yes.

<b>             LECKTOR
</b>     Pictures?

<b>             GRAHAM
</b>     Yes.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>     let me have them,, and I might
     consider it.

<b>             GRAHAM
</b>     No.

<b>             LECKTOR
</b>     Do you dream much, Will?

<b>             GRAHAM
</b>     Good-bye, Dr. Lecktor.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>     You haven't threatened to take away
     my books yet.

Graham gets up and starts to walk away.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>     let me have the file. Then I'll
     tell you what I think.


Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant.
Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding
tray. Lecktor pulls it through.


<b>GRAHAM
</b>sits in the chair. He wants a cigarette. He doesn't take
one. He waits. And he watches. What he sees:






<b>30.
</b>
<b>GRAHAM'S POV: EXTREME CLOSE PAN THROUGH CELL OP
</b><b>DR. LECKTOR
</b>
Toothbrush, mirror, sink, Sryrofoam cups, soft paper jour-
nals, T-shirts, neatly stacked hospital pads, sneakers with-
no shoelaces, the wall, seatless toilet bowl, etc, etc
All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light.
Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal. The
shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes. It is a high
resolution, highly brilliant sec of images. It feels like a
hyper-perception of reality, a super-realism perceived by the
mind of Graham. It is interrupted when:

<b>              LECKTOR (O.S.)
</b>      There is a very shy boy, Will.


<b>GRAHAM
</b>
snaps back to the present, looks at Lecktor.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      What were the yards like?

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      Big backyards, fences, some hedges,
      why?

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      Because, my dear Will, if this
      Pilgrim imagines he has a
      relationship with the full moon,
      he might go outside and look at it.
      Have you seen blood in moonlight,
      Will? It appears quite black. If
      one were nude, it would be better
      to have outdoor privacy for this
      sort of thing.

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      That's interesting.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      It's not 'interesting'. You thought
      of it before.

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      Yes. I'd considered it.

<b>              LECKTOR
</b>      You came here to look at me, Will.
      To get the old scent again, didn't
      you?

<b>              GRAHAM
</b>      I want your opinion.


<b>31.
</b>
<b>                       LECKTOR
</b>          I don't have one right now.

<b>                       GRAHAM
</b>          When you do have one I'd like to
          hear it.

<b>                      LECKTOR
</b>          May I keep the file?

<b>                      GRAHAM
</b>          I haven't decided yet.

<b>                       LECKTOR
</b>          I'll study it, Will. When you get
          more files, I'd like to see them,
          too. You can call me. When I
          have to call my lawyer, they bring
          me a telephone. Would you like to
          give me your home number?

Threat.


<b>                       GRAHAM
</b>          No.

<b>                       LECKTOR
</b>          Do you know how you caught me,
          Will?

<b>                       GRAHAM
</b>          Goodbye, Dr. Lecktor. You can
          leave messages for me at the number
          on the file.

Graham bangs on the door. Locks are starting to be unlocked.
Graham can't wait to get out of here. He wants the locks to
get unlocked faster!

<b>                       LECKTOR
</b>          Do you know how you caught me?

The door is now open. Graham fights down the impulse to run
through. As Graham -- controlled -- steps out, what he hears
is :

<b>                       LECKTOR (O.S.)
</b>          The reason you caught me, Will, is:
          we're just alike. You want the
          scent? Smell yourself.

The DOOR SLAMS shut on Lecktor.

a I4-year-old girl, Mr. Sherman and Mrs. Sherman. A handmade
sign says:   "THE NEW HOUSE - SWIMMING POOL." Mrs. Sherman has
brown hair.  She wears a bikini.   She has a nice body. She's
sensuous and tan in her thirties.  She dives into the pool.
The next shot: water. Out of the water surfaces Mrs.
Sherman. She shakes her head and water sprays off her hair.

A couple drops hit the lens and diffuse a small area of the

and shoves down to hoist herself out. Her breasts are glis-

<b>TRACK ACROSS FRANCIS DOLLARHME'S BACK

where the fabric stretches between his shoulder blades and
past his cheap haircut's line at the nape of his neck into
his left shoulder to reveal he's reading the National Tattler.
It's about Will Graham with a Freddie Lounds byline. The
only words we catch are: "FBI Manhunter Consults Fiend Who
Tried To Kill Him, by Freddie Lounds." We also catch: "The

It's the one Lounds took after Graham was slashed by Lecktor.
It's a black-and-white square image of a sleeping man with a
myriad of tubes running into his stomach and a temporary
colostomy bag. A black square is imposed over his genitals.
The caption reads: "Federal Manhunter Will Graham Recover-

He photographs its placement with the camera on his belt,

it to put the can in an evidence bag. Graham climbs higher

goes for now.

</b>I wouldn't presume to try.

<b>                CRAWFORD
</b>You're never alone in a room with
Graham, are you? You're smooth
about it, but you're never one-on-
one with him. Why's that? Do you
think he's psychic?

<b>                BLOOM
</b>He's an eideteker. He has almost
total recall.   But I don't think
he's psychic.   What he has it empathy
and projection  He can assume your
point of view and mine.., and some
other points of view that scare and
sicken him.


<b>                CRAWFORD
</b>Why aren't you ever alone with him?


<b>                BLOOM
</b>Because I'm professionally
concerned about him. And he'd
pick up on that. He's fast. He
hates being prodded and poked.

his life? Or would he hesitate?

<b>                BLOOM
</b>      I'll tell you the events. The
      psychology's none of your business.
      Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven-
      year-old daughter's throat. Graham
      shot him with his .38 six times.
      Hobbs still didn't go down. He had
      to wade in...

<b>               CRAWFORD
</b>      That's when it happened?

<b>                BLOOM
</b>      No. It happened when Graham went
      to see Hobbs' daughter four months
      later in the hospital. She saved
      her carotid artery.., but lost
      three fingers and her larynx. She
      was connected up to a voice box.
      When Graham went to see her, she
      asked him -- through the speaker:
      'Why did you have to kill my
      daddy? '
           (beat)
      That's when Graham had his nervous
      breakdown.

<b>               CRAWFORD
</b>      What's the bottom line?

<b>                BLOOM
</b>      If he pushes too deep into our boy's
      mind-set, he may destroy himself.
           (beat)
      What are you planning, Jack?

<b>                CRAWFORD
</b>      Could he handle a direct contact?

<b>               BLOOM
</b>      I don't recommend it.

<b>                GRAHAM (O.S.)
</b>      You don't recommend what, Sidney?

Crawford is surprised at Graham's entry. Bloom isn't.

<b>                BLOOM
</b>      Crawford has a proposition. I
      don't think it's a good idea.

<b>                GRAHAM
</b>      If the Tooth Fairy listens to

<b>STILL PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV THROUGH CAMERA: GRAHAM + LOUNDS
</b>
Lounds lays Graham's arm over his own shoulder and mugs :or
the camera. Behind him is the flood-lit Capitol dome and
the sign of a motel across the street.


<b>                GRAHAM
</b>       Keep the motel sign across the
       street just slightly out of focus.
       He has to be able to read it, but
       it can't look too obvious.


Lounds barks orders to the still photographer and splits.
The photographer starts breaking down his gear. Crawford
takes Graham aside.

His muscular frame bears the full body tattoo of William

Graham and Molly are sitting at the kitchen table over cups
of coffee. It's dark. Graham is looking down into the Formica.
He and Molly say nothing for a long time. Then:

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      Can I have one of your cigarettes?

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>           (surprised)
      You haven't smoked in two years.

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      I'd like one of your cigarettes,
      please.

Graham gives her one. Molly lights up. She picks a piece or
tobacco from her lips. She's trying to control fear.

</b>      Have you ever omitted telling me.

      It felt dirty to not tell you.

</b>      No.

</b>      And... where are things?

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Where we're at is nowhere. We have
      nothing. We're running out of time.

There is a long pause. Molly suspects:

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      What will you do?

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      I have to go back to Birmingham.

</b>      Is Crawford going with you?

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      No. I have to be. in there...       
      alone. Maybe there's something for
      me if I know how he feels and thinks.

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      William: you are going to make
      yourself Sick or get yourself killed.

Graham says nothing.

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      Kevin and I have lived through... with
      Kevin's father... once before... and
      we can't...

She can't finish. There's a pause. Then: She looks at him.

He shakes his head and locks away from her, wondering about
himself:

           (pause)
      … I love you. And I'm not really
      going to be fit to be with for
      awhile...


They are both frozen: in the same room but very separate.
Molly's eyes are moist. She gets up and leaves. Graham
sits at the kitchen table by himself, both hands around
his mug of coffee. Slowly, deliberately, he picks up the
mug to take a sip. Then he sits alone in the kitchen.

      I want to know if you're smiling
      or frowning. I want to know if I
      should just shut up or not...

There's a smile on her face. Now her hand moves up towards
Dollarhyde's mouth with the Z-plast scars where his harelip
and cleft palate were fixed.

hand feels the roughness of the pads. She presses and the
claw slides cut. Both her hands go up his leg to the heavy
supple muscles of his shoulder.


<b>TIGER'S HEAD

Reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands
feel the width of his head.

The hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the
hairs on her forearms.

It rests on the face of the crimson dragon. When she is asleep

<b>101.

<b>               DOLLARHYDE
</b>      Yes, are you okay...?!

<b>               REBA (O.S.)
</b>      I'm fine.


<b>REBA
</b>
In her cotton dress. The prairie wind blows her hair and
presses the thin cotton against her body in the overgrown
weeds and wildflowers of Dollarhyde's backyard.


<b>DOLLARHYDE
</b>
nears her, towers above her. He touches her face. Reba folds
into his arms and lays her head on his hard chest. His heart
is going fast. He doesn't believe this fine thing is happen-
ing to him and that she's okay.

<b>               REBA
</b>      Good morning...
           (kisses his cheek)
      If you show me where things are,
      I'll make us some coffee...

<b>               DOLLARHYDE
</b>      No! Don't go back into the house...
          (to Reba's quizzical
           reaction)
           it's too nice outside.

<b>               REBA
</b>      My sister's coming by to pick me up
      for brunch. Why don't you come, too?

<b>               DOLLARHYDE
</b>      I have work to do at the plant.

<b>               REBA
</b>      I'll get my purse.

<b>               DOLLARHYDE
</b>      I'll get it.

</b>

He's heavy-set and sullen. Dollarhyde's van, with Reba, pulls
in.







<b>102.
</b>
<b>                DOLLARHYDE
</b>      Do you want a Coke or something, Reba?

<b>               REBA
</b>      I'm fine, Francis.

Dollarhyde gets out.

<b>                DOLLARHYDE
</b>      Fill it up and check the oil, please.

Dollarhyde crosses to the men's room. After placing the
nozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood,
draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout
into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he
starts to move around the van he sees something in the
interior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't
know what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He
wipes and wipes the same spot.


<b>REBA'S
</b>
dress is just above her knees. She sits on the high seat.
Her legs are crossed. Her white cane lays between the seats.
From his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can
look up her dress. He bends down a little to see better...


<b>MEN'S ROOM DOOR
</b>
Nothing. Then Dollarhyde ENTERS. He crumples a paper rowel
and throws it in the basket. Dollarhyde crosses around the
backside of the van.


<b>DRIVER'S WINDOW
</b>
Dollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on
the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing...


<b>ATTENDANT
</b>
unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same
spot in front of Reba.


<b>DOLLARHYDE
</b>

is coming around the van. Fast.

<b>               DOLLARHYDE
</b>      You sonofabitch...









<b>103.

<b>               ATTENDANT
</b>           (cocky)
      You don't like it? You know what
      you can do about it...

Attendant starts away. Dollarhyde catches him and shoves him
into and through a display of STP. The Attendant bounces once
and slams into the station wall. CANS CRASH and roll away...
Dollarhyde does know what he can do about it.


<b>REBA'S FACE
</b>
through the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to
roll down the window.


<b>ATTENDANT
</b>
is white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has
never seen before, anywhere.


<b>DOLLARHYDE
</b>
pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He
advances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end
of the spout.


<b>ATTENDANT
</b>
is wide-eyed. Dollarhyde's big hand ENTERS and flattens the
man into the wall, compressing his thorax.

<b>               DOLLARHYDE
</b>      I ought to jam this in your chest,
      and drain your heart...

The Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk.
Dollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face. He hesitates. Then
he throws money at the Attendant and leaves...

</b>      When are you coming back?

<b>               GRAHAM

Graham hangs up the phone. He looks out the window at the
rain. He dials again.

<b>                GRAHAM
</b>      It's Will Graham. Is Molly there,
      Mr. Swenson?

<b>               GRAMPA (V.0.)

Graham hangs up. He dials again.

<b>               GPAHAM

<b>               LECXTOR
</b>      I wanted to congratulate you for the
      job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired
      it enormously. What a cunning boy
      you are. Will.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      What do you want?

<b>               LECKTOR
</b>      You know Lounds's enlightened me on
      one thing: your confinement in the

      have brought that our in court.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      I'm worn out with you crazy sons-of-

      say, Lecktor, say it.









<b>106.
</b>
<b>               LECKTOR
</b>      I want to help you, Will. You'd be
      more comfortable if you relaxed with
      yourself. We don't invent our
      natures, They're issued to us.
      Along with our lungs and pancreas
      and everything else. Why fight it?

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Fight what?

<b>               LECKTOR
</b>      When you were so depressed after
      you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to
      death, it wasn't the act that got
      you down. Didn't you really feel
      so bad because killing him felt so
      good?
           (ironic)
      And why shouldn't it feel good?! It
      must feel good to God. God does it
      all the time!

Graham laughs. Then he starts to listen closely. There is
something here for him:

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      I don't believe in God.

<b>               LECKTOR
</b>      You should, Will. God's terrific!
           (beat)
      He dropped a church roof on thirty-
      four of His worshippers in Texas last
      Wednesday night. Just as they were
      grovelling to Him and singing a hymn.
      Don't you think that felt good?
           (beat)
      He wouldn't begrudge you two measly
      murders.

<b>               GRAHAM 
</b>      Why does it feel good?

<b>               LECKTOR
</b>      It feels good because: if you do as
      God does, enough times, you become
      as God is: powerful...

Will Graham thinks about this.

<b>               LECKTOR
</b>           (fading)
      God's a champ! He got a hundred and
      sixty Philippines in one plane crash
      two months ago... Remember the big
      earthquake in Italy last spring...?







<b>107.
</b>
Lecktor's voice fades as Will Graham hangs us on him. Graham
sits on the crumpled bed and stares out the window at the rain..

<b>                            CUT TO:
</b>

<b>INT. LEEDS HOUSE - GRAHAM - DAY
</b>
stands in the kitchen. His raincoat and rainhat drip water
onto the floor. The house no longer is a crime scene. It's
been cleaned up. It is absolutely naked. Shades are drawn.
Slashes of light hit the floor. Graham stands there. Then
he walks forward...


<b>STAIRCASE - GRAHAM'S FEET UP TIIE STAIRS
</b>
<b>                GRAHAM (O.S.)
</b>      I enter. The glass cutter. I lick
      the suction cup. The piece of glass
      I take out is mine. House is mine .
           (beat)
      I walk up these stairs. I pass
      childrens' toys. The children mean
      nothing to me...

The toys appear on the stairs as Graham's feet continue
moving up the stairs to the second-floor landing.


<b>GRAHAM'S POV: APPROACHING LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM DOOR
</b>
<b>                GRAHAM (O.S.)
</b>      I am soundless. I move to the door.
      I step into the room...


<b>INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM: THE DOOR
</b>
It opens. Graham enters.   The room is white. We don't see
the bed. Graham stands there in profile. Beyond Graham OUT
OF FOCUS the wall starts to discolor. Pieces of plaster
start to fall. The room starts to disintegrate around Graham.
We will see what Graham sees in his mind.

<b>                CRAHAM
</b>      I see you there. I breathe in the
      perfume of this room. I am in the
      inner sanctum of a life. You will
      accept me. Take me into you.


<b>GRAHAM'S POV: THE BED
</b>

The ceiling and walls decomposing. Nothing falls on the bed.
Mr. Charles Leeds sleeps with his arm under Mrs. Leeds' pillow.







<b>108.
</b>
Mrs. Leeds is on her side. Slowly she starts to rise. She
sees the figure in front of her and her mouth opens to scream.
A silent shot shoves her back to the headboard. Red blood
starts to stain her nightgown as she holds the wound. We
FLOAT CLOSER. In SLOW MOTION Mr. Leeds starts to rise.
Something massive and silver flashes through the FRAME. He Is
gone. Mirrors explode. Mrs. Leeds was looking at her hand
covered with blood. Now Mrs. Leeds looks up at us. Her face
turns into a smile. Her eyes are silver. A silver light
emanates from her mouth. She smiles at us. She wants us. She
really wants us. Her hand gestures us closer. As we MOVE
CLOSER we hear:

<b>                GRAHAM (O.S.)
</b>      You will be better than anything...
      anything I have ever known. As I
      see me in your eyes.., as I see me
      accepted there. Reflected there in
      mirrors .
           (beat)
      And you, you are the fuel for my
      changing... as this event becomes
      one more step towards what I am
      becoming that is different than what
      I have ever been before...
           (beat)
      As I see me, accepted by you, in the
      silver mirrors of your eyes...

In the silver mirrors of her eyes, Graham sees reflected
there: himself.


<b>INT. LEEDS LIVING ROOM - WIDE
</b>
It is empty. The bare floorboards, a dynamic perspective of
lines, go nowhere. O.S. Graham's scream reverberates in the
empty house.
<b>                            CUT TO:

It is pitch-black. In the green safe light we make our the
rollers and pulleys carrying film through the vats of D76
developer and fixer. It is mechanized. There is no one
to maintain it. Distantly on the floor in a far corner we
perceive the shape of a man and reddish glow. The CAMERA
STARTS MOVING towards the shape on the floor. As we get
closer we realize it's Dollarhyde. Something is wrong with
him. ..

<b>               RED DRAGON (O.S.)

</b>
<b>               DOLLARHYDE
</b>      No!

By now we're close to his body curled up on the floor in the
sanctuary of the developing room. The red glow emanates
from beneath Dollarhyde's shirt.

<b>               RED DRAGON (O.S.)

He stands.

</b><b>      YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS!
</b><b>      YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH!

</b>
He starts throwing bottles of chemicals across the room.
They form a moire pattern of colors on walls. Some splash
on him and make his shirt smoke.


<b>PHONE
</b>
Dollarhyde's unsteady hand takes it off the wall. Be pours
sweat. If the acid that makes his shirt smoke burns him,
he doesn't acknowledge it. He punches four numbers.

We see what Dollarhyde imagines: Dandridge's fingers caress
the soft skin of Reba's face. Reba's expression and mouth
are open and warm to him.

ing past the hedges. An arm shoots out and turns Dandridge.
Dollarhyde's hand clutches the whole of Dandridge's lower
face from underneath his jaw. He starts crushing Dandridge's
face. THREE soft POPS are from Dollarhyde's nine millimeter.
He shot Dandridge three times in the heart.

</b>      That's why the boltcutter.

<b>                GRAHAM
</b>      He used a boltcutter to trim the

      was watching from the woods. Why
      didn't he use it to go through the

<b>                CRAWFORD
</b>      Because a steel door and deadbolt
      were there when they were killed.

</b>      He had to.


Graham rifles through the files and comes up with the autopsy
report on Donald Jacobi.


<b>                GRAHAM
</b>      Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday
      party was April fourteenth.
      Sometime between April fourteenth
      and May third they changed the

      But you can't see either family's
      door from the street. He wouldn't
      know until he got to the house that

He freezes the Jacobi tape and loads and plays the Leeds
tape :

Leeds enters and pets him.

Crawford is staring at Graham strangely. This is why
Crawford drafted him. But Crawford doesn't look like he
wants to be alone in the same room with Graham anymore...

      Three! There's an access road to
      the back of the house. That ought
      to be a second team's approach.
      Will Graham and I are in an orchard
      due west of the house.

<b>                GRAHAM
</b>      How far away's the back-up?

<b>               CRAWFORD
</b>      Three minutes.

Graham gestures Crawford to a position with a front 3/4 view
of the house.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      I'll cover the back.

<b>               CRAWFORD
</b>      Stay in the trees.


As we TRACK with Graham through the trees towards the back,
beyond him we see the side yard and the side windows moving
past. The windows are large. At the back -- like a ramp --
are two storm cellar doors.

in the dark shadows of the trees. He seems to float: through
the branches and slows and settles quietly. Then the ex-
pression on Will Graham's face starts to change...


<b>GRAHAM'S POV: KITCHEN WINDOW
</b>
Shadows. A light comes on. Then the figure of Reba is
swung out of a corner past the window...


<b>               GRAHAM
</b>           (resigned whisper
           into radio)
      There's somebody in the house, Jack…

<b>                CRAWFORD (O.S.)

      Wait for the back-up! Will?

<b>                GRAHAM
</b>          (whispers in radio)
      It's happening again, Jack...

<b>                            CUT TO:

<b>INT. DOLLARHYDE'S KITCHEN - DOLLARHYDE + REBA - NIGHT
</b>
On the right we see Dollarhyde's right arm with the aluminum
shafts... Beyond them, THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Graham has
stepped out from the tree line. He stands on the grass.
He looks helpless. His gun hangs idly at his side.


<b>CLOSE: GRAHAM
</b>
It's his worst nightmare. About what he's seeing:

<b>                GRAHAM
</b>          (low)
      ... stop it.


<b>INT. DOLLARHME'S KITCHEN - DOLLARHYDE + BEYOND HIM 007 THE
</b><b>WINDOW: GRAHAM
</b>
We and Graham see Dollarhyde's arm arc back for an uppercutting
thrust into Reba. Dollarhyde's left hand clutching her dress,
raises her two feet up the wall. And now Graham starts running
forward. And his face is distorted and he's shouting:


<b>                GRAHAM
</b>           (roars)
<b>      STOP IT!!!
</b>
Dollarhyde turns to the window in time to see:




<b>128.
</b>

<b>WINDOW + GRAHAM
</b>-- his arms across his face and his body angled sideways
-- CRASHES through the glass.


<b>DOLLARHYDE
</b>
catching Graham's momentum -- throws him across the room.

<b>GRAHAM
</b>
CRASHES off the fridge which opens and spills and hits the
floor as...

<b>DOLLARHYDE
</b>
ROARS and grabs his 9mm from the kitchen table.


<b>GRAHAM'S FACE
</b>
is lacerated from the glass. He sees his own blood on the
floor. He struggles to rise. The first thing up is the
big bore of the .44. It FIRES as if it had its own mind.


<b>DOLLARHYDE'S
</b>
left shoulder EXPLODES.


<b>GRAHAM
</b>
bleeding, brings the .44 down from the recoil of the first shot.
Now, up on one knee, he FIRES FOUR more rounds into Dollarhyde.



<b>OVERHEAD: THE KITCHEN FLOOR
</b>

Graham stands and walks to Dollarhyde. Reba is collapsed in
the corner. Dollarhyde it more exploded from within than
shot. Graham starts to raise the gun...

As we PULL BACK and see arriving squad car flashers play on
the walls and Crawford runs through the foreground, we see

pulling away comes the final FLASH + REPORT and...

We will only see the rear of Will Graham sitting alone on the
side of the bed in the alienating motel room. His head is
bandaged.


<b>               GRAHAM
</b>          (into phone)
      Hello.


<b>INTERCUT WITH:

</b>

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      I was out in the garden. Mama came
      out and told me when she saw it on
      TV. Why didn't you call me?

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Mama was probably asleep.

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      Will? Are you okay?

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Not too bad. I'll be here a few
      days longer.
           (beat)
      I want to see you.

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      I want to see you, too.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Today's Wednesday. By Friday I
      ought to...

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      Mama has all Kevin's uncles and
      aunts coming down from Cheyenne
      next week and...

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Come home with me.

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      Will, they never get to see Kevin
      and a few more days...

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      What's this Mama shit?

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      It's what Kevin called her when he
      was little...





<b>130.
</b>
<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      What's the problem, Molly?

<b>               MOLLY
</b>           (pause)
      I came up here after Kevin's father
      died .
           (beat)
      They were very supportive and
      helped me adjust. I got myself
      together. I've gotten myself
      together now, too.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Small difference: I'm not dead,
      yet .

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      Will?
          (no response)
      You could come up here.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      They don't want me up there. Every
      time they look at me I remind them...
      If they thought about it, they'd
      want you. Bur all they really want's
      the boy. And they'll take you.
      But they don't want to see me...

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      That's not true.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Okay. They're full of shit and
      they make me sick...

Then no one says anything.

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      Maybe we should give it some time...

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Yeah. That's great. A little
      time.
           (beat
      I tell you what, buckaroo...
           (beat)
      See you around.


Graham slams down the phone. Still half-immersed in a
psychotic landscape of the mind, Graham's psyche resonates
with echoes of Dollarhyde. Now he gets up and walks out of
the room leaving the door open. Outside is only the deserted
parking lot.

<b>INT. TAXI (TULSA, OKLAHOMA) - PASSENGER'S POV OF DRIVER - NIGHT

It's raining The DRIVER moves slowly down a residential
street looking for an address. He squints...

</b>      Twenty-three twenty-six..- Twenty-
      three twenty-eight. Here you go.
<b>

<b>INT. HOUSE - WIDE ANGLE - NIGHT
</b>

It's open plan. The dining area and kitchen are raised.
The Sherman family are engaged in 7:00 PM suburban family
chaos: GEORGE SHERMAN is trying to watch the news. He
hollers up the stairs for his daughter to turn down her
stereo. His 11-year-old son, FRED, at the dining room
table is supposed to be doing homework. Instead he rolls
up balls of paper and does jump shots from his chair into
the wastepaper can,

<b>                SHERMAN
</b>            (to son)
      Cut out the basketball and go back
      to the algebra,

George Sherman goes back to NBC news. The DOORBELL RINGS.
Thirteen-year-old TINA SHERMAN comes down the stairs.

<b>               TINA
</b>      I'll get it.


<b>DOOR
</b>
Tina opens it.

<b>TINA
</b>
screams.

<b>GEORGE SHEBMAN
</b>
runs to the door. In a WIDER SHOT, we see there is a sho-
gun resting inside the door jamb. It's within reach or
Sherman's hand. We see why Tina Sherman screamed:





<b>132.
</b>

<b>WILL GRAHAM'S FACE
</b>
is pulled down slightly on the left side, making his left
eye moon-shaped. There is a half-healed wound and butter-
fly bandage where Dollarhyde stabbed him. He is standing
in a black raincoat with a black hat.


<b>               SHERMAN
</b>      What do you want?

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      Are you George Sherman?

<b>               SHERMAN
</b>      Yes. Who are you?

<b>                GRAHAEI

            who he is)
      Oh, Jesus... Come in.
           (to wife)
      Honey...!


His wife starts to come forward.


<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      No, that's okay...
           (pause)
      How are you?

There's a searching look on Graham's face. Totally strange.


<b>                SHERMAN
</b>      We're fine. Fine. We're all well.
      We're okay!
           (beat)
      That man, Crawford, called and...
      told me...

      ... how 'bout a drink? Coffee or
      something?

<b>                GRAHAM

           (beat)
      ... stop by and...

<b>                SHERMAN
</b>      I can't thank you enough, I..,

Graham shakes his head. He doesn't want to be thanked.
No one knows what to say. Graham looks at them:




<b>133.
</b><b>SHERMAN FAMILY
</b>standing in awkward places. They ate nothing special. They
are normal human beings living their lives. To Graham they
are very special: they are alive.


<b>                GRAHAM
</b>      I just wanted to stop by and... see
      you... I guess. That's all.


Graham stands there as if engraving each one in his memory.
Then he nods. Then he leaves.


<b>GEORGE SHERMAN
</b>
closes the door. There's an awkward look on his face. He
didn't get to say what he wanted to say to Graham.

<b>GRAHAM

stands as she comes near him. The aqua highlights of the
water eat into their figures as they look at each other.
Molly touches the wounded side of his face. Then:

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      Let's forget who said what to whom...

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      You got a deal...

Graham takes Molly's hand.

Molly and Graham walk to the water's edge and look out to sea.
The highlights burn out sections of the two people.

<b>               MOLLY
</b>      So how'd we do...?

Graham looks at her. He touches the side of her cheek and
her hair. She pushes against his hand with her face to make
closer contact.

<b>               GRAHAM
</b>      We did okay.
           (beat)
      Most of them made it...


<b>REARSHOT: GRAHAM + MOLLY
</b>
Graham -- in the sunbleached violet shorts -- lays an arm
across Molly's shoulder. Molly's arm moves around Graham's
waist. They look out to sea. In front of them, the surf
kicks up drops of spray which take light and become brilliant
atoms.
