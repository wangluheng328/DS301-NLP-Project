                              <u>LEVIATHAN</u>



                            Screenplay by


                          David Webb Peoples

                                 and

                              Jeb Stuart










                                           Revised Draft

                                           September 8, 1987










<b>     FACE IN ON
</b>
<b>     THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
</b>
     sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER

     Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers
     of fish and marine life...

     A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current,
     their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison.
     Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the
     school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the
     shadows.  The school moves on as if nothing happened,
     quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only
     seconds before.

<b>     WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER
</b>
     Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us.  Cold and lifeless
     where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten
     thousand.  Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating
     echoniderms move eerily through the currents.  Then suddenly
     WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION.  THEN VOICES...

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Burritos...Enchiladas...

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                                (hispanic voice)
                   Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that
                   stuff?...

<b>                                BOWMAN
</b>                                (female)
                   I can't wait for fresh vegetables...

     Several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?"
     "shit," "burgers"...Suddenly another voice rises above the
     others.

<b>                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
</b>                   Okay, cut the chatter.  You're
                   not out of here, yet.  Who's the
                   hook?  Seven?...You got a hook on
                   container 22?

     A pause, then more voices.

<b>                                SIXPACK'S VOICE/ RADIO
</b>                                (redneck drawl)
                   The man's asking if you're hooked
                   on 22, you dumb shit.

<b>                                JONES' VOICE/ RADIO
</b>                   Watch your mouth, Sixpack.  Hello,
                   Shack, Seven, here.  I ain't the hook,
                   over.

     A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an
     IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal
     nearly seven feet tall.  It is a motorized diving suit and
     we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front
     breastplate.  As it pivots we see the stationary worklights
     around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE
     SHACK.  Then a woman's voice.

<b>                                WILLIE'S VOICE
</b>                                (woman's voice)
                   Six to Shack.  I'm the hook.

<b>     INSIDE THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM
</b>
     littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion
     of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at
     the monitor controls.  He is younger than we expected,
     twenties, clean cut good looks.  He'll be a hell of a good-
     looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened.
     From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his
     way.

<b>                                BECK'S VOICE/ RADIO
</b>                   Okay, Six, let's wrap this container
                   and call it a day.

     Above him a bank of monitor screens.  Each one labeled with
     a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a
     camera mounted on their helmet.  Beck reaches above him and
     throws a console switch which activates another monitor
     labeled ROV.  With a joystick he manipulates an outside
     camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor.  It is
     moving.

<b>     UNDERWATER
</b>
     WILLIE'S POV  The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED
     gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature,
     atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure.

     She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes
     the tool attached to the end of her arm.  The move is
     practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on
     a set of egg beaters.  First, she inserts the existing tool
     into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she
     disengages the tool.  Next, she selects the next tool from
     the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into
     position.  Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.

<b>                                SIXPACK'S VOICE
</b>                   Hey, Willie, you trip on a
                   tit or something?  We're all
                   waiting on you, honey.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                                (under control)
                   Keep your pants on Sixpack.
                   I promise you'll be inside before
                   "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood" comes on.

     OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing.  They
     like Willie and cheer her on.  "Tell him, Willie," "Atta
     girl," etc...

     Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns.  Expertly she
     hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what
     looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER
     TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the
     massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in
     by a winch.

<b>                                WILLIE'S VOICE
</b>                   Six to Shack...Hook's on.  Ready
                   to winch.

<b>     UNDERWATER MACHINERY
</b>
     Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and
     dumpsters squatting in the gloom.  A winch begins grinding
     and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks.
     It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with
     several others to complete a set.  We hear BECK'S VOICE.

<b>                                BECK/ RADIO
</b>                   Ok, that's it.  Come on in.

     More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights
     glaring.  Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights:
<b>     COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE.
</b>
     As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will
     transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human
     life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the
     building; stickers and signs:  "No Bozos," etc.  A formal sign
     towers over the entrance.  It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6.

<b>     ON ONE OF THE CREW
</b>
     He moves behind the others.  Suddenly he freezes in his
     tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the
     glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA
     SPIDER.  It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm.

     Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical
     motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick
     movement, snares it.

     CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET.  The latch opens and the
     writhing sea spider is shoved inside.  From the pocket WE
     MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on
     the breastplate.  He looks around to see if anyone has
     noticed then continues on toward the shack.

<b>     ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS)
</b>
     They walk together to the Shack.  A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS,
     comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an
     exaggerated accent.

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                   When it's time to relax....
                   One thing stands clear...

<b>     INSIDE ON BECK
</b>
     As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see
     he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated
     by age and rank.  He is the shack boss, management.  He
     listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key.

<b>                                JONES' VOICE(O.C.)
</b>                   Mil-ler's tastes too good to
                   hurry through...

     As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair
     in front of a bank of equipment monitors.  The vital signs
     of each miner and his equipment are registered on this
     console.  The chair in front of them sits conspicuously
     empty.  This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand
     written sign under the console which states:  THE DOCTOR IS
     <u>OUT</u>.

<b>     DEJESUS' POV
</b>
     Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring
     vital signs.

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                   ...beer after beer...

     Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom
     corner inside DeJesus' helmet.  The words to the song freeze
     in his mouth.  His voice becomes edged with panic.

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   Oh, shit...

<b>                                JONES/ RADIO
</b>                                (to DeJesus)
                   Hey, Hazy, I'm not that bad, man.

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                                (rising terror)
                   Jonesy!  I'm losing compression...
                   I'm going to blow my suit, man!
                   Beck!  Doc!  Help me!...

<b>     INSIDE
</b>
     Beck grabs his microphone.  He tries to remain calm but
     there is a definite tremble in his voice.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Give me a readout, DeJesus.

<b>                                DEJESUS(ON RADIO)
</b>                                (gripped with panic)
                   Ahhhh!

<b>     OUTSIDE
</b>
     The other divers move quickly to DeJesus.

     DeJesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion.  "15, 14,

     last few yards to the SHACK.

     and suddenly, DeJesus' gauges jump to life.  We see the same
     countdown in progress on the Shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8...

     ON DEJESUS  He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater
     elevator room is eerily lit.  His readout continues inside
     his helmet...5, 4, 3...DeJesus screams.

<b>     ON BECK
</b>
     DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room.
     Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens.  He hits it
     again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by
     the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator.  It's moving!
     Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock.

<b>     INSIDE/LIFT LOCK
</b>
     WE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet.  It stands inside the
     Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water.

     CLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then
     suddenly they flutter.  He's alive!

<b>     THE MESS - LATER
</b>
     The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess
     features neatly stenciled letters that say:  "DAYS TILL
     PICKUP".  The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board
     obviously changes daily.  Right now, it's a "3"...

     A CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE
     MACHINE.  A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft
     drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he
     looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners:  JONES,
     Black, athletic, 30's;  COBB, 50's, a career miner with a
     mouthful of gum;  BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she
     has seen more of the world than any of them;  WILLIE,
     twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist.
     DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still
     shaken from his experience.

     The strain of a month of working two miles beneath the
     ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight.

                   have done to stop it, huh?

     Sixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the
     empty Coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a
     huge belch.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   That would have been you, DeJesus...

     DeJesus keeps his head down.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                   Yeah...I was standing next to a guy
                   who blew a suit once in the
                   Indian Ocean...little tiny hole
                   in the fucking toe of his suit
                   ...ocean came in and the
                   pressure crammed his whole
                   fucking body up into his helmet.

     DeJesus springs for Sixpack's throat AS WE CUT TO

     Beck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks.

                   like this tear us apart...

     Beck glares, ready for an argument, but as WE PULL BACK we
     see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters.

     Apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard
     look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Shit...

     He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at
     college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking
     father.  Leadership "how-to" books like <u>The One Minute</u>
     <u>Manager</u>, etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on
     underwater mining.

     He opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC
     GROANING NOISE stops him cold.  The entire Shack seems
     shifting, like a giant waking from a nap.

<b>     MESS
</b>
     The NOISE stops the fight between DeJesus and Sixpack cold.
     All eyes go to the ceiling and walls.

</b>                   Fuck the suits man...this

     Just as suddenly as it began the GROANING NOISE STOPS and in
     its place WE HEAR an intermittent RATTLE in the air system.
     Only Cobb seems undisturbed by this sound.

     Beck approaches the Mess and as he nears it we hear Cobb
     ranting inside.

<b>     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME
</b>
     ON BECK  He starts out of the Mess and by chance finds
     himself walking with Willie.  Beck is obviously
     uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together.
     She smiles, friendly, at ease.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   You did good...

</b>                                (a little surprised)
                   What?

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Today...with DeJesus.  That
                   was smart thinking to get him
                   inside...

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   There probably wasn't anything
                   wrong with his suit...

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Still...you did the right thing.

     She turns off toward the Swamp, leaving Beck with the tiny,
     but honest compliment.  He savors it.

<b>     THE SWAMP - LATER
</b>
     The "Swamp" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy
     bilgewater.  The door slides open, Willie enters, and
     switches on a bank of fluorescent lights.  The room is
     spooky even with the lights.  The giant machine suits, we
     saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters.

     Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a
     motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked,
     laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked
     screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the
     control switch and hits the START button.

     NNNNNNNNNN.  A motor moves one of the suits along the track
     toward Willie.  As it turns the corner toward us we see it
     says:  DEJESUS.

<b>     DOC'S OFFICE - SAME
</b>
     Beck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting
     on a fresh shirt.  A man in his 50's, he must have once been
     quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed.

<b>                                DOC
</b>                   I must have dozed off.

     Beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of Old Granddad
     Whiskey.  He picks it up.

                                DOC(cont'd)
                   Snakebite medicine...Never
                   pack my bag without it.

     Beck doesn't smile.  He puts the bottle back down and Doc
     watches him in the mirror.

<b>                                BECK

                   We almost had an accident today.
                   DeJesus' suit...

     The Doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with Beck.

<b>                                DOC
</b>                   You got something to say to me, son?...

     Beck definitely has something to say, but confronted, he
     falters.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   I...I think it's important to
                   have the second officer on deck.

     Doc smiles, and goes back to buttoning his shirt.

<b>                                DOC
</b>                   I'll keep it to nine holes

<b>     THE DORMITORY - SAME
</b>
     Small but functional.  The bunks can be closed-off with a
     privacy door.  Photographs and bumper stickers on the walls
     of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an
     otherwise sterile environment.

     Willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary
     maps;  Sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which
     proclaims:  "I MAY BE FAT, BUT YOU'RE UGLY AND I CAN DIET."
     DeJesus' has posters of the Alps, and the Rockies;  Bowman's
     has clipped pages from "Gourmet" of meals she dreams for;
     Cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he
     is instead of somewhere else.  Inside Jones' bunk is an
     indoor basketball goal.

     Bowman and Sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a
     sponge and pail.  Sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on
     Bowman's chest.

<b>                                SIXPACK

                   Why?  What did ya think I said?

<b>     CORRIDOR "A" - SAME
</b>
     Jones and Cobb are kneeling in a corridor, unfastening a big
     plate on the floor with a power wrench.  Overhead a huge
     plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization
     system.  The interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire
     exposing the throbbing machine floor of the Shack.

     Cobb removes the last bolt and Jones lifts off the
     floorplate exposing the guts of the shack--the BILGE--dark
     and wet.  Without the plate the RATTLE in the air system is
     much louder and sinister.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Listen to it for Christsake.

                   You don't see the Doc opening
                   me up every time I get a new creak
                   in my joints...I say, as long as
                   it's recycling the air let
                   the next shift deal with it.
                   But, 'long as we're here...

     He pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops
     it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs
     down, stopping at the bottom to look up at Jones.  Jones
     seems in no hurry to accompany him.

                                COBB(cont'd)
                   You gonna sit there on your
                   butt or give me a hand?

     Jones reluctantly starts down after him.

<b>     BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME
</b>
     Beck in his quarters.  He seems to be talking to himself but
     as we move around him we see he is talking to a video
     monitor.  On screen we see MARTIN, 30's, a slick
     bureaucratic executive with TransOcean Corp. whose face is
     all we see on the video monitor.

                   in front of the Vice President
                   of District Operations last night...

     Beck stops.  Martin notices his concern.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   You're good executive timber,

                   'Know what I mean?

     He stares hard at Beck, but doesn't wait for an answer.

                                MARTIN(cont'd)
                   The one thing I've learned in

     The boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denver's
     <u>Rocky Mountain High.</u>

     DeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he
     works on the intercom system.  He finishes, closing a metal
     box which says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS.

     computer and is going through the computerized
     checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of
     possible problems.

                   Probably a short.

     Suddenly, the computer pauses on one:  It says:  Electrical
     Short.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Good guess, Williams.

     She types in a "help" command and the computer screen
     displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most
     Electrical Engineers baffled.  Willie hardly bats an eye.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Piece of cake.

     She immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus' suit and
     pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt.  With
     two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces
     the panel.  Finished, Willie presses the control switch and
     the suits begin to move along the track.  A new suit rounds
     the corner toward us.  It says SIXPACK.

<b>     THE BILGE - SAME

     The walls are dark and moist.  Water drips from the pipes.
     The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans
     over and hands Cobb another tool.  Crouched in the humming
     machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy
     hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones.

     directly in front of Willie.  She reaches up to open the
     pocket latch when she stops...listening.  THE NOISE IN THE
<b>     AIR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED.

<b>     THE BILGE - SAME

     Jones looks incredulously at Cobb.  He can't believe that's

     In the gloomy silence, Willie reaches for the hinged pocket
     in the waist of Sixpack's suit.  Some water drips out.  She
     pushes the spring a second time.  The pocket opens.
     Nothing.

     backs away and it drops into the water at her feet.

     watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings
     the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS
     skewering it.  She presses the intercom button and lifts the
     skewered sea spider out of the water.

</b>                                (reading)
                   "Major development in
                   South Indian Ocean set for
                   fall of 2010..."
                                (to Willie)
                   That sounds interesting, but they're
                   too tied to their holdings.  Remember
                   a year ago when they lost that tanker?...
                   The bottom fell out of their stock and
                   I lost a bloody fortune.  That's
                   when I decided to diversify.

     Willie looks at Bowman a moment, then keeps exercising.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   You take your money, too
                   seriously, Bo.

</b>                                (sharply)
                   You're damn right I do.  Five
                   years down here and I'll pull
                   in more than 15 topside.  I'm not
                   down here for the fun, I'll tell
                   you that.

</b>                   "Fun?"  Somebody talking fun?

     They look up to see Sixpack at the door to the Mess wearing
     only a robe.  With a leer he stares at Willie exercising.

                                SIXPACK(cont'd)
                                (saccharine sweet)
                   Hey, Willie, honey...Sorry about that
                   little incident tonight...Everyone's
                   been so tight lately, I thought
                   a little humor'd loosen us all up,
                   you know?

     Willie doesn't bite, she looks hard at Sixpack.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Get out of here, Sixpack.

     Sixpack smirks.  He waves a copy of Penthouse opened to the
     Pet of the Month and sings cheerfully.

<b>                                SIXPACK

                   I got a date with an angel...

     CLANK, BANK, CLUNK.  A coke can tumbles noisily from the
     Coke machine.  Jones retrieves two cans of Coke and comes
     out of the Galley with a snack.  He stops in front of
     Bowman and the computer.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Hey, Bo...when're you going to
                   be off that thing?  I want to
                   find out tonight's NBA scores
                   and check the weather.

                                 the screen, answers him)
                   The weather's good, I already
                   checked, but I'll be off in a minute.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                                (to Jones)
                   Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power
                   forward in the NBA...Jameson?

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Jameson?  Who're you trying to
                   con?

     They grin at each other--a standing joke and Jones leaves.

<b>     DORMITORY
</b>
     Jones enters the Dorm with his snack and tosses a can of
     Coke across the room to DeJesus.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Hey, Hazy!  We got a day off
                   tomorrow, Kemosabi!  Let's get
                   shit-faced!

     DEJESUS catches the can and pops the top sending a shower of
     carbonation all over Cobb under the sunlamp.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   How about you, brother Cobb?
                   Little Wild Turkey?

     Cobb wipes the Coke from his sunglasses and shakes his head.

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                   No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker,
                   from way back.  Ain't that right
                   Cobbie?

     Jones and DeJesus laugh and take long pulls on their Cokes.
     Cobb turns and watches them.  This is obviously a nightly
     ritual.

<b>                                COBB

                   What game, Cobb?...I'm on
                   my way to Nirvana...

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                                (laughing)
                   I'm on the way to the looney
                   bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude
                   sun bathing in his clothes.

<b>     INT. SIXPACK'S BUNK - SAME
</b>
     CLOSE ON  The Pet of the Month as she smirks coyly from the
     centerfold, her body twisted into an awkward position
     representing mad desire.

     Sixpack closes his privacy door then smirks back at the
     photo.

<b>                                SIXPACK
</b>                   Oh, Darlin'...come sit on
                   my face...

     He stirs in the bed and adjusts his pillow and SCREAMS!  The
     SEA SPIDER is suddenly right there on his shoulder, dead.

     Sixpack sits bolt upright in his bunk and slams his head
     against the roof of the bunk, then stumbles out screaming.
     He hits the floor and rams his foot into a table and screams
     in more pain.

     The whole dorm looks up amazed, Cobb takes off his
     sunglasses, even Jones and DeJesus temporarily "sober up" to
     stare.

<b>                                SIXPACK
</b>                   That bitch!

<b>     MESS
</b>
     Sixpack storms into the Mess with the dead Sea Spider.  He
     points angrily at his bleeding foot.  Jones and DeJesus move
     up to watch.

<b>                                SIXPACK
</b>                                (moving into room)

                   little humor would loosen us all
                   up...you know?...

     Everyone laughs, but Sixpack.  He has revenge in his eyes.
     He holds out the ugly, limp creature and advances toward
     Willie.

<b>                                SIXPACK
</b>                   You think you're so funny?
                   Wait till you taste this!

     As he pushes the dead creature into her face BECK'S VOICE
     behind him makes him freeze.

<b>                                BECK'S VOICE(O.S.)
</b>                   That's enough!

     Everybody turns to see Beck standing in the doorway.

                   day...Anymore shit and its a full

<b>     CLOSE ON BLACKBOARD/ MESS - MORNING
</b>
     SCREECH!  Chalk on the blackboard as Bowman writes "2" in
     place of yesterday's "3" over the neatly lettered words
     "Days Till Pickup."

     Jones, sitting next to Cobb, looks up from his tray of
     cereal and holds his head in mock misery.

<b>                                JONES

     of Cobb.

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                   Oooooh.

     Cobb looks from one man to the other, realizing what they're
     doing.

<b>                                COBB
</b>                   You know it's really crazy to

                   fucking insane to pretend
                   to have a hangover.

                   out videotaping outcrop.

<b>     UNDERWATER - SAME
</b>
     CLOSE ON  A whirling cylinder tool we see is attached to the
     end of Willie's mechanical suit arm.  Like a drill its
     diamond bits cut into the rock outcrop to take a core
     sample.  It's a sinister hand-attachment, something Captain
     Hook would have loved.

     Above her the ROV maneuvers into position for a better view.

<b>     INSIDE THE SHACK CONTROL - SAME
</b>
     Beck is in the control station, staring at the video
     monitors--the image from the ROV.  Willie removes a slender
     instrument, like a bicycle pump and with a quick pump
     motion, CHUNK, CHUNK...activates an explosive charge.  She
     puts it into the hole she made with the drill and backs off.

                   C'mon Rover let's get out
                   of here.

     Like a good dog, the ROV follows her to a safe position.

<b>     ON MONITOR  THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE SPOT.  SUDDENLY THE

</b>
<b>     WILLIE RETURNS TO THE SITE OF THE CHARGE AND REINSERTS HER

     Willie holds out the sample to the ROV so Beck can see
     inside.

<b>     INT. CONTROL ROOM/ CLOSE ON BECK'S ROV MONITOR

     He stares at the image on the screen.

<b>                                BECK

     There is no answer.  Willie turns around.  Her helmet lamp
     eerily illuminating the darkness around her.  Sixpack is
     nowhere to be seen.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Sixpack?

     lights are turned on.

     She again holds out her hand to the ROV.

<b>     INSIDE SHACK

     Beck looks at the monitor and presses a red button to start
     the tape, then after five seconds releases the button.

     Suddenly Sixpack's foot hits some loose rock and slides.

     Willie turns in his direction and sees his headlight
     turning, becoming smaller, then disappearing as his radio
     goes dead.

<b>     INSIDE ON BECK

     ON WILLIE  She has stopped in her tracks.  All around her is
     blackness.  Her helmet light hardly penetrates the darkness.

</b>                   Sixpack?!  Sixpack...

     Then she looks down--a cliff right in front of her feet.
     The drop is thirty feet into a waving sea of tubers.

     BECK'S VOICE brings Willie back.

<b>                                BECK'S VOICE(RADIO)

     Jones is bench pressing 200 pounds on a fold-down compact
     gym, while DeJesus huffs and puffs on an exercise bike.

     Jones grits his teeth and struggles against the weight,

     Beck presses the red record button and pans the ROV slowly
     across the bulkhead of the ship.  The next letter is an "A".

<b>     WILLIE'S POV
</b>
     Her life-support gauges move eerily around the perimeter of
     her mask.  She moves along steadily down darkened corridors.
     She opens a door and it drops from its corroded hinges--a
     cloud of sludge rises off the bottom.  The room looks empty.

<b>                                WILLIE

     She throws open another door.  It also looks empty, then
     WHAM! a grotesque ECHONODERM slams into her helmet.  Willie
     bats it aside and as soon as she recovers shines her light
     into the room.

     WHAT SHE SEES:  The ship's infirmary.  Broken glass,
     stainless steel...the light does strange things, reflecting,
     sparkling...

<b>                                WILLIE(ON RADIO)

     Her helmet-mounted camera pans the room one more time, then
     as she turns to leave it captures a strange gleam of white
     in the corner--A LARGE HUMAN-LIKE SKELETON.  Willie doesn't
     see it.

<b>     INT. THE CONTROL ROOM

     CLOSE ON DOC  He stares at the monitor screen.  Did he see
     something or were his eyes playing tricks?  He looks across
     the console and sees the videotape is recording.

</b>                   One minute.

     Willie hesitates at the junction and PUSHES OPEN the door on
     her left, SOMETHING HUGE BEHIND IT MOVES--IT'S SIXPACK.  His
     mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the
     ship's huge safe.

<b>     THE SWAMP - LATER

     The door to the Russian ship's safe stands open.  BANG!
     BANG!  Jones and DeJesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a
     chisel.  While the others watch, Sixpack pleads his case
     with Beck.

<b>                                SIXPACK

     DeJesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box
     and dumps the contents on the workbench...several wallets,
     wristwatches, a pocket watch, a wedding ring...Bowman who
     stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory.

     She picks up something else, a pack of soggy chewing gum and
     tosses it to Cobb.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Here's something for you, Cobbie.

                   Russian money...Don't look like much.

     Jones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the
     table...Life Savers candy, a postcard of a fat Russian woman

     Everyone chuckles.  More papers and a small, book-shaped
     object wrapped in plastic.  Jones unwraps it.  It's a video
     tape.  He looks at the label.

     Jones hands it to Doc who looks at it.

                                DOC (cont'd)
                   It's a log of some sort.

     Jones pries the lid off another box and dumps it
     out--Papers, more cheap watches.

     ON SIXPACK  He notices something silver, the size of a
     paperback book, under a stack of papers.  Discreetly he
     covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off
     the table out of sight.

     Jones opens the last box, and something rolls across the
     table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught
     by DeJesus.  He holds it up and we see--a clear liquor
     bottle.

     the label.

     He stops the tape and presses another button on the console.

                   Like an accident.

     He looks back at Beck who we see is sitting behind him, and
     has also been watching the tape.  Beck looks at Doc and
     shrugs.

</b>                   I want your permission to

     Beck looks at him.  It is obvious that he doesn't trust Doc,
     with the vodka, but he's diplomatic.

<b>                                BECK

     He hears Cobb and freezes.  He looks around--the cramped
     quarters don't offer much in the way of hiding places.

<b>     INTERCUT WITH BOWMAN AND OTHERS IN DORMATORY

     They react similarly to the sound of Cobb on the P.A.

<b>     ON COBB AND BECK/ CORRIDOR

     Beck stops outside his door and sees Cobb.

     Cobb smiles, he can't believe his luck, then Beck holds up
     the videotape.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   ...Just let me put this in
                   my safe...

     Before Cobb can react Beck opens the door to his quarters
     and steps inside.

     BECK'S QUARTERS  WE SEE no sign of DeJesus.  Cobb follows
     into the room, looking carefully around for sign of DeJesus.

     In the mirror to Beck's bathroom, Cobb spots DeJesus
     pressing against the wall.  Cobb suddenly starts to sweat
     bullets.  Beck quickly unlocks the safe, opens it, and puts
     the videotape <u>right next to the bottle of Vodka.</u>

     We see Cobb's reaction.  Beck turns.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Something wrong?

     Cobb shakes his head weakly and starts to follow Beck out,
     he sneaks a look back at DeJesus in the shadows who gives
     him a thumbs up.

<b>     MESS - LATER
</b>
     Five specimen cups filled with vodka.  Bowman takes hers and
     looks at it questioningly.  Cobb watches the door for signs
     of the officers.

<b>                                BOWMAN

     Willie shakes her head.

<b>                                WILLIE

                                DEJESUS(cont'd)
                   I poured the vodka in here.

     Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Bowman, and Sixpack grin and clink
     glasses, then knock back their vodka.  Afterwards we get
     their reactions.

     JONES:  Looks concerned.
     BOWMAN:  Shakes her head, something's wrong.
     DEJESUS:  Can't get the taste off his tongue.
     COBB:  Seems totally satisfied.
     SIXPACK:  who has held the liquid in his mouth savoring it,
     suddenly spits the vodka out.

<b>                                SIXPACK

</b>                   Can you beat that?  The sonof-
                   abitch doesn't trust us!

     Willie grins at her co-workers and Beck's move and jogs out
     into the corridor.  Sixpack disgustedly tosses his shot
     glass away and leaves.

<b>                                SIXPACK
</b>                   That little turd.  If I
                   ever get the chance I'll
                   fix his ass.

     The others put down their glasses disappointedly except
     Bowman.  She watches Sixpack.

<b>     DORMITORY
</b>
     SIXPACK'S BUNK  He closes his privacy door and hesitates as
     if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask
     with Cyrillic lettering--the silver object he palmed in the
     Swamp--and smiles as he takes a long pull.  Suddenly WHAM!

     The Privacy door to Sixpack's bunk is slammed open.
     Startled he turns startled to see--BOWMAN.

<b>                                BOWMAN
</b>                   Didn't I ever tell you vodka

     She holds out her glass.  Sixpack looks around the Dorm,
     it's empty, then grins sheepishly and pours her a shot.

<b>     CORRIDOR "B"
</b>
     ON WILLIE  She is jogging through the corridors.  Suddenly
     there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE.  Willie stops and looks
     through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor.  The
     dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim
     light.  The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp.

     As she passes the door she notices the light and stops.  Beck
     stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with
     the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside.
     He sees her.

<b>                                BECK

                   I'd be used to it.

     She moves into the Swamp and goes to the Lift Lock, stopping
     under one of the ladders she leaps up and grabs a metal rung
     above her and begins doing her chin-ups as Beck watches her
     lean body easily doing the exercises.

<b>                                BECK

     Beck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends
     the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit.
     DeJesus and Jones share a look.  Bowman and Willie watch him
     carefully.  As Beck's suit stops in front of him the room is
     quiet, they can't believe their eyes.  Awkwardly, Beck
     tries to get into his suit.  Cobb breaks the silence.

     Doc and Sixpack.  Doc takes a blood sample, seals it and
     opens a cabinet under the sink where a supply of blood is
     stored in a refrigerated unit.  The plastic bags of blood
     are labeled with the various crew members' names.

     Sixpack watches him from the examination table.  He is
     shivering violently and scared.

     Skillfully Doc takes a skin sample.  Sixpack screams.

</b>
     An enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity.
     We see it literally spreading before our eyes.

<b>     ON DOC

     He leans back from the microscope.  There is awe on his face
     for the first time since first year medical studies--and
     there is fear of the unknown.  He looks over his shoulder at
     Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the
     table.

     He finishes typing and waits for an answer.  The cursor

     "Genetic Alteration?"  The words send a chill down Doc's
     spine.

     The mood is happy.  Like a high school football locker room

     Beck is standing in the doorway of the Infirmary, glaring at
     Doc, who sits with his bottle of Old Granddad.

     Beck hesitates, then puts on the mask.

<b>     SICK ROOM
</b>
     As Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the
     sheets.  Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the
     sight.  The black splotches have nearly all grown together.
     His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed.  Most
     dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become
     flared and elongated.  Though not bleeding, the open veins
     are visible.

<b>     WASHROOM - SAME

     Willie enters the room with several sinks and a couple of
     toilet stalls.  She approaches one of the sinks and pulls a
     toothbrush from the pocket of her robe.

</b>                   Bo?  Doc says you're next.

     Just then she hears a retching sound from one of the stalls.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   Bo?...You okay?

<b>     INFIRMARY - SAME

     Willie and Jones help Bowman into the Infirmary.  She is
     weak from nausea.  They help her onto the examination table
     and look around for Doc.  Jones sees a light on in the Sick
     Room.

<b>     SICK ROOK - SAME
</b>
     Sixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room.  The
     door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim
     light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the
     body totally.  Jones smiles.

<b>                                JONES

                   Hey, Sixpack...Hey, my man...
                   How you feeling?

     There is no answer and Jones slowly approaches the body.

<b>                                JONES

                   Bowman off.  I hope what you've
                   got ain't catching...

     He is almost to the table and reaches out to touch Sixpack
     when suddenly the body stirs.  Sixpack's foot moves slightly
     under the sheet as if shifting in his sleep.  Jones stops.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                   Oh, man, sorry...you go back
                   to sleep.

     Jones returns to the examination room.  Bowman is now
     undressed and under the blankets on the examination table.

                   in the shower room...

     They leave Bowman GROANING on the examination table and head
     back to the main corridor.  As they leave WE HOLD ON the
     door to the sick room behind Bowman.

     Bowman writhes on the examination table in pain.  Carefully
     she climbs off the table and goes behind a partition to
     throw up.

<b>     CLOSE ON BOWMAN

     At the sink in the infirmary.  She rinses her face in the
     sink and pulls back her hair, suddenly she stops and brings
     her hands in front of her face.

     INSERT HER HANDS.  Huge clumps of hair have come out in her
     hands.  And then she sees her hands themselves.  Scaly.

     She turns and looks at the light on in the Sick Room.  Slowly
     she goes to the door and enters.

     Bowman approaches the body of Sixpack.

     Jones looks from one officer to the other then grins.

</b>                   Bullshit...I was just talking

</b>                   What?...

<b>     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME
</b>
     Beck hits the floor off the ladder and rushes to the
     Infirmary with Jones.  He opens the door and freezes.

     WHAT HE SEES:  The examination table where Jones left her is
     empty.  The room deserted.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                                (pointing to
                                examination table)
                   I left her here.

     DOC comes up behind them, then turns.  He hears to a HISSING
     SOUND down the ring corridor.  He turns from the others and
     moves slowly toward the noise.

<b>     SHOWER ROOM
</b>
     Doc enters the shower room, full of steam and the SOUND OF
<b>     WATER.
</b>
<b>                                DOC
</b>                   Bowman?

     There is no answer and he moves toward the shower.

<b>                                DOC
</b>                   Bowman.  It's Doc.  I'm here
                   to help you.

     The water continues to run.  No answer.  Carefully, Doc
     opens the shower door.

     WHAT HE SEES:  Bowman.  Dead.  Her wrists have been cut and
     blood swirls down the drain.

     Doc sadly squats down beside her.  The death effects him
     greatly.  He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen
     and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm,
     turning it supine.  There, running the length of the arm, WE
     SEE the black scales.

<b>     INFIRMARY
</b>
     Jones and Beck lay Bowman's body carefully onto the
     examination table in the infirmary.  Through the Sick Room
     door we see the sheet shrouded body of Sixpack.  Doc covers
     Bowman with a sheet as

<b>                                                      WE CUT TO

<b>     THE MESS - LATER
</b>
     The remaining crew, Doc, and Beck assembled in the Mess.
     Doc sits quietly, almost in a daze.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   I can't tell you much about
                   it, except that none of you
                   show any symptoms.

<b>                                DEJESUS

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   No...she killed herself.

     ON WILLIE  the news hits her hard.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   We're getting out of here just

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   There's now a problem with the

                   typhoon in our sector...
                   ...We're going to be delayed
                   twelve hours...

</b>                   Typhoon?!

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Twelve hours!

<b>                                COBB
</b>                   At least we get time and

</b>                   Fuck double pay, man!  I
                   want out of here!

     Their argument is suddenly cut short by a NOISE from the
     corridor.  A THUMP!  The crew stops their grumbling and
     listens.  A moment later we hear another THUMP!  Beck looks
     at Jones.

<b>                                BECK

                   Stay here.

<b>     RING CORRIDOR
</b>
     Beck leads the way slowly toward the Infirmary where the
     sound is coming from.  Outside the door they hear it once
     more.  THUMP!

     Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the
     examination table is empty!  Beck goes to the Sick room and
     stops in the doorway.  Jones moves behind him and his eyes
     suddenly widen.

     WHAT THEY SEE:  Both bodies now are in a motionless, hideous
     conglomeration on the the table.

     ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.  It is quickly pulled shut, running the
     length of a heavy plastic bag, closing both bodies inside.

<b>     INT. CORRIDOR "B" - LATER
</b>
     Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus,
     Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the
     zippered bodybag.  Now, well over three hundred pounds, the
     bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to
     transport.

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                   C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...

                   I ain't, goddamnit...It's
                   Jones!..

     Before Jones can argue, Beck cuts them off.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Shut up, all of you.

<b>                                COBB
</b>                   Mr. Beck, the contract states that

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Fuck the contract, man!

     The group turns into the Swamp where Doc waits for them by
     the Lift Lock.  Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side
     of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the "package."  Like
     dominoes, Willie also looses her grip, then DeJesus.  The
     bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even
     harder for everyone to get a handhold.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   C'mon...Lift!

     The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to
     their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesus's face.

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                   Hey!...I feel something.
                   It's moving!  He's alive!

<b>                                COBB
</b>                   I feel it, too...Someone's trying
                   to get out.

     Cobb drops his end intentionally and he kneels looking for
     the zipper.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Cobb, what're you doing!

<b>                                COBS
</b>                   But he ain't dead!  He ain't
                   dead.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Cobb!  Stop!

     But Cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag.
     Beck tries to stop him when suddenly, WHAM!  a DARK
     APPENDAGE RIPS through the zipper and flails like a
     pressurized firehose.  It beats wildly for several second,
     then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm.

     While Cobb screams in pain, Beck yanks the appendage off
     Cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a
     sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a
     dagger.

<b>                                COBB
</b>                   It bit me!  It bit me!

     While Beck and Willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage,
     Doc rushes to the Lift Lock.

     DeJesus and Jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag
     into the Lift Lock.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Push Hazy!

     The bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its
     occupant.  Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just
     as the bag suddenly RIPS in several places.  A tear RIPS
     OPEN next to Jones' head revealing the head of BOWMAN, her
     vacant eyes only inches from Jones' face.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Oh, Jesus Christ!  I ain't
                   never gonna sleep again!

     Suddenly a WHINING NOISE sounds behind them.  Beck looks
     back to see Cobb approaching with a battery operated
     underwater chain saw.  He's clearly intending to cut the
     Creature with the whirring blade.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   No!

<b>                                COBB

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                   It's Sixpack!

<b>                                COBB
</b>                   I'm going to kill it!

     DeJesus turns to block Cobb while the others continue to
     wrestle the bodybag into the Lift Lock.  The bag suddenly
     splits and a scaly arm protrudes.  It reaches out grabbing
     DeJesus.  Beck pulls him free and yells.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Close the Lock!  Now!

     Doc hits the lever.  The elevator doesn't move!

     RRRRRRIIIIIPPP!  A scaly leg rips out of the body bag!

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Hit it again!

     Doc hits the elevator switch again, harder.

     NNNNNNN!  The Lift Lock door whines closed and a horrifying
     SCREAM rises from the Lock.

<b>     CLOSE ON THE LIFT LOCK
</b>
     The end of the appendage is severed in the closing door,
     disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water.

                   Flush it!

     Doc flips a switch and the SCREAM OF THE VACUUM PUMPS drown
     out the SCREAM in the Lift Lock, the wails of Cobb, and the
     splashing sounds of the severed three-foot section of gory
     muscle which slip silently and undetected under the
     workbench.

     A second later the elevator returns empty, silent,
     bloodstained.

     Beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior Lock.  The
     exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the
     flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it
     grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of
     the Shack lights...into the darkness.

     Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew.  Willie, Jones,
     DeJesus, Doc look like wet-suited butchers.  Splattered in
     blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together
     by having simply survived.  Jones holds up Willie.  DeJesus
     leans against the bulkhead.  In the far corner Cobb sobs
     quietly.

     Clouds of steam.  Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is
     scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the
     spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her
     skin.  Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her
     head against the wall of the shower stall.

     Beck and Jones open the privacy door to Sixpack's bunk.
     After some digging which produces five month's supply of
     pornography, the empty flask clatters to the floor.  Beck
     picks it up.

     Cobb pours himself a cup of coffee with a shaky hand.  Jones,
     and DeJesus sit at a table and Willie laces up her shoes for
     a run.  There is a feeling of anger among them.

     coldly.

     Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack
     on the Russian ship.  On the monitor screen we see Willie's
     POV of the infirmary.  The light dances off the broken glass
     as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the
     light moves out into the corridor.

</b>                   Back it up slowly.

     Beck does and we watch Doc's face as he stares intently at
     the screen.  Suddenly he sees it.

</b>                   There.

     ON SCREEN  We see it.  Caught in the turn of the camera, now
     frozen on the screen is the clear gleaming skeletal remains
     of a man.  Only it is clear that this is no ordinary man.
     Fingers and appendages are lengthened and broader than
     normal.  But it is the large head and long sharp teeth that
     especially catches our attention.

     as a hand suddenly moves into frame and we see the scene is
     actually one of DeJesus' jigsaw puzzles.  He takes a piece
     of blue sky from the hundreds of pieces on the table and
     places it perfectly into position on the puzzle.  Jones
     watches him amazed.

                   Sixty-four square miles.

     He picks up another piece of blue sky and effortlessly fits
     it into place as Jones watches.  It's blowing Jones' mind.

<b>                                JONES

     He gets up to go into the mess and Jones looks at him in
     amazement.

     below her feet.  It is dark down there.  Her feet pound off
     the metal grating.

     LOW ANGLE  We watch Willie from below as she jogs past.  THEN
     WE TILT DOWN to the dark, still water of the bilge.  Suddenly
     something stirs in the water--a ripple like a trout in a
     stream.

</b>                   Shut up, both of you!  We've
                   got to find it.

     Beck suddenly looks around noticing something.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Where's Willie?

<b>                                COBB
</b>                   Oh, God, she's out there...

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Jones...come with me.  Cobb,
                   you and Doc check the rooms.

<b>     INT. THE LOWER "B" CORRIDOR - SAME
</b>
     Jones and Beck move down the spooky corridor toward the
     Swamp.  Overhead, water moves through the desalinization
     conduit.  Jones eyes it warily.

<b>     SWAMP
</b>
     They enter the quiet Swamp.  The suits hang silently like
     sleeping monsters.  Beck steps into the equipment room.

     Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him.
     Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly.  He reaches the
     end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw
     Willie doing chin-ups.  He looks down and sees her headband
     floating in the bilgewater.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Willie...

     Suddenly Willie lowers herself from the bar behind him.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Yeah?

     The sudden sight of her nearly gives Jones heart failure, he
     stumbles backwards into the ankle deep water and Willie
     drops from the bar laughing.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                                (grinning)
                   What on earth's the matter
                   with you?

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   I ought to smack your face!

     Willie picks up the strain in Jones' voice, her smile fades.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   What's wrong?

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   DeJesus...It's got him.

<b>     THE EQUIPMENT ROOM - SAME
</b>
     Jones, Willie and Beck move quickly.  Beck pulls a portable
     laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits
     and attaches a portable power unit to the back.  Turning it
     on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon.

     Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated
     container transporters.  Beck notices and then looks up at
     Jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle
     pump/earthquake device we saw Willie use earlier.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   I thought they were your friends?

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Were, Doss <u>were</u>.

     Beck reaches out and takes the powerful weapon away from
     him.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   You fire that in here and
                   you'll bring the whole place
                   down.

     Jones thinks about it for a moment, then reaches for one of
     the Acetylene tanks.  He lights the end of it and a long
     blue tongue of flame whips out the door into the Swamp.
     Jones grins.

<b>     INFIRMARY - SAME
</b>
     Doc and Cobb move into the Infirmary.  Doc goes into his
     office.  He takes three scalpels out of an equipment drawer
     and then looks up, through the levolor blinds into the
     infirmary.  What he sees upsets him.

<b>     INT. SWAMP - SAME

     Jones working the intercom.

                   Jones to Doc.  Doc?...Cobb?

     He looks back to Beck, concerned.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   No, it's not going through.
                   The intercom's busted.  I thought
                   DeJesus fixed that?

<b>                                JONES
</b>                                (beat, realizing)
                   He did.

<b>     INFIRMARY - SAME
</b>
     Doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to
     the storage counter across the room--where the blood is
     stored.  WE SEE what disturbed him...the door to the
     refrigeration unit is ajar.  Doc opens the door to the
     cabinet.  The plastic bags are now empty.  Each one has been
     drained.

<b>     LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME
</b>
     Cobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie
     corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security.
     There is a sinister feel to the place.  Each step only
     reveals a little bit of space ahead of him.  Suddenly he
     stops.  In front of him across the hall a cabinet which
     says:  ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS, is torn open.  It is where
     DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before.

<b>     CLOSE ON THE CABINET
</b>
     The door is shattered.  Carefully, Cobb opens the door and
     WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire
     system has been disabled.

     Cobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY
     HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping
     COBB and sending his weapon to the floor.  Cobb turns
     directly into

     THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH!  It's sharp teeth shine in the light,
     poised to strike.

     Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the
     tentacle to attack.  Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes
     in the corridor.

     COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone.  Doc is
     holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he
     has seen the devil itself.

<b>                                COBB

     Doc shakes his head dumbly.  He is in total shock.

<b>     THE MESS
</b>
     The remaining group is assembled around the table.  Jones
     watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers.  He
     listens.

     He holds out the empty blood bags.  A change has come over
     Doc since Bowman's death.  The experience has slightly
     deadened him.

     ladder to the Upper Level instead.

<b>     CLOSE ON DROPS OF BLOOD INTO A SMALL POOL
</b>
     a grisly sight.

     WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL the drops coming from the plasma bag
     of Beck's blood.  Beck stops the drip and moves on into the
     darkness of the corridor.

     Doc moves behind the computer keyboard in the dim light of
     the Control room.  His face lit by the computer monitor.  He

     DOC pauses looking at the message, then moves his hand to
     the SEND command and presses it.

     Willie prepares a clean bandage as Doc examines the cut.  He
     smiles at Cobb like a friendly country doctor.  The tired look
     now gone from his eyes.  He seems revitalized.

     She nods.  Doc turns back to the sink and Cobb holds out his
     arm to let Willie put the new bandage on.  As Cobb's arm
     comes up we suddenly notice a slight movement under his
     shirt.  Willie stops just before applying the bandage.  The
     movement intensifies--like snakes moving wildly beneath the
     cloth.  Cobb whitens...breaks out in a sweat.  Willie backs
     off.

     sharp proboscis punctures Doc's chest right at the heart and
     the leach mouth with it's hundreds of teeth attaches with

                   Don't let him see you.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Don't worry...

     As the Creature approaches WE SEE Beck stand up like a
     wounded animal.  He begins dragging his "injured" leg behind
     him as he retreats toward the Swamp.  THE FOOTSTEPS MOVE
<b>     FASTER.  IT'S CLOSING!
</b>
<b>     INT. RING CORRIDOR - SAME
</b>
     ON WILLIE  She bursts out the door to the MESS and heads
     toward Corridor "B."

<b>     DOOR TO THE SWAMP
</b>
     Beck moves through the door to the Swamp and positions
     himself by the door.  He looks back and WE SEE Jones for the
     first time, flamethrower poised, ready to fire.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   C'mon baby c'mon...

<b>     ON THE SHADOW OF THE CREATURE
</b>
     It moves steadily toward the door, moving right to the
     doorway.  Carefully it moves a dark, horrible hand-like
     appendage inside the doorframe.

<b>     ON BECK AND JONES
</b>
     poised to kill when suddenly both men hear the same thing.

<b>                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.S.)
</b>                   Beck?  Jones!?

<b>     ON WILLIE
</b>
     She turns the corner and freezes.  There, less than ten feet
     away is the Creature.  A tentacle whips excitedly like a
     tail!

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Oh God...

     AS THE CREATURE starts to turn for Willie, Beck suddenly
     closes the vault-like door to the swamp on Creature's hand,
     trapping it vise-like in the door.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Run Willie!  Run!

     The Creature throws back its head and SCREAMS in pain as the
     heavy door severs its appendage.

<b>     ON BECK AND JONES
</b>
     As the writhing hand-like appendage squirms in front of them
     Jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls
     like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Well done.  Just like
                   momma makes 'em.

     Beck opens the door--the corridor is empty.  Willie and the
     creature are gone.

<b>     ON WILLIE RUNNING
</b>
     She heads back toward the Ring corridor around the inner
     path toward Corridor "A".  In a full run now, every panel
     and instrument looks even more sinister--where is Cobb/Doc
<b>     CREATURE?---
</b>
<b>     ON THE DEJESUS CREATURE'S SEVERED APPENDAGE
</b>
     As the Creature moves after Willie we see its bloody stump
     suddenly sprout a new appendage!  Like a starfish it grows
     another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost.

<b>     ON WILLIE
</b>
     She turns down Corridor "A".  A NOISE overhead in the water
     conduit causes her to look up WHEN SUDDENLY A BLACK ARM
<b>     REACHES OUT FROM THE SHADOWS, AND PULLS HER INTO THE DARK
</b>     DOORWAY TO THE MACHINE FLOOR----IT IS JONES!  He pulls her
     between him and Beck in the shadows.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                                (whispered)

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   C'mon.

<b>     CONTROL ROOM
</b>
     Beck is followed inside by Jones and Willie.  It is empty.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Lock the door.

     Jones rolls the large vault-like door closed and locks them.
     Beck goes to the console and checks the instruments.
     Suddenly he sees something that causes him to freeze in his
     tracks.  A red light blinks ominously on the console.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Shit!  He sent them all.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   The escape bubbles?

     She and Jones stop in front of Doc's console.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                                (gravely)
                   Look at this.

     Beck looks at Doc's computer screen.

     ON SCREEN WE SEE DOC'S MESSAGE:  "...hope that our sacrifice
     will mean that the human race will never know this awful
     mutation..."

<b>                                WILLIE

<b>     SUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR!  LIKE A
</b><b>     HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING
</b>     TO BREAK IT DOWN.  Jones readies his weapon but just as
     suddenly, the BANGING STOPS.  Beck, Willie and Jones all
     nervously exchange looks.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Well, at least we're safe inside

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   For how long?

     Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a
     message.  WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN.  "SHACK SIX REPORTING.

     He turns off his screen and the picture in front of Beck,
     Jones and Willie goes blank.

<b>                                BECK

<b>     CONTROL ROOM - LATER

     Jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across
     his stomach.  Near him Willie lies still, eyes open.  She
     watches Beck across the room, standing at the window.

     He stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then
     as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the
     blank computer screen.

<b>     CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

                   Martin, you asshole...

     Suddenly he hears a voice behind him.

<b>                                WILLIE

                   Yeah...I think they're just
                   deciding what to do with us.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Maybe they already have.

     She moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls
     up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring
     earlier.

     ON SCREEN  WE SEE:  Stock prices.

     Willie types in a series of commands.

<b>                                BECK

</b>                   Seeing how my stock's doing...

                   Where?....

     She scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the
     words.

     THE SCREEN:  "...accident took place in Shack Six, Southeast
     Sector of Pacific Zone 10...Seven dead.  All bodies
     missing."  Their names follow.

     ON WILLIE  as her name comes up she shivers.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   I can't believe they'd

     A voice behind them causes them to turn.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Welcome to the union, boss.
                   We're all expendable.

     He is now awake.  He sits up against the air vent.  Suddenly,
     Beck listens, the room is deathly silent.  He looks over to
     the air vent.  Jones is listening also.

<b>                                WILLIE

</b>                   The air's stopped.

     WHOOP!  WHOOP!  Suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds hysterically.
     A blue light on the console blinks on and off.  It says
     "AIR."  Beck turns to the instruments.

<b>                                BECK

<b>                                WILLIE

<b>     SUDDENLY WE HEAR A SOUND WE HAVEN'T HEARD IN A LONG TIME.

     in on the tell-tale noise.

</b>                                (almost to himself)
                   Cobb...Job security...

     He locks eyes with Beck.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   They're drawing us out.

     He leaves his seat and Jones checks his weapon as Willie
     watches.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   You can't go out there, that's
                   what they want.

     Beck checks his make-shift flamethrower.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   We don't have much choice...

                   pressure will fall and--

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Crunch...Implosion.

     Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining
     tools, the laser-drill, she powers-it up to check it.  Her
     action stops both men and she catches their looks.

<b>                                WILLIE

<b>     INT. CORRIDOR "A" - SAME

     Carefully the three move into the Lower Ring Corridor.  As
     they move we suddenly hear a new sound, DEEP, LIKE DISTANT
     THUNDER.  The sides of the shack tremble slightly.

<b>                                WILLIE

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   She's wondering what's
                   happening.  We're losing
                   air faster than I thought.

<b>                                BECK

                   Which way?

     Jones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor "A."

<b>     INT. CORRIDOR "A"
</b>
     The SOUND of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the
     flooring.  The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down
     into the darkness.  Willie stands guard with the flame-
     thrower.

     ON JONES  He peers into the darkness below.  He wasn't a big
     fan of the bilge even before the Creature, now he's scared
     shitless.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   I'll go first.

     Before Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs
     down into the dark bilge.  Jones waits till he's at the
     bottom, then starts down behind him.  Willie looks back.

<b>                                WILLIE

<b>     BILGE

     From somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF
     ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM.
     As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light
     into the eerie underground area.

     Pipes run overhead and on the walls.  A broken electrical
     conduit sparks over their heads.  The floor is ankle deep in
     greasy water.  They start toward the noise.

<b>     ON WILLIE
</b>
     Her back is to the solid wall(outside wall).  Her eyes move
     from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering
     long enough to distract her.  Sweat runs down her face and
     we hear another tremor in the Shack.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                                (to herself,
                                calming herself)
                   Okay, Williams...let's hear a
                   tune.
                                (beat, quietly
                                at first)
                   "Off we go...into the wild
                   blue yonder..."

     ANOTHER RUMBLE FROM THE SHACK causes her to pause.  She
     catches her breath and starts again.

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                   "...flying high into the sky..."

     She suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the
     wire mesh of the other wall).  Was it something moving?

</b>
     ON BECK  He moves around a corner we recognize from before
     with Jones' and Cobb's repair.  Beck floods the area with
     light and the break in the line is visible.  The pipe has
     been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable.  What's
     worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the
     water.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Jesus Christ...

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Can you fix it?

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   No way...

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Think!  Can we stop it?!
                   Block it up?!  Shut down
                   the line somewhere?!  Think!

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   I am thinking, man!  You
                   think I want to die!  I am
                   thinking!  I--

     Suddenly his eyes widen.  Beck sees this and turns.  In his
     light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK
     FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE!  It's leech-like appendage
     whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail.  Before
     it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a
     blast of flame from his flamethrower.  The CREATURE SCREAMS
     and disappears.

     As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes
     out sending the bilge into greater darkness.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   I hit it.  But I can't see
                   it!  Can you see it?!

<b>                                BECK
</b>                                (standing)
                   No.

     Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a
     thought.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   The Swamp.  There's an over-
                   ride switch in the Swamp.

     They start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP! out of the
     darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones'
     arm.  The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised
     like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's
     thigh.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                                (screams)
                   Ahhh!

     Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the
     tentacle.  The unseen Creature's SCREAM echoes through the
     Bilge.  Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the
     ladder.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Hurry...Get out!

     Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor
     fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then
     suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the
     ladder at them.  Beck ducks and leaps to the side.  He is
     less than six feet from the Creature.  In the dim light WE
     SEE it wickedly bare its teeth.

     Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and
     spot the exposed power cable.  The Creature steps forward
     directly under the hole in the floor.  It is about to lunge
     when a voice from above distracts it.

<b>                                WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
</b>                   Hey, you?

     The Creature looks up and sees:

<b>     ON WILLIE STANDING OVER THE OPENING, HER FLAMETHROWER
</b><b>     POINTED STRAIGHT DOWN.  SHE FIRES, SENDING A SEARING BLUE
</b><b>     FLAME INTO THE BILGE.
</b>
     BECK watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives
     him the moment of distraction he needs.  He leaps out of the
     bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken
     power cable from the wall.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Jones!  Get your feet out
                   of the water!

     Jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as Beck
     thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the Creature's
     feet.

<b>     IN A BLINDING FLASH OF ELECTRICITY
</b>
     The current surges through the Cobb/Doc Creature sending it
     instantly rigid.  A second later it crashes forward into the
     water.

     Moving hand over hand toward the ladder Jones quickly climbs
     out, followed by Beck.

<b>     THE SHACK CONTINUES TO SHAKE, EACH JOLT STRONGER THAN THE
</b>     LAST.  As they emerge Willie helps them.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   C'mon, the Swamp!

     They start for the Swamp down Corridor "A" when an enormous
     shudder goes through the Shack, causing the lights to blink
     and the floor to open beneath Beck.  The jolt knocks him
     back into the bilge.  Only grabbing onto the pipes just
     above the water stops him from falling back in.

     JONES stops and looks back over the missing grating.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Beck!

     Jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt
     only widens the gap.  Beck yells to be heard over the din of
     the collapsing Shack.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Go on!

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   No!

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   That's an order!

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Fuck your orders!

     He leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts
     his hand down into the darkness.  Beck lets go of one hand,
     then the other, to grab Jones' extended arm.  In one
     Herculean effort Jones pulls him out of the bilge.  Together
     they leap across the chasm as the Desalinization Conduit
     collapses over their heads and water floods into Corridor "A"
     behind them.  They have to go around the other way!

<b>     AS THEY RUN
</b>
     KLAXON HORNS SOUND and a RECORDED FEMALE VOICE warns:  "Five
     minutes until implosion..."

<b>     FLASH CUTS OF:
</b>
<b>     THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND FAIL, CAUSING THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING
</b><b>     TO GO ON, AND CASTING AN EERIE STROBE EFFECT ON THE ESCAPING
</b><b>     THREE CREW MEMBERS
</b>

</b>
<b>     SEAMS BEND UNDER THE STRAIN, RIVETS POP...
</b>
<b>     STRAINING MACHINES SEND SCALDING GEYSERS OF STEAM INTO THE
</b><b>     CORRIDORS...AND SUDDENLY THE FLOOR GIVES WAY BENEATH WILLIE!
</b>     She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the
     firm ground.

<b>     JONES LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE SWAMP, WITH WILLIE BEHIND
</b><b>     HIM, AND BECK COVERING THE REAR.
</b>
     THEY reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn
     into the Swamp Annex.  Willie hits the door opener.  RRRRRR
     IT DOESN'T BUDGE.  The pressure has bent the door frame.

<b>     BECK ARRIVES
</b>
<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   It's jammed!

     Immediately Beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand
     held spreader--like a "Jaws of Life"--from the wall.  He
     turns back to the Swamp when a BLACK SCALY ARM SUDDENLY
<b>     BURSTS THROUGH THE WIRE MESH OF THE MACHINE FLOOR AND PULLS
</b><b>     BECK AGAINST THE WIRE!  IT IS THE DEJESUS CREATURE.
</b>
     His head held in place by the powerful arm, Beck looks
     almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature.  Its
     gill-like slits flare.  Its mouth opens and we see a flash
     of its razor sharp teeth.

     Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the
     steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a
     knife for Beck's face.  At the last instant Beck move his
     head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh.  The mesh
     loosens the creature's grip and Beck manages to reach a
     mining drill from the tools on the wall.  As the appendage
     starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the
     Creature's tentacle and breaks free.

     Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where
     Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door
     open.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Where the hell've you been?

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   I got hung up!  Try this!

     Willie stands back and Beck thrusts the Spreader into the
     tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made.  With Jones'
     help the two men force open the door and all three rush
     inside the SWAMP.  Beck closes the door behind them.

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Five minutes to
     implosion."  And we feel it happening:

<b>     THE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE
</b><b>     VIBRATIONS
</b>
<b>     THE WALLS SHAKE
</b>
<b>     THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE.
</b><b>     ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER
</b>
     JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red
     handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half
     way!  It is jammed by the pressure.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   It won't go!

     Willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not
     enough.  THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS!

<b>     STEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE!
</b>
<b>     THE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION!
</b>
     THE FEMALE VOICE INTONES:  "Four minutes..."

<b>     BECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK
</b>
     He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her
     suit hangs.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   The suits!  Get in them!

     Willie moves quickly but Jones doesn't.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   The suits!  Are you crazy!
                   How're we going to get to
                   the surface?

     Beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing TANKS OF
<b>     COMPRESSED AIR AND DEFLATED CONTAINER TRANSPORTERS.
</b>
<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Like this.

     He looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they
     begin pulling the equipment out.

                                BECK(cont'd)
                   Get them in the Lock!

     Jones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like
     Container transporters to the lock.

     ON WILLIE  She climbs into her suit and activates her
     generator.  Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around
     the perimeter of her helmet.

     THE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONS..."Three
     minutes...to...implosion..."

     Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the
     elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to
     arm himself with earlier.  He takes the tool from Beck and
     sticks it in the vest of his wet suit.

     Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the
     Lock.  Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track
     to the Lock.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Your suit, Becky!

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Just get in yours!

     Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his
     suit.

     Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving
     along the track toward the Lock.  A suit turns the corner
     from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK.

     Beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder.  He moves
     along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM
<b>     BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION!  A HUGE
</b><b>     TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR.
</b>
     BECK ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off
     the appendage.  Another tentacle jabs for Beck.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                                (screams)
                   Look out!

     But it is too late.  It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and
     sends him to the floor.  Beck looks up at the Lock in time to
     see Jones seal himself into his suit.

<b>                                JONES/RADIO
</b>                   I'm in.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                                (to the others)
                   Go!

<b>                                WILLIE/RADIO
</b>                   No!

<b>     THE CREATURE APPROACHES BECK
</b>
     Beck looks at the others one last time.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Go, now!  That's an order!

     Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the
     elevator sends them down without Beck.

     BECK stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he
     swings at the Creature driving it back.  As Beck gets the
     upper hand, the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck
     freezes.  There attached to the back of the Creature's head
     is the grotesque face of DeJesus!

     DeJesus' eyes suddenly blink.  He's still alive!  His lips
     tremble in agony.

<b>                                DEJESUS
</b>                   Kill me...Kill me!

     Beck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with
     the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature.

     As the Creature falls back hurt, Beck looks up at the lock
     elevator as it returns--IT IS EMPTY--The others have made it
     out!  His suit continues down the track and stops in the
     Lock.  He still has to make it, if he can just get there!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE SOUNDS:  "One minute to
     implosion..."

     Beck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit.
     His arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy
     metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the
     generator.

     BECK'S POV.  His vital signs light up around the perimeter
     of his helmet, but he sees something else--the Creature
     charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck
     out of the elevator!  Instinctively, Beck swings his
     motorized leg into the Creature's snarling mouth, knocking
     it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the
     elevator button.  BUT IT DOESN'T WORK!

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   No!

     He hits again, still nothing!

     THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE..."Nineteen, eighteen..."  Her
     voice begins to quiver.

<b>     BECK POUNDS ON THE BUTTON AND LOOKS UP JUST AS THE CREATURE
</b><b>     DIVES FOR HIM, ITS HUGE SCALY HAND GRABBING HIM AROUND
</b><b>     BECK'S LEG!
</b>
     CLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON  Beck pounds it one last time
     and NNNNNNNNNNNN!

<b>     THE LOCK CLOSES, CRUSHING THE CREATURE AS IT FLUSHES BECK
</b><b>     OUTSIDE SECONDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE COLLAPSES WITH
</b><b>     IMPLOSION AND SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN A HUGE SHUDDER OF ENERGY!
</b>
<b>     UNDERWATER - LATER
</b>
     WHOOSH!  A parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward
     the surface.  A heavy-suited crew member flashes past us.
     Its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears.  A
     moment later another Transporter follows, racing out of the
     darkness after the first.

     BECK'S POV  We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his
     helmet.  The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as
     he moves closer to the surface.

     WILLIE'S POV  She tilts her head upwards.  She snaps off her
     light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then
     suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her.  At
     first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then
     we see it again--a glimmer of light.

<b>                                WILLIE(RADIO)
</b>                   Light.  Beck, I see light!

<b>     ON BECK
</b>
     He follows her look.  Light is coming fast, brightening as
     they rise.  The LED numbers inside their helmets click
     off..."125, 100, 75..."

<b>                                BECK(RADIO)
</b>                   Wait till you reach thirty-

<b>                                WILLIE(RADIO)
</b>                   Ejecting.

     She yanks at the handle on the chest plate and WHOOSH!  The
     plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle.  Her
     hand gropes for it.

<b>     SUNLIGHT IS STREAMING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER AS SHE RUSHES
</b><b>     UPWARD.
</b>
     WHOOSH!  The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as
     she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons.

     No longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, Willie
     frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface.

<b>     SUDDENLY SHE BREAKS THE SURFACE AND CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE
</b><b>     SUN, DAZZLING THROUGH A MILLION DROPLETS OF WATER AS A HUGE
</b><b>     SWELL CARRIES HER UP EVEN HIGHER.
</b>
     Then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull
     the tab on the life jacket around her neck.  Suddenly a MALE
     HAND GRABS THE TAB FOR HER AND PULLS.  She looks up at Beck.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   We made it!

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Where's Jones?

     Holding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell.  At
     the crest WE SEE JONES in the trough below, face down.  Beck
     breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach
     Jones.  Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water
     and inflates his life jacket.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Is he okay?

     Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket.  For a
     moment.  Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint
     against the sunlight.  Beck turns back to Willie and as he
     and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs-up."

                                WILLIE(cont'd)
                                (jubilant)
                   The sun!  The sun!

     Jones looks at Beck and grins.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   What happened to that typhoon?

<b>     CALM SEA - LATER
</b>
     BECK, WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search
     the horizon.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Are you sure you saw something?

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   How many times I got to tell
                   you.  I saw a ship.

<b>                                WILLIE

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   We'll fire one more, that
                   leaves us one last one.

     BECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it
     into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark
     water.  The light fades, Willie looks at Jones.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   Are you okay, Jonesy?

<b>                                JONES
</b>                                (weakly)
                   Tip top, Willie...tip top.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                                (testing him)
                   Who's the best power forward
                   in the NBA...Jameson?

<b>                                JONES
</b>                                (tired, but
                                with fight)
                   Jameson?  Who are you trying
                   to con...?

     They both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   I'll be damned.  Look!...A flare!

     As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just
     fading against the sky.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   It saw us!

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Answer them and quit kicking me!

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   I'm not touching you!

     WHOOOOOOOOSH!  Beck fires another flare into the sky.  As the
     flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the
     first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   No...no, no, no.

     The SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades.

<b>     EXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME
</b>
     A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and
     speaks to someone O.S.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                   I thought you said you'd
                   combed this area?

     He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN
     standing on the bridge.  He also lowers his binoculars and
     smiles coolly as he lies.

<b>                                MARTIN
</b>                   We did....Many times.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                                (looks at Martin
                                then to a Lieutenant)
                   Initiate rescue.

     We hold on Martin's face as from

<b>     THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP
</b>
     A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks
     off toward the fading flare.

<b>     OCEAN - SAME
</b>
     Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together.
     Suddenly Willie feels another bump.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                                (panicky)
                   It hit me!  Where are they?!

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   I can't see them!

     Suddenly he is bumped by a shark.  Willie sees one only two
     feet away.  They are surrounded.  Suddenly Jones stare to
     taunt the sharks aggressively.

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   All right!  I've had enough
                   of this shit!  You want meat,
                   motherfucker?  Come on, eat
                   me, sucker, try some dark meat!

     He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop
     him.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (taunting sharks)
                   What's wrong you snout-nosed
                   bastards?  My meat too tough
                   for you?!

     Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear.  Willie and Beck
     watch stunned.  Even Jones is surprised.

                                JONES(cont'd)
                                (to Willie and Beck)
                   Whoa!  Did you see those fools
                   run?  They know whose boss.

     He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE
     SEE a gash across his forearm.

<b>     UNDERWATER POV
</b>
     As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT
<b>     RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS!
</b>
<b>     SURFACE/OCEAN
</b>
     Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something
     is happening...

     WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP,
     THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over
     the waves.  It's lights are visible.  Willie and Beck wave
     frantically as Jones drifts closer to them!

<b>     UNDERWATER
</b>
     JONES' LEGS  His wet suit is now completely split open and
<b>     WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING!
</b>
<b>     THE HELICOPTER
</b>
     hovers over the group below and lands on the water.  Its
     blades beat the surface into waves.  The WINCH OPERATOR
     hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the
     ring.  He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock
     eyes.  Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and
     signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety.
     Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Jonesy...Give me your hand!

     WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the
     harness.  The Winch operator throws it back across the water
     where

     BECK grabs the harness.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   C'mon, Jones!

     Jones reaches out his hand.  He is almost there WHEN
<b>     SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE
</b><b>     SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY!  HUGE AND
</b><b>     GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT.  IT GOES FOR
</b><b>     BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM.
</b>
<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Jonesy, No!

<b>                                JONES
</b>                   Get out of here, Becky!

     The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under.
     Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears.  Numbed he
     clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a
     boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles
     rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs
     to the surface several feet away from Beck.

     Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again!
     It turns and focuses on Beck.  Beck keeps going for the life
     vest as the Creature starts for him.

<b>     ON HELICOPTER
</b>
     The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the
     Creature bears down on Beck.

<b>                                WINCH OPERATOR
</b>                   Is he in the harness!

     CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST  Beck reaches it.  His fingers
     wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones'
     vest pocket.  The Creature is right on top of him!

     CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles
     rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body
     in a death grip.  It's horrible mouth starts to open.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   C'mon, motherfucker open up!

     The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck
     thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and <u>is suddenly</u>
     <u>pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp!</u>  The rescue
     cable is taut!  The helicopter is taking off!

     BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT.  Beck rises suddenly out of the
     water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him
     until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the
     Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean
     surface!  The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off
     toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it.
     The winch operator pulls him in.

<b>     EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER
</b>
     Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of
     the ship.  He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked
     INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and
     shakes his hand.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                   Mr. Beck, I understand
                   you passed your physical with
                   flying colors.  And Ms. Williams?

<b>                                BECK
</b>                                (worried)
                   I don't know yet, she's still
                   in there.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                   Well, you'll be glad to know
                   you have a friend onboard.

     Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them.

<b>                                MARTIN
</b>                                (excitedly)
                   Beck!  I told them you'd
                   make it.  No one back at
                   TransOcean believed me, but
                   I never gave up on you once.
                                (smiling)
                   So, how are you feeling?

     Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in
     one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across
     the deck.

<b>                                BECK
</b>                   Better...A lot better.

     Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears
     with a new outfit on.  Smiles at Beck.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   I'm fine!

     Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a STEWARD
     approaches with a tray of WHOLE COOKED FISH, HIDEOUS LOOKING
<b>     THINGS LIKE ANGLERS, LOBSTERS, CRABS...MINIATURE LEVIATHAN.
</b>     The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie.  The
     Captain notices.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                   I thought we might have some
                   wonderful seafood.  But, if there's
                   something else you'd rather have...

     Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at
     the Captain and smiles.

<b>                                WILLIE
</b>                   How about a burger and fries?

     She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the
     deck with the Captain.

     AS WE PULL BACK the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the
     distance and WE ARE AT THE

<b>     SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
</b>
     riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping
     beneath the waves and descending again into the cold
     depths.





<b>                                THE END
