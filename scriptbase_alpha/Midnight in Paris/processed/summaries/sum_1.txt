The successful Hollywood screenplay writer Gil Pender is spending vacation in Paris with his fianc√©e Inez and her parents since his future father-in-law is on a business trip.
Gil is an aspiring novelist that loves Paris, and dreams of living in the city after getting married to Inez.
Furthermore the romantic Gil believes that the golden age of Paris was in the 1920s and he loves to walk through the streets of the city.
When Inez meets her former boyfriend, the pseudo-intellectual Paul, with his girlfriend Carol, they spend some time together visiting tourist attractions.
At night they drink wine at a party and Paul invites the couple to go dancing with Carol and him.
Gil, however, prefers to return walking alone to the hotel.
At midnight an old car stops and the passengers invite him to go a party and soon he realizes that he is back in the 20's, where he meets his favorite writers, musicians and artists and lives his dream.
