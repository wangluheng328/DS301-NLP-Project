A young girl walks through a secret door in her new home and discovers an alternate version of her life.
On the surface, this parallel reality is eerily similar to her real life - only much better.
But when her adventure turns dangerous, and her counterfeit parents (including Other Mother) try to keep her forever, Coraline must count on her resourcefulness, determination, and bravery to get back home - and save her family.
