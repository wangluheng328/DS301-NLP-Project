A New York police officer goes undercover in a dangerous crime scene to investigate abductions and drug-trafficking operations.
He obtains backup with the help of another brave Hong Kong police officer who works for the NYPD.
They partner up together to stop the operation before the city goes down.
The criminal organization is called the "Fukanese Dragons" who are likely terrorists and illegal immigrants who are about to tear up Chinatown in New York City.
