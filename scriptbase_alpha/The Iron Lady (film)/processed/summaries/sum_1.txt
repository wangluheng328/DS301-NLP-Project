Biopic of Margaret Thatcher, the United Kingdoms first female Prime Minister.
Now elderly and senile, Thatcher spends much of her time in conversation with her husband Denis, who is dead.
Interspersed with her everyday life are snippets of her life and political career.
The middle class daughter of a grocer, she obtained a good degree and developed an interest in politics.
She was first elected in 1959 and quickly developed a reputation for dealing with difficult issues and showing herself more than capable of taking on her male counterparts in the House of Commons.
As Prime Minister, she takes on the very powerful unions seeing her popularity plummet until her patriotic response to Argentina's invasion of the Falkland islands leads to her re-election.
In the longer term, her rigid approach with her colleagues leads to her downfall and the Conservative party ousts her from the leadership.
