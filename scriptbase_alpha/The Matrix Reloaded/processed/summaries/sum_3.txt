Roughly six months after the original "Matrix", Neo begins to have nightmares about Trinity plunging to her death.
Meanwhile, the rebels have returned to the city of Zion to learn that 250,000 sentinels are digging towards them to seek Zion and wipe out the human resistance.
The Oracle gives Neo instructions to find the Keymaker and seek out the source.
If Neo fails the mission, then the rebellion will be crushed, and the machines will win the war.
