Returning back to London after his wife and daughter were been stolen by Judge Turpin, Benjamin Barker adopts the name Sweeney Todd and relocates his barber business to the top of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop.
Todd wants his revenge on the man who has now adopted his daughter and works with Mrs. Lovett on an evil plan.
Todd will slice the throats of the unsuspecting public while giving them a shave.
These bodies are then turned into Mrs. Lovett's new meat pies.
With this plan being successful, all Todd needs to do now is try to convince the Judge to sit in his chair.
