<b>            SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET
</b>



                            Written by

                            John Logan



                       Music and Lyrics by

                         Stephen Sondheim




                  Adapted from the Stage Musical
         "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"

               Music and Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim
                       Book by Hugh Wheeler

              Based on a version of "Sweeney Todd"
                       by Christopher Bond






                                               18th DECEMBER, 2006
<b>                                                                   PAGE 1.
</b>


<b>1   INT. DARK CHAMBER -- NIGHT                                     1
</b>
    Foreboding organ music is heard...

    We are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an
    alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory?
    ... we're not sure...

    The flickering glow of flame is the only illumination...

    The ominous organ music continues as...

    From the bottom of the frame...

    A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up
    the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected
    in the blood...

    Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame.

<b>    SUDDENLY--
</b>
    A shrill factory whistle blows--

    ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering --
    the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory
    whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring
    inferno; a human scream--

    And a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool
    of blood.

    He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and
    matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat.

    The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right
    side up as--

<b>                           GENTLEMAN
</b>                 Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.
                 His skin was pale and his eye was odd.
                 He shaved the faces of gentlemen
                 Who never thereafter were heard of again.
                 He trod a path that few have trod,
                 Did Sweeney Todd,
                 The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

    We cut from the blood to see the Gentleman standing before
    us. Strangely impassive.

    We are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a
    world of silhouettes and shadows.


<b>                                                         (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                                                   PAGE 2.
</b><b>1   CONTINUED:                                                     1
</b>
    Another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows, into the
    hellish flickering of flame: THE BANKER. He is large, rotund
    and sleek. Impressive muttonchops.

<b>                           BANKER
</b>                 He kept a shop in London town,
                 Of fancy clients and good renown,
                 And what if none of their souls were saved?
                 They went to their maker impeccably shaved...

    More FIGURES begin to emerge from the shadows, joining the
    Gentleman and the Banker as...

<b>                           BANKER
</b>                 By Sweeney,
                 By Sweeney Todd,
                 The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

    Although prosaic in appearance these figures are, in fact,
<b>    GHOSTS.
</b>
<b>                           GHOSTS
</b>                 Swing your razor wide, Sweeney!
                 Hold it to the skies!
                 Freely flows the blood of those
                 Who moralize!

    As they continue, the new figures become more distinct...

    THE GENERAL, a tough, leather-skinned military man in a
    crimson imperial uniform...

<b>                           GENERAL
</b>                 His needs were few, his room was bare:

    THE PRIEST, a lean, severe man with pale skin in clerical
    attire...

<b>                           PRIEST
</b>                 A lavabo and a fancy chair...

    THE TOURIST, a small, meek man with glasses in an ill-fitting
    suit...

<b>                           TOURIST
</b>                 A mug of suds and a leather strop,
                 An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop...

    THE STUDENT, a dashing young man from Oxford with luxurious
    long hair...




<b>                                                          (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                                                 PAGE 3.
</b><b>1   CONTINUED: (2)                                               1
</b>
<b>                        STUDENT
</b>              For neatness he deserves a nod,
              Does Sweeney Todd...

<b>                        GENTLEMAN
</b>              The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

    The ghosts are a bit more insinuating now as they move around
    this mysterious world...

<b>                        GHOSTS
</b>                  (variously)
              Inconspicuous Sweeney was,
              Quick and quiet and clean `e was.
              Back of his smile, under his word,
              Sweeney heard music that nobody heard.
              Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned,
              Like a perfect machine 'e planned,
              Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle,
              Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle...

    The specters are becoming more insistent, their strange
    impassivity giving way to accusation as the flickering red
    flame becomes an inferno--

<b>                        GHOSTS
</b>                  (variously)
              Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle,
              Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle.
              Inconspicuous Sweeney was,
              Quick and quiet and clean 'e was,
              Like a perfect machine 'e was,
              Was Sweeney!
              Sweeney!
              Sweeney!
              Sweeeeeneeeeey!
    On this explosive note we revolve -- away from the ghostly
    Furies--

    To discover--

    SWEENEY TODD. Standing before us. An unclear figure,
    silhouetted in blazing red flames.

    We slowly push in on him as:

<b>                        GHOSTS
</b>              Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.
              He served a dark and a vengeful god.
              What happened then--



<b>                                                      (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                                                   PAGE 4.
</b><b>1   CONTINUED: (3)                                                1
</b>
<b>                        GENTLEMAN
</b>              Well, who's to say?

<b>                        BANKER
</b>              And he wouldn't want us to give it away,

<b>                        GHOSTS
</b>                  (variously)
              Not Sweeney,
              Not Sweeney Todd,
              The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

    On this note, we push in tight on the figure of Todd...

    Music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we
    slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported
    to...

<b>2   EXT. SHIP -- THAMES -- ALMOST DAWN                             2
</b>
    ANTHONY, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail
    of a ship. We see the obscure shape of rigging and sails
    behind him. The cries of sailors echo.

    Behind him stand the GENTLEMAN and the BANKER. They are
    looking past Anthony, looking at something. They move away as
    Anthony peers through the fog, straining to see...

    London.

    Gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and
    mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in
    relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping
    toward its prey.

    Music continues as Anthony takes in the dreadful and
    magnificent spectacle of the 19th Century metropolis. The
    gnarl of rooftops. The labyrinth of streets and alleys. The
    black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from
    a thousand chimneys.

    London. Sulfurous London.

    Anthony is awestruck.

<b>                        ANTHONY
</b>              I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders
              From the Dardanelles
              To the mountains of Peru,
              But there's no place like London--!

    Then--


<b>                                                         (CONTINUED)
</b><b>                                                                  PAGE 5.
</b><b>2   CONTINUED:                                                    2
</b>


    Sweeney Todd steps to Anthony's side, grimly interrupting--

<b>                           TODD
</b>                 No, there's no place like London.

<b>                           ANTHONY
</b>                 Mr. Todd...?

<b>                           TODD
</b>                 You are young.
                 Life has been kind to you.

    Todd's glares forward, his haunted gaze never leaving the
    approaching city.

    Music continues as Todd stands very still and takes in the
    shadowy figures on the docks.

    Anthony seems almost lost at his side, overwhelmed by the
    scale and aura of the city.

<b>                           ANTHONY
</b>                 Lord ... takes your breath away,
                 doesn't it?

    Todd shudders violently, almost snarling.

<b>                            TODD
</b>                 There's a hole in the world
                 Like a great black pit
                 And the vermin of the world
                 Inhabit it
                 And its morals aren't worth
                 What a pig could spit
                 And it goes by the name Of London.
                 At the top of the hole
                 Sit the privileged few
                 Making mock of the vermin
                 In the lower zoo,
                 Turning beauty into filth and greed.
                 I too
                 Have sailed the world, and seen its wonders
                 For the cruelty of men
                 Is as wondrous as Peru,
                 But there's no place like London!

    Anthony looks at his friend, mystified by his grim reaction
    to the city.

    Anthony looking at him, questioning. Todd continues quietly:

<b>                           TODD
</b>                 There was a barber and his wife,
                 And she was beautiful,
                 A foolish barber and his wife,
                 She was his reason and his life,
                 And she was beautiful,
                 And she was virtuous.
                 And he was...
                     (a breath)
                 Naive.

    Anthony watches, rapt, as Todd remembers...

<b>4   EXT. FLOWER MARKET -- FLASHBACK -- DAY                         4

    ...Fifteen years before.

    Todd walks with his beautiful wife LUCY through a crowded
    flower market, a colorful explosion of blossoms. Lucy carries
    their one-year-old baby, JOHANNA.

    Todd is almost unrecognizable to us, content and smiling.
    Chatting with his wife. Happy.

<b>                           TODD (V.O.)
</b>                 There was another man who saw
                 That she was beautiful,
                 A pious vulture of the law,
                 Who with a gesture of his claw
                 Removed the barber from his plate.
                 Then there was nothing but to wait
                 And she would fall,
                 So soft,
                 So young,
                 So lost,
                 And oh, so beautiful!

    During the above, JUDGE TURPIN, an elderly man with a
    saturnine demeanor, eyes Lucy through the luxurious bunches
    of flowers. He stalks her, desiring her.

    With the Judge is his nefarious creature, BEADLE BAMFORD. The
    Beadle is a large man, his florid nature and pink, powdered
    face never quite disguising his lethality.

    The Judge whispers to the Beadle, indicating Todd. Then the
    Beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag Todd off. The
    Judge moves in on Lucy like a predator.

    And we return to...

    A quiet beat.

</b>                 I owe you my life, Anthony. If you
                 hadn't spotted me, I would be lost on
                 the ocean still ... Thank you.

    Todd picks up his duffel bag, preparing to go.

</b>                 Will I see you again?

</b>                 Until then, my friend.

    He offers his hand. Todd takes it and shakes.

    Then Todd quickly turns and goes.

    Anthony stands for a moment, saddened by the mysterious pall
    that hangs over his friend.

    Todd strides along, deep in thought. The emotions roiling
    within him finally seethe out in a dark mutter:

<b>                        TODD
</b>              There's a hole in the world
              Like a great black pit

              Who are filled with shit
              And the vermin of the world
              Inhabit it...

    He disappears down the street as the music THUNDERS--

    --We ZOOM ahead of Todd -- cutting through the city at
    lightning pace down twisting alleys and up crowded boulevards
    -- into tunnels and over bridges -- slashing through London
    at breakneck speed -- the insane explosion of music sending
    us hurtling to--

<b>8   EXT. THE PIE SHOP -- DAY                                       8

    Fleet Street.

    We see the exterior of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop. It is tatty
    and unloved by all. Yet it has a strange, ghostly presence to
    it. Imposing and dead at the same time.

    There is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened
    second floor room with a window overlooking the street.

    The music slows and continues as we see Todd, standing in
    front of the shop, considering it deeply.
    The GENERAL we saw before passes, glancing at Todd. Here and
    then gone.

    Todd finally strides to the shop and enters...

    Behind the dusty counter is...

    MRS. LOVETT, a venal, vigorous and slatternly woman in her
    40's.

    She is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with
    a wicked looking knife, her greasy hair hanging down over her
    face.

    The moment Todd enters -- and the bell at the door sounds --
    her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of
    prey:

<b>                           MRS. LOVETT
</b>                 A customer!

    Todd is startled, starts to go--

                 Did you come here for a pie, sir?
                      (Todd nods. She flicks a
                       bit of dust off a pie
                       with a rag)

              These are probably the worst pies in London.

              Is that just disgusting?

              The worst pies in London.

    During the following, she slams lumps of dough on the counter
    and rolls them out, grunting frequently as she goes:

     She finishes one of the crusts with a flourish as the music
     ends.

     Todd, meanwhile, is gulping at his ale, trying to wash down
     Mrs. Lovett's hideous creation.

     shop and into...

</b>                  Up there? Oh, no one will go near
                  it...

     She turns to him, something a little intense and probing
     about her gaze.

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT
</b>                  People think it's haunted.

     She holds his gaze.

</b>                  And who's to say they're wrong? ...
                  You see, years ago, something happened
                  up there. Something not very nice...
     The flickering flame from the fire begins to cast a more
     intense red glow on her face...

</b>                  There was a barber and his wife,

                  But they transported him for life.
                      (Sighs)
                  And he was beautiful...

     The music continues as she looks at him, again with that
     rather intense gaze:

     she remembers...

     Lucy is pacing, holding Baby Johanna to her closely. Lucy is
     distraught, strained, tears in her eyes.

     As Lucy paces we notice the room is full of dead and dying
     flowers: dozens of dried bouquets tossed aside and ignored.

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)

               Poor thing. Poor thing.

     Lucy moves to the window, looks out. She sees Judge Turpin
     and the Beadle waiting below. The Judge holds yet another
     bouquet.

               But did she come down from her tower?
               Sat up there and sobbed by the hour,
               Poor fool.

     Lucy moves away from the window, sobbing.

     The Beadle is leading a nervous Lucy along an exclusive
     street of dark stone mansions, grand but somehow menacing.
     Lucy is wearing her best dress.

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
</b>               The Beadle calls on her, all polite,

               The Judge, he tells her, is all contrite,
               He blames himself for her dreadful plight
               She must come straight to his house tonight!
               Poor thing, poor thing.

<b>13   INT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- BALLROOM -- FLASHBACK -- NIGHT       13
</b>
     The Beadle ushers Lucy into a ballroom. She is shocked to see
     a fancy-dress ball in progress.

     Masked couples swirl around the ballroom, their number
     sinisterly multiplied by the distorting mirrors that frame
     the room. The hanging chandeliers, draped in red cloth, cast
     a disquieting incarnadine glow on the proceedings...

               Poor thing, poor thing,
               They're having this ball all in masks.

     Lucy wanders lost through the swirling dancers, they buffet
     her, confusing her...

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT (V.O.)
</b>               There's no one she knows there,

               She wanders tormented, and drinks,
               Poor thing.
               The Judge has repented, she thinks,
               Poor thing.
               "Oh, where is Judge Turpin?" she asks.

     The Beadle finds Lucy again and graciously gives her his arm,
     leading her through the party. She is thankful for the
     salvation he provides. He brings her to Judge Turpin.

     The Judge descends on Lucy, raping her. The other guests
     crowd around ravenously, enjoying the spectacle. A feverish
     nightmare.

                  They figured she had to be daft, you see,

     creeping in.

     He continues with a chilling and quiet resolve as he stares
     with unblinking eyes into the fire:

     exterior staircase to the darkened second floor room. He
     hesitates.

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT

     She continues up, he slowly follows.

     A macabre shroud of dust and spider's webs. Furniture covered
     in sheets. A broken mirror on one wall.

     We hear footsteps approaching and then Mrs. Lovett enters.
     The door creaks like a living thing.

                  ... Nothing to be afraid of, love,
                  come in.

     She moves into the room. But Todd hesitates at the door,
     looking into the room.

     For him this is a truly haunted place.

     Meanwhile, she kneels and pries loose a floorboard.

     Underneath there is a hidden area. Within that, something
     covered with a velvet cloth. She removes it and carefully
     unwraps it. Her touch is particularly gentle and respectful.

     We discover it is a fine leather case. She looks at it for a
     beat. Then turns to him, dusting it off.

<b>                            TODD
</b>                  I don't believe it...

                  Cracked in the head, wasn't I?

     Haunting music begins as she opens the case...

     And we see it contains a beautiful set of razors.

     He stands for a long moment, gazing down at his beloved
     razors.

               His voice was soft, his manner mild.
               He seldom laughed but he often smiled,
               He'd seen how civilized men behave.
               He never forgot and he never forgave,
               Not Sweeney,

     Todd pulls a sheet off Baby Johanna's cradle. A cloud of dust
     rises.

     The ghosts disappear in the cloud of dust and Todd stands
     alone, staring at the cradle, holding his razor.

<b>17   EXT. EXCLUSIVE STREET -- DAY                                  17
</b>
     Anthony, now out of his sailor's uniform, is walking along
     the sidewalk near the Judge's mansion, absorbed in a copy of
     Baedeker's London.

     He stops, lost, trying to get his bearings, studying his map.

     Then an unusual sound emerges through the normal cosmopolitan
     bustle. It is the sound of a woman humming. He looks up to
     see...

     JOHANNA, a 16-year-old girl with golden hair, beautiful and
     hauntingly sad. She sits at her window above, behind bars,
     humming to herself as she does needlepoint.

     Anthony watches her, absolutely mesmerized.

     Johanna notices a Bird Seller passing. He carries a long,
     wooden pole with little bird cages attached.

<b>                         JOHANNA
</b>               Green finch and linnet bird,
               Nightingale, blackbird,
               How is it you sing?
               How can you jubilate,
               Sitting in cages,
               Never taking wing?
               Outside the sky waits,
               Beckoning, beckoning,
               Just beyond the bars.
               How can you remain,
               Staring at the rain,
               Maddened by the stars?
               How is it you sing
               Anything?
               How is it you sing?

     Then ... she sees Anthony on the sidewalk below.

     Music continues. There is a long look between them. Her
     intense, melancholy expression moves him.

     She continues singing, the strange anguish and yearning of
     her words seem intended only for him...

<b>                         JOHANNA
</b>               My cage has many rooms,
               Damask and dark.
               Nothing there sings,
               Not even my lark.
               Larks never will, you know,
               When they're captive.

                  Teach me to be more adaptive.

                  Green finch and linnet bird,
                  Nightingale, blackbird,
                  Teach me how to sing.
                  If I cannot fly,
                  Let me sing.

     Then she turns away quickly, alarmed, when someone enters her
     room. She looks terrified.

     Below, Anthony is concerned for her. He sees her move from
     the window.

     He is craning to see better when a BEGGAR WOMAN -- a filthy
     tendril of a woman, her foul clothes of rags like a second
     skin -- suddenly thrusts her arm up from the curb, imploring:

<b>                            BEGGAR WOMAN
</b>                  Alms! ... Alms! ...

                  On a miserable chilly morning...
                      (Anthony drops a coin into
                       her hand)
                  Thank yer, sir, thank yer.

<b>                            ANTHONY
</b>                  Ma'am, could tell me whose house this
                  is?

<b>                            BEGGAR WOMAN
</b>                  That's the great Judge Turpin's house
                  that is.

<b>                            ANTHONY
</b>                  And the young lady who resides there?
<b>                            BEGGAR WOMAN
</b>                  That's Johanna, his pretty little
                  ward. Keeps her snug, he does, all
                  locked up ... So don't you go
                  trespassing there or it's a good
                  whipping for you -- or any other young
                  man with mischief on his mind...

     She suddenly leers into a lewd and demented assault:

<b>                            BEGGAR WOMAN
</b>                  'Ow would you like a little muff, dear,
                  A little jig jig
                  A little bounce around the bush?
                  Wouldn't you like to push me parsley?

               It looks to me, dear,
               Like you got plenty there to push.

     She grabs at Anthony's crotch -- Anthony starts back -- she
     turns away, instantly plaintive again, and appeals to other
     pedestrians as she goes:

<b>                         BEGGAR WOMAN
</b>               Alms! ... Alms!...
               For a desperate woman...

     Anthony considers the mansion. He sees a figure standing at a
     window, unclear behind the shutters, watching him.

     He sits on a bench outside the mansion and sings quietly:

<b>                         ANTHONY
</b>               I feel you,
               Johanna,
               I feel you.
               I was half convinced I'd waken,
               Satisfied enough to dream you.
               Happily I was mistaken, Johanna!
               I'll steal you,
               Johanna,
               I'll steal you...

     Then the figure disappears from the window above. Anthony
     stands, waits. Then the doors to the mansion swing open...

     Anthony is expecting Johanna...

     But it is Judge Turpin, the predator we met in Todd's
     flashback, who steps into the doorway.

     He seems a different man now. Paternal and warm, he smiles
     and beckons to Anthony.

     Anthony hesitates, unsure. The Judge beckons again. Again the
     warm smile.

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               Come in, lad. Come in...

     Anthony goes into the mansion.

<b>18   INT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- LIBRARY -- DAY                       18
</b>
     Judge Turpin leads Anthony into the dark library, filled with
     books. Anthony is looking around for Johanna. He is wary,
     this is all very strange.

<b>                            JUDGE
</b>                  Sit down, lad, sit down.

     Anthony sits, uncomfortable, as the Judge pours two snifters
     of brandy.

<b>                            ANTHONY
</b>                  It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose

                  are.

     Then...

     The large form of the Beadle appears from the shadows. No
     introduction is made. Anthony glances to him, uneasy.

<b>                            JUDGE
</b>                  A sailor, eh?

</b>                  Yes, sir. The "Bountiful" out of
                  Plymouth.

<b>                            JUDGE
</b>                      (handing him a snifter of
                       brandy)
                  A sailor must know the ways of the
                  world, yes? ... Must be practiced in
                  the ways of the world ... Would you
                  say you are practiced, boy?

<b>                            ANTHONY
</b>                  Sir?

     The Judge moves to consider some beautiful volumes, bound in
     the richest leather. He runs a finger along the spines of the
     books; his large library of pornography.

               ... All the vile things you've done
               with your whores.

     Anthony is speechless. The Judge just smiles at him amiably.

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               Would you like to see?

<b>                         ANTHONY

               I think there's been some mistake--

<b>                         JUDGE

               ward, Johanna ... You gandered at her
               ... Yes, sir, you gandered.

     The Beadle moves behind Anthony.

<b>                         ANTHONY
</b>                   (glancing nervously back
                    at the Beadle)
               I meant no harm--

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               Your meaning is immaterial. Mark me:

               street, you'll rue the day your bitch
               of a mother gave you birth.

     Anthony is stunned. The Judge proceeds with shocking venom:

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               My Johanna isn't one of your bloody
               cock-chafers! My Johanna is not to be

     He nods to the Beadle -- the Beadle instantly grabs Anthony
     and brutally hauls him out.

<b>19   EXT. MANSION -- ALLEY -- DAY                                  19

     The Beadle drags Anthony through a rear door of the mansion
     and flings him into a filthy alley.

     Anthony pulls himself up. Stunned.

<b>                         BEADLE

     Flustered, Anthony turns to look--

     The instant Anthony's back is turned, the Beadle swings his
     lethal billyclub and SLAMS him from behind brutally, in the
     kidneys -- Anthony's knees buckle--

     The Beadle then SLAMS Anthony across the back of the neck --
     Anthony falls hard--

     The Beadle then uses one dainty foot to roll Anthony over--
     Anthony gazes up at him, panting for breath, in agony--

<b>                            BEADLE
</b>                  You heard Judge Turpin, little man.

     He presses the end of his billyclub into Anthony's forehead,
     grinding it hard--

<b>                            BEADLE
</b>                  Next time it'll be your pretty brains
                  all over the pavement.

     With that, the Beadle returns to the mansion and slams the
     door.

     Anthony slowly pulls himself to his knees, doubled over,
     coughing up blood.

     A long beat as Anthony gets his breath, wiping blood from his
     face.

     Still doubled over, he sings with burning intensity:
<b>                            ANTHONY

                  Even now I'm at your window.
                  I am in the dark beside you,
                  Buried sweetly in your yellow hair.

     He pulls himself up, every movement is agony. He makes his
     way down the alley, leaning on the wall for support.

<b>20   EXT. EXCLUSIVE STREET -- DAY                                   20

     The music swells as Anthony emerges from the dark alley into
     the bright sunlight. He makes his way along the sidewalk:

     The soaring music continues as Anthony stops at a park across
     the street from Turpin's mansion, bravely gazing up at
     Johanna's window.

<b>21   EXT. STREET LEADING TO ST. DUNSTAN'S MARKETPLACE -- DAY        21

     Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett are moving quickly, she
     struggles to keep up with his long, loping stride. He carries
     his razor case, she carries a shopping basket.

     They round a corner and move into the bustling marketplace. A
     steady mercantile hum as the cries of merchants and wandering
     coster-mongers fill the air.

     Todd and Mrs. Lovett move toward a hand-drawn caravan
     dominating one corner of the marketplace. It is painted like
     a Sicilian donkey cart and on its side a sign declaims:
     "Signor Adolfo Pirelli -- Haircutter to His Royal Majesty the
     King of Naples."

     The Beadle casually strolling through the crowd. Todd is

     Then, TOBY -- a 13-year-old boy, a bit small for his age,
     malnourished and consumptively pale -- emerges from Pirelli's
     caravan. He bangs on a tin drum, drawing customers.

     A crowd begins to gather at the caravan as:

<b>                            TOBY

                  Do you wake every morning in shame and despair
                  To discover your pillow is covered with hair
                  Wot ought not to be there?
                  Well, ladies and gentlemen,
                  From now on you can waken at ease.
                  You need never again have a worry or care,
                  I will show you a miracle marvelous rare,
                  Gentlemen, you are about to see something wot rose
                  from the dead!
                      (A woman gasps, he smiles
                       and wiggles a finger no)
                  On the top of my head.

     He dramatically doffs his cap, revealing mountains of hair
     which cascade to his shoulder.

     More customers are stepping up and buying bottles.

     Todd opens a bottle of the Elixir, takes a whiff. Disgusting.
     He smiles to Mrs. Lovett, his plan falling into place.

<b>                         TODD
</b>                   (loudly, to Mrs. Lovett)
               Pardon me, ma'am, what's that awful stench?

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT

</b>                   (to a woman in the crowd)
               Must be standing near an open trench!

     The crowd responds to Todd and Mrs. Lovett, looking askance
     and sniffing at the bottles. Toby nervously tries to distract
     them:

<b>                         TOBY

     The music speeds up -- Toby is getting desperate:

               Eats right through.

</b>               Yes, get Pirelli's!

               Ladies seem to love it--

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Flies do too!

     Suddenly, the curtains on the caravan are dramatically flung
     wide to reveal--

     PIRELLI, a flamboyant Italian with a velvet suit, thick wavy
     hair and a dazzling smile. Pirelli poses splendidly for a
     moment. Then:

<b>                         PIRELLI

                     boldly.)

               I have opened a bottle of Pirelli's
               elixir, and I say to you that it is
               nothing but an arrant fraud, concocted
               from piss and ink.

     The crowd gasps. Pirelli is about to respond, outraged, but
     Todd continues--

<b>                         TODD
</b>               And furthermore --   "signor" -- I have
               serviced no kings,   yet I wager I can
               shave a cheek with   ten times more
               dexterity that any   street mountebank.

     He snaps open his razor case and holds it up for the crowd to
     see, turning to display the wondrous razors:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               You see these razors?

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>                   (to the crowd)
               The finest in England.

<b>                         TODD
</b>                   (glaring at Pirelli)
               I lay them against five pounds you are
               no match for me. You hear me, sir?
               Either accept my challenge or reveal
               yourself as a sham.

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Bravo, bravo.

     The crowd is enjoying this now, whispering eagerly about the
     bold challenge. In the crowd, we see a quick flash of the
     meek TOURIST we saw earlier.

     Pirelli studies the razors for a moment and then turns to the
     crowd with a confident smile:
<b>                         PIRELLI
</b>               You hear zis foolish man? Watch and
               see how he will regret his folly!

     Music begins as Todd moves into action, preparing the
     challenge:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               Friends, who's for a free shave?

     Two men step forward. A plain wooden chair is brought for
     Todd as he moves into the boldest part of this plan...

     He carefully turns to ... The Beadle.

<b>                         TODD
</b>               Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?

</b><b>22   CONTINUED: (5)                                            22

     Mrs. Lovett's eyes shoot to Todd, alarmed--

     The Beadle moves toward Todd ....

     Todd smiles amiably, but quivers internally at being so
     dreadfully close to his prey...

     Mrs. Lovett watches, concerned. Will the Beadle recognize the
     features of Benjamin Barker...?

     Apparently not.

     The Beadle stops right before Todd and smiles.

<b>                         BEADLE
</b>               Glad, as always, to oblige my friends
               and neighbors
                   (to the crowd)
               ... Let the challenge commence!

     One man sits in Todd's plain chair as the other moves to an
     elaborate chair on Pirelli's caravan. Pirelli shakes out a
     fancy bib with a flourish and covers his man. Toby prepares
     Pirelli's ornate shaving supplies as Todd takes a plain towel
     and tucks it around his man's neck.

<b>                         BEADLE
</b>               Ready?

<b>                         PIRELLI

<b>                         TODD
</b>               Ready.

<b>                         BEADLE
</b>               The fastest, smoothest shave is the
               winner.

     He blows his shrill whistle. Agitated music begins.

     Pirelli strops his razor quickly, Todd in a leisurely manner.
     Pirelli keeps glancing at Todd in various paranoid ways
     throughout, frightened of Todd's progress. He starts whipping
     up lather rapidly:

<b>                         PIRELLI
</b>                   (while mixing furiously)

               To shave-a da Pope.
               Mr. Sweeney-so-smart--
                   (Splatters the customer
                     with shaving cream)
               Oh, I beg-a you pardon -- 'll

               Nope!
               It was-a da Pope!

     Unexpectedly, Todd still shows no signs of starting to shave
     his man. He merely watches Pirelli's performance. Mrs. Lovett
     looks at him nervously, wishing he would get on with it.

     Pirelli, now feeling he can take his time, sings lyrically as
     he lathers and shaves with rhythmic scrapes and elaborate
     gestures of wiping the razor.

<b>                         PIRELLI
</b>               To shave-a da face,
               To cut-a da hair,

               You rip-a da lip a bit
               Beyond-a repair!

     Todd strops his razor slowly and deliberately -- shoop,
     shoop, shoop -- disconcerting Pirelli and drawing the crowd's
     attention.

<b>                         PIRELLI
</b>               To shave-a da face

               It take-a da passion
               For da art.

     Todd is unconcerned. He just continues to slowly strop his
     razor -- shoop, shoop, shoop -- which flusters Pirelli.

     While Pirelli holds this note elaborately, Todd, with a few
     deft strokes, quickly lathers his man's face, shaves him and
     signals the Beadle to examine him.

<b>                         BEADLE
</b>                   (blowing whistle)
               The winner is Todd.

     Pirelli deflates.

</b>                   (feeling the customer's
                    cheek)
               Smooth as a baby's arse! -- (to Todd) -
               - Well done, dear!

     The crowd laughs and applauds Todd as Pirelli goes to him:

<b>                         PIRELLI
</b>                   (a profound bow)
               Sir, I bow to a skill far defter than
               my own.

<b>                         TODD
</b>               The five pounds.
     Pirelli produces a distinctive chatelaine purse and removes a
     five pound note, gives it to Todd:

<b>                         PIRELLI
</b>               Here, sir. And may the good Lord smile
               on you --
                   (a quick stab of a smile)
               -- Until we meet again.

     He bows his head quickly and then moves away, beckoning to
     Toby:

</b>               Come, boy.

     Without warning, Pirelli SLAPS Toby viciously across the face
     --Toby almost falls--

<b>                         PIRELLI
</b>                   (snarling)
               We're pulling out, yes. Quickly.

     Mrs. Lovett has observed all of this as she moves away with
     Todd, who is making his way inexorably toward the Beadle.

     Some eager customers surround Todd, among them is the
<b>     TOURIST.
</b>
<b>                         EAGER CUSTOMER
</b>               Mr. Todd, sir, do you have an
               establishment of your own?

     Mrs. Lovett is on him like a hawk:

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               He certainly does. Sweeney Todd's
               Tonsorial Parlor -- above my meatpie
               emporium in Fleet Street.

     Todd has led them right to the Beadle:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               I thank you for your honest
               adjudication, sir. You are a paragon
               of integrity.

<b>                         BEADLE
</b>               Well, I try to do my best for my
               friends and neighbors ... Your
               establishment is in Fleet Street, you
               say?
<b>                           TODD
</b>               Yes, sir.

<b>                         BEADLE
</b>               Then, Mr. Todd, you will surely see me
               there before the week is out.

<b>                         TODD
</b>               You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford,
               and I guarantee to give you, without a
               penny's charge, the closest shave you

</b>
     Todd and Mrs. Lovett are walking away from the marketplace.
     She chatters happily:

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               ... Like to give me a coronary right
               there! What if he had recognized you!
               Lord, my heart was beating a mile a
               minute, just like a little finch it
               was. Aren't those lovely birds now?
               Always so twittery and happy...

     She continues chattering...

     But Todd is not listening.

     His eyes dart to the side to see--

     The Gentleman is walking next to him, whispering, subtle,
     insinuating...

<b>                         GENTLEMAN
</b>               Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned.
               Like a perfect machine 'e planned...

     The Banker moves in next to the Gentleman...

<b>                         BANKER
</b>               Barbing the hook, baiting the trap,
               Setting it out for the Beadle to snap...

     The General joins them...

<b>                         GENERAL
</b>               Slyly courted 'im, Sweeney did,
               Set a sort of a scene 'e did...

<b>                          GENTLEMAN, BANKER AND GENERAL

               Letting it lead to higher places...
               Sweeney...

     The last word echoes ... And then they are gone ...
     disappearing from Todd's mind ... swallowed up by the crowd
     of pedestrians...

     Todd looks to Mrs. Lovett and she continues chattering:

<b>                               TODD
</b>                  Of course.

     But then his eyes dart again -- looking for the specters. He
     only sees strangers.

<b>24   INT. JOHANNA'S ROOM -- MORNING                                24
</b>
     Johanna sits, framed by the window, quietly cutting out
     silhouettes. Aimless Victorian handicrafts.

     But we see there are tears in her eyes.

     She steals a glance across the room. We see a small hole in
     the wallpaper. Through this hole, the Judge is watching her
     from another chamber. Lascivious. Perverse.

     Johanna finally stands and casually glances out from between
     the shutters at her window. She sees...

     Anthony, standing at the park across the street, keeping up
     his lonely vigil, gazing up at the mansion.

     She watches him for a moment and then makes her decision. She
     moves to a table and opens a drawer. Reaches in and removes
     something...

<b>25   EXT. TURPIN'S MANSION -- MORNING                              25
</b>     Anthony sees a figure at the shutters -- then hears a
     clinking sound. Metal on pavement.

     He quickly moves across the street and looks...

     A key, dropped from above.

     He looks up to the shutters and smiles, then snatches up the
     key and hurries off.

<b>26   INT. JOHANNA'S ROOM -- MORNING                                26
</b>
     Peering through the shutters, Johanna watches him go.

     We linger on her face and then dissolve to another face, also
     watching...
<b>                                                                  PAGE 37.

<b>27   INT. BARBER SHOP -- MORNING                                  27
</b>
     ... Her father.

     Todd's face, staring out the window, intense and brooding.
     Seething with discontent.

     Mrs. Lovett chatters as she moves around behind him:

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               ... It's not much of a chair, I'll
               grant, but it'll serve. Was me poor
               Albert's chair. Sat in it all day long
               he did, after his leg give out from
               the gout, poor dear.

     He moves from the window and paces like a caged tiger in the
     small barber shop.

     Though it has been cleaned, it is still a spartan room. A
     tatty parlor chair. A large chest. A few counters with meager
     bottles of tonsorial supplies. And his gleaming razors,
     always waiting.

<b>                         TODD
</b>               Why doesn't the Beadle come? "Before
               the week is out," that's what he said.

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               And who says the week's out? It's only
               Tuesday.

     Todd moves away from her, she pursues, trying to calm and
     soothe him...

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Easy now.
               Hush, love, hush.
               Don't distress yourself,
               What's your rush?
               Keep your thoughts
               Nice and lush.
               Wait.
                   (he continues to pace)
               Hush, love, hush.
               Think it through.
               Once it bubbles,
               Then what's to do?
               Watch it close.
               Let it brew.
               Wait.

     He does not respond. She dares to move closer...

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT
</b>                  I've been thinking, flowers--
                  Maybe daisies--
                  To brighten up the room.
                  Don't you think some flowers,
                  Pretty daisies,
                  Might relieve the gloom?
                  Ah, wait, love, wait.

     Todd sourly tosses himself into the chair, he picks up his
     largest razor and looks at it intensely:

<b>                             TODD
</b>                       (to razor)
                  And the Judge? When will we get to
                  him?

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT
</b>                  Can't you think of nothing else?
                  Always broodin' away on yer wrongs
                  what happened heaven knows how many
                  years ago...


                  Don't you know,
                  Silly man,
                  Half the fun is to
                  Plan the plan?
                  All good things come to
                  Those who can
                  Wait.

     Her gentle words have calmed him considerably. She moves even
     closer. Risks touching him softly...

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT
</b>                  Gillyflowers, maybe,

                  I don't know, though...
                  What do you think?


     Then Todd tilts the razor in his hand--

     SUDDENLY -- the face of the GENTLEMAN -- a flash -- reflected
     in the razor--

     Then--

     A bell rings from outside the shop -- the effect is electric
     -- Todd bolts up, senses alert -- Mrs. Lovett spins to the
     door--

     Todd holds his razor open as he moves strategically toward
     the door--

     We hear footsteps ascending the stairs outside quickly--

     Then--

     Anthony enters, breathless--

<b>                         ANTHONY
</b>               Mr. Todd! Thank God I've found you --
                   (Todd turns, closing the
                    razor, as Anthony sees
                    Mrs. Lovett)
               ... Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me...

               -- You see, there's a girl who needs

               lonely, but beautiful too and--

<b>                         TODD
</b>               Slow down, Anthony.

<b>                         ANTHONY
</b>                   (takes a breath)
               Yes, I'm sorry ... This girl has a
               guardian so tyrannical that he keeps
               her locked away. But then this morning
               she dropped this ...
                   (produces the key)

     Todd and Mrs. Lovett exchange a quick glance as Anthony
     continues:

               release her -- and beg her to come

                her till I've hired a coach to take us

     He looks at Todd deeply:

</b>                If I could keep her here, just for an
                hour or two, I would forever be in

     Todd stares at him, his mind racing to figure out how this
     new twist might aid in his plans.

     It is Mrs. Lovett who smoothly replies:

<b>                          MRS. LOVETT
</b>                Bring her here, dear.

     A beat.

                What is it, love? You'll have her back
                before the day is out.

<b>                          TODD

     Todd moves again to his post at the window, he stares out,
     deep in thought.

     Meanwhile, she happily moves around the shop, straightening
     things up and trying to make it all a bit more cozy:

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT

     Mrs. Lovett joins him at the window. Below, they see Pirelli
     approaching with Toby in tow.

     the muffled voices .... the sound of shoes walking...

     Toby:

     all in, savoring every second:

     Without a word of warning--

     Like a thunderbolt--

     Todd is on him.

     He leaps across the shop and brutally grabs Pirelli by the
     neck -- violently strangling him -- Pirelli is surprisingly
     strong and puts up a desperate struggle -- they thump
     awkwardly around the shop--

     Mrs. Lovett hears the muffled sounds of the struggle above.
     She nervously begins to shift and clang some things around as
     she cleans the counter, trying to cover the sound,
     chattering:

</b>                  Signor, you got an appointment...

     He stops when he realizes Pirelli is nowhere to be seen.

<b>                            TODD
</b>                  Signor Pirelli has been called away.

</b>                  Oh no, sir. I better wait for him here
                  or it'll be a lashing. He's a great
                  one for the lashings.

     He moves past Todd to the large chest and sits--

     Only now do we see one of Pirelli's hands protruding from the
     chest, dangling limply.

     Toby doesn't notice it. Todd at this moment, however, does.
     He smiles nervously.

<b>                            TODD

     Then Pirelli's hand ... twitches.

     Toby doesn't notice. Todd does, stares at it anxiously.

<b>                            TODD
</b>                  That she is ... that she is. But if I

                  An aching void.

     Pirelli's hand begins to twitch more desperately now,
     perilously close to where Toby's hand rests...

<b>                            TODD

     He races out happily and clatters down the stairs.

     A beat as Todd gets his breath.

     Then he goes to the trunk, leans down to open it, the camera
     follows him down and up again, when he rises--
     The GENTLEMAN is standing right behind him!

     Todd turns.

     The Gentleman's face is completely impassive. He is not
     spectral. He does not disappear. He just stands there.

     Todd looks at him.

     Then the Gentleman's eyes slowly move to a counter...

     Todd follows his look to see...

     His largest razor.

     A long beat as Todd looks at the razor.

     The point of no return.

     Todd strides to the razor and he snaps it open with a sharp,
     quick flick of his wrist--

     Then he moves to the chest and--

     With great ferocity he hauls Pirelli up--

     Pirelli's eyes snap open--

     And Todd SLASHES his throat--

     The piercing factory whistle SCREAMS--

     Todd remains standing over Pirelli as the painful whistle
     echoes into music...

     We see that the Gentleman is still standing there, watching
     Todd...

<b>                         GENTLEMAN
</b>               His hands were quick, his fingers strong.
               It stung a little but not for long.

     arms folded, looking at Todd...

<b>                         STUDENT
</b>               And those who thought him a simple clod

     The last word echoes to silence as we cut to:

     A high-angle shot of the room.

     The ghosts are gone.

     Todd stands alone over Pirelli's body. Blood dripping from
     his razor. Drip. Drip. Drip.

     Judge Turpin lurks over the proceedings.

     He sits, the personification of power, very high at the
     bench. He glares down a wasted wretch of a BOY. The Beadle
     stands next to the boy.

</b>               This is the second time, sir, that you

               Though it is my earnest wish to ever
               temper justice with mercy, your
               persistent dedication to a life of
               crime is an abomination before God and
               man.

     He places a black cloth on his head:

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               I therefore sentence you to hang by
               the neck until you are dead and may
               the Lord have mercy on your soul.

     The wretched boy collapses in sobs. The Beadle is pleased
     with the verdict.

     The Judge removes the black cloth and tosses it casually on
     his desk:

<b>                         JUDGE

                  I have news for you, my friend. In
                  order to shield her from the evils of
                  this world, I have decided to marry my
                  dear Johanna.

</b>                  Strange, though, when I offered myself
                  to her she showed a certain ...
                  reluctance.

     The Beadle proceeds with exquisite and obsequious delicacy:

<b>                            BEADLE
</b>                  Excuse me, my lord,
                  May I request, my lord,
                  Permission, my lord, to speak?
                  Forgive me if I suggest, my lord,
                  You're looking less than your best, my lord,

                  And stubble upon your cheek,

     As they round a corner, the Judge feels his chin:

     Mrs. Lovett is pouring Toby a glass of gin, not his first.

     He gulps down the gin between ravenous bites of another meat
     pie as she nervously glances up to the ceiling, wondering
     what the hell is going on up there.

<b>                           MRS. LOVETT

     He casually points the razor toward the chest.

     She lifts the lid and sees Pirelli's body at the bottom of
     the chest.

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT
</b>                      (spinning on Todd)

<b>                            TODD
</b>                  He recognized me from the old days. He
                  tried to blackmail me -- half my
                  earnings.

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT
</b>                      (relieved)
                  Oh well, that's a different matter!
                  For a moment there I thought you'd
                  lost your marbles!

     She looks into the chest again.

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT
</b>                  Ooooh! All that blood! Enough to make
                  you come all over gooseflesh, ain't
                  it? Poor bugger. Oh, well.

     She starts to close the chest, then has an idea.

     She reaches in and rummages around the body. Pulls out
     Pirelli's chatelaine purse, then drops the lid of the chest.

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT

               Now, Mr. T., surely one's enough for

               me poor knees not being what they used
               to be.

     Todd sighs and moves to his familiar post at the window:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               Anything you say.

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               'Course we'll have to stock up on the
               gin, the boy drinks like a Barbary
               sailor--

     Todd suddenly gasps -- a great, shocking intake of breath as
     his whole body tenses like iron--

     Mrs. Lovett spins to him--

<b>                            TODD
</b>               The Judge.

     Mrs. Lovett hurries to the window--
     Below, they can see the Judge and the Beadle approaching.
     They see them exchanging a few words and then the Beadle
     moves off as the Judge approaches the shop--

     Todd whispers, his eyes blazing:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               Justice ... Justice.

     Mrs. Lovett gives him a quick kiss and then very quickly
     leaves. A beat as Todd prepares himself.

     He turns from the window and looks around the shop, shifting
     nervously. Now that his great moment of revenge is at hand,
     he doesn't quite know what to do with himself.

     He snatches up his large razor, coils by the door, ready to
     attack. No. He wants to savor this. He quickly moves and puts
     the razor down.

     Finally he just stands. All his demons settling into a
     bizarre sort of calm.

     He hears the Judge's footsteps approaching on the stairs.
     Then the Judge enters.

<b>                           JUDGE
</b>               Mr. Todd?

     Todd slowly turns:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               The closest I ever gave.

     He whips a sheet over the Judge, then tucks the bib in. The
     Judge hums, flicking imaginary dust off the sheet; Todd
     whistles gaily.

<b>                         JUDGE

<b>                         JUDGE

<b>                         TODD
</b>               Pretty women.

     The Judge hums jauntily, Todd whistles and starts stropping
     his razor rhythmically. He then lathers the Judge's face.

     Still whistling, Todd stands back to survey the Judge, who is
     now totally relaxed, eyes closed.

     Todd goes to his razor and picks it up, sings to it gently:

     again and settles in comfortably...

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               And pretty as a rosebud.

     The music rises...

     The music builds as he steps behind the Judge-- his razor
     ready -- we are sure the great moment has come -- the music
     still builds -- Todd finally puts the razor at the Judge's
     throat--

     Then--

     With an easy flick of his wrist, he just begins to shave the
     Judge, as:

               Pretty women
               Are a wonder.
               Pretty women.

               Sitting in the window or
               Standing on the stair,
               Something in them
               Cheers the air.

               Pretty women...

<b>                         JUDGE

               Blowing out their candles or
               Combing out their hair...

     They sing simultaneously:
<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               Then they leave...
               Even when they leave you

                  As you're living--
                  Pretty women, sir!

     The music approaches a feverish crescendo as Todd prepares to
     finally kill the Judge and they sing simultaneously:

<b>                              JUDGE
</b>                  Pretty   women, yes!

                  Pretty women--

     Just as the music reaches a climax, Todd raises his arm in a
     huge arc and is about to slash the Judge's throat when--

     Suddenly--

     Anthony bursts in--

<b>                            ANTHONY
</b>                  Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna! She said
                  she'll leave with me tonight--!

     The Judge jumps up, away from Todd--

</b>                  You! -- There is indeed a higher power
                  to warn me thus in time--

                 slut! -- I'll lock her up in some

                 any other vile creature shall ever lay
                 eyes on her again--!

     He spins with venom to Todd:

<b>                           JUDGE
</b>                 And as for you, barber, it is all too

                 them well and hold their custom -- for
                 you'll have none of mine.

     He strides out.

     Todd stands, frozen.

     Todd suddenly turns on him with a ferocious ROAR:

<b>                           TODD
</b><b>                 OUT! OUT, I SAY!
</b>
     Utterly stunned at his friend's ferocity, Anthony backs away,
     leaves the shop.

     Music begins, very agitated, as Todd stands motionless.

     In shock.

     His mind cracking apart.
     Mrs. Lovett hurries in:

<b>                           MRS. LOVETT
</b>                 All this shouting and running about,

<b>                           TODD

               You told me to wait!
               Now he'll never come again...

     The music becomes ferocious as Todd's wrenching insanity,
     always close to the surface, finally explodes:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               There's a hole in the world
               Like a great black pit
               And it's filled with people
               Who are filled with shit
               And the vermin of the world
               Inhabit it--
               But not for long!

     He suddenly looks to Mrs. Lovett -- she starts back --
     alarmed by the pure madness in his eyes--

<b>                         TODD
</b>               They all deserve to die!
               Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett,
               Tell you why:
               Because in all of the whole human race, Mrs. Lovett
               There are two kinds of men and only two.
               There's the one staying put
               In his proper place

               In the other one's face--
               Look at me, Mrs. Lovett,
               Look at you--

     He suddenly lurches and grabs Mrs. Lovett tightly--

               Because the lives of the wicked should be--
                   (slashes at the air
                    violently)
               Made brief.
               For the rest of us, death
               Will be a relief--
               We all deserve to die!

     He clutches her to him very tightly as he suddenly keens, a
     howl of pure agony:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               And I'll never see Johanna,
               No, I'll never hug my girl to me--

     He hurls Mrs. Lovett away from him--

     We are moving with him as he stalks relentlessly, holding his
     razor, striding down a busy street like a tiger.

                  And I'm full of JOOOOOOY!!

     He raises his razor high on the soaring last note as we pull
     back ... our view is suddenly obscured by a strange, frenzied
     fluttering of black wings ... We continue to pull back ... We
     discover the black wings are pigeons, thousands of them,
     flying up in a great cloud...

     We continue to pull back to finally discover that Todd is
     kneeling in the heart of a church square...

     Empty but for him.

     As his cry ends we slash back to--

     -- Todd is kneeling, sweat pouring through his clothes,
     panting for air.

     Mrs. Lovett stands, looking down at him intently.

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT
</b>                  That's all very well, but what are we

                      (kicks the chest)
                  -- the dear departed?

     Todd remains kneeling, motionless. She goes to him, firm:

</b>                  Listen! Do you hear me? Get a hold of

               do about that?

               him to some secret place and bury him.

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Well, yes, of course, we could do
               that. I don't suppose he's got any
               relatives going to come poking around
               looking for him...

     A chord of music. A beat. An idea. He looks at her
     uncomprehendingly.

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Well, you know me, sometimes bright
               ideas just pop right into my head, and
               I keep thinking...
               Seems a downright shame...

<b>                          TODD
</b>               Shame?

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Seems an awful waste...
               Such a nice plump frame
               Wot's-his-name

               Had...
               Has...
               Nor it can't be traced.
               Business needs a lift--

                  As a gift...
                  If you get my drift...
                      (Todd has no idea what she
                       is talking about)
                  No?
                      (She sighs)
                  Seems an awful waste.
                  I mean,
                  With the price of meat what it is,
                  When you get it,
                  If you get it--

     Todd suddenly understands:

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT
</b>                  Good, you got it.
                      (She warms to the idea)
                  Take, for instance,
                  Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop.
                  Business never better, using only
                  Pussycats and toast.
                  And a pussy's good for maybe six or
                  Seven at the most.
                  And I'm sure they can't compare
                  As far as taste--

                  What a charming notion,

     The music builds as they sing simultaneously:

                  How delectable!
                  Also undetectable.

               Lovett, and desperate measures are
               called for.

     She goes to the counter and comes back with an imaginary pie:

     smile.

               Awful lot of fat.

<b>49   INT. JOHANNA'S ROOM -- EVENING                                49
</b>
     Small, white hands ... removing some clothes from a drawer
     ... putting them into a portmanteau ... locking the case...

     Johanna, wearing traveling clothes, is packing to leave when
     a voice surprises her:

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               So it's true.

     She turns. The Judge stands in the doorway.

<b>                         JOHANNA
</b>               Sir ... A gentlemen knocks before
               entering a lady's room.

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               Indeed he does ... But I see no lady.

     He enters, dangerously quiet. And terrifically hurt.

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               I told myself the sailor was lying ...
               I told myself this was a cruel fiction
               ... That my Johanna would never betray
               me. Never hurt me so.

     He moves toward her. She stands her ground.

<b>                         JOHANNA
</b>               Sir ... I will leave this place.

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               I think that only appropriate. Since
               you no longer find my company to your
               liking, madam, we shall provide you
               with new lodgings.

     He stands very close to her. Still she holds her ground.

<b>                         JUDGE
</b>               Until this moment I have spared the
               rod ... And the ungrateful child has
               broken my heart. Now you will learn
               discipline...

     The large form of the Beadle fills the doorway. She glances
     to him, disquieted.

     He nods to the Beadle -- the Beadle surges forward and grabs
     Johanna brutally--

     She screams and fights like a tiger -- to no avail--

     The Beadle covers her mouth with one of his huge hands and
     hauls her out--

     Anthony is racing toward the front of mansion when he sees--

     A hansom cab is just pulling away -- Johanna's terrified face
     looking at him through the window--

<b>                             ANTHONY
</b><b>                  JOHANNA!
</b>
     Anthony sees the Beadle pulling her away from the window as
     the carriage clatters off--

     Judge Turpin stands on the steps of the mansion -- Anthony
     goes to him in a murderous rage:

<b>                            ANTHONY
</b>                  Where are you taking her?! Tell me or
                  I swear by God--!

     The Judge spins and roars -- a hellish howl that echoes--

</b><b>                  WOULD YOU KILL ME, BOY?! HERE I STAND!

     Anthony's eyes burn into the Judge -- but he is no killer.

     He turns and races after the hansom cab. It rounds a corner
     and is gone.

     The Judge watches as Anthony pursues the cab, disappearing
     around the corner.

     And we fade to...

     She sits, crouched on her haunches, peering up from under her
     few greasy locks of hair.

     She is watching something intently. A few pedestrians move
     quickly down the sidewalk past her, excited. They chatter
     back and forth eagerly...

     The Beggar Woman uncoils and follows...

     And we finally see what the Beggar Woman has been watching so
     intently...

<b>52   EXT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                          52
</b>
     Mrs. Lovett's wretched establishment has been transformed!

     She has created a modest outdoor eating garden with tables,
     surrounded by glowing Chinese lanterns. A fresh coat of
     paint, a few bushes in pots and birds in cages add to the
     feeling of upward mobility.

     A new sign hangs proudly over the entrance to the pie shop:
     "MRS. LOVETT'S WORLD FAMOUS MEAT PIES!" And then in smaller
     letters: "LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE."

     The eating garden is already crowded, the benches at the
     tables are filled and other customers stand and mill about.

     All eating, eating, eating...

     ...The most delicious looking meat pies you could ever
     imagine. Crispy crust. Thick, luxurious gravy. Tart and tangy
     meat.

     The customers take great, hungry mouthfuls; the steaming
     gravy oozing down greedy faces.
     Chomp. Chomp. Chomp.

     The Beggar Women stands across the street, ravenously hungry.
     She finally gets the nerve to approach when--

     Toby -- wearing a spiffy new outfit with apron -- bursts from
     the shop and circulates through the customers:

<b>                            TOBY
</b>                  Ladies and gentlemen,
                  May I have your attention, perlease?
                  Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well
                  At that delicate, luscious ambrosial smell?
                  Yes they are, I can tell...

</b>
     He moves through the greedily eating customers in the outdoor
     garden and toward the street as:

<b>                            TOBY
</b>                  Well, ladies and gentlemen,
                  That aroma enriching the breeze
                  Is like nothing compared to its succulent source,
                  As the gourmets among you will tell you, of course.

     He arrives at the street and drums up some more business:

<b>                            TOBY
</b>                  Ladies and gentlemen,
                  You can't imagine the rapture in store--
                      (Indicating the pie shop)
                  Just inside of this door!
                  There you'll sample
                  Mrs. Lovett's meat pies,
                  Savory and sweet pies,
                  As you'll see.
                  You who eat pies,
                  Mrs. Lovett's meat pies
                  Conjure up the treat pies
                  Used to be!

     Just then Mrs. Lovett sweeps from the pie shop with a tray of
     hot, steaming pies.

     Like her shop, she has been transformed as well. She wears
     her somewhat gauche notion of a "fancy dress." Buckets of
     decolletage. And her hair has been dyed a rather unique
     aubergine color.

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT

     The customers suddenly exclaim their joy through awkward
     mouthfuls of pie:

<b>                         CUSTOMERS
</b>               God, that's good!

     Toby scurries inside to get a jug of ale, whisks back out and
     starts filling tankards as Mrs. Lovett circulates grandly.

     She is a bundle of activity -- serving pies, collecting
     money, giving orders, addressing the patrons individually and
     with equal buoyant insincerity:

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Nice to see you, dearie...
               How have you been keeping?...

               Hear the birdies cheeping--
               Helps to keep it cheery...

     She spots the Beggar Woman approaching and responds with
     unusual ferocity:

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Toby!

<b>                         CUSTOMERS
</b>               God, that's good!

     Toby shoos the Beggar Woman away, but she soon comes skulking
     back.

     screwing, hammering. Doing something we cannot see to his
     barber chair. Making adjustments, tinkering, building,
     feverish. Happy.

     unique refinements.

     He leaves the barber shop...

     away.

     Todd is alone. He sits in the barber chair, smoking a pipe.
     He is holding an old Daguerreotype; creased, stained and
     bleached-out.

     The image shows his wife, Lucy, smiling and holding Baby
     Johanna. The child's features are almost completely obscured
     by a stain on the picture.

     He looks at it deeply.

     Then church bells echo in the distance...

     Mrs. Lovett and Todd rest on a picnic blanket, just like any
     other couple out enjoying the fine day.

     The remains of a nice picnic lunch are scattered around them
     and Toby can be seen flying a kite a bit away.

     Mrs. Lovett watches happy couples moving about ... dogs and
     kids running hither and yon ... military officers squiring
     their ladies ... nurses with prams...

     Todd is distinctly ill at ease, brooding, as she chatters:

                    unresponsive Todd)

     cheek:

     to imagine a wonderful, domestic future...

     ...In Mrs. Lovett's mind.

     She and Todd sit in the exact same positions as in Hampstead
     Heath. Only now they are sitting on a beach.

     They are wearing what she imagines as fashionable seaside
     bathing clothes.

     Toby, who is not consumptively pale but overly rosy-cheeked
     in her fantasy, is building a sandcastle nearby.

     Mrs. Lovett is sitting with her Dream Todd, of course, so he
     has a bland smile on his face. Somewhat unnatural.

     In fact, there is something vaguely unreal and stilted about
     all of this.

     He turns back to the window.

     Mrs. Lovett proceeds with great sincerity:

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT

</b>                  We could have a life we two ... Maybe

     He does not answer.

<b>                            MRS. LOVETT

     A long beat.

     He finally turns from the window. Almost as if to leave his
     demons behind...
     She smiles quietly and holds out her hand...

     She begins to cross to him...

<b>     SUDDENLY REVEALING--

     The Gentleman!

     Standing right behind Mrs. Lovett--

     He is glaring at Todd, relentless and accusatory--

     Blood pouring from his throat--

     A shocking horror movie vision--

     Then the bell rings outside the shop ... Todd turns ... the
     Gentleman is gone ... we hear footsteps climbing the
     stairs...

     Mrs. Lovett remains standing, her hand out to him, as--

     Anthony enters, absolutely exhausted.

<b>                         ANTHONY
</b>               Mr. Todd ... Mrs. Lovett, ma'am ...

<b>                         ANTHONY
</b>                   (bitter)
               He has her locked in a madhouse.

     Todd's head snaps to Anthony, riveted:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               You've found Johanna?

<b>                         ANTHONY
</b>               For all the good it'll do -- it's
               impossible to get to her.

     Todd begins pacing, the tiger again, his mind is racing--

<b>                         TODD
</b>               A madhouse ... A madhouse ... Where?

<b>                         ANTHONY
</b>               Fogg's Asylum. But I've circled the
               place a dozen times. There's no way
               in. It's a fortress.

     Anthony fades to a brooding silence as Todd continues pacing,
     thinking, thinking. Mrs. Lovett watches him, concerned.

     Todd suddenly stops...

     We see him settling into an inspired sort of calm, as if he
     can finally see the Promised Land.

<b>                         TODD

               all the wigmakers of London go to
               obtain their human hair? Bedlam. They
               get their hair from the lunatics at
               Bedlam--

<b>                         ANTHONY
</b>               I don't understand--

     Todd suddenly grabs Anthony and hauls him up -- holds him
     close, forehead to forehead -- his whispered intensity truly
     disturbing:

<b>                         TODD
</b>               We shall set you up as a wigmaker in
               search of hair -- that will gain you
               access -- then you will take her.

<b>                            ANTHONY

<b>                         TODD

<b>                            ANTHONY
</b>               Yes.

     Mrs. Lovett watches, troubled, as Todd embraces Anthony
     closely. He holds him for a long beat.

     Then Todd is all action, hurries to get some money and gives
     it to Anthony, as:
<b>                         TODD

<b>                            TODD

     Anthony hurries out.

     Todd immediately hurls himself into a chair and begins
     writing a letter, his violent scrawl slashing across the
     page.

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Dear, I wonder if--

</b>
     Mrs. Lovett begins going down the stairs outside the barber
     shop.

     Then she stops. She stands for a long moment, disturbed that
     Todd's demons are again devouring him.

     She looks down and sees Toby washing the tables in the
     outdoor garden. Toby is serious about his work, vigorously
     scrubbing the tables with soap and water.

     She watches him for a moment and then continues down the
     steps:

<b>                         MRS. LOVETT
</b>               Toby ... Mr. Todd requires you.
<b>                           TOBY
</b>               Yes'm.

     He goes up the steps. She just stands, deep in thought.

      Todd pounces like a panther--

      He suddenly leaps up and grabs Toby by the throat with
      shocking brutality--

<b>                             TODD

<b>                   UNDERSTAND?!
</b>
      Toby is stunned and terrified. It is the first time he has
      seen this side of his friend, Mr. Todd.
      Todd releases him. Toby races out.

      Todd immediately begins pacing like a caged animal, back and
      forth, back and forth, whispering to himself neurotically, as
      day becomes evening...

      Toby walks back to the pie shop, upset.

      He stops when he sees Todd at the window above, unblinking,
      gazing like a falcon into the street.

      He continues on to Mrs. Lovett, who is clearing up the
      remains of a meal in the outdoor garden.

                new penny and you can fetch us some
                nice toffees--?

      She pulls Pirelli's chatelaine purse from her dress--

</b>                That's Signor Pirelli's purse!

                     pulling her hand)
                We gotta go, ma'am, right now -- we
                gotta find the Beadle and get the law
                here--

      She pulls him down to her again, agitated, her mind racing:

<b>                          MRS. LOVETT
</b>                Hush now, Toby, hush ... Here, you

                ... How could you think such a thing
                of Mr. Todd, who's been so good to us?

      He calms down a bit as she holds him.

      And she comes to a painful, dreadful decision.
<b>                          MRS. LOVETT
</b>                Nothing's gonna harm you,

                Nothing's gonna harm you,
                Not while I'm around.

      The music continues as she holds him. There are tears in her
      eyes. But we see that her gentle song has calmed him.

      toward the bakehouse.

      She arrives at the heavy iron door to the bakehouse. We can
      hear the seismic rumble of the bake oven within.
      She unbolts the door and ushers Toby in.

      And we finally enter...

      A macabre vision of Hell.

      The roof hangs low in this subterranean chamber. The grisly
      tools of her trade are scattered about the place: a large,
      stained chopping block; a meat grinder; buckets of
      questionable viscous liquid; cleavers and bone saws and meat
      hooks; wet sewer grates for the blood.

      A metal sheet, hinged at the top, has been attached to cover
      an opening in the wall: the mouth of the chute from the
      barber shop above.

      And eeriest of all ... the thundering roar of flame coming
      from a large industrial oven against one wall.

      Toby takes in the cavernous bakehouse:

<b>                             TOBY
</b>                   Coo, quite a stink, ain't there?

</b>                   Those grates go right down to the

                   a few rats gone home to Jesus down
                   there.

<b>                             TOBY
</b>                   So -- where do I start?!

      She leads him across to the thrumming, fiery oven:

<b>                             MRS. LOVETT
</b>                   Now this would be the bake oven ...

                   the doors is closed properly, like

      She leads him to the meat grinder:

</b>                   And here's the grinder ...

       A cacophony of madness. The ragged inmates of the asylum are
       slammed together in a series of cramped cells, the low
       ceiling pressing down.

       We discover Anthony, dressed as a fashionable wigmaker,
       walking past the cells with the odious MR. FOGG. Fogg carries
       a large pair of scissors.

<b>                           FOGG
</b>                 ... Oh yes, sir, I agree it would be
                 to our mutual interest to come to some
                 arrangement in regard to my poor
                 children's hair.

       He moves to one of the cells and unlocks it:
<b>                           FOGG
</b>                 I keep the blondes over here. It was
                 yellow hair you was looking for, sir?

<b>                           ANTHONY
</b>                 Yes.

       Fogg goes into the crowded cell -- the inmates, all blonde
       women, scurry back, clearly terrified of Fogg. Anthony sees
       Johanna, wearing a filthy straitjacket, hunched like a feral
       animal, cowering in a corner of the cell.

<b>                           ANTHONY

      Fogg goes to fetch Johanna, hauls her to Anthony:

<b>                             FOGG
</b>                   Come, child. Smile for the gentleman
                   and you shall have a sweetie.

      Johanna's eyes shoot wide when she sees Anthony, but she says
      nothing.

<b>                             FOGG
</b>                       (prepares scissors)
                   Now, where shall I cut?

      Before Fogg can react -- Anthony pulls a revolver from his
      clothing, grabs Johanna and pushes Fogg back into the cell.
      He swings the cell door shut, locking Fogg in.

<b>                             ANTHONY
</b>                   Not a word, Mr. Fogg, or it will be
                   your last ... Now, I leave you to the
                   mercy of your "children."

      He grabs Johanna and pulls her away.

      Mr. Fogg turns. He is locked in with the blonde inmates. They
      slowly begin to advance on him. Menacing. It is likely they
      are going to rip him limb from limb...

      Mrs. Lovett allows herself a breath.

      From across the street, we see Todd leading the Beadle up the
      stairs to the barber shop, chatting with him easily.

      We realize we are seeing the perspective of the Beggar Woman,
      hunched across the street, watching them closely.

<b>108   INT. BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING                                  108
</b>      Toby is eating a pie as he slowly wanders around the
      bakehouse.

      He stops to consider the many stained cleavers and bone saws,
      curious.

      Then he bites on something hard -- stops -- he reaches into
      his mouth and pulls something out. Looks at it:

      It is a fingernail.

      To be exact, it is the severed tip of a finger.

      Toby drops it in horror and starts back--

      Suddenly, a loud THUMPING and CLANGING makes him spin,
      alarmed--

      As --

      The bloody body of the Beadle EXPLODES SUDDENLY from the
      mouth of the chute--

      Toby screams and races to the door--

      Pulls at it. Locked. No use. He bangs on the heavy iron door
      wildly:

<b>                             TOBY

</b><b>                   MRS. LOVETT!
</b>
      The thundering roar from the bake oven seems to rise to match
      his frenzy as--

      In panic, Toby races to the sewer grate, yanks it up and
      disappears down into the sewers as the shrill factory whistle
      SCREAMS and we cut to--

      Todd stands by the chair, his razor high--

      His eyes blazing--

      His face covered in a spray of blood--

      Lost in rapture.

      Not for long.

      The Gentleman, the Banker, the General move into the frame
      with purpose, impatient.
      The Gentleman flicks out his handkerchief and begins to clean
      the blood off Todd's face -- he is not gentle, the blood
      smears--

      and hands Todd his jacket--

      Todd sees that more and more of the ghastly specters are
      moving around the room -- multiplying exponentially -- we see
      the TOURIST, the STUDENT, the PRIEST and others.

      They are more intrusive than they have ever been -- touching
      Todd -- eagerly preparing him for the finale of his drama --

      She turns to the window, watches him go. Her expression is

      to get a bottle of bay rum--

<b>                          TODD

</b>                You're in a merry mood again today,
                barber.

      They sing simultaneously as Todd smoothes bay rum on the
      Judge's face and then reaches for his razor:

<b>                          JUDGE
</b>                Pretty women!

                Blowing out their candles
                Combing out their hair--
                Then they leave--
                Even when they leave you
                And vanish, they somehow
                Can still remain
                There with you there...

<b>                          TODD
</b>                Pretty women!

                Blowing out their candles
                Or combing out their hair,

                Even when they leave,
                They still
                Are there,
                They're there...
      The music builds dangerously as:

                But then, I suppose the face of a

                the dock -- is not particularly
                memorable.

      The factory whistle screams a steady, terrible blast as--

      Todd brutally SLASHES the Judge's throat--

      Severing his jugular--

      The spray of blood drenches Todd--

      He pulls the lever and sends the body tumbling out of sight
      down the chute.

      The music continues...

      As Todd stands for a long moment, blood dripping from his
      face, exalted.

      Then he sinks to his knees, overcome.

      The music stops.

      A long beat of silence.

      Then Todd looks at his razor deeply:
<b>                          TODD
</b>                Rest now, my friend,
                Rest now forever,
                Sleep now the untroubled
                Sleep of the angels.

      Then silence as he reverently sets the razor on the floor and
      looks at it.

      We focus on his face.

      His quest is completed.

      His demons silenced.

      The ghosts are gone.

      It's done.

      He just kneels there. No reason to move. No purpose in life.

      Then...

      A sound from the chest. A slight thump.

      His eyes dart to the chest.

      He slowly picks up his razor and moves to the chest. Then
      suddenly WRENCHES it open and HAULS out Johanna--

<b>                             TODD

<b>                                JOHANNA

      He tosses her in the chair, throws back his arm, his razor
      ready--

<b>      SUDDENLY -- A PIERCING SCREAM ECHOES UP FROM THE CHUTE --
</b>      Mrs. Lovett's voice -- screaming to raise the dead--

      Todd rivets Johanna, pointing the razor at her, a lethal
      warning:

<b>                             TODD
</b>                   Forget my face.
      He spins and bolts out of the shop, leaving her sitting in
      the chair--

<b>114   INT. BAKEHOUSE -- NIGHT                                      114

      Mrs. Lovett is standing in horror by the mouth of the chute.
      The Judge, still barely alive, clutches at her skirt--

      She tries to wrench herself away from his vise-like grip--

<b>                             MRS. LOVETT
</b>                   Die! Die! God in heaven -- die!

      The Judge's fingers finally relax their grip; he is dead.

      Panting, Mrs. Lovett, backs away from him and for the first
      time notices the body of the Beggar Woman.

                   Hell come to torment me?!

      She grabs the Beggar Woman and starts dragging her quickly
      toward the oven as Todd races in:

<b>                             TODD

      She continues quickly dragging the Beggar Woman toward the
      oven.

<b>                             TODD
</b>                   Leave them to me. Open the doors.

      He waves her toward the oven--

<b>                             MRS. LOVETT
</b>                   No! Don't touch her!

      He shoves her toward the oven and leans over to pick up the
      Beggar Woman's body--

      Then -- Mrs. Lovett opens the oven doors--

      The thundering roar from the oven crashes through the room as
      the fiery light slashes across the floor--

      Clearly illuminating the face of the Beggar Woman.

      A chord of music as Todd realizes who she is. Music continues
      and builds as:

                As you've said repeatedly,
                There's little point in dwelling on the past.

      He steps toward her, she steps back, unsure, as they sing
      simultaneously:

                Can we still be
                Married?

      Todd steps toward her darkly.

      She knows she is doomed.

      But steps into his arms anyway for a final, triumphant waltz:

<b>                          TODD
</b>                The history of the world, my pet--

                By the sea, Mr. Todd,
                Where there's no one nosy...

      He waltzes her toward the roaring oven.

      She offers no resistance, fully aware of what's coming.

      The blazing, thundering inferno of the oven makes it seem
      they are the damned, dancing through Hell.

<b>                          TODD

      The music reaches a thundering crescendo as--

      He flings her into the oven and slams the doors--

      We hear her screaming. And banging on the oven doors.

      Todd sinks to his knees and covers his ears desperately as
      the banging and screaming and music finally fade to silence.

      Then he slowly drags himself across the floor to the Beggar
      Woman.

      He cradles her head in his arms.

      A long beat.

      Then he becomes aware of something. He looks over to see....

      Toby -- staring at him from the open sewer grate. He has seen
      everything.

      Todd watches as Toby silently pulls himself up. Todd gently
      sets Lucy down and then, still kneeling, turns to face Toby.

      A long beat as they look at each other.

      Then Toby slowly moves and carefully picks up Todd's razor.

      Todd looks at him.

      Then slowly unbuttons his collar and exposes his neck.

      He bends his head back, offering his naked throat.

      Toby slowly goes to him and methodically slits his throat.
      Todd continues to gaze up at Toby as we hear the lonely sound
      of wind escaping from his severed wind pipe.

      Then Toby turns and leaves the bakehouse.

      Todd leans forward, dying.

      We cut to his point-of-view:

      The rough brick floor...

      From the bottom of the frame...

      A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up
      the frame ... the fiery glow from the bake oven reflected in
      the blood...

      Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame.

      We realize this is the first image we saw in the story.
      Todd's perspective. Todd's blood. As he dies.

      As before, the Gentleman's face appears, reflected in the
      pool of blood...

<b>                          GENTLEMAN
</b>                Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd,
                His skin was pale and his eye was odd.

      The Banker emerges from the shadows of the bakehouse...

<b>                          BANKER
</b>                He shaved the faces of gentlemen
                Who never thereafter were heard of again.

      The General emerges ... and the Tourist ... and the Priest
      ... and the Student...

<b>                          GHOSTS
</b>                    (variously)
                He trod a path that few have trod,
                Did Sweeney Todd,
                The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

      Then a new ghost ... a face we recognize ... the Beggar
      Woman...

<b>                          BEGGAR WOMAN
</b>                He kept a shop in London town,
                Of fancy clients and good renown.

      She is joined by the Judge...
<b>                          JUDGE
</b>                And what if none of their souls were saved?
                They went to their maker impeccably shaved.

                By Sweeney Todd,
                The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

      The Beadle and Pirelli join the ghosts...

<b>                          PIRELLI AND BEADLE
</b>                Swing your razor wide, Sweeney!
                Hold it to the skies!

                Who moralize!

      The ghosts move around the bakehouse, considering the meat
      grinder and stained cleavers and chopping block...

<b>                          GHOSTS

                His needs are few, his room is bare.
                He hardly uses his fancy chair.
                The more he bleeds, the more he lives.
                He never forgets and he never forgives.
                Perhaps today you gave a nod
                To Sweeney Todd.
                The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.

      Hunting like predators, we begin to move urgently through the
      ghosts. Their long shadows tower bizarrely against the walls
      and ceiling of the bakehouse. The fiery red roar of the bake
      oven builds in intensity...

<b>                          GHOSTS
</b>                    (variously)
                Sweeney wishes the world away,
                Sweeney's weeping for yesterday,
                Hugging the blade, waiting the years,
                Hearing the music that nobody hears.
                Sweeney waits in the parlor hall,
                Sweeney leans on the office wall.
                No one can help, nothing can hide you--
                Isn't that Sweeney there beside you?
                Sweeney wishes the world away,
                Sweeney's weeping for yesterday,
                Is Sweeney!
                There he is, it's Sweeney!
                Sweeney! Sweeney!

      We tear through them with increasing frenzy -- cutting
      quickly, vertiginous angles -- as the music builds--
<b>                          GHOSTS
</b>                    (variously)
                There! There! There! There!
                There! There! There!
                    (almost a scream now)
                There!

      They move away--

      Revealing--

      Todd and Mrs. Lovett. Facing each other.

      We circle them:

</b>                    (sharply to Mrs. Lovett)
                To seek revenge may lead to hell.

<b>                          MRS. LOVETT
</b>                    (coldly to him)
                But everyone does it, if seldom as well--

<b>                          TODD AND MRS. LOVETT
</b>                --As Sweeney...

<b>                          GHOSTS
</b>                As Sweeney Todd...
                The Demon Barber of Fleet...

      The ghosts begin to disappear ... fading into the shadows of
      the bakehouse ... leaving Todd and Mrs. Lovett alone...

<b>                          GHOSTS
</b>                ... Street!

      The febrile music continues as Todd and Mrs. Lovett stand
      alone, continuing to glare at each other.

      Finally she gives him a grim little smile and disappears into
      the darkness.

      He stands alone.

      And we cut to--

      A series of images from earlier in our story, cut to the music --
      Todd's life flashing before his eyes --

      The images building as the music races toward its conclusion--

      Todd singing -- slashing -- smiling -- striding--

      The final crash of music at the final image:

      Todd kneeling, hunched over the pool of blood on the
      bakehouse floor.

      He falls...

      Into the blood.

      Dead.
