<b>TITLE: THE ABYSS -- ON BLACK, DISSOLVING TO COBALT BLUE
</b>
<b>EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER -- DAY                                            3
</b>
Blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down.
PROPELLER SOUND.  Materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but
sleek form of an Ohio-class SSBN ballistic missile submarine.

<b>INT. U.S.S. MONTANA -- DAY                                              4
</b>
In the attack center, darkened to womb-red, the crew's faces shine with sweat
in the glow of their instruments.  The SKIPPER and his EXEC crowd around
BARNES, the sonarman.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                Sixty knots?  No way, Barnes... the reds don't
                have anything that fast.

<b>                                BARNES
</b>                Checked it twice, skipper.  It's a real unique
                signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise...
                doesn't even sound like screws.

He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to
the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING.  The captain studies
the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of
the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an
amorphous trace, representing the bogey.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                What the hell is it?

<b>                                EXEC
</b>                I'll tell you what it's not, it's not one of
                ours.

<b>                                BARNES
</b>                Sir!  Contact changing heading to two-one-four,
                diving.  Speed eighty knots!  Eighty knots!

<b>                                EXEC
</b>                Eighty knots...

<b>                                BARNES
</b>                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

<b>                                FRANK
</b>                           (simultaneously)
                Still diving, depth nine hundred feet.  Port
                clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.

Tension builds in the attack room as the Montana surges to intercept the
intruder.  The exec tensely watches the vector-graphic readout for the side-
scan sonar array.  The sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls.

<b>                                EXEC
</b>                          (low, to Captain)
                It's getting tight in here.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                We can still give him a haircut.  Helm, come
                right to oh six niner, down five degrees.

<b>                                HELMSMAN
</b>                Coming right to oh six niner, sir.  Down five
                degrees.

<b>                                NAVIGATOR
</b>                Port side clearance one hundred twenty feet
                narrowing to seventy-five.  Sir, we have a
                proximity warning light.

<b>                                EXEC
</b>                That's too damn close!  We've gotta back off.

<b>                                BARNES
</b>                Range to contact, two hundred.  Contact junked to
                bearing two six oh and accelerated to... one
                hundred thirty knots, sir!

<b>                                EXEC
</b>                         (really freaked now)
                Nothing goes one thirty!

Suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness.

<b>EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     5
</b>
We see only the effect, not the source, as a large diffuse light passes
rapidly under the sub's hull.  Moments later a shockwave, like an underwater
sonic boom, impacts the sub, slamming it sideways.

<b>INT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     6
</b>
The bride crew are knocked off their feet, as the ship is buffeted.

<b>                                EXEC
</b>                Turbulence!  We're in its wake!

SIRENS.  Everyone shouting at once.  The power flickers low.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                Helm, all stop!  Full right rudder!

<b>                                HELMSMAN
</b>                All stop.  Full right rudder.  Hydraulic failure.
                Planes are not responding, sir!

Power returns in time for the sonarman to get a glimpse at the side-scan
display... AS THE SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOM BEFORE THEM.

<b>                                HELMSMAN
</b>                Hydraulics restored, sir.

<b>EXT. U.S.S. MONTANA                                                     7
</b>
The cliff wall materializes out of the blue limbo off the port bow with
nightmarish slow-motion.  The sub slams into it with horrific force, scraping
along and bouncing off.  One tail stabilizer is sheared off and the big screw
prangs the wall with an earsplitting K-K-KWANG!

<b>INT. PORT TO TORPEDO ROOM                                               8
</b>
With the outer tube-doors torn off, seawater slams in, busting the inner
hatches.  Two-foot thick columns of water, like fire-hoses of the gods,
blast into the room.  Everything vanishes instantly in white spray.

<b>INT. CONTROL RM/ATTACK CENTER                                           9
</b>
Everyone is hurled off his feet.  The planesman flights to recover control of
the yoke.

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                Collision alarm!  Collision alarm!  Lighten
                her up, Charlie!

<b>                                NAVIGATOR
</b>                The torpedo room is flooded, sir!

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                Blow all tanks!  Blow everything!

<b>                                HELMSMAN
</b>                Passing twelve hundred feet...

<b>                                EXEC
</b>                Blowing main tanks!

<b>                                HELMSMAN
</b>                Twelve hundred fifty feet...

<b>EXT. MONTANA                                                            10
</b>
The great sub is being hauled down by the mass of its flooded bow section,
its flanks rushing past us like a freight train headed for Hell.

<b>INT. MONTANA CONTROL ROOM                                               11
</b>
The command crew fights futility for control, everyone shouting and terrified.

<b>                                EXEC
</b>                Main forward tanks ruptured!

<b>                                HELMSMAN
</b>                Passing thirteen hundred feet...

<b>                                EXEC
</b>                Too deep to pump auxiliaries!

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                All back full!  All back full!

<b>                                HELMSMAN
</b>                Answering all back full.  Passing thirteen hundred
                fifty feet... fourteen hundred... fourteen
                fifty...

The Captain locks eyes with the Exec amid the din...

<b>                                CAPTAIN
</b>                We're losing her.  Launch the buoy!

The Exec opens the door to a small box and punches a button.  A red light
comes on.  The Captains takes a deep breath.

<b>EXT. MONTANA                                                            12
</b>
A tiny transmitter is ejected from the sub's hell and begins its long ascent
to the surface.  A second later the sub slams down like a piledriver onto a
ledge, tearing open its pressure hull.

<b>INT. MONTANA                                                            13
</b>
VARIOUS QUICK CUTS, just flashes and impressions, as...
Seawater blasts down the corridors --
Explodes across the control room, hurling men like dolls --
Floods the cavernous missile bay in seconds --
Bursts through hatches into the reactor room --
Blasts men OUT OF FRAME in a micro-second.

<b>EXT. OCEAN/UNDERWATER                                                   14

In the cobalt twilight we see the Montana slide down the sea cliff, its hull
SCREECHING like the death agonies of some marine dinosaur.  Descending in an
avalanche of silt, it finally disappears into the blackness below... a
blackness which continues almost straight down, 20,000 feet to the bottom of
the Cayman Trough.  The abyss.

LONG LENS SHOT: three massive Navy Sea King helicopters thundering straight
at us, FILLING FRAME.

REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly
but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER.
It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around
which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment.

The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval
officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen.  A pantomime in the
rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum "company man" KIRKHILL greeting
COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander.

The bridge is state-of-the-art, with computers and sophisticated navigation
and communications gear, looking like mission control with its bank of video
monitors.  The Drilling Operations Supervisor, LELAND MCBRIDE, and BENDIX,
the crew chief, watch the invaders swarming the deck below.

WIDER, showing the Navy contingent crowding the control room.  DeMarco is
hardcore military, brusque and efficient.  Kirkhill is a small man with
pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means
company man and/or dickhead.

1700 FEET BELOW.  A submersible oil-drilling platform, DEEPCORE II, an island
of light in the vast blackness.  Its main framework connects two "tri-

areas in a pressurized environment.  An umbilical cable, thick as a man's
thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer
at the surface.  In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or
"toolpusher," BUD BRIGMAN.  He's talking (via headset) with two divers
working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER.

Bud turns from the window and crosses the drill floor.  The working heart of
the rig.  THUNDEROUS MECHANICAL ROAR.  The drill crew, in hardhats and mud-
plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the
chamber.  The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate.  The
others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER, DWIGHT PERRY, JAMMER WILLIS, and TOMMY RAY
DIETZ.  Bud hears his names called above the din by Jammer, a massive
roughneck/diver who stands a good head taller than the rest.

The control module is a long narrow cabin like the inside of a Winnebago,
packed with instrumentation.  At the end is a small bay with multiple
viewports.  Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver
can be seen welding.  He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and
by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK.  Little Geek is an
underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER.
It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little
machine.  The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the
window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee.  His pet white rat,
BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders.  The door BANGS OPEN.

Hippy jumps, slops his coffee.  Bud strides in.  Not calm.

Flatbed's pilot, LISA 'ONE NIGHT' STANDING, can be clearly seen behind a
bubble canopy.  She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly
male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the
business.  She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver,
ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work.  Little Geek hovers around them like a
tiny helicopter.  One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the
pipe.

Flatbed moves underneath the rig, a few feet above the seafloor, with Sonny

The opening is called the moonpool, and Deepcore's submersibles are launched
through it.  From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool.
Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it.  The chamber also contains CAB ONE, a
similar submersible.  Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys
are helping the divers out of the water.  The water at this depth is only
about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune-
fingered.  Finler pulls off his demand-helmet, revealing a round, boyish

PANNING ALONG BOOTED FEET, four pairs of black military size twelves line
up, onto... a pair of Charles Jourdans fives under shapely ankles.

her early thirties.  She's attractive, if a bit hardened, dressed
conservatively in a skirt and jacket.  Meet LINDSEY.  Project Engineer for
Deepcore.  She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her.  Eventually.
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear, getting tossed around by the storm.  The SEALs are dressed alike in
black fatigues.  They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous
special-forces types.  The leader of the SEAL team, LIEUTENANT COFFEY, makes
his way forward to the cockpit.

The pilot is white-knuckling his stick, trying to hold the great beast of a
helicopter in position.  Through the windshield, the deck of the Benthic

Coffey goes back to the crew deck, moving easily in the bucking craft.  He
nods to the others SEALs, MONK, WILHITE, and SCHOENICK.  In the open side
door, Wilhite clips a 100 foot nylon rope to the airframe and throws out the
coil.  One by one the shoulder the gear-bags, grab the rope, and step out.
Lindsey stands swaying in the chopper door, watching the SEALs fast-roping

He's sure she won't go for it.  It's his certainty that gets her.  She sets
her jaw.  Opening her purse she takes out a small plastic bag, puts her
shoes and purse in the bag, and grips the bag in her teeth.  Then grabs
the rope and slides down.

feet to the deck.  She steps away an instant before Coffey hits behind her.
Lindsey crosses the rainswept deck with athletic strides.  Her nylons are
ruined.  An air-crewman in the chopper lowers two additional equipment cases
using the rescue sling.  The SEALs catch them as they swing radically across
the deck.  They Navy chopper banks and seems to scurry away before the
mounting storm.

BLACKNESS.  Then shafts of light become visible, above a ridge of rock.
Flatbed appears, trailing two heavy two cables.  Behind it, the mass of
Deepcore emerges from the darkness, its forward lighting array blazing.
Flatbed is towing it like a tug, aided by Deepcore's own mighty stern
thrusters.

Bud, his feet propped up, uses joystick controls to 'fly' Deepcore,
maneuvering against currents and around seafloor obstacles.  He is guided
by the side-scan sonar display, with Hippy assisting in the sonar shack.
Through the front viewport, Flatbed can be seen out ahead.

Ten foot waves crash through the launch-well, sending up geysers of spray.
Next to the launch-well, crewman have attached a lifting cable to CAB THREE,
eighteen feet of ugly yellow submersible.  It slams violently in its steel
cradle as the drill-ship rolls.  Coffey and Schoenick hand the gear bags in
to Wilhite and Monk though the hatch under the rear of the submersible.

Lindsey approaches, wearing a borrowed roustabout's coverall.

She looks down at the larger of the two equipment cases brought by the SEALs,
lying on the deck.  Stenciled on it are the words: F.B.S./DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.
Coffey and Schoenick push past her to pick it up.

<b>                                LINDSEY

Coffey looks up in surprise as she nimbly climbs the side of Cab Three and
grabs the lifting shackle, circling her raised hand to signal the crane man.

Cab Three, with Lindsey riding its back, is pulled up out its cradle and
starts to swing violently as Explorer pitches.  The submersible is then
swung out to the center of the launch well.  It sways and gyrates above the
furious water below.  Lindsey drops into the upper hatch.

jammed in with their equipment in the tiny space, are getting slammed into
the walls.  Lindsey is calmly flipping switches as she talks.

She pulls the lever hard.  CLUNK-CLANG!  The shackle-release drops the sub.
It freefalls ten feet to the water with an enormous splash and keeps right
on going after Lindsey floods the trim tanks.  Coffey et al have been slammed
hard.

Lindsey cuts on the floodlights and maneuvers the descending submersible so
that the umbilical cable is a few feet ahead on her front port.  Moving up
through her lights, it will guide her down to the rig.  Cab Three free-falls
into increasing darkness.  Soon it is a candle below us in the indigo.

HISSSS of inrushing compressed gas.  The pressure in the chamber rises.  The
breathing mixture is composed of helium, oxygen and nitrogen.  Catfish
monitors it carefully from a station outside the chamber, watching the

Catfish checks his watch, then reaches over and adjusts a value on the tri-

through beat-to-hell magazines or just staring.  Lindsey has her feet propped
up on the smaller of the SEALs' two equipment cases.  She casually toes open
one of the latches, then the other.  Glances at Coffey.  He's reading.  She
begins to lift the lid with her toe.  Gets a GLIMPSE INSIDE, of packing foam,

hand and stares at it.  The fingertips are trembling the slightest bit.  He

TIGHT ON HIPPY, bathed in the light of the sonar display.  He is making
kissing sounds at Beany, who has his inquisitive nose right up to Hippy's
lips.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Hippy, you're going to give that rat a disease.

WIDER, as Hippy and Bud to see Lindsey leaning in the doorway.  She and Bud
size each other up.  He opts for a jovial approach, his eyes wary.

<b>                                BUD

Lindsey crossed past him, her eyes scanning the banks of equipment, almost
unconsciously checking, checking... getting the pulse of her big iron baby.

<b>                                BUD

<b>                                BUD

Lindsey leans past Bud to the gooseneck mike on the console.

One Night mimes a puking motion, finger down her throat.  Then she replies
with sickening sweetness...

Lindsey fives the sonar shack the once-over.  She tweaks some knobs.

</b>                I can't believe you were dumb enough to come

She crosses past Bud and exits into the corridor.  Bud bolts out of the chair
to follow her and Hippy scrambles in to take over.

pace with here as she make here inspection.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Then why'd you come down?

She stops abruptly to look at a leaky pipe.  He almost slams into her.  She
moves on, climbing down the ladder to the lower level.

<b>                                LINDSEY

                had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a

On the lower level landing, Lindsey opens a hatch into one of the machine
rooms.  ROAR OF PUMPS AND COMPRESSORS.

Lindsey enters and moves expertly through the dark labyrinth of pipes and
roaring machinery.  Her eyes rove constantly over fittings, gauges, circuit
panels.

She scowls at a pressure gauge and turn a valve minutely.

</b>                That must be it.

Lindsey's on the move again, and Bud scrambles through the pipes to keep up.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                No, I think you were.  Come on, admit it.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four

Darkness.  The door opens and Bud snaps on the light.

Lindsey slips past him into his tiny state-room, the only private bunk on the
rig.  Rank had its privileges.  His hand on the door is just level with her
eyes.  She notices his wedding ring, a massive band of pure titanium
(something your fiancee might have picked out if she had a degree from
<b>M.I.T.).

</b>                I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to
                take it off.

Bud stays in the doorway.  Lindsey takes a heaps of Bud's cloths off the
narrow bunk.  Start unconsciously straightening the room.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                I haven't worn mine in months.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit?
                It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name
                is Michael.

Lindsey takes off her borrowed tennies and socks.

Bud eyes her, sounding too causal.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks

</b>                Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of
                you life any more.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                I'll tell you what happened... you woke up one
                day and realized the guy never made you laugh.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                You're right, Bud.  It was just that simple.
                Aren't you clever?  You should get your own
                show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn
                from three hundred fathoms.

She closes the watertight door, forcing him out.  Locks it.  She turns and
throws her shoe hard against the far wall.

She flops down on the bed, sitting... staring at the wall.  Her armor is
gone.  She looks small and vulnerable.  A long beat.  She reaches over to the
tiny sink.  Amid the clutter is a bottle of Bud's aftershave.  She unscrews
it and takes a sniff.  Catches herself.  Tosses it.

Bud barges into the tiny head and puts some soap on his ring finger.  He pulls
the ring off roughly and throws it into the toilet.  He reaches forward to
flush.  Can't do it.  Now really pissed off at himself, he reaches into the
toilet bowl, wrist deep in the chemical-blue water, and salvages the ring.
He puts it on and washes his hands.  The right hand stays faintly blue no
matter how hard he scrubs.

The platform is stopped, hovering in place.  Like a great spacecraft setting
down on a barren planet, the rig settles into the bottom ooze.  Flatbed
releases its tow lines and heads back to its berth inside.

CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH, actually a computer-composited down-looking scan from
a towed LIDAR (laser imaging sonar) rig.  It shows a faint, blurry outline of
the Montana lying on her side on a ledge part-way down the canyon wall.  There
is no detail.  A finger points to a flat ledge nearby.  An "X" has been put
on with a grease pencil.

                meters away and 70 meters below us.  We think she
                slid down the wall, and lodged against this

The divers, Bud, Catfish, Sonny, Finler, Jammer, and the four SEALs have

                prep and ready to get wet in fifteen minutes.

The rig crew disperses, picking up helmets and diving gear.  Some are studying
the diagrams of the Montana's interior layout.  Bud takes Coffey aside as
the others prepare.

<b>                                BUD

                Just get your team ready to dive.

End of discussion.  Coffey is walking away.  Burning, Bud crosses to his gear
locker.  Picks up his helmet.  Finler is suiting out next to him.

NEARBY, Monk comes over to pick his helmet up off the worktable.  Hippy
points to the heavy equipment case that says F.B.S. DEEP SUIT/MARK IV.

Mink opens the case and shows them an unfamiliar diving suit, what looks like
a space helmet, and a large backpack.

                It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you
                breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed.
                Pressure doesn't get to you.

Catfish is grappling with the concept.

Monk take a clear plastic box full of O-rings off the shelf and dumps them
out.  He opens a valve on the backpack and allows some of the fluid inside
it to drain into the box.  Then he take Beany by the tail off Hippy's
shoulder.

He drops Beany in the box and, before Hippy can protest, closes the lid.
Beany is forced under the surface.  He struggled for a second, and bubbles
come out of his mouth.  Then he casually swims around in there, completely
submerged... breathing liquid.  Catfish and the others stare into the box,
amazed.

<b>                                MONK

Monk takes Beany out and hold him by the tail for a few seconds to drain his
lungs.  Then hands him back to Hippy.  The rat is annoyed, but otherwise
alright.

The great black hull of the Montana recedes into the darkness beyond the
puny beams of their lights.  It seems bigger than the Titanic and just as
eerie in its final resting place.  On it side, the sub's top deck becomes a
wall along which the tiny submersibles are moving.  Ahead, in the lights, is
a white painted circle.

the sub's hatch.  Hippy guides Cab Three in closer to the hatch area.

Hippy nods and Perry drops Little Geek through the hatch into the water and
feed out a length of tether.  Hippy picks up the control box and watches the

The three SEALs have unlatched the deck cover and revealed the hatch.  They
open the out hatch and Monk swims down into to narrow escape trunk.  He bangs
on the inner hatch with a wrench, listening carefully with his helmet pressed
against it.

Hippy flies the ROV into the hatch.

Lindsey's front port, the great hatches of the Trident missile tubes roll
toward us in procession.  Several of the hatch covers have been forced

Out of the darkness ahead emerges the trailing edge of the sail, big as a
five-story building.  Far below her, Flatbed moves along the edge of the
ledge which supports the vast sub.  Its lights, and Lindsey's strobes, reveal
the tremendous damage to the forward section as they pass the sail.  The torn
and twisted hull looms above Flatbed as it sets down.

Coffey indicated an enormous rent where the bow section is almost torn away
from the rest of the hull.

Bud's team leaves Flatbed, swimming forward.  The opening is a black mouth in
their lights.  Coffey moves inside.  Bud attaches one end of an orange nylon
line to a piece of pipe and moves into the wreck behind him.

<b>                                BUD

Jammer, Catfish, Finler, and Sonny follow him inside.

They find themselves in the forward berthing compartment with its rows of
bunks.  The room is twisted and disheveled, with bedding hanging from the
bunks like the lolling tongues of dead dogs.  Papers float in gentle
eddying currents, letters, pages from paperback novels, photos of girlfriends.
Bud pays out the line and follows Coffey forward.  As they pass sealed doors,
Coffey pounds with a tool, listening.  All flooded.

Monk leads his team along a corridor, following Little Geek's tether.  Through
a hatch into the engine room.  Their lights play over flooded machinery.

<b>INT. COMPANIONWAY/CONTROL ROOM AND ATTACK CENTER                        71

From the berthing Coffey's team swims up a companionway towards the attack
center.  He pulls at a buckled watertight door.

<b>                                COFFEY
</b>                It's jammed.  Give me a hand.

Jammer and Bud squeeze in around Coffey.  Together they wrench the door open
on its squealing hinges.  It give way suddenly, flying open.  The suction
pulls SOMETHING THROUGH.  It slams Bud's shoulder.  He turns.  A FACE...
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM!  He jerks back, gasping.

Face to face with Barnes, the sonarman.  The ensign seems unmarked, merely
dismayed at his own mortality, judging from his wide eyes and mouth.  Coffey
reaches past Bud and pushes the ensign's body out of the way.

<b>                                COFFEY

                going to see this.

They enter the control room.  Their lights play over the high-tech wreckage.
Floating debris and bodies make shifting shadows on the walls as they swirl
in the currents.  A languid, weightless waltz.  They move through the carnage.
Their lights pick out tableaux... the planesman still strapped in his chair,
someone jammed into the ceiling pipes, hanging down.  Dead faces, pale in the
lights.  Still.  We see only glimpses.

Coffey locates the captain's body and rolls it over.  Removes the missile
arming key which hangs on a chain around the dead man's neck.  Moves on. All
business.  Bud turns back to his guys.  Checking them.  He notices Jammer is
breathing so rapidly he's fogging his helmet.  Catfish, Finler, and Sonny
aren't much better.  A wave a panic seems imminent.

<b>                                BUD

We see Bud working, calming them, talking them through it.  He's sweating
rivers in his helmet, not looking too steady.  His projection of calm to the
others is his own salvation.

Coffey pauses in the doorway to the communications room.

They search the rooms along the corridor with their lights until they come to
a vertical hatch, open.  a pit of darkness below.

Bud drops down through the hatch to the level below, followed by Jammer, who
barely fits through.  Catfish hooks his safety line onto Bud's with a
carabiner and move along the corridor with the others.

Working from a plastic card, Coffey spins the dial on the wall safe and opens

Bud leads Jammer through a long, claustrophobically narrow corridor, tapping
on the walls and hatches periodically.  After he taps, he waits a few
moments.  There are no answering taps.  They open doors and shine their lights
into the rooms.  The are bodies, but they seem anonymous.  Crumpled shapes
in khaki or blue.  They undog and open a hatch.  Beyond it is the largest
chamber of the sub, the...

and forty feet high, with two rows of vertical launch tubes, 24 in all.  The

illuminating a body just beyond the door.  A coveralled seaman turning
slowly in the eddying current.  Small albino crabs crawl slowly over the
man's face.  One scuttles out of his gaping mouth.

Bud goes to him.  Gets up close to his face.  Sees that he's not.  That he's
hyperventilating.  Fighting nausea.  Bud grabs him by the shoulders.

<b>                                BUD

watch.  Checker Jammer's pressure gauges.

Bed negotiates his way through the tangle of wreckage near the far end of the
missile compartment.  He goes down a stairwell to the lower level.  A HUNDRED
FEET AWAY, Jammer loses sight of Bud's dive-lights.  He starts to get
nervous.  Suddenly his own lights begin to DIM, flickering lower and lower.
They become little orange candles, the filament barely glowing.  The darkness
closes in.

lights, which are dimming and flickering.  He hears nothing from his helmet
transceiver.

JAMMER, smacks the side of his helmet.  Shakes the transceiver on his belt.
Nothing... just static.  Then even the static dies.  Panic time.

He grabs the safety line and pulls twice.  Hard.  It is snagged on a sharp
metal edge ten feet from him.  He pulls twice more, harder, hauling the
thing.  The line severs.  Jammer stared at the frayed and floating toward
him.  His eyes bug.  He looks all around in the darkness.  Can't see Bud.
Can't decide what to do.  We can see hysteria revving up inside him like a
flywheel.

Then he becomes aware of a faint radiance flickering over the walls.  It is a
cold and ethereal light, unlike the warm-white of their dive lights.

It grows brighter.  He turns slowly toward it.

The glow is moving beneath the steel grill of the deck, sending shafts of
cold light flickering upward hypnotically, coming toward him.

<b>                                JAMMER
</b>                Bud?  Is that you?

C.U. JAMMER, shielding his eyes, staring into the radiant source.

Guess what, Jammer?  It's not Bud.  In the brightest center of the glow,
SOMETHING is moving, a figure casting strange inhuman shadow across the walls.
Jammer blinks against the glare, his face registering total, outright
astonishment melting into terror.

The glare pulses subtly, hypnotically.  The shifting shadow falls across
Jammer.  He finally snaps out of his fixity...

Screaming and gulping air he spins away and starts clawing hand over hand
through the treacherous wreckage.

His harness catches on a twisted pipe.

He struggles, totally out of control... the big man reduced to a blind panic.

Jammer heaves forward with all his adrenalized strength.

He tears free of the entangling debris.  Launches like a torpedo... slamming
his backpack full force into the top sill of the hatchway.  His tri-mix
regulator takes the full brunt of the impact.

ON BUD, swimming furiously back toward Jammer's position.  The strange
radiance is gone.  His dive light flare back to full brightness.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Jammer?  Answer me, buddy,  JAMMER?!

He reaches Jammer only to find him thrashing violently in place.  A seizure.
Bud grapples with him.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Hang on, big guy.  Hand on!

Catfish, Sonny, and Finler arrive from the corridor a moment later.  They
leap into the fray.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                He's convulsing!

<b>                                CATFISH
</b>                It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!

Then they're all yelling at once, grappling with the big man, struggling with
the valves on his breathing gear.

<b>                                FINLER
</b>                Crank it down, man!  We're gonna losing him...

<b>                                BUD
</b>                SHIT, it's stuck... goddamnit!

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.

Jammer's convulsion ends.  He goes limp.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                We gotta get him out of here.  Come on!
                           (to Jammer)
                Hang on, buddy.

They drag Jammer's slack form into the corridor, hauling their way rapidly
back along the lifeline.

</b>
Lindsey is approaching the monolith of the sail, maneuvering to clear the
horizontal diving plane.  Then her lights go dim and her thrusters loose
power.

Suddenly a bright corona breaks around the bulk of the sail and SOMETHING
appears right in front of her, a glowing object moving like a bat out of
hell right at her!  It is slightly smaller than submersible and we only get
a glimpse.  What we think we see in the diffuse glow is a translucent ovoid,
open at the front with a spinning vortex of light inside... like some
hallucinatory jet engine.  And it's hauling ass.

Lindsey jinks left.  The object jogs right.  She fights the control as her
sub slews around, slamming broadside into the sail.  K-BAM!  Her power comes
back up.  Righting Can One, she spins to look through the aft viewport in
time to see the object racing away in a broad arc.  It pulls a high-G turn
and dives straight down.

We see the object zip behind Flatbed.  One Night can't see it.  The thing
spirals down into the darkness like a hit-and-run drunk, diving along the
wall into the abyss until it is lost to view.

HOLD ON Lindsey excited, amazed... dazed.  Her hands are shaking.  Suddenly
Bud's voice blares out over the open frequency.

It is now clear what the SEALs are doing.  Using large lift bags and Flatbed's
big arm, they have pulled one of the Trident C-4 missiles partway out of its
launch tube, and have partially disassembled the nose-shroud, exposing
several of the MIRV warheads within.

Moving very carefully, Wilhite and Schoenick ease one of the individual MIRVs
out of its bracket.  Hanging under a lift-bag in a jerry-rigged harness, the
three-foot long warhead is move gently by the divers to the back of Flatbed.

Flatbed surfaces in boiling foam.  The rig crew are all waiting.  Like a
crack pit-crew Bud's people leap onto Flatbed while its deck is still awash
and start to work on to Navy divers, unsealing their helmets and uncoupling
their umbilicals.  Hippy and Bud start to untie a cylindrical object wrapped

fingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe.

sealing and locking.

LOOKING DOWN THE WALL of the canyon as Big Geek moves beneath us, tilting up
to show Deepcore perched at the very edge of the abyss.  The rig is twisted
and dented, covered with loops of umbilical, trimodule-A a mass of wreckage.
The ROV passes across the front of the control module.  Through the front
port, two figures can be seen in the light of a single emergency lamp.

Bud walks down the corridor from control, slowly... as if carrying a great
weight.  The air is still thick with smoke.  The power off... everything
lit by emergency lights.  Makeshift quarters have been set up in the mess
hall, with blankets laid out on the tables, and with folding cots in the
storage room across the hall.  Jammer is still unconscious.  Coffey and
Schoenick bring Monk in on a stretcher, and set him up on a table.  He is
conscious but dazed with painkillers, his led splinted.

He and Bud lock eyes.  Bud bites back on his recriminations, but his gaze
blames Coffey.  He turns away.

                I was under orders.  I had no choice.

Coffey's manner is subdued, contrite.  A marked contrast to his previous
brusque arrogance.  He's wrestling with his own loss, a sever blow to the
tight brotherhood of a SEAL unit.  Bud's anger is not dispelled.  But he
can't address it now.  He moves on.

PAST THE INFIRMARY, where Sonny Dawson is rigging a sling over his own broken
arm.  He cries out in pain, cursing at himself.  LOOKING DOWN THE CENTRAL WELL
as Bud crosses.  Down through the grill decking we can see the bottom level
of the module is flooded.  Catfish is down there welding, sending shivering
reflections through the chamber.

Lindsey is working, up to her knees in water.  She is covered with grease,
tools scattered around.  Bud puts his hand on her shoulder.  She looks up,
blows some hair out of her eyes.

Rather than trigger anger and invective, the disaster seems to have affected
her in a different way.  She's accepted the situation, now that's it's done,
and is immersing herself in technical tasks, which are for her therapeutic.

Catfish and Lindsey, in suits and helmets, drop down from the glare of the

                Catfish?

Behind her, SOMETHING rises from the depths.

It is the little vehicle she almost collided with at the Montana wreck.

It comes right up behind her.  She doesn't know it's there.  It hovers
sideways like a hummingbird, as if curious, trying to get a better look.  She
becomes aware of the pulsing glow on the ground around her.  She turns
slowly.  We see her react as the glowing, pulsing apparition is reflected in
her faceplate.

A more powerful glow washes up onto her from below.

Her eyes go down.  She gasps, absolutely stunned...

Above the edge of the wall, AN ENORMOUS SHAPE RISES SILENTLY OUT OF THE
DEPTHS.  Over sixty feet across.  It looks like a blown glass manta ray, its
transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and
complexity, pulsing with a blue-violet glow.

Lindsey stand before it, unable to move.  Absolutely rapt.

Captivated by its ethereal beauty.  It begins to turn, majestically, one
rounded wing passing only a few feet above her.  She reaches up.  Touches it
as it passes over her.

Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized.

The thing completes its turn and dives gracefully down along the wall.  She
is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water.

About that time, Lindsey remembers she has a still camera, a little Nikonos.

She fumbles to set focus and exposure with her bulky gloves as the beautiful
machine glides into the depths.  Gets all set for a shot and...

WOOSH!  The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her.
She completely misses the shot of the 'manta ship'.  She pivots, trying to
get a shot of the little one as it zig-zags down along the wall, fast as a
meteor.  CLICK.  She get a shot a second before it disappears.

From around the flank of the rig module, Catfish appears.  Their com-sets
come backs to life, along with their lights.

</b>                Bud, something really important is happening
                here.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Look.  I'm just trying to hold this situation
                together.  I can't allow you to cause this kind
                of hysteria--

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Who's hysterical?  Nobody's hysterical!

They're talking across each other, not connecting.  Bud weary and frustrated.
Lindsey is cranked up with the afterglow of her encounter.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                All I'm saying is when you're hanging on by your
                fingernails, you don't go waving you arms around.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                I saw something!  I'm not going to go back there
                and say I didn't see it when I did.  I'm sorry.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                God, you are the most stubborn woman I ever knew.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do
                I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of
                pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                No.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Bud, this is me, Lindsey.  Okay?  You know me
                better than anybody in the world.  Now watch my
                lips... I saw these things.  I touched one of
                them.  And it wasn't some clunky steel can like
                we would build... it glided.  It was the most
                beautiful thing I've ever seen.

Bud is stilled by her intensity.  She moves close to him.  Eyes alive and
luminous.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                It was a machine, but it seems almost alive.
                Like a... dance of light.  Bud, you have to
                trust me... please.  I don't think they mean us
                harm.  I don't know how I know that, it's just a
                feeling.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's
                going to go on you 'feeling'?

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks
                and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear.
                Bud, you have to look with better eyes than
                that.

Bud has been taking this all in.  His eyes tracking her face.  He closes his
eyes, taking a deep breath.  It's so hard for him to do this, but...

<b>                                BUD
</b>                I can't, Lindsey.  I'm sorry.  How can I?

<b>                                                                CUT TO:

Coffey has Bud, Lindsey and several of the rig crew gathered for a little
summit.  Lindsey is withdrawn, sitting far from the others, a self-imposed
exile.  They're all wearing warm clothes and hugging themselves.  Their
breath shows in the air.

                trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking
                Russian.

Coffey looks at her for a moment, then goes on as if she hadn't spoke.

<b>                                COFFEY

</b>                I was having my nails done.

Coffey is sweating, despite the chill.  Keeps his hands clenched in fists so
they won't see how bad the tremors have gotten.

<b>                                COFFEY

                In addition to which your momma dresses you
                funny.

Coffey's eyes are straight razors.  He slashes them from face to face.  You
can see him tightening up like a clockspring, losing control of the situation
in front of his own men.  Bud defuses it.

<b>                                BUD

Coffey and Schoenick are bending over the warhead.  They have a small port
removed and are attaching waterproof leads from an ELECTRONIC DETONATOR.  The
black box Lindsey glimpsed earlier.  As the two SEALs work like surgeons, we
see past Coffey's shoulder to a hemispherical window behind him, which looks
out into the perpetual blackness.  Something appears... a goofy shark face.

Big Geek rises silently in front of the port.  It moves a little, trying to
get a peek over Coffey's shoulder.

ON THE SCREEN, Geek's POV.  Coffey is blocking Hippy's view of whatever it is
they're working on.  Abruptly, be moves.  The warhead is lying there in plain
sight, detonator wires hooked up.  Hippy's eyes bug out.  He knows exactly
what it is.

Bud has his face right up to screen.  He frowns, skeptical.

</b>                Come on, man.  What else could it be?

                the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot.
                Oh, uh... hi, Lins.

Bud whips around.  Lindsey, standing quietly in the doorway.  It's apparent
from expression she's been watching them for some time.  She looks ready to
kill somebody.  Then she's gone.

Bud catches up to her in the corridor, trying to put the brakes on her.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Lindsey!  Wait a second--

She reaches the watertight door to Maintenance Room B.  It's locked.  Before
Bud can stop her she grabs a fire-extinguisher off the wall and pounds on
the steel door like a big gong.  BOOM!  BOOM!  BOOM!

Needless to say, it opens.  She pushes past Schoenick, see the bomb lying
there naked.

                Escort her to quarters and have Monk prepare a

Schoenick takes her arm in a tight grip.

</b>                Bullshit, you can't do that.  Oww... goddamnit!

Lindsey goes bananas, trying to get Schoenick's big hands off her arms.  Bud
slams his hand down on the intercom button.

</b>                Emergency!  Maintenance room B.  Emergency!

He pulls the fire alarm for good measure and spins on Coffey... warning him
with a look that is not to be messed with.  Coffey is braced back against the
worktable... an odd stance, with one arm behind his back.  Suddenly there's
a crowd outside the door as Catfish, Hippy, One Night, and Sonny come running
up.  Confrontation time.

Sirens going.  About a million volts of electricity in the air.  Bud braces
Schoenick.

<b>                                BUD

ANGLE FROM BEHIND COFFEY, as Bud's group moves out of sight up the corridor.
Hands behind his back.  In his hand, cocked, finger on the trigger, is the
.45.  He turns and sets it on the table, steadying himself as if in the wind.
he seems to sag.  When he looks at Schoenick, his eyes are wounds.  A hunted
animal.  Voice shaky.

Coffey goes to the dome port.  Looks past his shrunken and twisted reflection
into the void.  Eternal night.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE.  Coffey's face in the window.  Stuck to the acrylic
bubble beside him is one of those Garfields, suction cups on its paws.  Coffey
stares out.  Behind his eyes, his brain is like that cat, just hanging on,
spreadeagle and screaming.

The lights are down.  Those who can are grabbing some sleep.  Snoring comes
from one of the bunkrooms as Lindsey passes.  In the mess hall, Catfish and
Bud are crashed out on the tables, wrapped in blankets.  The cold has gotten
intense.  Water drips.  The walls sweat with condensation.  Lindsey can see
her breath as she makes coffee.  She carries a cup over to Monk, who is a
face in a pile of blankets.  A hand comes out, takes the coffee.

Lindsey sips hers, staring.  Her thoughts are far away... in the bottomless
pit.  She is leaning up against the table where Bud is sleeping.  His soft
snoring downshifts into a loud rasp.  Lindsey touches him gently on the
shoulder.

stops.  It is a quiet, intimate moment, a reminder of the mileage these two
have logged together.

Sonny has made himself comfortable in front of the screens.  Too comfortable.
He's asleep, chin on his chest.  On the main passive-sonar screen, an almost
imperceptibly faint trace appears.  A HUM, which is by now familiar, becomes
audible.  Sonny shifts in his seat.  Doesn't wake.

Hippy puts his tools away, finished with the modifications to Big Geek.

                grin off your face.

He yawns as he shambles across the chamber to the corridor door.  Switches off
the lights.  Goes out.

Quiet lapping of water in the moonpool.  A beat.  Then...

A cold luminosity suffuses the water beneath the moonpool opening, sending
shadows shifting across the top of the chamber.  The surface begins to
pulsate.

Suddenly, the water itself rises, forming itself into a shifting, shimmering
pseudopod as big around as a man's body.  The transparent form pulses... an
amoebic mass shivering in the air.

It stretches, becoming a more refined form.  Like a blindly probing glass
python, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends,
stretching out from the moonpool, a shimmering tentacle.  The 'head' or tip,
a featureless liquid bulb, seems somehow to be scanning as it moves forward,
as if it can see where it's going.

</b>
Hippy trudges along the dark corridor.  He reaches the men's head and goes in.
As the door closes, the tip of the liquid pseudopod extends into the corridor
B.G.  It 'looks' left and right.  Then extends the length of the corridor,
holding itself a couple feet off the floor like a weightless snake.

<b>INT. TRIMODULE B/LADDERWELL/BUNKROOM/MESS HALL                          144
</b>
LOOKING DOWN three levels through the central ladderwell between the
cylinders.  The pseudopod enters and undulates upward.

FROM INSIDE THE MAKESHIFT BUNKROOM, we see its tip extend inside.

Sonny and One Night are snoring, oblivious.  Jammer is still unconscious.  The
pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on.

IN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet.  Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her
chair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle
enters the room in total silence.  It sways gracefully in to air, searching.
It undulates across the room, hanging about five feet in the air, surveying
everything.  It moves past Lindsey.  Sensing something, she lifts her head,
turning... sees the apparition next to her.

Her eyes go wide.  Amazement, but not fear.  The tentacle is moving on, still
searching.  Lindsey shakes Bud awake, clapping her hand over his mouth.

Bud blinks twice, then freezes.  When she lowers her hand his mouth is hanging
open like a total goon.

Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table.

Catfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open
now.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to
recognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to
her.  She holds her ground, fascinated.

The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water,
still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.  She gasps in surprise.
The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression.
Lindsey laughs involuntarily.  It laughs... without sound.  Lindsey makes a
face, sticking out her tongue... testing it.

The liquid-Lindsey does the same.  Bud has just had the rug jerked out from
under his sense of what is possible and what isn't, but he's taking it pretty
will, considering.

<b>                                BUD

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                It's trying to communicate.

Her liquid face suddenly transforms into a likeness of Bud's.

She reaches out her hand slowly.  Gingerly, her fingers touch the surface.
Ripples extend outward from the contact, across Bud's features.

Her fingertips break effortlessly through the surface, just like she's
dipping her hand into a bowl of water, except sideways.  She draws her wet
fingers out and studies them, amazed.  Touches one fingertip to her tongue.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Seawater.

The pseudopod pulls back from her.  It loops in the air dramatically, full
circle... and ties itself into a knot.  As the knot tightens down, it melts
back into the body.  The 'disappearing knot' trick.

Lindsey laughs, grinning with the open wonder and delight of a child at a
magic show.  She is transported.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Show off.

She looks at Bud.  He grins broadly.  He's with her now.

The stunned group watches as the thing moves on across the room.  Out to the
corridor

Coffey and Schoenick enter the back way, through the dive-prep area.  They see
the pseudopod arching from the moonpool big as a treetrunk.  Coffey's mind is
blown.  We can smell the insulation burning.  He just stares.

The water tentacle enters and moves toward the hot-wired warhead.  It studies
the device for a few seconds.  Bud and Lindsey enter through a side door, in
time to see the tentacle divide into four tendrils which wrap around the
warhead.  They begin to lift it off its cart.

<b>INT. SUB BAY                                                            147
</b>
Coffey finally jump-starts his brain.  In a flash of insight, he runs to the
big sliding door through which the pseudopod stretches into the corridor.  He
and Schoenick heave on the door.  Like a guillotine blade it slices
effortlessly through it.

VARIOUS ANGLES -- CORRIDORS, MESS HALL, LADDERWELL, MAINTENANCE... as the
body of the pseudopod collapses, splashing on the floor.  It reverts to
nothing more than a long puddle of simple seawater.  As the tendrils dissolve,
the warhead slams back down onto the cart, unharmed.  ON COFFEY'S SIDE ON THE
DOOR, however, the "stump" rears back like a cobra.  It withdraws rapidly into
the moonpool.  The glow fades away.

Sonny wakes up with a start as the HUM revs up into a LOUD WHINE and then
fades away.  He scrambles to track it.  Too late.

Hippy emerges from the can and looks down, puzzled, at the puddle running the
length of the corridor.  He missed the whole thing.

Coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like Nicholson in "The Shining".
Bud give her a warning look.  Don't poke at the rattler.

                Controlling water.

Coffey is hunched over, elbows on his knees.  His hands are out of sight.  His
arm is moving in a slow rhythm.  We can't see what he's doing.

<b>                                HIPPY

ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE, showing what Coffey is doing.  He has his K-BAR KNIFE
gripped white-knuckle in one hand.  He is drawing it slowly and repeatedly
across the skin of the other forearm.  Neat chevrons of blood from wrist to
elbow.

C.U. COFFEY -- He doesn't flinch.  His eyes are hard and bright as diamond
drills.  No one notices.  He's keeping the edge.

<b>                                LINDSEY

Coffey stands abruptly, snags Schoenick with his eyes, and leaves, walking
through the group as if they were smoke.  This cold behavior brings the mood
down a notch.

Outside the mess hall, Coffey pauses, listening to the conversation resume.
Bright speculation, a few jokes.  Coffey is visible shaking.  Breathing hard.
Pupils dilated.  Schoenick looks at him with concern.

Coffey walks away without hearing him.  Schoenick catches up.

The door opens in the dark room.  Coffey enters, moving with purpose.  He
pulls his gear bag out from under the work table.  Unzips it.  Pulls out a
short-barreled CAR-15 assault rifle.

<b>                                COFFEY
</b>                We have no way of warning the surface.  Do you
                know what that means?

Schoenick doesn't know.  He hopes Coffey knows.  Because he's a fearless man
who's discovering what it is to be afraid.  Coffey inserts the magazine with
a CLACK!  Snaps the bolt.  Tosses the rifle to Schoenick.

Hippy passes the maintenance room.  Looks in.  The warhead and its cart are
missing.  He looks around.  Heads toward the sub-bay.

Hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from
the sub-bay.  He edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the
steel floor.  Slides up along the wall next to the door.  Inches his eye
around the doorframe.  Across the room. Schoenick is working with a chainfall,
lowering Big Geek onto the MIRV warhead, which is still on its cart.  He
begins to attach them together with a sling of tie-down straps.

Hippy lets his breath out slowly.  His expression is Holy Shit.

He slides back along the corridor wall, silently.  Away from the door.  Then
turn turns quickly to go... WHAM!  Coffey slams him up against the wall!
.45 pressed to Hippy's temple.  Hippy gulping air as Coffey ears back the
hammer.

The meeting is breaking up as the door CLANGS open and Hippy is thrusted
inside.  His hands are taped behind his back and he stumbles onto his face.
Coffey steps through smoothly, straight-arming the .45.  Schoenick flanks him
with the assault rifle aimed at the group.

<b>                                COFFEY

                Here, hold this a second.  We're going to phase
                three.

He hands his gun to Monk, with the assumption of absolute loyalty from a team
member.  Monk's eyes move between Coffey and the pistol.  We can't tell what
he's thinking.  Coffey grabs Hippy and shoves him onto a chair.

<b>                                HIPPY

                Please, you can't.  Coffey, think about what
                you're doing... for God's sake--

Coffey lets her approach him, his eyes glittering.

Without warning he grabs her by the hair and hurls her against the Coke
machine, pinning her there with one hand.  Bud leaps forward.

</b><b>                GET BACK!

Coffey moves up close to Lindsey.

</b>                This is something I've wanted to do since I
                first met you.

His hand reaches down, OUT OF FRAME.  We hear something RIP.  His hand comes
back up... holding a piece of gaffer's tape.

He slaps it over her mouth.  Then pushes her down into a chair.

Hippy looks at Monk and Schoenick.

Their only hope is to sway Schoenick.  But the SEAL's fear is making him the
perfect machine, totally dependent on external orders.  And his orders are

</b>                Now what?

They're locked in trimodule-C.  No other doors give access to the sub-bay
corridor.  Bud's mind is racing.  He drops down the ladder to Level One, into
about two feet of water.  He reaches down and open the emergency lockout
hatch.  Takes off his boots.

<b>                                BUD

                freezing.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Then I guess you better wish me luck, huh?

Catfish is pulling his boots off as well.

                'Case I don't die.  Okay, Bud... let's go,
                podner, I ain't got all day.

Bud clasps him on the shoulder and starts hyperventilating.  He drops into
the water.

Bed shoots down through the hatch.  The cold hits him list a fist, becoming
instantly paralyzing.  He starts kicking in powerful strokes through the dark
water, maneuvering around tangles of umbilical cable twisted tubular steel.
Catfish is behind him, swimming like hell.  They reach hatch six.  Together
they spin the wheel and heave upward, opening it.

Bud surges up into the lock.  Catfish jams into the tiny airspace with him.
They try the upper hatch.  Jammed.  They're both panting with the exertion
and intense cold.

Bud looks at Catfish, shivering and heaving, wide-eyed.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Okay, Cat.  You head back.

Bud hyperventilates rapidly and pikes over diving back out through the hatch.

In the moonpool, Bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of
Flatbed.  His wracked breathing is masked by the WHINE of HYDRAULICS as Coffey
uses the external controls to extend Flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking
the Geek/MIRV in its gripper.

Bud strokes to a point where Coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the
water onto the deck of the pool.  He lies gasping behind Cab One's cradle.
His limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold.  His fingers are
completely numb.  He hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits.
Scans the situation.  He can't get to the door, which is across the room,
without Coffey seeing him.

Lindsey watching the whole thing going down, ON THE SCREEN, a high angle of

                killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling
                One Night over laundry duty.

ON THE SCREEN, Bud picks up a piece of pipe.  Hefts it.  Moves forward,
crouched... stalking.  Lindsey yells at the screen in frustration.

Bud chucks a tool across the chamber, creating a clattering distraction, then
wades in with the pipe in a vicious swing to the back of Coffey's knees,
taking him down.  Coffey spins even as he falls, catching Bud in a scissor
kick that topples him.

Grappling, they fall together into the freezing water.

Coffey is momentarily stunned by the cold, giving Bud time to haul himself
out, hoping to make it to the door.

Coffey launches from the water and grabs him legs.

He pulls himself up as Bud kick out.  Claws his way viciously over Bud's
body until he has him pinned to the deck.  Then he pulls out the .45.

Put it unceremoniously to Bud's forehead.

Coffey pulls the trigger... CLICK.  Bud flinches, then opens his eyes,
staring cross-eyed at the muzzle of the .45.  Coffey cocks it and tries
again.  CLICK.  Nothing.  Really pissed off beyond description, Bud hurls
the commando off him with a powerful heave, sending him clattering against
a rack of equipment.  They face off, panting.

Even so Bud is getting his ass kicked.  Coffey's really trying to put him out
of business.  It's mostly duck and dodges on Bud's part.  Throw a few things.
When Coffey connects, Bud goes down hard.  Give him credit, though.  He
manages to scramble back up.

The fight wrecks the room, scattering tools and gear.

Compressed air cylinders roll dangerously around the floor.

Coffey slips on one and Buds get in a couple of good licks.

Slams the SEAL's head in an equipment locker door.

But the Navy man is just too massive.  Bud is hammered back into a wall.
Coffey has his fist cocked back for the coup de grace.  Spins around at the
sound of a VOICE.

Catfish is right behind him.  Dripping wet.  A trail of water goes back to
the moonpool a few feet away.

CRACK!  Catfish's 'Hammer' punch comes in so hard and so fast, Coffey is
knocked right on his ass.  He doesn't get up.  Just sort of flops around.

Catfish helps Bud to his feet.  They advance on Coffey, who crab-scuttles
sideways, his eyes rabid.

He picks up a helium tank and hurls it at them.  As they duck he sprints to
Flatbed and drops through the hatch and slams it down.

Bud leaps across the water to land on Flatbed.  The hatch is already sealed.
He grapples with Geek/MIRV, trying to free it from the steel claw.

Catfish pounds down the corridor like he's never run before, his beer gut
doing a rumba.  He reaches the door, tears out the piece of pipe and spins
the wheel.  Hippy pushes it open so fast it hits Catfish in the stomach.
Hippy tears past him, running with the assault rifle.  John Wayne.

Flatbed is submerging, with only the hatch tower still above the water.  Bud
is being dragged down, still trying to free the ROV.  He gives up when he
sees Hippy run in, waving the assault rifle around like a 130-pound Rambo.

Bud climbs the hatch tower and leaps to the deck of the moonpool.

Hippy clumsily raises the unfamiliar rifle at Coffey, visible inside his
viewing bubble beneath the swirling water.  Coffey looks up, stares at the
gun... doesn't seem to care.

He grabs it out of Hippy's hands and aims it at the sub.  He racks the water
with a long burst.  BENEATH THE SURFACE, the rounds nip nasty contrails
through the water.  They barely scar the front port.

<b>                                LINDSEY

Catfish rakes the descending sub with more bursts, trying to hit the
shimmering shape of the ROV on its back.  UNDERWATER we see the rounds
arcing wild, a few hitting the ROV but causing little damage.

Coffey complete his descent to just above the seafloor.  ABOVE, Catfish
empties the weapon.

Catfish slams a backpack onto Bud's shoulders, grappling with the straps and
hose connections.  Hippy and Sonny (with one hand) are clipping, zipping and
buckling all over him.  This is a world-record suit-up time.  Bud pulls the
rubber neck-dam of the helmet's lower ring down over his face.

Bud rockets DOWN INTO FRAME in a column of bubbles.  He looks around.  Through
the lattice of conduit under the rig he can see Flatbed moving forward from
its exit point under the stern.  Bud see a shortcut under the platform.

He kicks along a lattice a pipes, heaving himself along in frantic hand-over-
hand stokes.  He reaches for Flatbed's stern as it passes.

Misses the last hand-hold... but just manages to seize a tie-down trailing
behind it.  He is jerked along behind the sub.

Bud holds on with both hands as he is buffeted in the wake of the powerful
thrusters.  Flatbed gathers speed, moving out toward the edge of the abyssal
wall.  The current slams him, spinning him like a fishing lure.  He pulls
himself forward slowly until he can grip the stern rail of Flatbed's platform.

LOW ANGLE, look up the wall.  Flatbed appears over the edge and stops.
Hovering.

ON THE BACK OF FLATBED.  Bud has the break he needs.  He scrambles up onto the
deck and opens and equipment locker.  Nothing in it but one of the yellow
nylon safety lines.  The big arm begins to unfold, lifting Geek/ROV.

Coffey works intently.  His eyes are the cool ice of lethal madness in a
face streaked with blood.  He brings the ROV into view with the boom arm.

GEEK/ROV had a passenger.  Brigman.  The diver is holding Geek's skid with
one hand, doing something with the other.  He turns to look at Coffey.

Coffey releases the ROV with the gripper and makes a grab at Bud with the
steel claw.  Bud dives.  The gripper hits his helmet a glancing blow.  Bud
kicks away rapidly, letting nylon rope pay out.  We see he has managed to tie
one end to Geek's skids.  Coffey hits the button to activate the ROV, sending
an acoustic pulse to Geek's transponder.  The little robot, pregnant with its
load of death, turns nimbly around and dives out and down toward the void.

Coffey pivots his bid machine toward Bud.  Bud strokes rapidly to a large
jumble of wreckage.  He loops the rope around a twisted pipe.  Big Geek is
hauling ass away from him.  The line snap taut an instant later.  The ROV
strains, like a Rottweiler on a leash... trying to go.  The rope is slipping
as Bud fights to make a knot.

Flatbed slews around, thrusters whining.  As it banks, it hurls up clouds of
sediment from the escarpment face.

Through the front panel we see Coffey jerking on the controls.

The big arm extends menacingly.  The smaller from manipulators open.  An
enormous predatory instinct, its lights blaring.

The big machine roars forward.  Straight at Bud.

Bud gets his knot partly done.  See Flatbed looming.

Glare-lit in its lights, Bud grabs a handlehold and pulls himself downward as
Coffey closes the last few feet.

One manipulator slams into his backpack, tumbling him, and the sub's underside
rakes across his legs as it passes over.  Flatbed crushes into the tangle of
pipework.  K-CRUUUNCH!!

Bud swims clear, diving down at an angle along the wall, hoping to stay in
Coffey's blind area.  Flatbed backs out of the wreckage in a cloud of debris.
It pivots toward Bud.  Moves after him.

Nearby, the ROV is whining mindlessly, trying to please.  Trying to GO.
DETAIL OF ROPE attached to wreckage, as Bud's knot begins to slip.  The nylon
line starts to play through the knot slowly.

BUD has gotten himself into a bad position.  Along the bare rock face of the
cliff wall he is naked, nailed in the spotlights like a rabbit in front of a
truck.  Coffey puts the hammer down, thrust levers all the way forward.
Flatbed surges forward, multi-limbed and demonic.  There's no cover, side to
side, up or down.

Coffey has him head in his lights.  Suddenly a bright glare blasts in,
blinding Coffey.  He looks up to see Cab One rushing down upon him, full
throttle.

At the last moment LIndsey slams the thrusters full-lock and the submersible
slews sideways, slamming its heavy skidplate into Flatbed's cab.  Coffey is
smashed sideways by the shock.  He fights to control his vehicle.  Lindsey
looks up to see Coffey's sub gun it up over the wall, out of sight.  She
cruises up over Bud.

FLATBED DROPS INTO FRAME BEHIND THEM, dwarfing little Cab One.  They are
slammed viciously as Coffey's submersible hammers into them.  She hits full
throttle.  Coffey floors it after Lindsey, ramming her from behind with his
more powerful vehicle.  With difficulty Lindsey maintains trim.

She arcs back toward the rig.  Flatbed slams her again, for the side.  She
fights for control.

Now the fight is really on.  The two subs are dodging between the cylindrical
modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure
hulls.

Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along
the flank of one of the trimodules.

They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.

Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing
up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock
pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon.
Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.

Lindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that.

Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.

Lindsey rises, cuts right.

Smashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in
the rocks.

Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom.
Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.

It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.

Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the
wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds
her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge.

ANGLE DOWN THE WALL as it falls, trailing a cloud of sediment like a comet's
tail, down into the unfathomable blackness below.

Inside the machine, Coffey is fighting for control.

He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge.  As the
pressure intensifies the hull begins to groan, and steel fitting scream with
the enormous load.

A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble.  Grows.
Coffey gives up fighting.  Just stares, wide eyed, at his death.  A damned
soul dropping into the bottomless pit.

The fracture line arcs rapidly across the dome port.

Suddenly, a scythe-like curtain of seawater, under tons of pressure, slashes
into him.  A moment later the bubble implodes, and Coffey disappears in a
bloody froth of churning water, air and glass shards.

Flatbed looks like a toy, tumbling away down the wall.

Soon its lights vanish.

<b>INT. CAB ONE                                                            190
</b>
They're both going to have a lot of bruises...

Lindsey is surveying the damage.  Water is spraying down on them like a
shower, and lights are flickering.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                You did okay, back there.  I was fairly
                impressed.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Not in this thing.

Lindsey is flipping switches.  Nothing works.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                You totaled it, huh?

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Yeah.  So sue me.

Bud looks down.  There's already about a foot of water sloshing around the
floor at their feet.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                It's flooding like a son of the bitch.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                You noticed.

She picks up and hand-mike of the underwater telephone.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Deepcore, Deepcore, this is Cab One, over.

She waits.  No response.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Try again.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance,
                over.  Deepcore, this--

With a SEARING CRACKLE or arc-light, a power panel shorts out and everything
goes black.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Well, that's that.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Wonderful.
                          (looking around)
                There's some light from somewhere...

A faint illumination, dimmer than moonlight, washes in through the front port.
Lindsey scrunches up against the acrylic and scans the darkness.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Over there.  It's the rig.

A glow, beyond a rock promontory... like the lights of a town just over the
hill in the desert.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Good hundred yards, I'd say.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                They'll come out after us.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find
                us.  We better get this flooding stopped.

He picks up his helmet and clicks on the light.  Using the thing like a bulky
flashlight.  The water is really pouring in, spraying them like a shower...
almost two feet deep already.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                You see where it's coming in?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Somewhere behind this panel.  Hold this.

She takes the light and he tries to reach the burst weld, which is blocked by
a steel switch panel and a bunch of conduit.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Can't get to it.  Have to pull this panel off.
                You go any tools?

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                I don't know, look around.

Bud scans the cramped interior, feels around under the water.  It's past his
knees.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Nothing.  Son of a bitch.  All I need's a goddamn
                crescent wrench.

He grabs the panel in both hands and starts torquing on it, trying to wrench
it off the wall.  Heaves on it repeatedly.  Finally stops, panting.  He's
breathing hard now, and it's not just effort.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Son of a bitch!

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Calm down, Bud.

A nervous edge in her voice now.  Bud's turning all around, looking around
for anything, trying to think fast.  Water up to their waists.  The sea
closing in.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                How?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                I don't know how!

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                We've only got one suit.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                I know!  I know!  But we better come up with
                something.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!

She climbs up on the pilots seat, scrunching right up against the ceiling,
keeping as much of herself as possible out of the frigid water.  She's
shaking all over with the cold, and getting drenched from above by water
pouring in.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back
                with another suit.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough
                time.  Look at this...
                       (the rate of flooding)
                Time I get back you'll be--

That stops the conversation for a second.  About two feet of airspace left.
Bud can't believe what this is coming down to.  They both stare at each other
for a long moment.

He makes a decision.  Starts pulling off his backpack.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Alright, put this on.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                What, you growing gills all of a sudden?  You
                got it on, keep it on.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Don't argue, goddamnit, just--

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.

Bud has his pack off uncoupling it.  She keeps fighting his hands, stopping
him, hooking it back up.  The desperation of the situation fuel the struggle.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--

<b>                                BUD
</b><b>                FUCK LOGIC!!
</b>
They're both right up against the ceiling, water up to their chests.
Lindsey's lips are blue and trembling from the cold.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Listen... will you listen to me for a second!?
                You're for the suit on and you're a better
                swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...

<b>                                BUD
</b>                What's the plan?

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                I drown, you tow me back to the rig--

<b>                                BUD
</b><b>                WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
</b>
Lindsey's gut-scared... shaking violently, her eyes wide.  But she's keeping
it together.  Thinking it out.  Bud see the bottomless pit opening to take her
and he can barely think.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Look, this water is only a couple degrees above
                freezing.  I drown.  I go into deep hypothermia...
                my blood like icewater.  I can maybe be revived
                after ten, fifteen minutes.  You got all the
                stuff to do it on the rig.

Bud stops moving and looks into her face, inches from him.  The water is up
to their necks.  He knows that, as always, infuriatingly, Lindsey is right.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                It is insane.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.

She takes a deep breath.  Before her nerve fails she busies her hands on his
suit, rehooking everything.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Jesus, I don't believe this is happening.

She raise his helmet.  Water up to their chins.  They lock eyes, inches
apart.  He can feel her breath on his face... maybe for the last time.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Oh God, Lins... I--

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Tell me later.

He grabs her head in both hands and pulls her mouth to his.  They lock
together in a fierce kiss, fueled by passion and terror... the naked
realization of love hanging over the abyss of death.

She breaks away at the last possible second and quickly pulls his helmet
over his head.  Seats is down over the neck ring.  Lock the bail-out handle,
sealing it.  Even with her head press up into the highest point of the
ceiling, Lindsey's mouth is barely above water.  She give a scared little
laugh.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                This is maybe not such a great plan, is it?

She is half-paralyzed with the cold, shaking pathetically.  Puts her face to
the glass of his helmet.  Seconds to go.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Hold me.  Hold me, Bud... I'm so scared...

He can't hear her, but he read her lips.  They clutch each other desperately.
The embrace last while the water rises over her mouth and nose.  She starts
to choke.  Her hands grip his shoulders like claws.  She bucks and thrashes.
Bud holds her, and a scream tears loose from him, a pure agony of the soul.

<b>                                BUD
</b><b>                NOOOOO!!!
</b>
The freezing seawater races into her lungs.  Her finger go slack, and her
hands float lifelessly.

Bud stares, transfixed, as the last tiny bubble trickles out of Lindsey's open
mouth.  He kicks himself into gear, fingers frenzied as he spins the wheel of
the lockout hatch.

<b>                                                                CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INT. DEEPCORE/COMMAND MODULE                                            191
</b>
TIGHT ON VIDEO SCREEN, one of the outside cameras.  A ghostly figure swims out
of the darkness, towing something.

<b>                                ONE NIGHT
</b>                It's Bud.  Oh my God... that's Lindsey!

                                BUD (V.O./faint)
                Deepcore, Deepcore, do you read?

<b>                                HIPPY
</b>                Read you, Bud.  We're here.

<b>EXT. DEEPCORE                                                           192
</b>
Bud swims with long, powerful kicks, towing Lindsey.  Her arms and legs float
as gracefully as seaweed waving in a gentle current.  Bud's voice comes in
short rasps, breathing hard, but icy with control.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen...
                de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc
                syringe... and some... heating blankets.
                You got all that?

<b>                                HIPPY (V.O.)
</b>                Got it. Over.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Meet me in the moonpool.  Move fast.

<b>INT. INFIRMARY                                                          193
</b>
The door crashes open and Jammer thunders in.  He picks up the CPR cart, meant
to roll on wheels, and carries it out past Hippy, Catfish, and One Night, who
are crowding in to get the rest of the equipment.  They ransack the place in
about ten seconds, grabbing everything they might need and half of everything
else.

<b>EXT. DEEPCORE/UNDER THE MOONPOOL                                        194
</b>
Bud moves up toward the rectangle of light, towing Lindsey to the diving
platform.  Through the surface we can see the others arrive at the edge,
looking down.

<b>INT. SUB-BAY                                                            195
</b>
Hippy and Catfish are setting up the cart and the oxygen kit, dropping things,
making mistakes.  One Night is teaching herself how to fill a syringe from a
bottle of adrenaline.

<b>                                SONNY
</b>                Here he comes!

Jammer and Sonny leap into the freezing water, waist deep on the submerged
diving platform.  Bud bursts to the surface.  Together they haul Lindsey
across the platform, out of the water, and onto the deck.  Her skin is blue-
white, her chest still.

Bud rips his helmet off in a near-frenzy, like a man possessed, a man with a
mission.  The others are galvanized by his energy even though they all see
Lindsey as dead, a corpse... cold and inert.  Water flows from her mouth and
nose and her lips are blue, her limbs completely limp.  Hippy peels back one
eyelid, to find the pupil fixed and dilated.

But when Bud shouts for them to move, they move.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Turn her over!

They flip his wife's body over.  He straddles her, pushing down with both
hands in the middle of her back.  Seawater gushes from her slack lips.  He
does it again until the flow stops, then flips her onto her back.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Come on, hurry!  Gimme the de-fib...

One Night and Catfish are fumbling with the emergency cart equipment.  They've
all been trained in CPR and use of the gear but that was years ago, and is a
friend they're working on.  They're all thumbs.  Catfish drops the electrodes,
picks them up quickly, hands them to Bud...

<b>                                CATFISH
</b>                Here, here, here... no, you got to have bare
                skin, or it won't...

Bud rips into her clothing, opening her jumpsuit, literally tearing away her
T-shirt, revealing her bare chest... bony and still.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Jesus.  Gimme those, come on.  Catfish, move it,
                man!  Come on... come on!

He slaps the things into Lindsey's bare skin, one on the sternum and one on
the side of the rib cage.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Is that it?  Is this right?

<b>                                HIPPY
</b>                Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                All right.  Do it!

One Night hits the switch and Lindsey's body convulses.  It is a pure muscle
reflex, and when it is over, there is not a hint of life.  Hippy pushes him
back and puts a black rubber oxygen mask over her mouth.  He opens the valve
on the cylinder and starts pumping the squeeze bag.  They start packing
electronic blankets around her to fight the intense hypothermia

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Do it again, One Night.  Zap her again!

The current hits Lindsey again and her back arches.  Bud doesn't wait for a
result... he's in his own reality now, driven.  He's doing it all at once,
somehow, in a senseless frenzy... pumping on her chest with his hands,
squeezing the oxygen bag, placing the electrodes.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Aw.  Christ... come on, baby.  Again!  Do it
                again!

Lindsey's back arches.  Her body relaxes, inert.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Come on, One Night... what are you waiting for?

A hush seems to have fallen over the group.  They know instinctively that it's
over.  But Bud can't accept it.  He looks at them, beseechingly, like they
are somehow intentionally holding out on him.  One Night starts to cry,
quietly.

<b>                                CATFISH
</b>                                (gently)
                Bud, it's over, man.  It's over.

There is a beat of silence.  Bud stares down into Lindsey's half-open,
motionless eyes.

TIGHT ON LINDSEY'S EYES, moving in until the pupil FILLS FRAME, a black void.

REVERSE, HER POV.  SILENCE.  A distant, distorted image, we see Bud, One
Night, Jammer, Hippy, Catfish, staring down.  It is like the circular top of
a dark well, their faces shimmering as if through the surface of water.  It is
as if we are in a well, descending, looking up at a circle of faces growing
smaller as we drop away... smaller and smaller, receding until it becomes
a point of light in the void, like the fading bright dot at the center of a
turned-off TV.

TIGHT ON BUD, rigid, staring.  Catfish puts his hand gently on Bud's shoulder.
Suddenly Bud tears Catfish's hand away and sets upon Lindsey like a madman,
renewing his efforts in spades... totally manic.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                No!  NO!  She's not... her heart is strong,
                she wants to live... can't you see that?  Come
                on, Lins.  Come on, baby!  Zap her again!  Do
                it... DO IT!

They do.  And Bud works, feverishly.  He lock his lips over hers and starts
mouth-to-mouth.  It is frantic, passionate... the kiss of life.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Come on, breath!  Goddamn it, you bitch, you
                never backed down from anything in life... now
                fight!

He slaps her face, hard.  Her head lolls.  He smacks her the other way.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Fight, Goddamnit!

LINDSEY's POV, from the bottom of the great well.  The circles of faces and
light rockets toward us in the blackness, as we soar upward from the pit.  We
see Bud yelling, but his voice is distant, windlike.

<b>                                BUD
</b><b>                FIGHT!!
</b>
TIGHT ON LINDSEY, still.  Then something incredible happens.  Something they
will never forget as long as they live.  Lindsey coughs once, weakly, and her
hands clench in a spasm.

Bud see it and his expression becomes beatific.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Come on, Lins.  You can do it... fight your
                way back, baby...

The others look on in wonder as Bud wills this woman back.

She starts to cough, weakly at first... then more violently as she draws air
into her lungs.  Bud crouches over her, rubbing her limbs... trying to re-
establish circulation.  It is like a difficult birth.  Lindsey comes hacking
and howling back into the world, wet and naked and fighting for breath.

Bud puts the oxygen mask over her face and she draws breath after agonized
breath.  He pushes her wet hair back from her face with his trembling hands,
and watches her breathe.  Color is returning to her skin as she lies there,
gasping weakly.

ONE THE GROUP... Catfish, Hippy, One Night, Jammer, the others... they're
all grinning, crying, beaming... gazing at the miracle of her rebirth.

ON BUD... tears are streaming down his face.

TIGHT ON LINDSEY, sleeping peacefully.  WIDER shows Bud hovering over her,
attentive.  They are alone in Bud's tiny cubicle.  Perhaps twenty minutes
have passed.  She is completely swaddles in blankets, except for her face,
and looks like a waif.

Lindsey's eyes flutter and open.  The first thing she sees is Bud, bending
over her.  He can't help himself.  The tears break again and roll down his
cheeks.  She seems terribly fragile, but bright and aware.  She smiles,
faintly... touches his cheek.

TIGHT ON BUD'S EYES, as Monk's fingers insert acrylic scleral lenses under his
eyelids so he can see in the fluid helmet.

WIDER reveals Bud is wearing the SEALs' deep suit.  Everybody is grouped
around, buckling and zipping.  He is hyperventilating with an oxygen mask,
part of the procedure for transitioning from air to fluid breathing.  Monk,
on his stretcher, is presiding.  The resident expert.  Lindsey is wrapped in a
blanket, still looking wan and frail.  She doesn't have the strength to resist
Bud's will, but she's trying.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                No, Bud, no... not you.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Who then?

She looks around at the others.  Sees their eyes.  The fear.  Has her answer.
He lowers the helmet over his head.  Catfish clamps it down.  We see what's
driving him... his sense of responsibility for these people, for not being
able to prevent this situation.

He touches her cheek, one last time.  She sees his fingers are trembling.
Then he puts on the gloves.  Catifsh is strapping a KEYPAD UNIT onto Bud's
forearm.  Lindsey wants to scream... to stop this madness.

                                BUD (muffled)
                So I'll hear you, but I can't talk?

<b>                                MONK
</b>                The fluid prevents your larynx from making
                sound.  It'll feel a little strange.

                                BUD (muffled)
                Warning you now, folks, I'm a lousy typist.
                              (a beat)
                The moment of truth, huh?

His breathing is shallow and tense.  He looks at Lindsey.  The eyes of a
condemned man.  She squeezes his hand.  He takes a deep breath.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Okay.  Let's rock and roll.

Monk gently cracks a valve on the suit's feed line.  The breathing fluid (3M
fluorocarbon emulsion FX-80) swirls into the helmet.  Bud reflexively raises
his chin.  The liquid fills toward his mouth.

<b>                                MONK
</b>                Relax now, Bud.  Just keep breathing as it
                fills... don't fight it.  Take it in.  Just let
                yourself take it in.

Suddenly, there's nothing in there to breathe but liquid.  His eyes go wide,
instant panic.  He starts to thrash.  Chest heaving.

<b>                                MONK
</b>                Hold him.  Hold him.  This is normal... it'll

                breathe liquid for nine months, Bud.  Your body
                will remember.

Lindsey grabs Bud's shoulders, steadying him.  He finds her eyes, the look
calming him.  He's passed into a realm from which she has already returned.
His spasms subside.  He begins to "breathe" normally.  He gets a goofy look
of wonder on his face, not really believing what he's experiencing.  He is
alive, alert and quite completely drowned inside the FBS helmet.  He grins.
Gives a big thumbs up.  Lindsey picks up a microphone.

<b>                                LINDSEY

                          (another thumbs up)
                Try your keypad.

Bud taps out a brief message.  FEELS WEIRD - YOU SHOULD TRY THIS prints out
on their portable monitor.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                I already have, moron.

They help Bud to the edge of the dive platform.  Jammer and Hippy lower Little
Geek into the water and Bud grabs onto it.  Hippy yells right up next to his
helmet.

<b>                                HIPPY

                He should take you right to it.  All you gotta
                do is hang on!

Lindsey crouches at the edge to watch Bud submerge.

He looks up at her as he drops away.

In a few seconds, she can't see him.  Her chin quivers, minutely.

FROM FAR BELOW, Deepcore is a faint tiara of lights, above in the blackness.
A single moving light appears above, at the edge of the cliff, and starts
down.  It grows large, resolving into Bud, free-falling down the wall.

He gathers speed as Little Geek's vertical thruster drives them down.

Bud looks down.  Between his feet he can see a short way down the wall in the
glow of his single light, and beyond that an unfathomable blackness.  The wall
unrolls upwards out of the darkness like a convoluted gray drapery.  He looks
up.  The lights of Deepcore are gone.  He feels  more alone than he has ever
felt.  He types out:  CANT SEE YOU

like a forty-ton yo-yo at the end of the umbilical.

types out: GOOD DEAL ON SLIGHTLY USED CRANE.  They watch the depth meter
counting down.

pool of light.  The wall is sterile brown-gray, devoid of life at this depth.

yawning below.

Lindsey has somehow tuned out the others in the room.  In her mind she is
with Bud, out in the darkness.

of pressure takes him.

Bud is in an enormous school of bioluminescent squid, graceful, attenuated
creatures less than a foot long.  Thousands of then glide in ghostly arcs
around him, filling the black void as far as the eye can see.  He stares at
them in wonder.  Reaches out and touches one, catches it, lets it go.  Are
they really here?  He can no longer be sure of his own perceptions.

Bud emerges from the school of squid.  As he falls, they form a luminous plane
of swirling colors above him.  He stares upwards, transfixed.  BUD'S POV, the
ghostly blizzard of luminescence above him.  A spectral form takes shape in
the patternless glow... resolving into Lindsey's face, a hundred feet wide.
Gazing down at him, her expression sad.  Her image receded away from him into
the darkness above as he falls.

he's having a hard time staying conscious.  He tries to type a message and he

Blackness.  Then a bright light appears... he's lit a MAGNESIUM FLARE.

It's fierce, flickering glare lights his plunge.  Bud discards the stalwart
little ROV and free-falls like a skydiver without a chute.  Out of control, he
hits a ledge and rolls off.  Tumbles forward in a cloud of debris.  He hits
another outcropping, limp as a rag doll.  Rocks and sand rain down with him
as he continues his descent.

Bud us quivering, teeth locked in a titanic rigor.

He pulls his arms and legs slowly into a fetal position.

In the plunge toward death he has gone he has gone full circle, returned to
the womb in which we all breathe the water of life before we know the world of
air and light.  Still, there is Lindsey's voice, faintly in his helmet.

<b>                                LINDSEY (V.O.)
</b>                You remember that time, you were pretty drunk,
                you probably don't remember... the power went
                out at the old apartment, the one on Orange
                Street... and we were staring at that one little
                candle, and I said something really dumb like
                that candle is me, like every one of us is out
                there alone in the dark in this life...

TIGHT ON LINDSEY as she grips the microphone.  Her voice has become a hoarse
whisper.  Her eyes are intense, focused on a point far beyond the walls of the
room.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>              ... and you lit another candle and put it beside
                mine and said "that's me"... and we stared at
                the two candles, and then we... well, if you
                remember any of it, I'm sure you remember the
                next part.  Bud, there are two candles in the
                dark.  I'm with you.  I'll always be with you.

A tiny flickering light moves down along a vast black wall.  Bud falls on in
dream-like solitude, a candle in the dark.

                Talk to us, Buddy boy.

They watch the screen, expectantly.

Nothing.  Hippy and One Night start checking the equipment.  Lindsey tried
unsuccessfully to keep the terror our of here voice.

There is an agonizing pause, then the letters appear slowly:  SHAKING STOPED.

Bud is no longer in pain.  His expression is rapt.

LOOKING DOWN, past his to a ghostly landscape.  His last flare sputters out,
but there is light.  Bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon
below him.  And he's right... it is beautiful.

The water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past Bud's tiny, silhouetted
figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels.  Barren as
the moon but exquisite, serene.  Changeless.  A place unseen by human eyes.
Like a firefly below, the lights of Big Geek are visible.  Bud descends toward
the ROV, which has grounded on a narrow shelf.  Below the shelf, the wall
slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it.

ONE BIG GEEK/MIRV, sitting there like a dumbshit.  Bud's feet thump into the
sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles.  Touchdown... three and
half miles of water over his head.  Bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of
fireflies.

Bud is peering into the detonator unit.  How bad is he?  We can't tell.

                I repeat... NOT the black wire with the yellow
                stripe.

Bud is staring.  Blinking.  The two wire look big as sewer pipes, and they're
miles away... way down there where his hands are.

The only light he has left is a CYALUME STICK.  He pulls out the little
plastic tube.  Breaks and shakes.  It starts to glow, a tiny wand of green
light.  He fumbles with his tool pouch, takes out a pair of side-cutters.
CUTING NNOW he types to them.  He reaches into the detonator.

DETAIL, THE WIRES... in the green Cyalume glow, the look identical.  The
cutters go over on wire.  A long beat.  They withdraw, then go over the other
wire...

He cuts--

Bud is one his knees beside the dead warhead.  His expression is enigmatic.
He looks around slowly at the luminous canyon.  Starts to type.

Lindsey sobs at the mike.  The others look away.  The signal is weakening.
One Night boosts it and the screen clears briefly.

She stares at the printout.

A tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert ROV, an Indian dying with his
horse in the desert.

Bud's eyelids close.  His chest barely moving.

A strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open.  He blinks.  Weakly,
he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance.

BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to
be an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an
extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body
and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A
delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates
gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The
head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a
cold, dispassionate wisdom.

It is stunningly beautiful.

The creature settles toward him.  Unafraid, Bud extends his hand.

Its slender, blown-glass digits grasp his bulky glove.  It pulls him up from
the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the
abyss.

At the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below.  They
resolve into NTI ships.  Tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that Lindsey
nearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And
others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.

Suddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of
brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below
them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the
center, as if the light were surging through channels.  The NTIs are revealing
their home to Bud.  The ships move among the spires like air traffic over a
major city.

Bud and the creature descend until, between the lines of light, we see a dark
surface of inhuman design.  The shape extends beyond the limits of visibility.
Towers hundreds of feet high stretch upward from the curving surface.  It
dwarfs their figures as the descend toward it, approaching an opening that soon
yawns like a vast mouth.

They are picking up speed, swept along by a powerful current, into the mouth-
like opening.

Bud stares around in awe as smooth, pearlescent walls blur past him.  It is a
curving three-dimensional maze of tunnels, like a vast circulatory system,
where controlled currents of water become freeways in three-dimensional
space.  Tunnels divide, narrow, and reenter main-routes hundreds of feet
across, as the pair race through in a dizzying blur.

Entering a smaller chamber they settle to the floor, and the NTI moves back a
few feet.

A shimmering plane or surface appears like a vertical curtain bisecting the
chamber.  The seawater divides, like the Red Sea, into two rippling walls.
They move apart.  Leaving Bud standing in a short, shimmering hallway.

Weakly, he uncouples his helmet and pulls it free.  Drops to his knees.
Doubles over as spasms wrack him.  Breathing fluid explodes from his lungs.
He lies gasping and coughing on the floor, dragging in deep breaths of what
he can only hope is air.  It is.

Bud slowly recovers, sitting up.  His head is clearing.  This really is
happening.  Beyond the shimmering, vertical surface of the water he sees the
NTI being joined by others, move or less identical, until a group of seven
is gathered watching him.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Howdy, Uuuh... how you guys doin'?

His voice echoes metallically in the strange chamber.  Soft laps of water
from the 'walls'.

In the air a pattern of glowing lines appears, a series of what appears to be
circuit diagrams.  Bud staggers back from this strange 'screen' hanging in
mid-air.  The image is about twenty feet across.

There is a rolling jumble of static and interference which resolves into...
the face of Dan Rather, doing the evening news.  STATIC, then another
newscast.  And another.  Fragments of the same story.  The world on the brink
of war.

<b>                                BUD

                say?  That you know what's been going on up
                there?

The NTIs are impassive.  Static... then another newscast.

This time, we're allowed to focus on the story.  An on-the-scene interview
outside a high-tech seismology lab.  There is an air of hysteria about the
scene... technicians running across the background of the shot, people
shouting, the reporter jamming his mike at the harried-looking scientist.

<b>                                REPORTER

                clearer explanation then we're getting?

Berg is edgy and distracted.  People keeps handing him pieces of paper,
computer hardcopy.  The biggest thing in his life is happening...

<b>                                BERG
</b>                They're acoustic shockwaves, like tsunamis, but
                with no seismological source.  The waves are
                propagating toward the shorelines of every
                continent--

An assistant runs up, face shiny with fear, beckoning.  We see that Berg is
running scared.  The impossible bringing the greatest terror to the rational
mind.

<b>                                BERG
</b>                Yeah.  I'll be right there... I have to go.
                Look, we don't know what it is!  Okay?  Not the
                slightest goddamn idea!

The image dissolves into static, fades out.  Bud turns to the NTIs.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                You're doing it!  Right?  That's what you're
                telling me.  Yeah, you can control water...
                that's your technology.  But why?

Static again, then a brilliant flash.  Grainy stock film of a hydrogen bomb
test in the Pacific.

The film repeats, and then again, faster, and again until is merges into an
unbroken white glare.  Bud gets the message.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                Hey, you don't know they're really gonna do it.
                Where do you get off passing judgment on us,
                when you can't be sure?  How do you know?

The screen exploded into a staccato series of searing images, stark moments
from recent history...

US soldiers fighting in Vietnam, street warfare in Beirut, a car bomb in
Belfast, a suspect shot in the head in the streets of Saigon, burned and
bleeding children, grainy footage of corpses bulldozed into mass graves at
Auschwitz, Wermacht soldiers marching in goose-step review, a 13-year-old
contra with an AK-47...  Just glimpses, strobing... a few frames of each.
But enough.  The images continue.

HOLD ON BUD, as the lights flicker on his face, the ongoing indictment of
humanity.

A roar fills the air, a thunder which drowns out the people's screams, even
the rotors of the news chopper as the camera teams scrambles aboard.  They
leave the announcer standing transfixed, his face blank, eyes tracking upward
and upward as the ground begins to shake.

The wave slows as it crests...

And stops.

2600 feet high and motionless except for a shimmering undulation of its
surface in the bright sun.  There is quiet, a faint wind and calling of
confused gulls.  Various reactions, as the thunder fades and people recover,
only to stand awed before the vast, inexplicable manifestation.  A news
helicopter passes in front of it like a dragonfly.

A pause, then:

<b>LOVE YOU WIFE
</b>
The last message expands to fill the entire screen.

Bud stares at the screen, at his message of self-sacrifice, then at the
aliens.  They bow their heads, just for a moment.  A sign of respect.

CLOSE ON BUD as he begins to realize what has happened.

<b>                                                                CUT TO:

<b>INT. DEEPCORE/CONTROL MODULE                                            239
</b>
Lindsey is slumped in a chair, just staring.  Withdrawn.

The others are conserving oxygen and heat, huddling in the dark.

The air is looking pretty thick.  The speaker of the hydrophone transceiver
crackles to life.

<b>                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
</b>                Deepcore, do you read?  This is Benthic Explorer,
                over.

<b>                                CATFISH
</b>                Hell yes, we read!  Good of you to join us.  How's
                that storm doin'?

<b>                                MCBRIDE
</b>                Well, it's strange... it just kind've blew
                itself out all of the sudden.  We're up here in
                a flat sea with no wind.  But then a lot of weird
                things've been happening.

<b>                                CATFISH
</b>                Well, hell, son.  You better get us a line down
                here, we're in moderately poor shape.

LATER, Hippy, Catfish, and Monk are conferring B.G. on how to get a new
umbilical hooked on.  One Night is talking to McBride on the hydrophone.

<b>                                MCBRIDE
</b>                They figure is was over a half mile high.

<b>                                ONE NIGHT
</b>                I wish I could have seen it--

She glances down at the telemetry screen, seeing movement.

<b>                                ONE NIGHT
</b>                Hey.  Hey!  HEY!!  Look... it's Bud.

<b>                                MONK
</b>                That's impossible.

Lindsey bolts to the screen.  Stares at the message printing out.

A huge grin wraps around her face.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                No it's not.

<b>                                MCBRIDE (V.O.)
</b>                What's it say?

Lindsey take the mike and sits before the screen.  During the message, her
voice will go through an emotional spectrum from confusion to wonder, to a
childlike joy.

<b>INTERCUT BETWEEN DEEPCORE AND EXPLORER BRIDGE DURING THE FOLLOWING:
</b>
<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                It says...

</b><b>                US HURTING EACH OTHER/GETTING OUT OF HAND LATELY"
</b>
Lindsey grins as she reads the next part...

<b>                                LINSEY
</b><b>                "THEY SENT A MESSAGE/HOPE YOU GOT IT"
</b>
<b>                                CATFISH
</b>                I'd say that's a big 10-4, jack.

<b>                                LINDSEY

<b>INT. BENTHIC EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                     240
</b>
Beyond the windows the ocean is calm.  The sky steel-gray put placid.  McBride
turns to Commodore DeMarco and the Navy contingent, his eyebrows cocked.

<b>                                MCBRIDE
</b>                Looks like you boys might by out of business.

<b>                                BENDIX
</b>                Something's going on down there.  I'm getting
                some big readings....

Bendix is hunched over the sonar, and we can see the screens lit up like a
Wurlitzer.

<b>INT. DEEPCORE                                                           241
</b>
In Deepcore the crew becomes aware of a strange subsonic rumbling.  The sonar
is going crazy.  One Night puts the headphones of her passive sonar rig up to
her ear, then jerks it away.

<b>                                ONE NIGHT
</b>                Whew!  Whatever this is, it's major.

The rumbling increases and a glow diffuses the water.

The glow intensifies until a blinding shaft of light blasts through the
viewport, bathing the whole interior in a cold white radiance.

A last message appears on the screen:

<b>KEEP YOU PANTYHOSE ON/YOURE GONNA LOVE THIS
</b>
The radiance intensifies.  Everyone covers their eyes.  It flares to
<b>WHITE-OUT.
</b>
<b>                                                                CUT TO:

<b>INT./EXT. EXPLORER BRIDGE -- DAY                                        242

Bendix and the bridge crew are going nuts.  All their instruments are pegged.

<b>                                BENDIX
</b>                Active is pinging back something big... it's
                enormous!  Coming up right under us.

<b>                                DEMARCO

<b>                                BENDIX

                         (looks out the window)
                Over there!  Port bow.

<b>EXT. BENTHIC EXPLORER AND OCEAN                                         243
</b>
A depression appears in the surface of the sea a hundred yards off, not
swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.

It gets wider.  Deeper.  Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.

The ocean is OPENING.

Now the surface is churned by turbulence.  Slow massive roils of tremendous
power boil up from the depths.

McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.

The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.

The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.

SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive spire.  Smoothly
curving and iridescent.  Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another
spire rises.  Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the
energy of Niagara.

Off the port bow... another spire.

And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.

Six towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising.

One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out
the sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF
<b>CREATION.
</b>
And now for the payoff shot:  WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.  THE SPIRES FORM A
<b>PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.  A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM
</b><b>THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.  THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.  IT IS ALL ONE.
</b>
<b>THE NTI ARK.
</b>
It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad
back.  We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic
being, which we assumed was a city.  The Explorer rocks gently on its flat
hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.

The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of
the vast, slightly curved hull.  The missile cruiser rocks back and forth
nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.

ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy
contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.
Touched by the hand of God.

<b>                                BENDIX
</b>                Look...

WHAT THEY SEE -- Fifty yards away, between them and the Albany, sits Deepcore
Two.  It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the
glistening plain of the NTI Ark's hull.

CLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.

Catfish's feet appear, bicycling.  He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.
Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like.  Jammer plonks down behind
him.  He turns, lifts Lindsey down.  Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into
the light of the sun.  A deliverance from the blackest night they will ever
know.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                We should be dead.  We didn't decompress.

<b>                                CATFISH
</b>                Out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook-
                up Coke.

<b>                                HIPPY
</b>                They must've done something to us.

Lindsey has tears streaming down her cheeks... for the sun, for life, for
their deliverance and the larger one she knows has happened, an epiphany for
the whole human race.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Oh, yes.  I think you could say that.

She blinks.  Seeing something not far away.  She gives a little laugh, or
something between laughing and crying.

REVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like
enterances to the NTI structure.  His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS
helmet dangles from one hand jauntily.

She starts toward him.  Breaks into a run.  Then stops a few feet from him.
Watching him come to her.

His smile, his eyes illuminating her.

He stops and she touches him, lightly.  Is this real?

The look at each other, wonderingly a moment.

Then laugh.  She sniffs loudly.

<b>                                LINDSEY
</b>                Hello, Brigman.

<b>                                BUD

Their lips meet.

<b>                                                                CUT TO BLACK
