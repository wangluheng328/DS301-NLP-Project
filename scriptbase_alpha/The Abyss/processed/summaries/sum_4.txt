The ballistic missile submarine USS Montana sinks under mysterious circumstances.
The doomed boat settles on a ledge several hundred feet deep and on the edge of an even deeper ocean abyss.
US Navy SEALS are brought in to salvage the sub's missiles and an experimental civilian deep water oil-drilling rig is commandeered to help.
All goes well until the SEAL leader suffers from high pressure madness and the rig is visited by the "Non-Terrestrial Intelligence" that apparently lives in the abyss.
The ensuing struggle results in a race against time to prevent World War III and a reunion between the estranged couple that designed and operate the oil rig.
