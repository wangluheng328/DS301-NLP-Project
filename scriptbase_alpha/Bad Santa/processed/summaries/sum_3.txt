Santa and his little helper are confidence men casing a mall all holiday season and robbing it blind Christmas Eve.
The elf "shops" the stores while Santa cracks the mall safe.
Following them through one last season of perverse holiday cheer you hear the 'f' word more frequently than in Scarface.
We meet a woman bartender who has always had a thing for Santas, and a little boy who evokes genuine emotional change in Santa.
