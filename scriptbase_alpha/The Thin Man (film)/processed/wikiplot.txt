Nick Charles (Powell), a retired detective, and his wife Nora (Loy) are attempting to settle down when he is pressed back into service when a friend disappears after a murder.
The friend, Clyde Wynant (Ellis) (the eponymous "thin man"), has mysteriously vanished.
When his former secretary and love interest, Julia Wolf, is found dead, evidence points to Wynant as the prime suspect, but his daughter Dorothy (O'Sullivan) refuses to believe that her father is guilty.
She convinces Nick to take the case, much to the amusement of his socialite wife.
The detective begins to uncover clues and eventually solves the mystery of the disappearance through a series of investigative steps.

The murderer is finally revealed in a classic dinner-party scene that features all of the suspects.
A skeletonized body, found during the investigation, had been assumed to be that of a "fat man" because it is wearing oversize clothing.
The clothes are revealed to be planted, and the identity of the body is accurately determined by an old war wound to the leg.
It turns out that the body belongs to a "thin man" â€” the missing Wynant.
The double murder has been disguised in such a way as to make it seem that Wynant is the killer and still alive.
The real killers are people who stole a lot of money from Wynant and killed him on the night he was last seen.
