</b>



                                  Written by

                               Brian Helgeland  


<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>          CLOSE ON a spectacular example of PEUCETIA VIRIDANS.
          Descending through mid-air on a silken thread. Neon green
          with black leopard spots on its legs. A Green Lynx Spider.
          As we follow it down, the threaded opening of a GLASS JAR
          appears from the bottom of frame.
          Just before the spider continues inside the jar, it stops,
          suspended. Something's not right. It waves a leg
          tentatively through the air...

<b>                         DARREN'S VOICE
</b>          Come on... Just a little lower...
          WIDEN TO REVEAL a Middle School TOILET STALL. Standing on
          the lid of the closed toilet, holding the glass jar up over
          his head, is DARREN SHAN.
          Darren is 14 and a well-liked kid. Tenacious. Diligent.
           The spider just hangs there.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Come on... I'll take good care of
          you. All the bugs you can eat.

<b>          MIDDLE SCHOOL BOYS ROOM
</b>          The door bangs open and STEVE LEONARD enters. Unlike Darren,
          Steve's not so well-liked. In fact, he can be trouble.
          Maybe that's why they're friends.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Hey, Darren!
          No answer. Steve walks along the stall, scoots low so he can
          see any feet in front of the bowls.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Did you fall in? Darren!

<b>                         DARREN'S VOICE
</b>          Shhh...
          Steve looks to the last stall, sees the jar being held up.
          INTERCUT from in and outside of the stall.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You're gonna scare him away.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          2.
</b>
<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Man, we're getting killed out
          there. It's three to nothing.
          Darren is all concentration as the spider drops a little.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Your problem, Steve, not mine...
          Steve gets a waggish idea. Stepping to the sink, pressing
          his forefinger over the spigot, he turns the faucet.
          WATER SHOOTS out in a stream, which Steve directs into and
          then over the stall door. Reacting, the spider zips up its
          thread, is lost in the darkened ceiling.
          The stall door opens. Dripping water, Darren stares at Steve
          who flashes a wicked grin...

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY
</b>
          Kids eat lunch, off in their groups. On the field: Darren
          has a SOCCER BALL practically glued to his foot. He dribbles
          through defenders, shoots, SCORES! Steve pumps a fist:

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          GOAL! Three to one!
          The other team regroups, starts back upfield with the ball.
          Darren steals it. A few strides and WHUMP!
          Darren catches the goalie too far out. The ball lofts just
          over the backpedaling goalie's head, bounces into the goal.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>
<b>                         (EXULTANT)
</b>          Three to two!
          Angry at himself, the goalie KICKS the ball away. It veers
          off toward the street. Steve takes it as a personal insult.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          What does that prove? Huh?
          The goalie blanches as Steve moves at him. Kids are nervous
          about Steve. He likes to fight. Darren gets between them.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Go get the ball. It's 3 to 2.
          Lunch's almost over.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          3.
</b>
<b>                         STEVE
</b>          That's why he kicked it. To kill
          time. Well, I still got time to
          kick your face.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>
<b>                         (BLOCKING HIM)
</b>          Forget it. The ball.
          Steve decides, heads after it. The goalie gulps in relief.

<b>                         GOALIE
</b>          Thanks, Darren. He's crazy.
          Darren watches after Steve. He does have a vicious streak.

<b>                         THE STREET
</b>          Steve tracks down the ball which has rolled into the street.
          From seemingly out of nowhere...
          A gleaming black 1966 LINCOLN Continental. Its tires sucking
          at the asphalt as it rolls. The windows blacked out.
          It speeds up reaching the ball. Ba-Dump! The ball BURSTS.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          You idiot!
          The car SCREECHES to a stop, idles ominously. Suddenly Steve
          doesn't seem so tough. He looks nervously back to Darren.
          But as a WIND picks up, the Lincoln suddenly tears off.
          A sheet of PAPER is kicked up by one of the car tires. The
          wind sends it sailing. It drifts down, until... Steve
          notices, snatches it out of the air.
          Darren steps up beside him, watches the Lincoln disappear
          down the street. Creepy...

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Look at this.
          The paper is a FLYER. A startling, violent layout. Beneath
          a snarling WOLF'S HEAD: CIROUE DU FREAK - Human oddities and
          other living curiosities. Midnight. Zeiterion Theater. $20
          - Admission is at the discretion of the proprietor.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          .Human oddities and other living
          curiosities...

<b>                         (TO DARREN)
</b>          Other. Does that mean not human?

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>          4.
</b>          Darren shrugs, takes the flyer.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          A freak show. Ever been to one?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>
<b>                         (GRINS)
</b>          Just this school.
          Darren turns the flyer over. There are tire tracks on the
          back. They hear the sound of distant tire squeals, but the
          Lincoln is long out of view. Just an empty street now...

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          A BOA OCCIDENTALIS
</b>          Probing the confines of its glass prison. A BOA CONSTRICTOR
          by any other name. It's a prison within a prison because
          we're inside...

<b>          THE SCHOOL SCIENCE LAB - DAY
</b>          The teacher, MR. DALTON, moves ponderously around the room.
          His voice like a metronome.

<b>          MR. DALTON
</b>          As you can see reptiles and
          amphibians are not one in the same.
          As Mr. Dalton continues, we see various PAIRS OF STUDENTS,
          their computer screens showing text or pictures of various
          FROGS, ALLIGATORS and LIZARDS...
          DARREN and STEVE sit together staring at a Komodo Dragon.
          After Mr. Dalton passes by, Steve switches screen views.
          He's done a WebSearch of Cirque du Freak. There are a dozen
          or so entries. He picks one: History of the Side Show.
          Under 1920's there's an older, much more 'Victorian' pamphlet
          for the Cirque du Freak. A more ornate version of the same
          Wolf Head. The same notice from the proprietor.
          Steve spreads the flyer out to compare. They whisper:

<b>                         STEVE
</b>
<b>          1923...
</b>
<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Must be a different one.
          Steve scrolls down through pictures:

<b>                         
</b>
<b>

<b>          5.
</b>          Sword swallower and glass eater: OHIO GRAY.
          Frog boy: AVERY CHILDS.
          Human skeleton: J.D. COMBS. .and then...
          Egyptian Soothsayer: LARTEN CREPSLEY. Crepsley's gaze is
          startling. Like he can see through the screen, even from
          1923. Steve looks like he's just seen a ghost.
          Suddenly, he hits print. As a PRINTER against the wall
          clicks to life, Steve looks back at Darren.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I gotta show you something...

          Picture perfect: two stories, dormers, trellises. 9-year-old
          ANNIE rides up on her bike, bookbag over her shoulder.
          Without stopping, she hops off, dumps it on the lawn by two
          other bikes. A few steps and she's through the door.

          Moody for the daytime. Only the light from the half-closed
          blinds streaking the floor where:
          Darren and Steve are huddled over several clippings and
          pictures that Steve has spread out. They all deal with
          VAMPIRES in some form or another. Steve pulls another stack
          from his backpack, spreads them out as well.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I don't get it.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Vampires. I've been studying them.
          Vampires? Darren looks at him a beat.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Right. You're failing half your
          classes at school, but you're
          studying vampires.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          They been around 1000's of years.
          Two tribes. They even fight wars.

</b>          What? When?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Okay, sometimes, when humans fight?
          They fight at the same time. And
          no one knows it. Like at the
          Battle of Stalingrad they fought at
          the same time the Russians and
          Germans were fighting.
          Darren just looks at him, wonders if he's serious.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Some people know about it. There
          have even been books written.
          He pulls a frayed old yellow hardcover from his bag.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          That's your proof? It smells.
          Steve's really trying to convince him now.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          It's everywhere if you look. On
          the internet, in blogs, newspapers,
          weird places. But you can find it.
          The room starts to tighten a notch around them.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I chatted online with one of them.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Come on.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Serious.
          We become aware of...

<b>          A SINISTER POV
</b>          Someone watching Darren and Steve through the half open
          doorway. It moves in, starts coming up from behind.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What was his name? Mr. Dracula?
          Mad now, Steve opens the book, flips pages, finds an old 19th
          Century painting. He slaps down the science lab internet
          print-out of Larten Crepsley. It's the same guy! Maybe...

          Huh? Maybe he'll be there tonight.
          Would that make you believe?
          As Darren looks them over, the POV looms up behind them.
          Suddenly Darren spins...
          And ROARS at what's behind them: his sister Annie. She
          SCREAMS in response. Steve jumps a mile. Darren LAUGHS.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          How'd you know?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Saw your shadow on the floor.
          Gotta try harder, knucklehead.
          Steve snaps his book shut, shoves it in his backpack.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I'm gonna get a soda.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Get me one, too.
          Steve gets up, stomps out of the room.

          Steve opens the refrigerator, looks to see what's in there.
          At the same time Darren's MOTHER arrives home. Coming in
          through the kitchen door, she sees the refrigerator door
          open, two sneakered feet behind it.

<b>                         MOM
</b>          I know you want to fight global
          warming, Darren, but that's not the
          way to do it.
          Steve leans back to show his face.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Sorry, Mrs. Shan.

          She sets her PURSE down on the counter.

<b>                         MOM
</b>          How's your mother?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          She's okay... She's been working a
          lot lately.
          A little frown of concern crosses Darren's mom. Something
          about Steve... His mom... He brings out a bottle of soda.

<b>                         MOM
</b>

</b>          I know.
          Darren's mom exits as Steve pulls down two glasses, starts to
          pour soda. As he waits for the foam to settle, he sees...
          The purse. Just there. A quick look around, it doesn't take
          him long to decide. Steve steps over, opens the purse.
          A quick rifling finds a wallet: $200 in $20's. He peels off
          three bills, shoves them in his pocket. BLLEEEP!
          A cell phone starts going off in the purse. Fumbling,
          frantic, Steve stuffs the rest of the money back in the
          wallet, the wallet back in the purse, closes the purse --
          Darren's Mom is back in. She's hurrying to get to her
          celiphone, so...

          .it takes her a second to realize something's up. Not
          listening to her call, she watches Steve grab the two glasses
          and hurry out, leaving the soda bottle on the counter and
          guilt in the air. As she looks over at her purse...

<b>                         DARREN'S ROOM
</b>          Darren's looking through Steve's vampire memorabilia. Steve
          reaches past, starts packing it up.

          Darren, under the covers, gets out of bed. Fully dressed.
          Going to his door, he listens. Then he crosses to the

          They cross toward the ornate, albeit crumbling facade of the

          Gaunt, but oozing an elegant toughness.

<b>                         STEVE

<b>          MR. TALL

<b>          MR. TALL

          The boys exchange a last look, then push through into...

<b>          THE ZEITERION THEATER
</b>          Mouldings removed, cherubs gouged from the walls of a once
          proud theater. Rows of seats are missing as well. Those
          that remain are filled. The crowd seems nervous, watching
          the empty stage expectantly. Yearning for something special.
          No sign of Mr. Tall. Darren and Steve stand at the top of
          the aisle. The only kids here. Somewhere off stage a
          TRUMPET sounds and with it a stage light goes out.
          Steve nudges Darren, points out two empty seats halfway down.
          As they move for them, a second trumpet sounds and a second
          stage light goes out.
          And so on. By the time Darren and Steve take their seats,
          the theater has gone black. A final flourish from the
          trumpets and all is silent.
          Then, a dull green light glows across the stage. Before it
          was empty; now there is a CAGE, set on wheels, in the center.
          There's the scraping of chain. A low guttural sound.
          A white spot shines down, leaves the front half of the cage
          in light, the back half in shadow. A FIGURE moves in there..
          The AUDIENCE lean forward, hoping to see when there's a ROAR!
          Several people SCREAM as the figure CRASHES to the front of
          the cage. A WOLFMAN for lack of a better term, its body
          covered in thick, matted hair. It roars again, shakes the
          bars. Its half-canine teeth yellow, its eyes red. A chain
          hangs attached to an iron collar around its neck.
          Half the audience believe it's real. The other half are
          amazed at how real this 'performer' seems. As they buzz, Mr.
          Tall steps out on stage. Wearing red leather gloves and hat.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Ladies and Gentlemen. Welcome to
          the Cirque du Freak. We are an
          ancient circus. We have toured for
          five hundred years...

<b>

<b>          14.
</b>          Darren and Steve exchange a look at this information.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          .Bringing the remarkable and
          grotesque to generations. Our
          freaks are not people in masks.
          They are not harmless misfits.
          What you see tonight is real. Each
          performer unique. None harmless.
          To prove this, the Wolfman lunges, reaches a claw through the
          bars to swipe just centimeters short of Mr. Tall who's non-
          reaction shows he knows exactly where he's standing.
          A ripple goes through the crowd as they become aware of
          TRUSKA. Startlingly beautiful. Dressed for the Moulin
          Rouge. Crossing the stage in a languid catwalk. Several MEN
          in the audience begin to cough and shift in their seats.
          Even the Wolfman takes notice.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Beauty and the beast.
          Truska approaches the cage, makes soothing motions, her upper
          body swaying. The Wolfman lulls to a trance.
          Two stage hands - MIDGETS apparently, hidden by blue robes,
          step out and start to push the cage off stage.
          Truska steps toward the audience, moving in the same
          languorous rhythm. And then: she begins to grow a BEARD.
          Hairs creeping from above her lip, curling from her chin.
          Some in the audience recoil.
          Darren and Steve trade grins. This is great. Then...
          From either wing of the stage come twin contortionists: SIVE
          &amp; SERSA. They walk on their hands, their legs pulled back
          with their ankles cinched behind there necks.
          As Truska exits, Sive and Sersa meet in the middle. Like
          Hindu wrestlers they take turns, climbing up and down each
          other, look like one person with two fronts. They twist like
          pretzels, getting huge LAUGHS when they pretend to be stuck.
          As it goes on, RHAMUS TWOBELLIES pads out to watch. The
          floorboards creak under his feet. He must weigh 600 pounds.
          After a moment, he turns, walks toward the audience. The
          light leaves the contortionists and focuses on Rhamus.

</b>
<b>                         RHAMUS
</b>          My name is Rhamus Twobellies. And
          I do have two.
          He TRIPS, stumbles toward the edge of the stage. PEOPLE in
          the front row jump back to keep from being crushed. Rhamus
          stops short, LAUGHS at them. He was pretending. He's
          practically doubled-over, resting his hands on his haunches.
          More blue-robed MIDGETS roll out a CART covered with food and
          lots of other stuff. Rhamus grabs a GLASS BOTTLE of soda.
          Instead of opening it, he bites off the glass top, chews it
          and swallows. Soon he's eating food almost as fast as he can
          grab it. Disgusting, but great fun at the same time.
          Next, he holds up a couple of nuts and bolts. Then swallows
          them whole. He swings his belly around. You can hear the
          sound of metal shifting inside.
          The crowd recoils as he starts to regurgitate, spitting out
          BOLTS, NAILS, BOTTLE CAPS, a JACKKNIFE. They clatter on
          stage. Finally, a METAL LINK appears between his teeth.
          He pinches hold of it and pulls. A CHAIN starts out of his
          mouth, up from his belly. One foot...two...six feet in all.
          With a shrug he starts off stage, dragging it behind him.
          Darren &amp; Steve break into applause. So does the audience.
          As Rhamus' chain slides out of sight, a SNAKE slides in. An
          enormous BOA CONSTRICTOR. Impossibly huge. It slithers out
          to the center of the stage, its tongue flicking in and out.
          A SPOTLIGHT flicks down from above. The snake stops, raises
          itself several feet off the ground as it looks up, seemingly
          transfixed by the light. But in reality...
          The end of a thick ROPE drops down. And moving (headfirst!)
          down the rope is a BOY. Very thin, his blonde hair tinged
          with green. This is EVRA VON. He moves smoothly, twists
          over backwards to set his feet down on the stage.
          Evra wears a sort of cloak which he suddenly spins out of.
          The audience GASPS... Wearing only shorts, Evra's body
          SPARKLES. He's covered in gold, blue and green scales!
          He moves a vaguely webbed hand through the air, charming the
          snake which raises itself higher still. He slowly slides
          forward till he and the boa are nearly eye-to-eye.
          Then Evra leans forward and KISSES the snake on the nose.

<b>                         STAGE
</b>          Evra starts to make a HISSING sound. In response, the snake
          begins corkscrewing around him like the stripes on a barber
          shop pole. Finally, it slithers around his neck, pulls back
          to look him in the eye. And then...
          Evra bends at the knees, lays down and starts to roll. Like
          he was wrapped in a snake carpet, he disappears stage left.
          More applause from the audience.
          Then the stage goes dark except for a small focused spot at
          the center. Everyone waits, but nothing happens until...
          Appearing literally out of nowhere - one instant there's
          nothing under the spot and the next instant there is --

<b>          LARTEN CREPSLEY!
</b>          Motionless, looking past the crowd. The only difference from
          his pictures is he's a bit older and a SCAR runs down his
          left cheek. It stretches his mouth up on that side.

<b>                         DARREN &amp; STEVE
</b>          Recognize him. Can't believe their eyes. Steve pulls the
          print-out from his pocket, compares.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          It's him...

<b>                         STAGE
</b>          Crepsley disappears! The crowd mumble nervously. And just
          as suddenly he's back! On the edge of the stage, lit by the
          footlights. This time he holds a draped BIRDCAGE.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          It's not true. That all tarantulas
          are poisonous. Though some can
          kill a man. With one bite.
          Crepsley whisks off the covering. In the cage: a TARANTULA
          the size of a large man's hand. So big you can make out
          individual eyes. As deadly looking as it is beautiful.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Reacts. A spider!

</b>
<b>                         STAGE
</b>          Crepsley makes the introduction.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Her name? Madam Octa. Pray that
          she never learns yours.
          Two of the blue-robed 'little people' lead a GOAT onto the
          stage. A ripple of worry runs through the crowd. Crepsley
          starts over. The goat BLEATS. The little people hold it.
          Mr. Crepsley flicks open the cage door with his finger. The
          spider sets its front legs on the bars, pulls itself through.
          A few gasps from the audience. The goat bucks.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, poised to leap on her prey.
          Several audience members CRY OUT that this should stop.
          Crepsley looks out with mock-theatrical surprise.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          No...? Shall it be life?
          Chuckling to himself, he looks to the goat tenders. They
          release the goat which bee-lines its way off the stage.
          Crepsley faces the audience.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          I wonder if you would be as shocked
          to see the same fate for me?
          Madam Octa moves -- climbing the outside of the cage --
          taking a cautious step onto the hand holding the cage, then
          starting up Crepsley's arm. He stands dead still.

<b>                         DARREN &amp; STEVE
</b>          Have a million questions, but right now the performance has
          their full edge-of-their-seat attention.

<b>                         STAGE
</b>          Madam Octa has nearly reached Crepsley's left shoulder.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Though we have been together such a
          long time, she is no pet. I think
          she would quite enjoy killing me.
          Crepsley calmly raises his free hand. It holds a shiny TIN
          WHISTLE. Madam Octa has reaches his shoulder.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>

<b>          18.
</b>
<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          For her bite there is no cure.
          Madam Octa bares her fangs, even longer now. Her malevolence
          about to be directed at her master.
          Crepsley carefully puts the whistle to his mouth and starts
          to play, as simple as it is evocative.
          Madam Octa hesitates. Then, she moves around his throat,
          starts to climb his face using his scar as her guide. She
          gets to the top of his head, stands in his shock of hair.
          She sways; she's dancing!
          Then she leaps, lands on the end of the whistle. Crepsley
          keeps playing as Madam Octa attaches a web, drops down about
          18 inches off the end. She starts to swing.
          Crepsley takes the whistle from his mouth and twirls it
          around. Octa does a few 360s and the thread breaks. She
          sails up high over Crepsley's head.
          He cranes back to watch as down she comes, legs splayed. She
          lands flat on his face. The whistle is in his hand.
          Crepsley looks out at the audience. Looking out between her
          hairy legs, his eyes are wide with horror.
          Without warning, the spotlight on him goes out. As the stage
          is plunged into darkness, we hear Crepsley SCREAM.
          A horrible, horrible sound. The audience wait, but nothing
          happens. Some of them rise from their seats, peer into the
          gloom. It's too dark.
          The sound of something being DRAGGED. Then nothing. A light
          comes up stage left as Mr. Tall steps out.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
          That is the end of our show.

<b>                         AUDIENCE MAN
</b>          But... What happened to him?!

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Don't you know? What happens to us
          all, can happen to any of us.
          That said, there's a crack of thunder and an explosion
          seemingly at Mr. Tall's feet. He's nowhere to be seen.

<b>

<b>          19.
</b>          The houselights come up. The stage is empty. Some in the
          audience start to clap. Others are a bit dismayed.
          Darren and Steve sit there as people start for the exits.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Let's get outta here.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          No, you go. I'm staying.
          Steve starts down toward the stage. Darren follows.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Wait. What're you doing?
          Steve reaches the stage, looks around. The audience is
          mostly exited; no one from the Cirque is in sight.
          As Steve starts up onto the stage, Darren grabs his shoulder.
          Steve wheels, shoves Darren who stumbles back into a seat.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          This is my destiny. Don't ruin it.
          Steve looks dangerous as he looms. Darren raises his hands
          in surrender. Steve eases off, but he's still intense.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          That car today. It was a sign.
          Sending me here. I was told
          there'd be a sign.
          Too friggin' weird.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Told by who? The guy in the chat
          room? The internet guy?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I'll tell you later. If I can.
          Steve scrambles onto the stage and disappears into the back.
          Darren stands, whispers into the dark.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Steve...
          Decision time. Darren climbs up, starts after his friend.

          Darren moves back into the gloom. Deserted, the junk casts
          sinister shadows. Then, a sound at his feet. Darren stops
          short. Sees that he's almost walked into an open stage DOOR
          IN THE FLOOR. The sound is someone moving below.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Steve...?
          No answer. Darren decides, starts down steep, rickety steps.

<b>                         CUT TO:

<b>          STEVE - UNDERSTAGE STORAGE AREA
</b>          He moves past a dilapidated stage elevator. Stumbles. As he
          heads further into the dark.

</b>          Coming down the creaky stairs. Spooky.

</b>          Turning a corner, is startled by what turns out to be a
          costume mannequin. But beyond: a LONG BOX set on two
          sawhorses. Coffin-sized. Empty, its lid propped up by it.
          The dust is tracked with footsteps. A mini-FRIDGE hums in a
          corner. Steve steps over, sees an EXTENSION CORD which runs
          up the wall, disappears into a hole punched in the ceiling.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Stops short as a LIGHT suddenly cuts through the gloom to his
          left. Darren steps over low behind a CREDENZA. He sees...

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          He's opened the door to the fridge. The little bulb inside
          pushes through the gloom, lighting the area up.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Reacts as MADAM OCTA tries to jump on his face! The bars of
          her CAGE stop her. It rests on the credenza he crouches
          behind. The whistle is there too. Darren looks over as...

          Steve whirls -- drops the bottle -- SMASH!
          Standing behind him - dead still - CREPSLEY.

          jumps, twists around. Unnerved.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Who sent you and what do they want?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Nothing. No one.
          Crepsley takes a moment to decide if he believes him.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Then what do you want?

</b>          I want to join you.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Join me? I don't understand.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I want you to make me a vampire.
          Not what Crepsley (or Darren) expected. Steve stands there
          trying to look resolved. Crepsley is surprised, intrigued.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Is it because you want to live
          forever? Because we don't.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I don't care about living forever.
          But you do seem to live a long
          time.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          A long time alone. Do you want to
          live alone?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I already do.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Are you an orphan?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          My father's gone; my mother doesn't
          care about me.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Nor mine. You're friendless also?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I have a friend, but he doesn't
          understand. He's got too much to
          know what it's like to be alone.
          As Darren reacts to this...

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          When you're alone you feel weak.
          Useless. But I know there must be
          something strong about it, too. I
          want to feel the power of being
          alone. I want to be a vampire.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          The power of being alone will never
          be greater than the weakness of it.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I don't care.
          Crepsley's actually impressed, but after a moment he waves a
          dismissive hand.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          It makes no matter. We do not
          blood children. I'm sorry.
          Steve pulls a JACKKNIFE from his pocket, flips open the 2-
          inch blade. Crepsley laughs out loud.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Do you intend to use that on me?
          And we feel it more than see it, but Steve cuts into his own
          palm. He holds it up, moist and red in Crepsley's face.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Do it. Make me a vampire.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Do not tempt me.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Can't believe what he's watching. He sees Crepsley suddenly
          get 'scent' of something. Something to do with Steve's
          blood. Not quite a clear view as Crepsley grabs Steve's
          wrist, dabs a finger into his palm and then tastes it.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Crepsley shoves Steve down to the ground and immediately
          begins spitting onto the floor. Like it was poison.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          What's wrong?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          You have bad blood.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          What do you mean?

</b>          I can taste the menace in your
          blood. You can never be a vampire.
          You're evil.
          Steve scrambles to his feet.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          That's a lie. You take that back!
          Crepsley draws himself full, his voice deadly.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Go home.
          Suddenly cowed, Steve just stands there blinking.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>
<b>          GO!
</b>          Steve runs, disappears into the gloom. After a moment, we
          can hear him scurrying up the stairs. Then he's gone.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Frozen to his spot, watches as Crepsley, seemingly ill, holds
          his head and spits again onto the floor. Then he steps over
          and kicks the fridge door closed.
          And in the blink of an eye, he's gone. Disappeared.
          Darren is alone. He starts out, then stops. Looks back.
          That beautiful spider. And Darren takes Madam Octa's cage
          and the whistle and makes a run for it. Just like that.

          3 AM. Dead quiet. Darren hurries home, cage in hand.
          Looking over his shoulder. So far so good. He nearly trips
          over an untied shoelace. He sets down the cage, to tie it.
          Madam Octa lunges across her cage at a WORM on the sidewalk.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Oh. You want that?
          Darren picks up the worm, lowers it between the bars. A beat
          and then Madam Octa snatches it away from him. Dinner.

          The wind rustles. Darren grabs the cage, continues.

</b>
          The house dark. Holding the cage with one hand, Darren
          starts climbing the side of the house using the other. He
          avoids the broken section, but as he reaches the window:
          His Dad is standing there looking out. Busted.

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Get inside.
          From his angle, Darren's Dad can't see the cage in his son's
          hand. Darren hooks it over the end piece of part of the
          trellis and climbs in. Leaving the cage hanging behind.

</b>          A freak show? Are you kidding me?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          It was down at the old Zeiterion
          Theater. Look, dad, I'm sorry.
          It's just, I couldn't resist. I --

<b>                         DAD
</b>          You told me the other day you were
          broke. You were looking for a job
          to do around the house this
          weekend.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Yeah? So?

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Where'd you get money for the show?

<b>                         DARREN

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          He wouldn't do that.

</b>          Mom's pretty sure about it.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Man, what is this? You don't want
          me hanging around with him. Now

          Do you know for sure?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Steve's had some bad times lately.
          I'm trying to be a good friend.

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Being a good friend and sneaking
          out are two different things.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I have to sneak out! You treat me
          like a kid!
          A moment as Darren's raised voice rings out of the room.

<b>                         DAD
</b>          Then act like an adult if that's
          how you want to be treated. This
          world is crossed by fences --
          Darren interrupts. He's heard it a million times.

<b>                         DARKEN
</b>          I know, I know. And you gotta
          decide which side you stand on.
          And you can't sit on it either.
          His Dad doesn't enjoy hearing his words thrown back at him.
          He starts for the door, looks back before exiting.

<b>                         DAD
</b>          A freak show. What do they do, put

</b>          It wasn't like that.
          A beat. Darren's Dad goes, closing the door. Darren sighs.
          He goes to the window, pulls up the cage. He scans a look
          outside. Except for his Dad, the coast is clear.

          Steve switches it on. Something occurs to Darren too late...

</b>          Let me see that --
          On the screen: the PHOTO OF MADAM OCTA. Steve twists around
          to keep the camera out of Darren's reach.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          It's Madam Octa.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I took it at the show.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Liar. Look at the background.
          This got taken right on your desk.
          Darren's caught. As they just stare at each other.

          I, I just took her.

</b>          Just like that...
          (after a look)
          You stole from a vampire you know?

          Darren trails off. Steve realizes Darren saw the coffin.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          You were there, weren't you?

<b>                         (NO ANSWER)

          Steve studies Darren, hopes that's true.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I heard what you said to him, too.
          That you wanted to be a vampire.
          Steve doesn't want to talk about it. He looks at Madam Octa.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          How do you think he made her do
          what he wanted?
          Darren opens his desk drawer, pulls out the flute.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I wish I knew how to play it.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I think that was just for show. I
          think he used something else. Some
          kind of mind control.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You mean telepathy?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I bet anyone with a brain could do
          it. Which leaves you out.
          Steve smiles, gives Darren a little punch in the arm. The
          tension is loosening. They react to a KNOCK on the door.

<b>                         ANNIE'S VOICE
</b>          Can I come in?
          Darren goes to the door. Opens it a few inches.

</b>          I swear to God, Annie...

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          What? I knocked.
          As they talk, Steve opens the cage door. Madam Octa sets her
          arms on the edge, pulls herself out.

<b>                         LEAPS --
</b>          Lands on Steve's shoulder. Her fangs, wet with poison, glint
          just before she sinks them into Steve's throat. She BITES!

</b>          Steve surges upward, his shout dying in his throat. He
          stiffens, eyes snapped wide, and then crumples to the floor.
          Darren and Annie react as --
          Madam Octa scurries off, disappears behind the curtain.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>
<b>                         (TO ANNIE)
</b>          Don't move.
          Annie freezes. Darren grabs a BASEBALL BAT which leans in
          the corner. He reaches out, pokes at the curtain with it.
          Madam Octa drops down onto the window sill -- WHAM! Wood
          cracks as Darren brings down the bat, but Madam Octa is too
          quick. She disappears, leaping out the open window!
          Darren pulls it shut. He rushes back to Steve, turns him
          over. Steve's skin is already a deathly pale.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Steve...
          Annie reaches out, takes Steve's hand.

<b>                         ANNIE
</b>          Darren, he's freezing.

          Hospital doors BANG OPEN as a gurney bearing Steve is rushed
          through. Darren and his Dad follow with a DOCTOR.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          What kind of spider was it?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I think some kind of a tarantula.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          Where is it?

<b>                         DARREN

          The doctor takes it as a NURSE meets the gurney.

<b>                         DOCTOR
</b>          Anaphylactic shock. Get Doctor
          Lund. And we need to download a
          photo to poison control.
          This is as far as Darren goes. Steve is wheeled in,
          surrounded. Syringes are drawn, handed in. All we can see
          of Steve is one skinny arm hanging out.
          PUSH IN ON DARREN. Sick for Steve. Scared. Unaware that
          his world has only just started to crash down around him.

</b>          Tough, no nonsense. Marching along, carrying a print-out,
          coming to a stop where Darren sits on a plastic chair. He
          sticks the print-out into his face. The PHOTO of Madam Octa.

<b>          DR. LUND
</b>          How did you make this and why would
          you make this?
          Darren's Mom and Dad start over from down the corridor.

<b>          DR. LUND
</b>          Poison control couldn't ID it. In
          fact, the department of Entomology
          at Harvard couldn't find it in
          their data base. So either it's a
          new species or it's a fake photo.

          Dr. Lund just stares at Darren. Then:

</b>          What have you done to him?!
          STEVE'S MOM approaches, her eyes on Darren. Disheveled,
          cheap looking, she hasn't quite started her hangover yet.
          She lunges past Darren's dad, grabs Darren by the shoulder.

<b>                         STEVE'S MOM

          breaks down, sobbing. Darren's mom tries to soothe her as
          she moans about what a bad mother she is.

<b>          DR. LUND

          APPLAUSE. One pair of hands create a hollow echo.
          Crepsley sits alone in the middle of the theater. Clapping.
          And then he's gone! Only to reappear over Darren, offering a
          hand up. Darren scrambles to his feet. A beat.

</b>          Why should they?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Because... you're evil.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Am I? Are vampire bats evil when
          they drink the blood of cows?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          That's different. Bats are animals.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          So am I. So are you. Our

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          He wanted to... become like you.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          You don't just 'become' a vampire.
          The change is too extreme. And if
          the shock didn't kill you, your
          inexperience would. So you become
          one in stages. A half-vampire at
          first. With greater strength than
          a human, but still able to go out
          in sunlight. You learn from a full
          vampire. Do you understand?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Then your friend will die.
          The words hang in the air. Crepsley smiles.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          You hardly have a choice. It's
          your destiny.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Destiny? That doesn't make sense.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Try this then. You're reckless
          enough to steal, responsible enough
          to come back for a friend. That's
          enough for me.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Not for me.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Yes, well, destiny can't be
          explained. It must be lived. Now,
          you're wasting my time.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          There's gotta be another way.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          There isn't.

<b>                         DARREN

          take it.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Yes or no?
          Thoughts rush, then stop. Darren finally just nods.
          Crepsley raises his right hand. The nails are not especially
          long, but they look thick and sharp.
          Crepsley takes Darren's hand, jabs at his forefinger, draws
          blood. He dabs off a drop, smells it, then tastes it.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          You have good blood.
          Crepsley lifts his own left hand. He presses the nails of
          his right into the fleshy tips of his left hand fingers.
          Then he uses the left nails to mark the right fingers in the
          same way. Blood drips down all ten fingers.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Lift your hands.
          Darren does as he's told. Crepsley digs all ten nails into
          all ten of Darren's fingertips. Darren jerks back in pain.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Get used to pain. More lies ahead.
          He motions to his hands. Darren raises them, fingers spread.
          Crepsley presses his fingertips to Darren's. Blood brothers.
          As their eyes lock, Darren frowns at an alien sensation.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          The blood flows into your left arm
          and out of your right. Do you feel
          it? Getting near your heart?
          Darren nods, shivers.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Almost there.
          A force arcs through Darren's body. He screams, falls down.

<b>

<b>          39.
</b>          Crepsley turns away, starts to lick the blood from his
          fingertips. Tries to block out Darren's soft whimpering.
          Tries to block out any sympathy he feels.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          The world will start to slow down.
          You'll become a witness of time.
          (snaps out of it)
          Your friend's time is running out.
          He pulls Darren to his feet.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Take my arm. Don't let go.
          Darren takes hold. Crepsley starts to move. Only it seems
          more like he's still and the ground is moving under his feet.
          Darren looks about as the building begin to streak past, the
          road a blurred ribbon. The night has a weird chromatic look.
          The world moving faster, Crepsley and Darren slipping past.
          A moment later and they're in the...

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Lick your fingers. Vampire spit
          will stop wounds from bleeding.
          Darren looks at his fingers, then around the lot.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          How'd we get here?

<b>                         CREPSLEY

          Darren watches as Crespley looks into Steve's eye.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          We're in time. He still has a few
          minutes left.
          Crepsley takes a small AMBER VIAL from his pocket. He breaks
          a wax seal then pinches out a small blackened cork.
          He pulls the drip line out of the IV CATHETER and empties a
          drop of the vial's dark, viscous contents inside. It swirls
          murkily, coloring the liquid on its way into Steve's arm.
          A beat and then Steve seems to convulse, his arms and legs
          twitching. Is he dying?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What's happening?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          He was near death. The journey
          back is not pleasant. What do you
          know about him, this boy with bad
          blood?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          He's my friend.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Hmm... Who's his father?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Never met him. I don't think Steve
          ever did either. Why do you want
          to know?
          And then Steve comes around. He opens his eyes, focuses on
          Darren for a moment. He looks puzzled.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Darren?
          And then he drifts off, asleep. His breathing growing
          deeper, steadier. Darren realizing he's going to be okay.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Will you come with me now or do you
          have things to set in order first?
          That's when it really hits home. He's agreed to leave every-
          thing and go off with a vampire. Without really thinking,
          Darren starts backing toward the door, his eyes on Crepsley.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Run if you want. It won't help.
          You're a creature of the night now,
          Darren Shan.
          Darren turns and bolts leaving Crepsley alone. Chuckling,

</b>          Darren... Wake up, honey.
          Darren wakes with a start as she gives him a little shake.
          As he looks about, wonders what reality he's in.

<b>                         MOM
</b>          I just got off the phone. Great

</b>          The hospital says it's a miracle.
          Was it a dream? Darren looks down at his hands. On the tip
          of each finger and two thumbs are small round WHITE SCARS.
          Darren instinctively hugs his mom. She thinks he's
          overjoyed, can't see his look of terror. She hugs him back.

<b>                         MOM

          sky. Relaxes a little. Right... Vampires... Sun.
          He takes a step down the stairs when... From out of the

          A couple of KIDS RUSH past him going into a classroom. Then
          a COUPLE more coming the other way.

<b>                         KID
</b>          Hey, Shan, you gotta see this.
          They duck into the classroom. Darren follows.

          Steve holds out a fist. A MOUSE pokes its head out through
          an opening in the hand. Its whiskers twitch. As Darren
          looks from the mouse to the snake...
          Steve addresses the kids does his best 'Mr. Tall'. He tries
          to be entertaining, but he comes off creepy.

<b>                         STEVE

          Darren reacts to the name. Steve lowers his hand into the
          terrarium. Some kids already look away, others are intent.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>
<b>                         STOP --
</b>          Steve hesitates. Darren pushes to the front.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          It's cruel.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          It's nature. Anyhow don't watch.

<b>                         (TO KIDS)
</b>          And don't blink; you might miss it.
          Steve sets the mouse in the terrarium.
          The MOUSE takes a few tentative steps. Moves toward a corner
          away from the... SNAKE who's suddenly alert. It raises its
          head, flicks its tongue. Coils back on itself.
          ZAP! The snake STRIKES...
          And Darren darts down his hand! CATCHES the snake just below
          its head, out of mid-air, out of mid-strike. Impossible!
          The snake twists in Darren's hand. The students are blown
          away. Steve's eyes narrow, his wheels are turning.
          The BELL RINGS. Moment over. Kids hurry out to class.

<b>                         DARREN

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I'll tell you now.
          Darren reacts instinctively, grabs Steve with his free hand
          and SLAMS him against the wall. Steve's nearly off the
          ground, only his left toe touching.

<b>                         DARREN

          Darren looks back as a black 1966 LINCOLN prowls through the

          narrow. A dark, ravenous look.

          Darren looks at his reflection in the MIRROR. Looking for
          reassurance. He curls his lip, checks his teeth. They look
          normal. He reaches out. Trying to reach himself.
          His hand comes to a stop against the glass. His nails CLICK
          hard against the surface. He scrapes the nail of his
          forefinger along the glass. It leaves a deep scratch.
          Darren starts to freak a little. His breath getting ragged.
          He tries to get a hold of himself, looks back in the mirror.

          Darren walks down an aisle, climbs up onto the empty stage.
          Dark, but Darren moves calmly, like it was noon.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Hello? Hey!
          Crepsley appears. Darren turns, sees him. A beat. Crepsley
          raises his hands to the gloom around them.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          The darkness isn't so scary
          anymore, is it?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I'm starting to think it's me
          that's scary.
          Crepsley waits to hear more.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          It's only gonna get worse, isn't
          it? There's no way back, is there?
          No magic potion to make me human
          again?
          Crepsley shakes his head. Darren nods that he understands.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          We made a deal. I won't run away
          again.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          It's neither here nor there, but, I
          do feel sorry for you.
          Darren waves it off, doesn't want to hear it.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Are you ready then? The night is
          young. We can make many miles.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I can't just -- My family, I can't
          let them think I just left them.
          Or that something happened to me.
          My mother would... She couldn't...
          As Darren trails off, Crepsley really does look sympathetic.

<b>                         CREPSLEY

</b>          I'm going to bed.
          They say 'good night' to him. Impulsively, Darren kisses his
          dad on the cheek, then does the same to his mom.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I love you both. I don't say it

          Darren enters to find Crepsley sitting at his desk. He holds
          a small dark bottle between his fingers (different than the
          one he gave to Steve). As Crepsley's about to speak...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Shut up.
          Off Crepsley's reaction...

</b>          This is my home and I'm never gonna
          see it again, so don't rush me.
          Crepsley makes a motion to zip his lips. All the same, he
          stands, unscrews the bottle as Darren takes a last look
          around. He takes a PHOTO of his family off the dresser.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Hold onto this for me, okay?
          Crepsley takes the photo, offers Darren the bottle in return.
          Darren sniffs, recoils at the foul smell.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You're sure it will work?
          Crepsley opens the window.

</b>          Your heart will slow down so
          drastically they won't find a
          pulse. With the fall from the
          window, they'll think you're dead.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What if I break bones?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Even better. They'll mend in a few
          days. Vampires don't stay broken
          for long and it takes a very long
          fall to kill one.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          And the funeral home? Won't they
          embalm me or something?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Don't worry. I have ways of making
          my thoughts become the thoughts of
          others. They'll leave you alone.

          climbs out, his foot resting on the trellis. He looks to the
          ground, back to Crepsley as an odd thought hits him.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          My dad's allergic to grass. It's
          my job to cut the lawn.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          You have a new job now. Drink.
          Darren steels himself, gulps it down, hands the bottle back.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          So this is destiny, huh? Tastes
          like crap.
          Darren body seizes up. He lets go, but Crepsley grabs him.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Your breathing is slowing, your
          heart as well. Do you feel it?
          Darren can't answer. He blinks his eyes 'yes' instead.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          You may be aware of what's going on

          CLOSE ON Darren lying face down in the grass. CRICKETS
          chirp. Beyond, a NEIGHBOR walks his DOG. The dog suddenly
          turns in the direction of Darren, pulls on its leash.

          up to the open window, realizes he fell. An instant later,

          Crepsley closes the coffin, begins to fill the hole as Darren

          vision. Suddenly he becomes aware of something:
          Steve. On the other side of a mausoleum. Ten feet away.

          Steve rushes the last step, a jagged WOODEN STAKE held high
          over his head. He knocks Darren back on the ground.
          Pouncing on top, he brings down the stake.
          Darren catches hold of Steve's wrist. Stops the point of the
          stake just over his heart. Steve puts his weight into it. A
          desperate moment of struggle, but Darren's strength is
          resurgent. He throws Steve off.
          Steve rolls to his feet, comes at him again. Darren catches
          his wrist with one hand, his throat with the other. He slams
          him up against the mausoleum, holds him there.

<b>                         DARREN

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Are you crazy? I did it to save

<b>                         (UNHINGING)

          You planned this all along. And
          you'll pay! You'll pay --
          Darren jams the stake under Steve's throat. That stops him
          struggling. The points jabs him as he swallows.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I want you to leave...
          Steve is just beginning to realize how strong Darren is now.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I want you to leave and forget you
          ever saw me. Understand?
          Scared, he nods. Darren shoves him away, brakes the stake in
          two. Steve heads away, looks back over his shoulder.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          I'm going to hunt you, Darren. You
          and the other one. Crepsley. I'll
          put a stake in you and burn you to
          ashes. I'll make sure you never
          come back from the grave again.
          WHAM. Steve walks right into Crepsley. He picks Steve up by
          the shoulders, pulls him close. With a voice like Death...

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          If we ever meet again, I will show
          you loneliness you cannot imagine.
          Steve trembles in fear. Crepsley lets go. Steve takes off
          running. Crepsley looks to Darren.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Do you still question his blood?
          Darrenthoughtful, doesn't know what to think.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Would a stake through the heart
          kill a vampire?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Yes. But so would getting hit by a
          truck if it was going fast enough.
          Steve finally disappears from sight. Crepsley sighs.

</b>          This adventure we're on. Shall we

          Darren hesitates, looks to the twinkling lights of his city.

</b>          You'll get used to it after awhile.

          A beat, then Darren looks back at him.

</b>          Maybe I'll wait until noon and then
          open every door and curtain in the

          A long tense silence as Darren awaits Crepsley's reply.

<b>                         MOTEL BEDROOM
</b>          Crepsley is a shadow among the shadows. He climbs into bed.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Yes, sunlight would kill me. My
          electrons are different than a
          human's. But it would take several
          hours of exposure. I'd have plenty
          of time to kill you before I closed
          the curtains and went back to bed.

          A TV droning. Darren asleep. Bathed in a golden glow that
          flickers out as the sun sets. The bedroom door opens.
          Crepsley steps over, looks down at his snoozing assistant.
          Crepsley CLAPS his hands together, nearly against Darren's
          ear. Crepsley smiles as Darren jolts awake.

</b>
          Getting late, stores closing. The parking lot nearly empty.
          Darren and Crepsley are on a walk and talk.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          We can die violently. Accidentally
          or otherwise. But we also grow
          old. A full vampire will age one
          year for every ten human years he's
          alive. A half-vampire like you:
          one for every five.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I don't understand.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          I was born in 1774. I became --
          Crepsley looks back to where Darren has stopped short.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>
<b>          1774?
</b>
<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Should we do the math or not?
          Darren nods. Crepsley motions him to keep up.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          I became a vampire when I was 20
          years old. In 1794.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>
<b>          1794?
</b>
<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          In Paris. The days of the Terror.
          Heads in baskets. Guillotines up
          and down all day. Really when
          humans put their minds to it, we
          vampires can hardly compete.

</b>          Darren's stare jogs him back from the good old days.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Math. 1794. So I've been a
          vampire now for 211 years. Hmm?
          Darren nods again, still with him.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          I age 1 year for every 10, so, 211
          divided by 10, I've aged about 21
          years in that time. That 21 plus
          my first human 20 makes me look
          about 40.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          But altogether you're 211 plus 20.
          You're really 231 years old.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Exactly. You're going to be a
          teenager for a very long time.
          They walk on a few steps as Darren thinks this over.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Where do you keep your car anyhow?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          What car?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          The one you were driving around my
          town in. The old black one.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          I've never owned a car, Darren. I
          don't need one.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          It was near school one day. It
          followed me home a few days later.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          And you saw me behind the wheel?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I couldn't see who was driving.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          It wasn't me.
          As Darren considers this, Crepsley stops suddenly.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          There...
          Ahead: just more parking lot. A WOMAN exiting a BOOKSTORE.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Dinner.

</b>
<b>          EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
          The woman nears her car. A chirp as she unlocks it with her
          remote. She opens the back door, sets the book bag on the
          seat. Suddenly she turns, like someone called her name.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>          Yes?
          Only nobody's there. She shrugs it off, closes the back
          door. But hesitates at the driver's side door. Then she
          starts walking away, toward a back area of loading docks.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>                         DARREN &amp; CREPSLEY
</b>          Watch from a dumpster by the loading dock. She walks right
          toward them. One look at Crepsley's face and we know he must
          be willing her over. Darren looks terrified.
          But the air shimmers and Crepsley has disappeared.
          The woman steps up, stops across from Darren. As she frowns,
          tries to figure out who he is and how she got here...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Go. Run.
          But Crepsley appears beside her. He 'breathes' into his
          hand, 'guides' the air into her face. He catches her as she
          passes out. Darren is horrified.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Did you kill her?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          I put her to sleep. She'll be like
          this 15 minutes. When she wakes
          up, she won't remember a thing.

<b>          61.
</b>          Crepsley eases her to the ground, finds a vein on her wrist.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Will she become a vampire?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          No. She'd have to share y blood
          for that to happen.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Don't take too much.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          A vampire who feeds often can
          control himself. One who drinks
          only when he must can end up
          feeding wildly.
          He uses one of his fingernails to open the vein.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          The hunger inside us must be fed to
          be controlled. To be civilized.
          It's what separates us from... the
          others.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What others?
          But as blood oozes, he takes the woman's wrist td his mouth.
          Darren is repulsed, but can't look away. Crepsley takes a
          few deep swallows, then holds the wrist out to Darren.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Your turn.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          No. I won't.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Darren...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I'll never do it.
          Crepsley runs his tongue over the cut, rubs the saliva in.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          You can lead a vampire to blood,
          but you can't make him drink.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I'm only half-vampire.

</b>          No matter, you need blood to live
          now. You'll drink eventually.
          When you're hungry enough.
          The wrist is clean, the cut gone. A barely perceptible scar.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I'll die first.

</b>          Don't be stupid. You may abstain
          tonight, but you must feed soon.
          Crepsley stands to go, then stops short. Tense, he looks
          about, more hunted animal than man. As he shrugs it off.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What is it?
          As the woman starts to stir...

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Nothing. Let's go.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Something out there scares you.
          What is it?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          The thought of spending another
          minute with you.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          We still need to eat food, too. I
          just don't need it tonight.
          Darren just sits there. Silently as tears begin to run down
          his cheeks. Crepsley is exasperated.

          Darren quietly cries. Crepsley pulls two paper napkins from
          the dispenser, hands them to him.

          Then he sees it: parked across and down the street...
          A black 1966 Lincoln Continental.
          Darren looks back at Crepsley.

          All three are sinewy, whipcords with blotchy purple skin.
          Crepsley stands surrounded in the middle of the restaurant.
          Whirling, hand fighting. Blocking their thrusts and blows.
          Darren moves to stand. Mr. Tiny pushes him back to his seat.
          Crepsley takes one down with a violent leg whip. He drives
          the second one back into the third knocking both back.
          A look to Darren and then he's back on LEG WHIP who's getting
          to his feet. Crepsley drives his flat hand forward, his
          nails tearing into the vampaneze's throat.
          As leg whip's hand instinctively goes to his throat to stem
          the blood, Crepsley grabs his free hand, sends him airborne.

          Sinewy Two near frozen in fight with Crepsley who is in mid
          swing with the knife in his head.
          Mr. Tiny and Darren stop across from YOUNG MURLOUGH.
          Humanoid in shape, monstrous in visage. Bloated, his skin
          albino white with purplish mottling and red crisscrossing

          His eyes narrow at the sight of Crepsley, his mouth widening
          to show two rows of sharp filthy teeth.
          Darren needs to do something. He eyes the watch in Mr.
          Tiny's hand. He grabs it with his free hand, thumbs back in
          the winding knob. As Murlough disappears from view...
          The WINDOW EXPLODES as Sinewy Two hurtles out.
          Darren tosses the watch high in the air. Mr. Tiny releases
          him to move to catch it.
          Darren rushes back toward the restaurant.
          Mr. Tiny catches his watch.
          Crepsley meets Darren. Crepsley's broken arm hangs uselessly
          from his side.
          Murlough appears alongside. He grabs Crepsley by the throat,

          Mr. Tall looks to Darren, throws a surprised look to
          Crepsley. Crepsley nods. 'Yes'.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Darren Shan. You've come a long
          way since the last time I saw you.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I liked it better where I was.

          tonight? A few of us are absent or
          ill this evening.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          I'd be delighted.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Mr. Shan will have to pull his

</b>          Evra, my industrious wonder. Here
          is Darren. Put him to work with
          you. Show him the snakey ropes.
          As the two boys consider each other...

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Off with you. Go!
          As the boys head off, Mr. Tall looks over at Crepsley.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          You blooded a child, Larten? What
          were you thinking?

          about it?

<b>                         CREPSLEY

</b>          What do you do? Me? I'm a snake

          Evra goes into a slithery snake walk for a few steps to
          illustrate. It's strange. Funny. Evra looks back over.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I caught your act in the last town.
          Pretty cool.

</b>          Still gotta work the floor though.
          Ushers. We get the seats filled.
          They pass PEOPLE all hurriedly crossing the camp.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Who are they all?

          Darren's eye is caught by the WOLFMAN. He's being pushed
          toward the factory building by several of the blue-robed
          LITTLE PEOPLE. The wolfman's yellow eyes are on Darren as he
          rumbles a low, guttural growl.
          Darren is so taken that he almost walks into...
          Madam Truska. He stops short. In costume, beardless, even
          more beautiful than when we first saw her. She considers
          Darren, uses a finger to raise his chin. She shakes her
          head, smiles. As she continues...

          An odd setting, but it works well. Stripped, ragged, weird.
          Feels like a rave. The lighting dramatic, the concrete walls
          ominous. PATRONS take their seat around a stage. A buzz in
          the air.

<b>                         DEBBIE &amp; SAM
</b>          About the same age as Darren and Evra, they're here for the
          show. Debbie is self-assured. Sam is sarcastic to cover his
          insecurities. Right now it's hard to find a seat.
          And here are Darren and Evra. Evra looking cool in his green
          sharkskin, Darren still wearing his burial suit.

<b>                         EVRA

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          You guys are with the Cirque?
          Darren nods. Sam's a little sarcastic and skeptical.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Cirque is French, right? Are you
          guys French?

</b>          Oui. Vous etes observateur. Nous

          That slows Sam a beat. Evra points out a small platform
          eight feet up the column. You have to climb a natural re-bar
          ladder to get there. Sam looks dubious, but Debbie smiles.

<b>                         DEBBIE

</b>          Is the show great? Say yes. We
          had to sneak out to see it.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I snuck out to see it once, too.
          And I'm still here.
          An odd, almost spooky moment. Is he serious?

          Darren. Like Bonnie and Clyde.
          And their friend Evra Von what?
          That breaks the moment. Debbie starts climbing the re-bar.
          Sam looks Darren over a beat, picks a thread off his lapel.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Dude, it looks like the kind of

          Evra smiles, sticks out his tongue. Pointy, narrow, Evra
          sends it up his own nostril. Sam tries to smile, then starts
          up after Debbie. Freaked out. As Darren and Evra laugh...

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          I was raised in a circus, but not a
          nice one like this. The owner used
          to beat me and keep me in a glass
          cage. I felt like a useless freak.
          One night I looked out of my cage
          and saw Mr. Tall just standing
          there. He watched me until the
          owner came over and asked if he
          could help him. Mr. Tall grabbed
          him by the throat and strangled him
          to death. Then he opened the cage
          and said, "Let's go, Evra." He
          named me that. I added the Von.
          I've been with him ever since.
          Darren looks back at Mr. Tall with a new set of eyes.

          It's Darren's cue. Looking appropriate in his burial suit,
          he walks out carrying Madam Octa's cage at arm's length.

<b>                         DEBBIE &amp; SAM

          steps to the opening. Crespley raises the flute, plays.
          Madam Octa walks out and up to Darren's shoulder where she
          attaches a web thread. The audience react as she leaps to
          Crepsley's shoulder and attaches the other end. She dances
          across to the music, spinning a web as she goes.

          Set against the black sky. Sparks rise up, their source

          Mr. Tall sits with his long legs up on a box, really enjoying
          watching everyone else enjoy themselves.
          Evra munches on a sausage he grills on the end of a stick.
          Darren is all ears and eyes. He likes these people. And
          he's certainly never experienced anything like this.
          Someone starts to play a guitar, someone else beats a drum.
          Madam Truska starts to dance, the fire flickering against her
          as are all eyes. Then she reaches out, takes Crepsley by the
          hand. A few moments later, the two of them are engaged in a
          mad TANGO. It takes the camp's collective breath away.
          Even Darren can't help but enjoy it. Crepsley's arm gives

          He starts to pull it out, then stops, nearly doubled over.

</b>          And old vampires?
          Without a sound, someone has reached around the two of them
          from behind, a RAZOR-KNIFE held to each of their throats.
          They stand dead still. We can make out the shape of a head
          as whoever it is leans in ever so slightly from the dark.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Gavner Purl, as always I heard you
          coming from a mile away.
          CLICK! In his hand by his side, Mr. Crepsley holds a thin
          SWITCHBLADE. He presses the steel back ever so slightly.

          The 'voice' pulls back his knives, steps out. It's GAVNER
          PURL. He was once handsome, but those days are long gone.
          His face is crossed with scars. They vary in size, thickness
          and color. Gavner is a warrior, carries himself so.

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          It's been too long, Larten.

</b>          Never mind. Darren, Gavner Purl.
          Gavner extends his hand to shake. Darren sees'the scars on
          Gavner Purl's fingertips. Darren raises his own hand so
          Gavner can see his scars. Gavner looks at Crepsley.

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          A half-vampire?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Of course. We don't make full
          vampires of our assistants.
          Gavner Purl looks at Crepsley, stunned.

          Darren and Gavner Purl walk. Gavner looks him over.

<b>                         GAVNER PURL

</b>          Why?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You'll get insulted.
          As Gavner waits for Darren to tell him...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I'm afraid if I drink blood, I'll
          become evil.
          Gavner LAUGHS out loud, catches himself.

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          The only thing drinking blood will
          do to you is keep you alive.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          That's how it would start. I would
          swear it was just to stay alive.
          But what'll I turn into? You're on
          one side of the fence or the other.
          My father used to say that and now
          I know what he meant.
          The 'father part' chokes Darren up a bit.

          become. There's no going back.
          They walk in silence a moment. Then:

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Why did Crepsley make himself an
          exile anyhow?

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          He was tired of all the killing.
          We were at war.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          With the vampaneze?

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          Crepsley was once a Vampire
          General. One of our great leaders.
          He may seem reluctant, but I assure
          you, no one is as skilled at
          killing vampaneze than Crepsley is.
          I think that's why they'd like to
          get him out of the way. Kill him
          off before the new war starts.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You've known him a long time?

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          I was his assistant. He blooded
          me, as he blooded you.
          There's almost something comforting in this news. Gavner
          Purl so proud and strong looking. Darren wants to know...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Why'd he choose you?

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          To teach me to kill vampaneze. Up
          until now, it's the only reason he
          ever chooses anyone.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Is it why he chose me?
          Gavner hesitates, not sure.

</b>          That's for Crepsley to say. Not
          me.
          Another brick wall, but Darren accepts it.

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          Do you know what the biggest danger
          is to a vampire, Darren?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          The vampaneze? Mr. Tiny?

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          No. It's that they live so long
          they no longer care. Everything
          they love is left behind until they
          finally have nothing left to live
          for. Except death. The fact that
          he's taken an apprentice seems, to
          me, a good sign. A sign that he's
          thinking of living not dying.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Lucky for me. Glad I could help.
          All the same Darren considers what he's heard. Gavner,
          meanwhile, considers the open countryside ahead.

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          A clear run. Good.
          Gavner gives Darren one last appraising look.

<b>                         GAVNER PURL
</b>          Stay by him, Darren. Stay by him.
          Gavner takes a deep breath. The air around him shimmers, his
          image bouncing in and out of phase like an electron heating
          up. And then he's gone.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          That part is definitely cool.

          High in the noon sky. PAN DOWN to where Darren stands under

          Darren and Evra come off a rickety staircase, pass through a

          huge gaps on the floor where the boards have fallen through.
          They see Sam, his back to them, staring out a smashed window.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          (messing with him)
          Off the hook, huh? I'll tell all
          the freaks you said so.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Are you guys on your own? Just
          traveling. No parents or nothing?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          No. No parents.
          He says it with a little twinge that Debbie picks up on.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          School?

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          No school either.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          You're the luckiest guys on earth.
          Wanna switch places?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You have to be different to be
          here.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Different how?
          Evra steps into a slash of sunlight and his skin flashes to
          life, the green of his scales catching the rays. Debbie's
          mouth drops. They couldn't see it in the dark last night.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          Everyone has a place they belong.
          The Cirque du Freak is ours.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          I think your skin is beautiful.
          That wins Evra over.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Can I touch it?
          Evra holds out his arm. Debbie traces a finger across it.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Wow. Has it always been this way?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          He's a snake-boy.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          You shouldn't call him names
          because he looks different.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          It's okay. I am a snake boy.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          You could say you're
          dermatologically challenged.
          They all LAUGH. Debbie considers Evra a beat, then Darren.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          What about you, Darren? How are
          you different?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I get scared easy.
          Darren looks up toward the rafters. From where she dropped.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          How'd you get up there anyhow?

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          You mean, how did a girl get up
          there?

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. FACTORY ROOF - DAY
</b>
          A spot where the roofing is gone, several long RAFTERS
          stretch out. Darren, Evra and Sam watch Debbie walk out on
          one. Like a balance beam. The factory floor 70 feet below.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          Hey, be careful.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Don't worry. She's like a gymnast.
          Debbie moves slowly at first, her arms stretched out for
          balance. Then she does a hop, a skip. Darren and Evra gasp.
          She gets to the other side, turns and bows.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You're crazy!

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          How about you?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I got nothing to prove.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          But it'd be easier for you than me.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Why's that?

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Because chickens have wings.
          She starts chicken CLUCKING. Mad, Darren steps onto a
          rafter, starts across. He stops in the middle, spins around.
          Aided immeasurably by his half-vampire skills.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>

</b>          Debbie is impressed.

<b>                         ANGLE OVERHEAD
</b>          The vertigo angle as Debbie walks back out on her rafter.
          Stops about 4-feet across from Darren.

<b>                         DARREN &amp; DEBBIE
</b>          Darren crosses his arms across his chest. No big deal.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Let's play mirrors.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What's that?

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          I do something and you have to copy
          me. Like this.
          Debbie crosses her arms the same way Darren has. He
          uncrosses them as he realizes.
          Debbie reaches down, touches her toes. Darren sighs, then
          does the same, gets a good look at the floor below.
          Debbie takes one foot off the rafter, takes hold of the top
          of it with one hand, raising the other arm out for balance.
          Looks like a ballerina.
          Evra doesn't like this daredevil stuff.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          Come on, guys...
          Darren hesitates. Not because he won't do it, but because
          maybe for the first time in his life, he's really fascinated
          by a girl. Debbie misreads, starts CLUCKING again.
          Darren smiles, repeats her move effortlessly.
          Without warning, Debbie leaps the gap, lands on the rafter
          alongside Darren. As she struggles a bit for balance, Darren
          reaches out and steadies her. As they come face to face.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          There definitely something
          different about you. I just can't
          figure it out.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Is Sam your boyfriend?

<b>

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          He's my cousin.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Oh...
          A funny, awkward beat out on the rafter. Finally...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          We should get off this.
          She nods, a bit smitten. Darren turns. As they start off...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Chalk it up to lack of blood, but everything starts spinning.

<b>                         DARREN'S POV
</b>          The area is like a big drain and he's whirling down it.

<b>                         RAFTER
</b>          Darren legs go out and he falls off. As Debbie screams...
          Darren CATCHES HOLD of the rafter just as he drops past it.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Hold on.
          Debbie grabs his arm. Evra starts out to help, but the
          rafter CREAKS OMINOUSLY. He stops. Sam states the obvious.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I don't think it'll hold you, dude.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          Thanks for the heads up... Bro.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          (shakes it off)
          It's okay. I'm okay.
          Darren swings up a leg, hooks it over the rafter. A beat and
          he's back on top. Debbie relieved. Evra backs up the way he
          came and in a few seconds they're all safely off the rafter.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          I don't know how you hung on. I
          couldn't have.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You wouldn't have fallen in the
          first place... I just got dizzy.

</b>
<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Maybe you need to eat something.
          Darren looks at her. She has no idea.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          Well, the food's down on ground
          level. Let's get out of here.
          Sam and Debbie start off, Darren and Evra following. As Sam
          and Debbie start down a ladder, Darren hangs back a beat.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          She's kind'of cool, huh? I mean,
          for a girl.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          I like her. She asks a lot of
          questions though.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          She's just curious.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          There's no such thing as 'just'
          with a girl.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What makes you such an expert?

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          My snake's a girl.

</b>
          Darren walks along, flashlight in hand. Going somewhere. He
          suddenly stops, listens, not sure if he heard something. A
          following FOOTSTEP?
          MOVE WITH Darren as he continues. As he passes through a
          doorway, he ducks around the corner. Waits a few beats.
          Then he leaps out to see who's following. No one's there.
          Shaking his head, he continues on.

          Darren knocks on a door, waits a beat before it opens and
          Crepsley emerges from his sleeping place.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Good morning, Darren.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What's good about it?
          Crepsley looks him over, doesn't like what he sees.

</b>
<b>          EXT. CIRQUE CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
          Bustling with activity. Nearly show time. Crepsley stands
          by an open tent flap watching Darren cross camp. Not well.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          He stops as Sam and Debbie catch up with him.

<b>                         SAM DEBBIE
</b>          Hey, Darren. Hi...
          Darren's happy to see them.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You guys are coming to the show

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Of course. Evra's doing his snake
          act tonight.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Oh, you came to see Evra.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          And you...
          Darren smiles shyly at that.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I was hoping for Amanda Bynes.
          Darren sees Crepsley watching him from the tent.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Hey, I'll catch up with you later.
          I got some stuff I gotta finish up.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          He's gonna be gone in another day
          or two. Tonight's the last show.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          I know that. So?

<b>                         SAM
</b>          So stop looking at him like you
          love him.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          You're such an idiot, Sam.

<b>                         TENT OPENING
</b>          Darren joins Crepsley, a little unsteady.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Look at you. You can barely stand.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I'm fine.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          You need to feed. You need blood..

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          No! I won't let you hunt some poor
          person down for me. I --
          Crepsley grabs hold of Darren, hauls him into...

<b>                         THE TENT
</b>          Dark, the inside walls richly embroidered. Medieval.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          No need to hunt. There's someone
          here willing to save you.
          From the shadows: Madam Truska. Startlingly beautiful. She
          steps up. Eyes on Darren, she offers Crepsley her wrist.

<b>                         MADAM TRUSKA
</b>          By my own free will, Darren Shan.
          As Crepsley's fingernail hovers, ready to open a vein.
          Darren shakes his head. 'No'.

<b>

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          No. I can't. I'm human.
          Crepsley releases Truska's arm.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          You're not! And you'll be nothing!
          Darren stands there as noble and sad as a boy could be.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I am human. In my heart I am.
          A great big TEAR rolls down Truska's cheek. That's the last
          thing Crepsley needed to see. He's defeated.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. FACTORY SPACE - NIGHT
</b>
          People in their seats or taking them. Darren is back in his
          role as usher. He seats two people, wipes at the sweat
          beading on his forehead. He's getting sicker.
          He sees Debbie. She and Sam are already seated across the
          way. She smiles, waves. Darren forces a smile,, waves back.
          Looking for more patrons, Darren nearly walks into... A
          FIGURE. A hat pulled down obscures his face.

<b>                         VOICE
</b>          An usher in the house of usher.
          And I can't seem to find a seat.
          Darren frowns at the odd voice, but leads down the aisle.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          This way.
          Darren brings him down to a handful of seats. The figure
          looks up from under the brim of his hat. It's Mr. Tiny.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          Join me.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I don't think so.
          As Darren moves to go, Mr. Tiny clamps a hand around his
          wrist. Like iron. He sits, pulling Darren down beside him.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          It's time we had a few moments.
          Folks involved in epic struggles
          should get to know each other.
          Darren doesn't answer.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          Has Crepsley told you about me?
          Explained me?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          He said you can't be explained.
          You need to be experienced.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          He gives me too much credit.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Hey, Darren.
          Darren looks up to see Debbie and Sam. Oh no...

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          We're gonna sit on this side.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Cuz we miss you so much.
          She digs Sam with her elbow. They sit just a row in front.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>
<b>                         (WHISPERS)
</b>          Choosing sides can only lead to
          trouble. Never, ever choose sides
          unless it's your own.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You've chosen the vampaneze.
          Mr. Tiny laughs, slaps his knee even.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          Is that really what you think? A
          smart boy like you?
          And the lights drop. A trumpet blasts and all is silent.

<b>          ON THE STAGE
</b>          The little people wheel out a CAGE. There's a gurgled GROWL.
          The little people retreat. Several audience members lean in,
          then SCREAM as the wolfman CRASHES to the front of the cage.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Ladies and Gentlemen...

<b>          DARREN &amp; MR. TINY

<b>          MR. TINY

          As Mr. Tall drones on...

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          Oh, his speeches are impossible.
          Mr. Tiny opens his free hand. His pocket watch melts up into
          view from his palm. Time begins to speed up around them.
          Mr. Tall's voice speeds to a BUZZ as he 'keystone cops' off
          the stage and Rhamus 'keystones' on. The audience's small
          movements become rattles and shakes.
          Only Darren and Mr. Tiny are at normal speed.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          I'm not so complicated, Darren.
          During war there are those who
          profit. A war between vampires and
          vampaneze would have terrible
          consequences. Therefore...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Terrible profits.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          Excellent. I am a profiteer. I
          exact fees and gains. I'm simple.
          On stage, Madam Truska exits and Evra 'keystones' through his
          performance with his snake.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          Did Crepsley tell you of the
          prophesy?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          What prophesy?

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          They say the final battle between
          vampires and vampaneze will be
          decided by a child. That's why the
          vampires won't blood children. To
          avoid the end of the world.
          As these words are pondered by Darren...

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          I think I underestimated you. I
          think you could be wonderful.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I think you're a creep. I think
          you suck.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          Too bad.
          Mr. Tiny closes his hand around the watch. Time returns to
          normal. The applause for Evra slowing down to normal speed.
          As he walks off the stage, Debbie looks back at Darren.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          He was great!
          As she looks back to the stage someone sits on Darren's other
          side. Collar pulled up, head wrapped in a scarf. Murlough!

<b>                         MURLOUGH
</b>          (low; re: Debbie)
          Is it Dar-wren's girlfriend?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Forget about her --
          Murlough takes hold of Darren's other wrist. Still low:

<b>                         MURLOUGH
</b>          She has plenty of lovely blood
          inside. Inside, outside, hmmm?
          Darren struggles. Murlough pulls him close, HISSES in his
          ear, flashing those filthy teeth.

<b>                         MURLOUGH
</b>          I don't care about humans. I don't
          care about you. But the vampire -
          Larten Crepsley - him I care about.

<b>                         (ALMOST SHY)

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You guys are in trouble. There's
          more than one vampire now. Gavner
          Purl is here.
          Murlough reacts to the name. Does not like it.

<b>                         MURLOUGH
</b>          Have you seen Purl Gavner's face?
          Young Murlough sliced it for him.

<b>          MR. TINY
</b>          Darren, you're a liar. He's a
          thousand miles gone by now. And
          master Crepsley is right there.
          As he points at Crepsley...

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Holding Madam Octa's cage. Aware something's 'in the air'.

<b>                         MURLOUGH
</b>          Shimmers, phases into flit mode. Disappears.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Crepsley! Look out!
          The audience LAUGHS. Like Darren's worried about Madam Octa.
          Debbie looks back, knows something is wrong. Sees Mr. Tiny's
          hand around Darren's wrist.

<b>                         STAGE
</b>          As Murlough 'appears' alongside Crepsley.
          Madam Octa's cage drops to the stage as Murlough knocks
          Crepsley fifteen feet through the air. He lands flat on his
          back. The audience CHEER! Think it's part of the show.
          Murlough reaches into his jacket, produces a razor-sharp LONG
          KNIFE in either hand.
          Crepsley pops to his feet. As his own single BLADE
          'switches' to life in his hand...

<b>          DARREN &amp; MR. TINY
</b>          As Darren struggles, Mr. Tiny switches his grip to the back
          of the boy's neck. That holds him.

</b>          CHEERS as Murlough charges forward, the long knives
          pinwheeling in his hands. His attack is brutal and blunt.
          Crepsley is driven back, parrying each thrust and attack as
          it comes. Sparks fly as the blades connect.
          From out of nowhere, Crepsley adds a BACKHAND to the mix. It
          catches Murlough hard across the chops.

<b>                         OFF STAGE
</b>          Mr. Tall and Evra watch. Not knowing what to do.

<b>                         STAGE
</b>          Murlough swings back wildly. Crepsley catches the blade in
          Murlough's left hand with the one in his right.
          Crepsley catches Murlough's left wrist, the second blade
          dangerously close to retracing the scar on Crepsley's face.
          Crepsley throws himself back, sending Murlough head over
          heels across the stage and SLAMMING into a concrete wall.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Concentrating. Trying to flit.

<b>                         STAGE
</b>          Murlough rolls to his feet, charges. It's brute force versus
          style. But as Crepsley moves to sidestep, Murlough's not so
          brutish after all. He matches the move --
          Buries one of his knives into Crepsley's stomach. Crepsley
          reacts, frozen in shock.

<b>          DARREN &amp; MR. TINY
</b>          The audience around them unsure. Many shocked. It's part of
          the show, right? Darren sees Murlough raise the other knife
          to finish Crepsley off. Darren trembling, phasing.
          And Mr. Tiny's holding nothing but air. Darren is gone.

<b>          DARREN (FLIT WORLD)
</b>          Speeding down to the stage. The dagger descends in slo-
          motion, but it's only a centimeter or two from it's target.

</b>          Darren reappears, leaps onto Murlough's back, knocks him off
          target. As Murlough staggers right, Crepsley staggers left.
          Murlough regroups, charges after him. Badly hurt, stumbling,
          Crepsley falls off the edge of the stage. Disappears.
          ROARING, Murlough grabs Darren. They disappear as well.

<b>          MR. TINY

          PATRONS facing the exit beyond. As he'loses his flit power,

          As Murlough says this, Darren looks past as stepping up,
          grinning, is Murlough's assistant.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Steve?
          Steve! Steve holds up his hands so Darren can see the WHITE
          SCAR on the tip of each finger. He gets closer.

<b>                         STEVE

</b>          I can smell it. Why does it hide?

<b>                         (STEPPING UP)
</b>          The vampire is here.
          WHUMP! Murlough drops from above. Lands ten feet in front
          of Crepsley. As they begin to arc around each other.

<b>                         MURLOUGH
</b>          The vampire will die.

<b>                         STEVE'S VOICE
</b>
<b>                         (FROM ABOVE)
</b>          Let's get readyyyyy to rumble!
          Crepsley looks up, reacts.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Even the creatures of the night
          watch too much TV.
          Darren swings past through the middle of it all.
          Murlough charges.
          Crepsley sidesteps Darren, decides to take the fight higher.
          He leaps up, swings himself up onto one of the catwalks.
          Murlough follows. They use the room steel as monkey bars as
          they climb, clash. Violent, quick attacks. Crepsley gaining
          a position, abandoning it as Murlough SLAMS in.

</b>
<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Has lost sight of them, he can only hear the battle now. He
          reacts as Evra, Debbie and Sam rush out. Evra takes hold,
          lifts, tries to lessen the load on the chain.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          Sam, unhook his legs.
          As Sam struggles, Debbie pulls the rag from Darren's mouth.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Are you guys nuts? Get outta here!

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          It's against our code.
          Suddenly unhooked, Darren hits the ground. He looks up at
          Evra who grins down at him.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          Never leave a freak behind.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>                         CEILING SUPERSTRUCTURE
</b>          On the catwalks Murlough draws his knives. Crepsley jumps
          to the space he wants to defend, draws his own. Murlough
          counters. Two very serious predators'-at work. The animal
          kingdom at its killing best.
          A charge. Murlough a bull, Crepsley a matador. He redirects
          one of Murlough's arcing arms, smashing it against a metal
          housing. One of the vampaneze's knives clatters away.
          It's not graphic or bloody, but several times Crepsley's
          knife finds its way into Murlough's body. It enrages him,
          but Crepsley continues dealing out punishment.
          He's now like a brilliant counter-puncher, even as he
          inadvertently backs his way into a corner.
          But as quarters close in, Murlough's rage works to his
          advantage. He charges into Crepsley, his lowered shoulder
          sending Crepsley through the air and into...
          And through a BRICK WALL. Into the thin air outside! Still
          raging, Murlough nearly falls through himself. Instead, he
          slips, drops about twenty feet down inside the building!

          Crepsley falls sixty feet, lands flat on his back, as brick
          and concrete rain on top of him...

          As Evra pulls Darren along. Debbie and Sam riding shotgun.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          Come on!

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Evra. I think I'm dying.
          He looks horrible.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Let's carry him if we have to.
          Evra and Sam support him on either side. They continue,
          start across part of a darkened backstage area.
          A dark rectangular shape looms ahead. We hear a GUTTURAL
          GROWL, sees eyes glow in the gloom. They freeze.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          It's okay. It's the wolfman. He's
          in his cage.
          They move forward again, the cage becomes visible. But
          another SHAPE beside it. Steve. He sets his hand on the
          cage's heavy latch. He's going to open it.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          No don't!

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Ooops...
          Steve lifts the latch. Even he doesn't expect the force the
          wolfman hits the door with. Whaanngg! It's out.
          Evra steps bravely forward. The wolfman sends him flying.
          Sam can't hold Darren up by himself. He doesn't even see the
          Wolfman leap over. As Darren sinks to the floor...
          The wolfman tears into Sam...

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Reacts in horror.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          He's more surprised than shocked. Until the wolfman looks
          his way. Then he heads for the hills, disappears into the
          dark. The wolfman turns back toward Debbie.
          She backs away, takes off up a rickety stairway. The wolfman
          HOWLS, then follows.
          Darren's too weak to follow, near tears in frustration and
          regret. He watches after them, then he looks over at Sam.
          Sam who is dying. Just a few feet away. His eyes flicker to
          Darren's. He tries to say something, but can't.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Oh Sam. Oh no...
          Darren crawls over, takes Sam's bloody hand.

<b>                         SAM
</b>          Go save Debbie, Darren...
          Sam manages the smallest smile. As his eyes drift shut...

<b>                         SAM
</b>          I think she loves you...
          From above, we hear Debbie SCREAM. Darren considers Sam's
          blood, knows what he has to do. Leave his humanity behind
          and cross the line. He needs to drink Sam's blood.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Forgive me, Sam, but I need
          strength. I need blood.
          As Darren extends his nails over Sam's wrist...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          We're going to save her together.

</b>          Murlough arrives! Pure animal action as he tears into
          wolfie, sends him retreating, licking his wounds into the
          darkness. Murlough heaves for breath, pretty beat up
          himself. And here comes Steve. Cautiously.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Is Crepsley dead?

<b>                         MURLOUGH
</b>          Who knows? Young Murlough lives,
          but he's hurt.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          What can I do?

<b>                         MURLOUGH
</b>          What can Dar-wren's girlfriend do?
          We need to get the blood inside
          outside. Don't we?
          Then we hear it: a blood-curdling scream filters up. It's:

<b>          DARREN! - BACKSTAGE AREA
</b>          He's drunk Sam's blood. He rises. His sickness wicking off
          him. Strength descending. Empowered. Furious. He screams
          again, the sound taking shape into words.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>
<b>          FORGIVE ME!!!
</b>
<b>          FACTORY STAGE SPACE
</b>          The audience who haven't left react as the chilling sound
          reaches them.

<b>          BACKSTAGE AREA - FACTORY
</b>          Fully 1/2 vampire powered, he takes the stairs two at a time.

<b>                         UPPER FLOOR
</b>          Murlough, looming over Debbie, smiles as Darren arrives.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Let her go.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Stop being a big shot. This isn't
          like stopping some fight at school.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Shut up, Steve.

<b>

<b>          109.
</b>          Murlough's eyes go very, very dark. He attacks.
          Darren tries to meet the onslaught, but he's bowled over.
          Knocked in a heap.
          Debbie moves to go after Murlough from behind. She's going
          to go down fighting as well. But Steve intercepts her. He's
          pretty powerful himself.
          Murlough pulls Darren to his feet, stands him up. He swings
          his fist in a vicious arc.
          Darren just ducks it and Murlough's fist SMASHES right
          through the wall (an inside wall) alongside Darren's head.
          Murlough's getting tired of Darren.

<b>                         MURLOUGH
</b>          You need to stand still so you can
          die.
          But as he attempts to pull his arm back through, he can't.
          He frowns. Then his eyes widen in pain.
          Murlough jerks his arm back as hard as he can. The wall
          smashes open as Murlough brings his arm back through with
          Crepsley hanging onto the end of it.

<b>                         FACTORY SPACE
</b>          The audience who remain chanting: "Refund! Refund!" They
          react as debris falls from above, smashes to the stage.

<b>          UPPER FLOOR - FACTORY
</b>          Crepsley brings up his knife.
          Murlough catches him by the wrist with one hand.
          With the other he grips Crepsley by the throat, SLAMS him
          hard into an I-beam pillar. Again. Then he squeezes. We
          can hear the cartilage crunching in Crepsley's throat.
          But Crepsley covers his own right hand with his left. He
          drives the knife blade INTO MURLOUGH'S HEART!
          Murlough looks down at the handle of the knife, then back at
          Crepsley whose throat he still holds.
          Murlough gives him a lopsided grin and then pitches back,
          falling through one of the holes in the floor. Taking
          Crepsley with him.

<b>

</b>          SCREAMS from the audience as Murlough descends. Somewhere in
          mid-fall, Crepsley FLITS, disappears. When Murlough hits the
          center of the stage, he hits it alone. Dead.
          As people start for the exits, we see Mr. Tiny'is among them.

<b>                         UPPER FLOOR
</b>          But as Darren stands, it's not over. Steve grabs Debbie,
          pushes her to the edge where the rafters are.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Stay back! Or I'll throw her off!
          I mean it!
          It sounds like he does. Darren looks intently at Debbie.
          She looks back. Then, Darren makes CHICKEN CLUCK SOUNDS.
          Understanding, Debbie tears herself away. To the precipice.
          But instead of falling, she continues out on a rafter.
          Steve slides out after her. But as he reaches for her, she
          deftly skips across the rafters, jumps back to the floor.
          Before Steve can follow, Darren cuts him off. Below them:
          rows of jagged, rusty pipes. The remains of a pumping
          station. Shredded now, broken. Waiting to impale.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          It's over, Steve.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Is it?
          Steve lunges. They come together, trading shots, stumbling
          but still having to make the rafters. A missed footfall will
          be their last. They separate, try to gain position.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          You wanna hear something funny?
          After your funeral, I went to see
          your parents.
          They continue circling.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          And they were fine. They acted
          like they barely remembered you.

<b>                         DARREN

</b>          Darren lunges, but Steve's ready. He CUFFS Darren in the
          head. Darren falls, ends up hanging. Steve looms, smiling.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>
<b>                         (SMILES)
</b>          And your sister. She was moving
          into your room. They had a yard
          sale. I bought some of your stuff.
          Steve's foot on his hand. Darren about to die. Oddly:

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Did you steal money from my mom's
          purse?

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          What?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Did you?
          Darren hanging there, dead grim. Steve's curious.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Why do you ask? Is knowing that
          gonna help you rest in peace?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          No. It's just practically the last
          thing that ever happened between me
          and my dad was I was arguing with
          him.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>
<b>                         (FLIP)
</b>          Least you had a dad to argue with.
          A fury building in Darren.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I was telling him he was wrong
          about you. That's the last time we
          had together. Fighting about you.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Hate to tell ya. Your dad was
          right. How do you think we got the
          money for the dumb tickets? I took
          it. Just like I'm gonna take you.
          Steve jams his foot down into Darren's face, but Darren hangs
          on. In fact, with a superhuman surge, he hauls himself up,
          no matter how many times Steve hits him.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I miss him.

<b>          WHAM!

</b>
<b>                         DARREN
</b>          I miss him so much.
          WHAM! Steve's arm pinwheel for balance. He's going over.
          But just as he pitches off the end rafter...
          Darren catches him by his belt. Nearly bent backward, he
          hangs back over the abyss. If Darren lets go, Steve will
          fall into the spikes below.
          Crespley steps up beside Debbie, knows what Darren should do.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Kill him, Darren. Do it now so you
          won't have to do it later.
          Darren looks at Steve. A moment they'll remember forever.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>
<b>                         (SOFTLY; SADLY)
</b>          No. He used to be my friend.
          Darren flings Steve back the other way. To safety.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Start running. Don't ever stop.
          Steve hesitates. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Darren
          starts off the rafter toward him. One last look of hate.

<b>                         STEVE
</b>          Next time...
          And he's gone. Disappearing into the dark.
          Darren joins Debbie. Nothing left to hide.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Sam?
          Darren shakes his head. Sam didn't make it.

</b>          She understands. Darren looks at Crepsley. He's a mess.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Are you gonna be okay?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          I just need to catch my breath.
          For a few days. Maybe a week.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You think I made a mistake, don't
          you?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          No. I think that you proved
          yourself human after all.
          Human. As Darren absorbs this kindness, smiles.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Half human. What now?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          What do you mean?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          There's a war on, isn't there?
          Crepsley shrugs.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          This world is crossed by fences.
          You have to decide which side you
          stand on.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Yes, yes. Black and white fences
          crossing very gray fields.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          It's not gray. I've met the bad
          guys. They need to be stopped.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          I'm not sure it's my fight.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          But you said it. There's no in
          between. And the power of being
          alone is never going to be greater
          than the weakness. It's our fight.

</b>
<b>          EXT. FACTORY - NIGHT
</b>
          As PATRONS try to get as far as they can as quick as they
          can. We see Steve duck out, blending in.
          Mr. Tiny's Lincoln Continental pulls up. As Steve gets in...

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          EXT. FIELD - NEAR THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT
</b>
          Mr. Tall, Evra, Debbie, Darren and Crepsley. Crepsley sets
          Sam's body down in the grass. It's covered with one of Madam
          Truska's tent silks. As Crepsley's eyes meet Darren's...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>
<b>                         (A WHISPER)
</b>          He was a good kid. It's weird, but
          I remember things about him even
          though I wasn't there when they
          happened. Even though it's
          impossible.
          A moment as Crepsley nods sadly at this most singular boy.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          His blood is in you.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          I'll deal with the police when they
          come. What I'll say, I don't know.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Say what happened. Some crazy guy
          showed up. Sam was in the wrong
          place at the wrong time.
          They're all quiet a moment.

<b>                         EVRA
</b>          He was brave.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>
<b>                         (SADLY)
</b>          For the only time in his life.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          He didn't die in vain.
          A beat.

<b>

<b>

</b>
<b>          115.
</b>
<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Time to fly or flit or whatever you
          call it. The sun won't wait all
          night.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Actually, that's exactly what it
          does.
          Mr. Tall manages a smile, considers the sky a moment.

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Time will tell what this night has
          brought us.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Yes. Keep my coffin ready, would
          you?

<b>          MR. TALL
</b>          Always.
          As they exchange farewells, Debbie turns to Darren.

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          Do you think we'll meet again?

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          You never know.
          As she hugs him tight, she whispers in his ear:

<b>                         DEBBIE
</b>          I hope so...

<b>                         DARREN
</b>
<b>                         (WHISPERS BACK)
</b>          Hope is a good word. I hope so,
          too.
          And so goodbye. Darren and Crepsley start down the road.

<b>                         DARREN
</b>          Where are we going?

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          To meet the Vampire Generals. War
          clouds are forming. A storm is
          coming. And I have a feeling
          you're needed much more than I am.

<b>                         
</b>
<b>                         
</b>
<b>

<b>                         
</b>
<b>          116.
</b>
<b>                         DARREN
</b>          So what are we waiting for? Let's
          go.
          Crepsley offers his hand.

<b>                         CREPSLEY
</b>          Take my arm.
          Darren shakes his head, doesn't need it.
          He shimmers, flits into the night.
          Crepsley laughs to himself. As he follows...

<b>          FADE TO BLACK.
