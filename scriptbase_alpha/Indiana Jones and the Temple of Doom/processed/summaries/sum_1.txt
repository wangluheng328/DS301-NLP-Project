After being driven away from Honduras, as well as offending the King of Madagascar, Adventurer-Archaeologist Indiana Jones, in the company of Wilhelmina Scott and Short Round, barely manage to escape from Chinese gangsters on a plane.
Unfortunately, its engines fail, the trio bail out and land in a Gujarati-speaking village of Pankot in British India.
Once there they find out that the region is poverty-stricken, all children are untraceable due to missing stones that were once blessed by Bhagwan Shri Shankar.
A trip to the local Maharaja's palace does not reveal the whereabouts of the children, but Indiana locates a hidden underground passage.
The passage leads to the human sacrificial venue of Devi Maa Kali by a local thuggee priest, Mola Ram.
They locate 2 of the 3 missing precious stones, Indiana keeps one, and must be on the run from Mola - who is determined to catch and kill them at any and all cost.
