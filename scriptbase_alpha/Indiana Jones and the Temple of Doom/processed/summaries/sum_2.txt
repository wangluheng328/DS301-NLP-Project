However, the gangsters also tried to ambush Jones but he escapes.
Things go from bad to worse when his plane crashes over the Himalayas stranding him in the wastelands of India.
Jones, along with a lounge singer (Wilhelmina), and a kid called "Short Round", get to a village that is suffering a crisis - the children are missing along with their sacred stones.
Jones, Wilhelmina, and Short Round offer their help and stumble upon a temple, where a vicious voodoo doctor kills and tortures his victims by tearing their hearts out.
Jones has to defeat the doctor and save the children and recover the sacred stones.
