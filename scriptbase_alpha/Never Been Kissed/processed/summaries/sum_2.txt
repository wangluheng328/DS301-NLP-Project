She desperately wants to be a reporter and one day her wish comes true.

Though she accepts Josie has some painful memories, when she was in high school she was a geek with braces who was called Josie Grossie.

Josie sees her assignment as an opportunity to redo everything and correct the mistakes she made in high school.
She gets a make over, and with the help of her brother who was popular in high school, becomes friends with the pretty but pea brained, popular girls.
