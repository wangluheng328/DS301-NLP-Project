</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSE UP ON A GIRL'S FACE
</p><p></p><p id="act">It's Josie Geller, 25, cute, blonde and scared out of her wits. We hear the chanting of a crowd.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CROWD
</p><p id="dia">Josie! Josie! Josie!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE (V.O.)
</p><p id="dia">You know in some movies how they have a dream sequence only they don't tell you it's a dream?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Pull out to reveal Josie on pitcher's mound of a--
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXTERIOR. A BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">It's packed. Reporters line the field. All eyes are on Josie.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
<b> (V.O.)
</b></p><p id="dia">This is so not a dream.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The stadium clock sets at 5:00. The crowd goes crazy. Josie takes a deep, nervous breath and smiles, "Oh God."
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INTERIOR. ELECTRONICS STORE -- CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Multiple images of Josie play across rows of TV sets. A crowd has gathered.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
<b> (V.O.)
</b></p><p id="dia">It wasn't supposed to be like this. I was just trying to do my job. And then things happened. Well, life happened. And now I'm here.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXTERIOR. BASEBALL STADIUM -- CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">The clock starts to tick down. The crowd yells again.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
<b> (V.O.)
</b></p><p id="dia">Trust me. I am not the kind of girl who does things like this. I mean, two months ago you couldn't have picked me out of a crowd...
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INTERIOR. CHICAGO SUN TIMES BULLPEN -- DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Packed with office workers. Bustling with activity. The camera searches the crowd.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE (V.O.)
</p><p id="dia">Told you. I'm over there.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The camera swings to Josie entering. Rhoda, a young copy assistant, tails her, pen and paper in hand.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RHODA
</p><p id="dia">Theater--
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Standard American calls for "er". Standard British is "re". So go for "er", unless you're a pompous American, then go for British.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie keeps negotiating the maze, leaving Rhoda in her wake.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RHODA
</p><p id="dia">No. Theater. Last night. We were supposed to go, remember?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie stops at a desk where Merkin Burns, officious office assistant, is talking on the phone. He picks his nose with abandon as he talks, ignoring Josie.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MERKIN
</p><p id="spkdir">(into phone)
</p><p id="dia">No way. No way. No way. Ech, hold on.
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Josie)
</p><p id="dia">What.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Messages?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Merkin removes his finger from his nose and uses it to pick up a pink message. He holds it out to Josie. Disgusted, she takes it by one corner.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MERKIN
</p><p id="spkdir">(into phone)
</p><p id="dia">Seriously? No way. No way--
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie's still standing there.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MERKIN
</p><p id="dia">What
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Merkin, do you think we could get some more yellow highlighters? I checked the box and we're--
</p><p></p><p id="act">Merkin swivels his chair 180 degrees so his back is to Josie and continues with his phone call.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MERKIN
</p><p id="spkdir">(back into phone)
</p><p id="dia">Okay, I'm back, so--
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie sighs, walks to her door. It's marked with a lopsided nameplate: Josie Geller, Copy Editor. She adjusts the plate so it's perfectly straight.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INTERIOR. JOSIE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie enters, reads the messsage still gingerly held in two fingers, and drops it into the trash can. She hangs her coat squarely on the back of her door, takes five pencils from her pencil pot, one by one sharpens them in her pencil sharpener, and then lays them out neatly in a row. She smiles, satisfied, ready for another day.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Anita Brandt, late 20's, pretty in a semi-unprofessional way, bursts in, smiling.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Guess who I did it with last night...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE 
</p><p id="spkdir">(duh)
</p><p id="dia">Roger in Op/Ed.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Who told!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie just stares at her.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Once it didn't happen for sure.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gus Strauss, late 30's, would probably clean up well, enters. He tosses some copy onto Josie's desk.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="spkdir">(emphasizing)
</p><p id="dia">It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gus and Anita just stare at Josie.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Well, excuse me for caring about words.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS 
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Anita)
</p><p id="dia">So. You and Roger in Op/Ed.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Oh, man! Who told?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Anita flounces off.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">How many times have I fired her?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Five-- Six--
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="spkdir">(shrugging, giving up)
</p><p id="dia">Eh.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gus turns to exit.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="spkdir">(disappointed)
</p><p id="dia">Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">You've done five of my ideas.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">A flack jacket.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="spkdir">(not getting it)
</p><p id="dia">A--flack jacket.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Hey--I can be out of control.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gus smiles. On his way out he re-adjusts Josie's nameplate so it hangs at an angle. Tormented, Josie waits a beat. She can't take it, and runs to the door and straightens it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="spkdir">(over his shoulder)
</p><p id="dia">Copy by five.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INTERIOR. SUN TIMES LUNCHROOM -- DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Actually, a pretty depressing kitchenette area. Anita and Josie eat lunch--Anita eats Chinese out of a container, Josie has three baggies of perfectly cut food in front of her.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Be honest. Do you think I'm aggressive?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Anita ponders a moment.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Yeah.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">You stood for like a month.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Cynthia, an affable African-American woman in her 40's, enters and puts three microwave meals in the microwave.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Just because I'm not out of control doesn't mean I can't write.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CYNTHIA
</p><p id="dia">Josie, you listen to me. If you feel you're a writer--(touching her chest)
</p><p></p><p id="act">Here, deep inside, don't let anyone tell you you're not. Look at me. Every day I come to this paper and I pour my heart and soul into what I do. I feel it, passionately, to the core of my being.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">You write obituaries.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CYNTHIA
</p><p id="dia">Hey, if you can make a busted aorta sound good--honey, that's art.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The microwave dings off. Cynthia fishes the three Lean Cuisines out. Anita and Josie share a look.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Cynthia, aren't they only diatetic if you eat them one at a time?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CYNTHIA
</p><p id="dia">I eat 'em one at a time.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Josie)
</p><p id="dia">Y'know, maybe Gus has a point. It wouldn't kill you to relax and have some fun. Roger's got a friend, Marshall in editing? The one with the lazy eye? Maybe we could double date.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Forget it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">I'm concentrating on my career right now.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="spkdir">(embarrassed)
</p><p id="dia">Anita!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—
</p><p id="spkdir">(beat)
</p><p id="dia">If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie laughs in spite of herself.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Anita and Cynthia trade looks.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CYNTHIA
</p><p id="dia">"That thing"? Is that what you kids are calling it these days?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">That thing. That moment. You kiss someone and it's like the world around you gets all hazy and the only thing in focus is you and this other person and you know that one person is the person you're meant to be kissing for the rest of your life. And for that one moment you've been given this amazing gift and you want to laugh and cry at the same time because you're so lucky you found it, and so scared that it will all go away.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Anita and Cynthia take this in.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INTERIOR. TIKI POST -- DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Basically a Mailbox Etc. store, but dressed in a Tahitian theme. Cardboard hula dancers hold Fedex envelopes.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rob Geller, 23, good-looking, wears a smock with "Tiki Post" emblazoned across it over a Hawaiian shirt. He stands watch at the cash register.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Monty Maylik, 50, proud owner, rearranges a display. The place is empty.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MONTY
</p><p id="spkdir">(of course)
</p><p id="dia">I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MONTY
</p><p id="dia">Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie walks into the store, triggering Hawaiian music. Monty puts a lei over her head.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MONTY
</p><p id="dia">Aloha! Welcome!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Monty takes the lei off her neck. Josie hands Rob an envelope. Rob rifles through the cash inside.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">Thanks, Jos. I'll pay you back. Bambi thanks you, too.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rob indicates a beat-up wreck of a yellow car parked outside.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">That is so--weird that you name your car.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">No it's not. Guys name their penises.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Okaaaay....(then)
</p><p></p><p id="act">That car's going to bankrupt you.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">She just needs a new windshield wiper.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rob hands the money back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">Y'know what? Take it. I don't want it.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie hands it back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Better person than I.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">See!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ROB
</p><p id="dia">Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!

</p><p></p><p id="act">We pan around the neatest and quietest walk-up you've ever seen. Lots of books on shelves.
</p><p></p><p id="act">We find Josie sitting at her small table putting the finishing touches on a needlepoint pillow. She turns it over and we see it says: "LOVE". She holds up the final product to a terrarium, lookup up at her two turtles.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">There. What d'you think, guys? Where should it go?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie looks around the living room.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INTERIOR. JOSIE'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
</p><p></p><p id="act">A perfectly arranged Laura Ashley bedroom. We pan over to the bed. It is completely covered in needlepoint pillows. Josie places the latest one on top of the others and smiles.

</p><p id="dia">Perfect.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INTERIOR. A CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME
</p><p></p><p id="act">It's packed with the NEWSPAPER STAFF. Hyram Rigfort, 65, white-haired, dignified owner of the paper presides. Anita and Josie sit next to each other. Next to Anita sits Roger from Op/Ed, a good-looking guy in his 30's.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">Let me start out by saying that I was very impressed by the investigative piece Dutton did on pesticides in our supermarkets.
</p><p></p><p id="act">An older man, Dutton, smiles proudly.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">But since the Trib did a better piece on the same subject, you're fired.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Dutton's face falls. Everyone looks horrified.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">You heard me. Out. Out.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Dutton shuffles out. Josie takes a big bite of donut.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT

</p><p id="dia">Happy March Mr. Rigfort.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">To celebrate, I've decided it's time for another undercover feature!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Everyone looks underwhelmed.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">You all know that some of my best inspiration comes from personal experience. Who knew that my botched foray into hair plugs would lead to last month's award-winning expose -- "hair today, gone tomorrow"? Hat's off to you, Bruns.
</p><p></p><p id="act">We pan over to Bruns, a reporter whose hair is missing in odd-looking clumps. He nods sadly.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">Or should I say "hat's on"! And what about when my wife had that affair with Gil, her ski instructor and Howard went undercover as an expert slalom skier.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Howard smiled wanly. Both his arms are in casts. Camera pans the room as Rigfort continues, picking out different reporters.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">So last night I'm sitting around the dinner table with my family. The wife, the two nannies, the boys, and we're eating chicken with this peanut sauce.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Camera stops at a Chef Boyardee look-alike.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">Undercover chef. I like it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">Hang on, Gus. So, we're eating this peanut sauce and suddenly the younger kid starts choking.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Camera stops at a Nurse Ratchet look-alike.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="spkdir">(sotto to Josie)
</p><p id="dia">I'm smelling undercover ER nurse.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">Turns out he's allergic to peanuts. And I think -- holy shit. I don't even know my own kids. I mean, who knows if they're even mine? And it got me thinking. How much do we know about kids today? What are they thinking? How many of them are allergic to peanuts? Boom. It hit me -- "My Semester In High School."
</p><p></p><p id="act">Camera stops at a bald guy, the jerks over one seat to Josie.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Josie)
</p><p id="dia">You. What's your name.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Oh. But--I'm not a reporter yet...
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE

</p><p></p><p id="act">Anita looks concerned.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
</p><p></p><p id="act">A beat. Josie's face falls.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">You don't think I can do it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gus enters.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Jos, that's not what we're --
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Anita looks down, chastened.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">Senorita Josie.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">I'm not holding your job for you, Geller.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie jumps up and down and hugs Gus, who is clearly uncomfortable.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA
</p><p id="dia">I do believe in you, Jos. Anything you need, I'll help you out.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie sits, motions to the brown paper bag.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">You can start by handing me that bag.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Anita does. Josie sticks it over her face, flips her head between her knees and starts hyperventilating again.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Close up on Rob, wearing his Tiki Post outfit. He shakes his head.

</p><p id="dia">Ole! Ten minutes in this hat, you'll never be late again. So, let's hear something about you. Stand up. Stand up.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie does. The sombrero drops over her eyes. She adjusts it so she can read her notecards. CLOSE UP on the notecard --it's filled with precise script under a heading: MY PAST. She scans it, then flips the cards face-down on the desk. Confidently she begins --
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE

</p><p></p><p id="slug">ANGLE ON HOT DOGS, POPCORN CHANGING HANDS being sold by the truckload at the stadium. The crowds are over capacity. Way over. People fill the parking lot, they cover every other inch of school grounds, as well. They stand on the roofs of nearby buildings, they sit on top of their cars. It looks like most of Chicago is either already there, or on their way.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Some WOMEN hold signs for Josie, others hold and wave her article.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie sticks her head out of the dugout, and looks out at the fans. TV REPORTERS are everywhere, including several on the field. She looks like she may faint. She ducks back in.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INTERIOR. DUGOUT - SAME
</p><p></p><p id="act">The team is dressed, ready, excited. Anita and Aldys stand next to Josie. Josie looks up at the crowd, amazed.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Wow. It's packed.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANITA

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALDYS
</p><p id="dia">It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie then starts to hyperventilate. She puts her head between her ankles. Anita and Aldys both grab the brown paper bag and hand it to Josie. She hyperventilates into it. Coach Romano approaches. Josie puts the bag down.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COACH
</p><p id="dia">Sweet Jesus, Geller - I had no idea there'd be all these TV crews here. This thing's gonna be on every station in the country.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie immediately begins hyperventilating into the bag again.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COACH
</p><p id="dia">You more than kept your end of the bargain. Now go out there and get 'em.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie gets up and he slaps her on the ass. She hugs Aldys. Then Anita gives Josie a big hug, and won't let go. Josie has to pull Anita pulls back. Josie struggles to get out of the hug- Anita won't let her. Finally, they are both laughing.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie walks out of the dugout, and onto the field.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXTERIOR. PITCHER'S MOUND - SAME
</p><p></p><p id="act">She walks, alone, out to the pitcher's mound, clutching a microphone. The crowd goes berserk. She stands until they quiet.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">JOSIE
</p><p id="dia">Could I have five minutes on the clock, please?
</p><p></p><p id="act">The scoreboard clock reads 5:00. Josie stands, alone.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The staff from the Sun Times sits in box seats up front. Rigfort joins them, carrying a huge load of hot dogs.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">I got weiners. Hot weiners.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Rigfort sits next to Gus. Behind them sit Bruns, his hair finally growing in and Howard, now down to just a sling.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="dia">I love this. Sun Times readers, out here, making a personal connection to one of our reporters. This is amazing, isn't it? Weiner?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Gus takes a weiner.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUS
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, it is.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT
</p><p id="spkdir">(studying his weiner)
</p><p id="dia">Wait a minute...

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT

</p><p id="dia">There's a bolt in my weiner.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Then he turns back to Howard and smiles.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">RIGFORT

</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie steals a look to the dugout. No one is coming out the door.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CROWD
</p><p id="dia">ONE!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Josie makes one more desperate look around. No one is running toward her.
</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSE UP on Josie, completely crestfallen. She drops the microphone. It reverbs in the silent stadium.
</p><p></p><p id="act">WE PAN ACROSS the Crowd, all defeated. And then...
</p><p></p><p id="act">A commotion in the stands. Sam bursts through the crowd. He runs toward the mound. The Crowd is on their feet.
</p><p></p><p id="act">It feels like a lifetime before he reaches Josie, grabs her, pulls her close to him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">SAM
