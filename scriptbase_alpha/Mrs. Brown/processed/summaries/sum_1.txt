While on an extended stay at Balmoral Castle and still in mourning over the death of her beloved Prince Albert, Queen Victoria meets Mr. Brown, a member of her household staff who thinks the time has come for her to start living a normal life.
He soon gains the Queen's favor and friendship and his authority and status in the household are soon on the rise.
This creates concerns among the Queen's many advisers who see their own influence diminishing and the Queen's reputation being tarnished.
As a result, they move to ensure Mr. Brown's future influence in the household is kept in check.
