Viridiana, a young novice about to take her final vows as a nun, accedes to a request from her widowed uncle to visit him.
Moved purely by a sense of obligation, she does so.
Her uncle is moved by her resemblance to his late wife to attempt to seduce Viridiana, and tragedy ensues.
In the aftermath, Viridiana tries to assuage her guilt by creating a haven for the destitute folk who live around her uncle's estate.
But from these good intentions, too, comes little good.
