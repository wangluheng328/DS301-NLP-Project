In 2001, General Manager Billy Beane's Oakland A's lose to the Yankees in the playoffs then lose three stars to free agency.
How can Beane field a competitive team when the A's player salaries total less than a third of the rich teams'?
To the consternation of his scouts, Beane hires and listens to Peter Brand, a recent Yale grad who evaluates players using Bill James' statistical approach.
Beane assembles a team of no names who, on paper, can get on base and score runs.
Then, Beane's manager, Art Howe, won't use the players as Beane wants.
Can Beane circumvent Howe, win games, make it to the 2002 Series, and stand baseball's hidebound conventions on their heads?
