Leon is a first-class hit man, but is also a sensitive guy who loves his potted plants.
He is moral: "No women, no children" is his professional motto.
He is sympathetic to his neighbor, Mathilda, a typically rebellious twelve-year-old who has trouble with her family.
But when her father runs afoul of drug kingpin Norman Stansfield, Mathilda turns to Leon for assistance.
