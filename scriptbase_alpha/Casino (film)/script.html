</b>
                               By

                   Nicholas Pileggi



<b>EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS, 1983 - DAY
</b>
SAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man 
approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn 
on the ignition.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          When you love someone, you've gotta 
          trust them. There's no other way. 
          You've got to give them the key to 
          everything that's yours.  Otherwise, 
          what's the point? And, for a while... 
          I believed that's the kind of love I 
          had.

Suddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise 
into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and 
their signs.

Music in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'.

Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body 
twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble 
into the flames of damnation.

<b>MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE.
</b>
<b>INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT
</b>
Vignette of ACE through rippling flames, we move in on ACE 
ROTHSTEIN overseeing the casino. He lights a cigarette.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          Before I ever ran a casino or got 
          myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a 
          hell of a handicapper, I can tell 
          you that. I was so good, that whenever 
          I bet, I could change the odds for 
          every bookmaker in the country. I'm 
          serious. I had it down so cold that 
          I was given paradise on earth. I was 
          given one of the biggest casinos in 
          Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers...

<b>INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - 
</b><b>NIGHT
</b>
Vignette of MOB BOSSES sitting at a table surrounded by food 
and wine like the gods of Olympus.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          ...by the only kind of guys that can 
          actually get you that kind of money: 
          sixty-two million, seven-hundred 
          thousand dollars. I don't know all 
          the details.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          Matter of fact...

<b>INT. BAR, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT
</b>
Vignette of NICKY SANTORO standing at a bar with DOMINICK 
SANTORO, his brother, and FRANK MARINO, his right-hand man.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          ...nobody knew all the details, but 
          it should'a been perfect. I mean, he 
          had me, Nicky Santoro, his best 
          friend, watching his ass...

<b>INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
</b>
Vignette of GINGER MCKENNA a dazzling thirty-one-year-old 
blonde seated by a small fiery pool.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          ...and he had Ginger, the woman he 
          loved, on his arm.  But in the end...

<b>INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACE'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</b>
ACE looks over the casino he rules.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          ...we fucked it all up. It should'a 
          been so sweet, too.  But it turned 
          out to be the last time that street 
          guys like us were ever given anything 
          that fuckin' valuable again.

<b>EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT
</b>
Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly 
lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert 
night.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          At that time, Vegas was a place where 
          millions of suckers flew in every 
          year on their own nickel, and left 
          behind about a billion dollars. But 
          at night, you couldn't see the desert 
          that surrounds Las Vegas...

<b>EXT. DESERT - DAWN
</b>
Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising 
above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          But it's in the desert where lots of 
          the town's problems are solved.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          Got a lot of holes in the desert, 
          and a lot of problems are buried in 
          those holes. Except you gotta do it 
          right. I mean, you gotta have the 
          hole already dug before you show up 
          with a package in the trunk.  
          Otherwise you're talkin' about a 
          half-hour or forty-five minutes of 
          diggin'. And who knows who's gonna 
          be comin' along in that time? Before 
          you know it, you gotta dig a few 
          more holes. You could be there all 
          fuckin' night.

<b>EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP, 1973 - NIGHT
</b>
<b>TITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER'
</b>
ACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the 
brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          Who could resist? Anywhere else in 
          the country, I was a bookie, a 
          gambler, always lookin' over my 
          shoulder, hassled by cops, day and 
          night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam 
          Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, 
          but running a casino. And that's 
          like selling dreams for cash.

<b>INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT
</b>
We see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. 
They are joined by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits 
and ties. They walk through the casino, past crowded and 
noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack 
tables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, 
cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          I hired an old casino pal, Billy 
          Sherbert, as my manager and I went 
          to work.

<b>                      SHERBERT
</b>               (Introducing the EXECS 
               to ACE)
          ...And this is Ronnie, who takes 
          care of the card room...

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          For guys like me, Las Vegas washes 
          away your sins. It's a morality car 
          wash. It does for us what Lourdes 
          does for humpbacks and cripples. 
          And, along with making us legit...

<b>INT. TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Dolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket 
full of coins into a trough. Camera follows progress as 
numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting 
machine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower 
conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, 
who then places the rolls on a rack.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, 
          what do you think we're doing out 
          here in the middle of the desert?  
          It's all this money. This is the end 
          result of all the bright lights and 
          the comped trips, of all the champagne 
          and free hotel suites, and all the 
          broads and all the booze. It's all 
          been arranged just for us to get 
          your money. That's the truth about 
          Las Vegas.

<b>INT. TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY
</b>
Camera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and 
walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's 
cage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'. 
He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep 
Out'.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          We're the only winners. The players 
          don't stand a chance. And their cash 
          flows from the tables to our boxes 
          ...through the cage and into the 
          most sacred room in the casino ...the 
          place where they add up all the money 
          ...the holy of holies ...the count 
          room.

He opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S 
point of view.

It looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A 
large room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, 
opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in 
white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and 
sorting paper money.)

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          Now this place was off limits.

<b>                      COUNTER #1
</b>          Verify two thousand.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          Even I couldn't get inside, but it 
          was my job to keep it filled with 
          cash. That's for sure.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          They had so much fuckin' money in 
          there, you could build a house out 
          of stacks of $100 bills. And the 
          best part was that upstairs, the 
          board of directors didn't know what 
          the fuck was going on.

At one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and 
rapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows 
a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He 
pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a 
video camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and 
announces:

<b>                      COUNTER #2
</b>          Five thousand.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          I mean, to them everything looked on 
          the up and up. Right? Wrong.

The first counter recounts the cash.

<b>                      COUNTER #1
</b>          Verify five thousand.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          The guys inside the counting room...

Stacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room 
to another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats 
the figure and writes it down on a master list.

<b>                      COUNT ROOM EXEC
</b>          Five thousand.

We move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of 
$100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with 
cash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other 
directions.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          ...were all slipped in there to skim 
          the joint dry.  They'd do short 
          counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd 
          even take cash right out of the drop 
          boxes. And it was up to this guy 
          right here [NANCE], standin' in front 
          of about two million dollars, to 
          skim the cash off the top without 
          anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or 
          anybody.

<b>                      COUNTER #1
</b>          Verify two hundred.

NANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters 
dumps another container of money on the table.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          Now, notice how in the count room 
          nobody ever seems to see anything. 
          Somehow, somebody's always lookin' 
          the other way. Now, look at these 
          guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, 
          right?  They're countin' money. Who 
          wants to bother them? I mean, God 
          forbid they should make a mistake 
          and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're 
          in and you're out.

NANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of 
the casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door.

          extra c-note a week just to watch 
          the door.  I mean, it's routine. 
          Business as usual: in, out, hello, 
          goodbye. And that's all there is to 
          it. Just another fat fuck walkin' 
          out of the casino with a suitcase. 
          Now, that suitcase was goin' straight 
          to one place: right to Kansas City 
          ...which was as close to Las Vegas 
          as the Midwest bosses could go without 
          gettin' themselves arrested.

NANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the 
curb.

NANCE and PISCANO walk through the grocery store, through 
the warehouse, past various employees to a doorway leading 
into the back room, where they are greeted by five older men 
around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old 
jelly glasses filled with red wine.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)

          And they would meet in the back of 
          this produce market in Kansas City.

NANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a bald,

across from him.

him in the neck with the pen.

NICKY grunts while JOE gasps and groans. The BLONDE screams 
while NICKY's hand continues to plunge the pen into JOE's 
throat. JOE tumbles to the floor.

NICKY pounces on him, still stabbing and now kicking. JOE 
whimpers.

ACE points at paper cups, empty glasses and the debris of 
silver dollar wrappings on the floor. DON WARD, the Slots

debris. ACE looks at WARD sternly.

ICHIKAWA places a larger bet.

rack of chips and tosses them into the air, then another,

diving for chips. Dealers. Players. Security guards.

GINGER, on her way out of the casino, passes a folded $100 
bill to a smiling older SHIFT BOSS.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          ...she took care of the valet parkers,

<b>EXT. TANGIERS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

GINGER exits and gets into her car, slipping a VALET PARKER 
a $100 bill.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          Ginger took care of the parkers 
          because they took care of the security

</b>          No problem.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          You're a doll.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          The valet parking job was such a 
          money-maker that they had to pay off 
          the hotel manager just to get the 
          concession.

<b>INT. GINGER'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b>
GINGER enters the room with $25,000 in her hands. She taps 
LESTER DIAMOND's leg with it and he turns to her.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          But one thing I could never 
          understand, was that she could have 
          everything under control, except for 
          her old pimp boyfriend, Lester 
          Diamond.

<b>                      LESTER
</b>          Look, Gin, you know I got other people 
          in this. I got partners. But I want 
          you to understand that I am lookin'

</b>          Okay?

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      LESTER
</b>          Where are you goin'? Where are you?

</b>          You are.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          I am.

He hastily kisses GINGER and slips out the door.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          The Ginger I knew wouldn't even look 
          at this creep.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Good luck.

<b>                      LESTER
</b>          Yeah.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          He was a moocher, a card cheat, a 
          country-club golf hustler. A 
          scumbag... chasing dentists for a 
          few bucks.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Careful.

GINGER looks out of the window and sees LESTER get into a 
convertible and drive off.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          I mean, the guy was always broke, he 
          always had a story. And somehow, she 
          could never turn him down. The way 
          Ginger saw it, I guess, was that 
          Lester was just an unlucky guy. 
          Somebody had to take care of him.

<b>INT. BACK HOME AIRPORT/CUSTOMS - DAY

NICKY, his wife JENNIFER, with a beehive hairdo, and their 
eight-year-old son LITTLE NICKY, are detained while their

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          I mean, he took care of himself only 
          too well. And that's why every badge

Two COPS push past him.

</b>          Even after a little vacation, they 
          hassled him at the airport.

NICKY, JENNIFER, LITTLE NICKY and MARINO walk in.

<b>                      JENNIFER
</b>               (To LITTLE NICKY)
          You go and put your things away.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          And they were usually right.

NICKY, JENNIFER and MARINO are gathered around the kitchen 
table. JENNIFER leans over and starts to shake her hair.

</b>          Whoa, whoa, whoa.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Hold it, hold it. Here.

NICKY places a red towel down on the table. JENNIFER leans 
over again, tugs and shakes her hair until diamonds begin to 
fall out of her beehive.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          Because Nicky enjoyed being a 
          gangster, and he didn't give a damn 
          who knew it.

<b>                      JENNIFER
</b>          Come on. There we go. Look at that. 
          Beautiful.

Diamonds fall on the red towel in slow motion.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause 
          it turns out Nicky was about to be 
          sent to Vegas.

<b>                      JENNIFER
</b>          All right, we're clear.

</b>          I think that's it.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          There's more! There's a couple stuck 
          in there. I know there's more.

<b>                      JENNIFER
</b>          God, I'm telling you, they're out!

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Come on, damn it. Don't get so 
          defensive. It could be stuck in your 
          hair, you know.

NICKY grasps JENNIFER's hair.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          You call this guy and tell him I'm

</b>          But I saw it another. I saw it as 
          untouched. I mean, they had bookies, 
          pimps and drug dealers I could shake 
          down. Who the fuck were they gonna 
          run to?  So, I started getting 
          everybody in line. Best of all, for

</b>          Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, 
          all right. It wasn't very scientific 
          but it worked. When he won, he 
          collected. When he lost, he told the 
          bookies to go fuck themselves. What 
          were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?

<b>INT. TANGIERS CASINO/BLACKJACK TABLES - DAY
</b>
A blackjack WINNER, who looks like a school teacher, with 
over $100,000 in chips before him has gathered a crowd.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          Like these yokels here who never 
          heard of Nicky or the bosses back 
          home, 'cause they're the morons who 
          give you the most trouble. Even after 
          we'd catch 'em, they'd try sneakin' 
          back with beards and wigs and fake 
          noses.

ACE and SHERBERT walk up to watch the WINNER who is playing 
all six hands at the blackjack table.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          You can spot these assholes by 
          watching the way they bet. Like this 
          guy. He's bettin' lavender chips at 
          five hundred each with only one little 
          problem. He's always guessed right.  
          If he wasn't so fuckin' greedy, he'd 
          have been tougher to spot. But in 
          the end, they're all greedy.

ACE walks around the WINNER's table, past the crowd, to the 
pit. Behind him are more blackjack tables, dealers and 
players. ACE bends down and ties his shoelace.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          I saw that the dealer was weak, but 
          he wasn't in on it.

The DEALER's hands lift the corner of his hole card a half 
an inch to determine the casino's hand against the WINNER. 
The slightly exposed hole card is a six of clubs.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          He just wasn't protecting his hand. 
          He was lifting his hole card way to 
          high.

<b>ON ACE'S FACE THEN TO HIS POV OF THE CARD, PAST A PIT BOSS, 
</b><b>PANNING TO THE SIGNALER AT THE BLACKJACK TABLE TO THE RIGHT.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)

</b>
<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          ...reading the dealer's hole card...

<b>PAN CONTINUES PAST ACE TO REVEAL THE WINNER'S TABLE.
</b>
<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          ...and signaling his buddy [the 
          WINNER] at this table.

<b>OVERHEAD DOLLY IN ON SIGNALER WHO APPEARS TO BE NERVOUSLY 
</b><b>TAPPING HIS THIGH.
</b>
We see through his trousers, that he is tapping a copper 
transmitter with a battery pack attached.

Back at the WINNER's table we see inside his pant leg where 
a device strapped to his leg is receiving the impulse signal - 
buzz - buzz - buzz - from the SIGNALER.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          And that's just what these hustlers 
          look for. They cruise from casino to 
          casino, lookin' for weak dealers the 
          way lions look for weak antelope.

ACE starts to get up.

the phone.

<b>OVERHEAD VIEW OF THE SIGNALER'S TABLE. VARIOUS SECURITY GUARDS 
</b><b>SLOWLY BEGIN TO GATHER AROUND IT.

ACE, waiting, lights a cigarette. ARMSTRONG joins ACE. They 
look towards the SIGNALER's table.

               again.)
          Operator... I need Mr Happy, loud.

On ACE's signal, WAITRESSES, one carrying a cake with a 
sparkling candle, start singing 'Happy Birthday', attracting 
the crowd's attention.

<b>                      WAITRESSES
</b>               (In unison)
          Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday 
          to you. Happy Birthday, dear Jeff. 
          Happy Birthday to you.

Gamblers cheer and applaud.

ACE nods and ARMSTRONG lets a long metal object drop out 
from under his jacket sleeve and moves in close behind the 
SIGNALER, as though looking at the game.

He presses the object - a cattle prod - under the SIGNALER's 
arm near his heart. The SIGNALER instantly goes into 
convulsions, falling to the floor gasping and groaning. 
Several SECURITY GUARDS grab the SIGNALER as he falls.  
ARMSTRONG walks away.

<b>                      SECURITY GUARD #1
</b>          Man down!

The WINNER sees what happened to his partner.

<b>                      SECURITY GUARD #1

          arrest here!

</b>          He's fine, folks. Just give us some 
          room, please!

ACE watches the scene. The guards lift the stunned SIGNALER 
to his feet and help him away from the table. Play is 
immediately resumed.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          Watch it now.

The WINNER hurriedly places his chips into racks.

<b>                      SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.)
</b>          Stand back!

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          They never know what hit them. And 
          if and when...

SECURITY GUARDS drag the SIGNALER out.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          ...they do find out they just got 
          zapped by a cattle prod...

SHERBERT follows the WINNER as he rushes away.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          ...they wish they really did have a 
          heart attack.

ACE exits behind the GUARDS and the SIGNALER.

<b>INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT

A grim, windowless utility room with tools on racks along 
the walls, some plain wooden chairs, and a workbench table.

<b>                      SECURITY GUARD #1
</b>          He's got a wire on him.

The SIGNALER is roughly shoved into the room. A SECURITY

strapped to his leg.

The SIGNALER is slammed down face first on the bench and the 
two GUARDS spread his arms out on the table.

<b>                      SIGNALER
</b>               (In pain)
          Oh, God! Oh!

Another GUARD starts up a power saw and approaches the 
SIGNALER who is now pinned to the table. He starts to scream.

<b>                      SIGNALER
</b>          Hey, no! No! No!

ACE walks toward the table, gesturing for the GUARD to turn 
off the saw.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)

<b>                      SIGNALER
</b>          Ye-yeah.

ACE nods to one of the GUARDS. Instantly a large rubber mallet 
smashes onto the man's right hand four times to the sound of 
screams. ACE watches.

<b>                      ACE

</b>          With over a million in cash and jewels

<b>INT. BEVERLEY HILLS BANK/VAULT - DAY
</b>
There are several safe deposit boxes filled with cash. ACE

ACE has to lean on it for the clasp to lock.

</b>          So, I put two million in cash in a 
          Los Angeles bank under the name of 
          Mr and Mrs Tom Collins. This was 
          strictly my shakedown and kidnapping 
          money.

ACE and GINGER struggle to push the crammed box into a slot 
in the wall.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          And, since I'd either be in jail or 
          locked in a closet when I needed the 
          money the most...

The BANK PRESIDENT joins them, and he and ACE simultaneously 
double-lock the outer safe box door with two separate keys, 
after which, ACE gives GINGER his key.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)

<b>INT. TANGIERS POKER TABLE - NIGHT

NICKY is at a table with his gang of card sharks: SLIM, ROCKY, 
MOOSH and COWBOY, all secretly signaling each other, 
sandbagging a mark. MIKE, the crooked dealer from the previous 
scene, deals NICKY a winning hand.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          ...the next thing I did, I started 
          bustin' out high-stakes poker players.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          It was so obvious. I mean, all of 
          Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they 
          were real signal happy.

<b>                      MOOSH

</b>          Oh, why're you crying, with three 
          loaves of bread under your arm?

</b>          Nicky thought nobody was watching 
          him. But he was wrong.

COWBOY, the card shark with the cowboy hat, rakes in a large 
pot toward his side of the table.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Yeah?  

He searches MARINO's jacket.  

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          That's why there was no real organized 
          street stuff in Vegas before I came 
          here.

NICKY throws the cash in the safe and closes the lid.

<b>INT. NICKY'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
NICKY is being shown papers by CHARLIE CLARK, a heavy-set 
banker with a moustache. They're both seated at a table in 
the living-room.

<b>                      CHARLIE CLARK
</b>          Yeah, that works out.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          But how much cash could I bury in my 
          closet, right?

<b>                      CHARLIE CLARK
</b>          You need to understand, and I - I'm 
          sure you do... that in a venture of 
          this kind, you have to be prepared 
          to take some kind of loss.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Oh, listen, I understand that there's 
          always a risk... you know, I might 
          have to take a loss somewhere.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          So I put some of the money into 
          legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. 
          He was Ace's banker.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          I mean, you will try to push it 
          through, won't you, Mr Clark?

<b>                      CHARLIE CLARK
</b>          Yes.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving 
          you fifty thousand cash.

CHARLIE CLARK chuckles

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          Then I put some more of the money...

<b>INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
A prosciutto sandwich is being prepared on a kitchen counter.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          ...in some legitimate places, like 
          my restaurant.

          Is that the last one?

<b>                      COOK
</b>          Yeah.

He hands the sandwich to DOMINICK who spits in it.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          I had my kid brother, Dominick, run 
          it for me.

<b>                      DOMINICK
</b>               (Spits)
          Fuckers!

DOMINICK wraps it in plastic and puts it into a brown paper 
bag.

<b>INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b>
DOMINICK sets the bag with the wrapped sandwich in it on top 
of pizza boxes being held by two uniformed Vegas COPS.

</b>          Yeah... yeah, enjoy.

</b>          Yeah.

He shakes COP #2's hand before heading back into the 
restaurant.

<b>                      DOMINICK
</b>          Have a good time.

          Hey, Dom.

<b>                      DOMINICK
</b>          Hey, how you doin'?

DOMINICK walks over to some patrons in the bar area. NICKY 
enters, kissing his brother.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He 
          was a real restaurant buff. And over

          It was a very popular spot. He had 
          politicians, showgirls and movies 
          stars hangin' out all over the place.

NICKY walks up to STEVE ALLEN and JAYNE MEADOWS seated at a 
table, he whistles their theme tune as he approaches from 
behind.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Listen, that show over at the Flamingo 
          gets better and better.

<b>                      STEVE ALLEN
</b>          By the way, Sammy said whenever you

<b>                      NICKY

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky 
          liked the most was the showgirls, 
          naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky 
          was the movie star.

NICKY walks across the room to MARINO and two showgirls, 
SHELLY and STACY.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>               (To MARINO)

NICKY and SHELLY walk across the parking lot and get into 
his two-tone, red and white car.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          I get bread from back home. I get 
          fish from California. And you can 
          always tell a great kitchen like 
          ours because of the milk-fed veal. 
          That's the secret.

Opening the car door from the passenger's side, she gets in.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          See, milk-fed veal is pure white. 
          Out here, they got that pink veal. 
          Slide over, honey.

She slides over, he gets into the passenger's seat and closes 
the door.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Now, pink veal, you can pound that 
          shit for two days and it'll never 
          get tender, you know what I mean?

SHELLY's head disappears into NICKY's lap.

<b>INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT

FRANK and DOMINICK are at the bar watching as NICKY chastises 
AL, a gambler. The restaurant is empty except for a waiter 
milling around in the background, setting a few tables.

<b>                      AL

<b>                      AL
</b>          A couple of guys, I owe them. So,

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Yeah?

<b>                      AL

          Two small kids at home. I gave you

AL glances over to MARINO.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Huh? And you didn't gamble that 
          fuckin' money? You're gonna stand 
          here and tell me that?

He shakes his head 'no'.

The chastised gambler nods 'yes', bowing his head in shame.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Fuckin' degenerate, you.

NICKY takes some money from his coat pocket and starts 
counting out some bills.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Yeah, thanks.

AL walks out.

          But if you are, you know what...

ACE takes some money out of his coat and puts the thick wad 
of bills on the table.

<b>                      ACE

LESTER turns and sees two HOODS standing by the front and 
back doors of the diner.

<b>                      ACE
</b>          She's my wife.
               (To LESTER.)
          Look at me. You did know that, didn't 
          you? You knew that she's my wife? 
          Huh? Hey, look at me.

<b>                      LESTER
</b>          Yeah, yeah. I know that.

move towards the back door.

The thugs follow him out of the back door. GINGER freezes.

<b>                      ACE
</b>          You remember when you called him 
          that night? When you said goodbye to

          Didn't. No, instead, what did he 
          say? 'Fuck him. Take him for

ACE takes GINGER by the arm to the rear of the diner where 
they can see the parking area through a glass door.

<b>EXT. REAR OF SALVADORAN DINER, PARKING LOT - DAY

Three HOODS rush LESTER who is running towards his car. GINGER 
bursts through the doors, trying to get to LESTER. ACE holds 
her back. They struggle. LESTER groans and gasps as the HOODS 
start to beat him up.

<b>                      HOOD #1
</b>          You fuckin' shit.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          No! No! No! Don't!

ACE restrains her.

The HOODS punch LESTER in the face and stomach.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Make them stop it!
               (Sobbing.)
          No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's 
          my fault!

NICKY watches from a car in a parking lot across the street, 
out of GINGER's sight.

ACE forces GINGER into the car as the HOODS finish the 
beating.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>               (Sobbing)
          No! No!

The HOODS toss LESTER into his car.

<b>                      LESTER
</b>               (Falling into the 
               front seat on his

ACE pulls out of the parking lot with a wailing GINGER.

LESTER groans, trying to sit up.

<b>                      LESTER

               drive off down the

<b>INT. GOLD RUSH BACK ROOM - DAY

GINGER and NICKY are in the back room. NICKY is sitting on a 
couch while GINGER stands by a mirror with a curling iron.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>               (Throwing the iron on 
               the counter)
          He's such a prick. He had some guy 
          from the hotel beat him up. He didn't 
          want to do it himself. Oh, no, he 
          didn't want to get his own hands 
          dirty.

She takes a pill with a drink.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          So, why'd he have to do that, huh?

She walks towards NICKY, who is sitting on a couch across 
the room.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Tell me.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          I know it wasn't a nice thing to do 
          but -

<b>                      GINGER
</b>               (Interrupts)
          Yeah, no shit.

She sits down next to NICKY.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Well, you gotta understand it. He 
          doesn't know if this guy is shaking 
          you down or taking advantage of you.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          No! No! I told him all about the guy 
          before we ever got married. This is 
          no fuckin' surprise.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Oh, you did? I didn't know that.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I 
          was trying to help, so... so what?

</b>          You know... the first time I ever

She smiles.

</b>          I never see - You know, I never seen 
          him act like that with anybody else.  
          I think he's crazy about you. I mean,

</b>          Oh, come on. I went into this with 
          my eyes open, you know. I knew the 
          bottom could drop out at any time. 
          I'm a working girl, right?  You don't 
          think I'm gonna go into a situation 
          like this if I don't think I'm gonna 
          get covered on the back end.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Sure.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Am I right?

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          I can see that. Sure.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          So, he put aside some jewelry for 
          me. A lot of jewelry.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          You mean, like a lot of expensive 
          jewelry? About how much?

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Mm, you want to steal it?
               (Cracking a smile.)

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          No. I - I'm just curious, you know. 
          I was wonderin' how much he would 
          put into a thing like that. That's 
          all.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          I'm told it's worth about a million 
          dollars, maybe more. 
               (Sniffs.)

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Well, there you go. But what does 
          that tell ya? A million dollars in 
          jewelry. Does that tell you the guy 
          is crazy about you, or what?

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          I should have never married him. 
          He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini...  
          duality.
               (Breaking down.)
          Gemini's the snake. You know you 
          can't trust the snake.
               (Sniffs.)
          I mean it.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          I know what you mean.

He moves closer to her.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Listen, Ginger... you know, this is 
          probably not... I don't have the 
          answers anyway... and this is probably 
          not what you want to hear right now, 
          because you're a little upset with 
          Ace.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          I do.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          I understand that. But, you know, I 
          think you should try to make the 
          best of it now. Go slow, you know. 
          See what happens.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          He could have killed him! Okay? He 
          could have killed him. 

She gets up and walks to the counter by the mirror.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          He didn't have to hit him. It's not 
          exactly like I'm sleepin' with the 
          guy! And he makes me sneak around to 
          see my own friends! What the fuck is 
          that all about?

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves 
          you so much. He's jealous and worried.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>               (Sighs, her voice 
               starts to crack)
          He gives a fuck what I do?

<b>                      NICKY
</b>               (Getting up)
          Look, I'll try to find out what the 
          hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll 
          talk to him.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Okay.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          All right?

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Yeah.
               (Walking over to him, 
               smiling.)
          Thanks.

Towering over NICKY, holding a drink in one hand and his 
shoulder in the other, she leans down and kisses him.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Thanks for puttin' up with me.

NICKY takes the drink out of her hand.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          And take it easy with this shit, 
          will you? I mean, this can only make 
          matters worse.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Oh, come on.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          You're a beautiful girl. You don't 
          want to ruin your looks. I've seen a 
          lot of girls get shot to hell from 
          this stuff.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>               (Fidgeting with his 
               jacket, then holding 
               his face in her hands, 
               smiling.)
          You're so nice.
               (She begins to cry.)

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Come on, now, I don't want to see 
          you unhappy.

She kisses him.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>               (Tenderly strokes his 
               head)
          Thanks.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Yeah.

She embraces NICKY, wrapping her arms around him.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>               (Through tears)
          Thank you.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>               (Feeling a little 
               awkward with the hug)
          It's all right.

She kisses him again. NICKY doesn't move, holding back.

GAGGI, holding a cigarette, snaps his fingers in disgust,

          lawsuit, but before she could start 
          countin' her money, the boys back 
          home decided to settle the case out 
          of court instead.

SCOTT, alone, is sitting at her kitchen table.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          So, they send me.

NICKY swiftly enters the room, grabs SCOTT around the neck, 
and fires three shots into her head.

He leans SCOTT back against the chair, then gently, while 
stroking her hair, sets her head to the side. Blood flows 
from her mouth on to her pink robe.

NICKY grabs his gun and leaves.

Reporters are heard shouting 'Mr Green'.

          Fuckers!  They take it, but they 
          don't want to give it back.

NICKY turns up another bad card and looks at the dealer. She 
smiles as she slides the house winnings over to her side of 
the table.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          How the fuck can you grin? How the

The FEMALE DEALER looks to her PIT BOSS for help. He steps 
up to a MALE DEALER at a neighboring table.

</b>          You know how much I'm stuck? You

The MALE DEALER walks up to the FEMALE DEALER and taps her 
on the shoulder.

</b>          Do ya?!

She lays down some cards, claps her hands to show the Eye-in-
the-Sky that they are empty, and exits.

We see the PIT BOSS lock up the chip tray from the table the 
dealer has just left. NICKY has a diminished stack of chips 
and an upturned ten and a two.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Huh, jag-off? Hit me.

The card is a king or a 'paint', a picture card, meaning 
that NICKY has lost.

Everyone freezes in fear. NICKY takes the paint and flicks 
it at the DEALER's chest where it sticks to his shirt.)

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          Take this stiff and pound it up your

The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS who nods 'okay'. He turns 
over a card. It's another paint, a queen. NICKY flicks the 
card to the DEALER's face.

</b>          Take this one and stick it up your

The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS again.

The DEALER looks at the PIT BOSS.

The DEALER deals him another paint.

NICKY gets up to go over to ACE, glowering at SHERBERT as he 
walks past.

ACE and NICKY are partially hidden behind a pillar by the 
slot-machines.

He makes a throat cutting gesture with his hand. ACE leaves. 
NICKY turns to walk back to the table. He sees SHERBERT 
standing right behind him.

<b>                      NICKY
</b>          What are you starin' at, you bald-
          headed Jew prick?!

Before SHERBERT can answer, NICKY grabs the receiver off a 
wall phone and hits him across the face and back. SHERBERT 
falls to the floor. NICKY pulls the cradle off the pillar 
and tosses it down on his back. He and MARINO walk back to 
the table, SHERBERT winces on the floor in shock.

<b>                      NICKY

          calmed myself down and we went to 
          dinner. I tried to keep things nice 
          and civil, you know.  But... hey, 
          twenty-five thousand for three suits? 
          That doesn't make much sense.

          First of all, he's not gonna wear f- 
          thousand-dollar suits. But let's say 
          he did, which he won't. How you gonna 
          get fitted for twenty-five suits in 
          three days?  I, um, I mean, how could 
          you get fitted that fast? I can't

Wide overhead of ACE alone in bed. Off-screen, we hear GINGER, 
a little drunk, on the phone.

          I cannot do it anymore. I can't 
          fuckin' live like this. It's not 
          right.

ACE's point of view as he moves towards the sound of GINGER's 
voice. He enters frame and stops to listen.

<b>                      GINGER (O.S.)
</b>          What are you? Yes, of course - He 
          doesn't come home at night.  What is

          and I just - I can't fuckin' take 
          it. Why should I fucking take it? 
          That wasn't the deal. He acts like...

ACE slips into the foyer where he can see GINGER's reflection 
in a glass door as she talks on the phone in the living-room.

ACE steps up behind her. She gasps, still holding the phone.  
Petrified.

GINGER rises and attacks ACE.

into the bedroom.

Racks and racks of her clothes are still hanging.

grabs as much cash as he can hold.

ACE reaches over to take GINGER's hand - she slowly takes 
hold of his.

<b>INT. ACE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

               almost in a plea.)
          She... she didn't know where to turn. 
          She was tryin' to save your marriage.

ACE pauses for a beat, realizing that NICKY is standing in 
his way and could be dangerous. ACE gives him a wide berth.

We follow ACE through the crowd to GINGER, seated in a booth.

ACE notices her look at NICKY but when he turns to see what

Through the kitchen sliding glass door: GINGER's engine roars 
and tires screech as she tears away in her her sportscar. 
ACE dials the phone.

NICKY has scratches on his hand and face.

<b>EXT. ACE'S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MORNING

ACE and SHERBERT get into ACE's damaged car. A metal strip 
dangling from SHERBERT's door scrapes the pavement as they 
pull out.

<b>INT. VEGAS BANK - DAY
</b>
GINGER opens the safe deposit box, which is filled with bound 
stacks of cash.

She grabs handfuls in a frenzy, some fall off the counter to 
the floor.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Shit! Oh, goddamn it!

GINGER gets down on the floor to pick them up.

COP #2 holds open a large canvas bag for GINGER.

She starts to stuff the money in the bag.

<b>EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAR, ACROSS THE STREET - MORNING
</b>
The FBI AGENTS photograph GINGER leaving the bank.

<b>EXT. VEGAS BANK - DAY
</b>
GINGER throws the canvas bag into the trunk of her car when, 
suddenly, she sees ACE's beat-up Cadillac approaching. She 
gasps.

<b>                      GINGER
</b>          Oh, God. It's him.

          You have to stop him. You have to - 
          'Cause he said he was going to kill 
          me.

ACE jumps out of his car and runs toward GINGER, SHERBERT 
follows him out.

ACE is intercepted by the COPS who hold him back.

<b>                      GINGER

The COPS huddle around ACE and SHERBERT until GINGER's car 
pulls out of the bank.

<b>                      COP #1
</b>          Nothin' we can do about it. Nothin' 
          we can do. There's nothin' we can 
          do.

ACE, unable to pursue, watches GINGER speed away.

<b>                      ACE
</b>          Look, look. You can't stop her for 
          speeding? I mean, look what the hell

<b>                      COP #2

GINGER's car disappears into traffic. The FBI car across the 
street follows right behind her.

<b>                      COP #2
</b>          There's nothing we can do. She had 
          the key.

          Okay, let's do it.

FBI AGENT #1 puts a siren on top of the car's roof.

<b>EXT. VEGAS STREET, CITGO STATION - MORNING
</b>
GINGER pulls over at a gas station, the FBI car with siren 
blaring right behind her.

<b>EXT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING
</b>
A powerless ACE and SHERBERT are still standing in front of 
the bank with the COPS. COP #2 gives ACE a 'sorry' gesture.

GINGER and the FBI AGENTS are standing by her car. She is 
distraught.

Twelve FBI AGENTS with rifles, wearing 'FBI' armbands, charge 
into the parking lot and rush through the front door.

casino.

</b>          I want all those papers seized,

As AUSTIN and the others make their way into the soft count

of the cashier's window.

<b>                      AUSTIN

The counters look on as several AGENTS seize the money boxes 
and stacks of cash from the glass table. DUPREY sifts through 
the Count Room Executive's notebook.

AUSTIN is at a cabinet looking through a ledger.

one cuff on him.

PISCANO gasps and clutches his chest, having a heart attack.

GAGGI's men, CURLY and BEEPER, appear from behind STONE and 
shoot him dead.

They empty their silent half-load rounds into STONE even

<b>EXT. NANCE'S COSTA RICAN HOUSE - DAY
</b>
<b>TITLE IN: COSTA RICA
</b>
The camera moves down a waterfall to reveal NANCE's Spanish-
style house.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          The first one to skip was John Nance. 
          He found a nice, warm secluded place 
          in Costa Rica. He thought nobody 
          would find him there.

Several gunshots are heard. NANCE emerges from the house 
through a door and runs along a verandah to another door. He 
breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in.  
BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into 
the house. Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from 
yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the 
stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          But, then, his kid got nabbed by the 
          Feds for drugs, and so naturally the 
          bosses were afraid he'd come out of 
          hidin' just to save his kid and give 
          'em all up.  So...

CURLY and BEEPER come out of the house and approach NANCE 
from behind.

<b>                      CURLY
</b>          Hey, where you goin', jag-off?

NANCE kneels down. CURLY points his gun expertly at the top 
of NANCE's head and fires. Blood splatters from NANCE's mouth 
and he falls to the ground. The gunmen walk away.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          But anyway, they, you know, they all 
          had to follow.

<b>EXT. HOLE IN THE DESERT - DUSK
</b>
A bound COUNT ROOM EXEC and a CLERK are kneeling next to a 
large pit in the esert ground in front of BEEPER and CURLY.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          Everybody went down.

The CLERK groans as he's shot in the head by BEEPER. Blood 
splatters and he falls right into the pre-dug hole.

<b>                      COUNT ROOM EXEC
</b>          Go ahead, fuck...

<b>                      CURLY
</b>          Fuck you.

CURLY shoots the EXEC in the head, he too falls backward 
into the pit. The gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies, 
then toss their guns into the hole.

<b>                      NICKY (V.O.)
</b>          Before you knew it...

RICHIE, a sharply dressed Tangiers EXEC, is getting into his

</b>          ...anybody who knew anything wound 
          up gettin' whacked.

CURLY sneaks up from behind and hits the EXEC with a lead 
pipe. He puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke 
him to death. The EXEC struggles a bit but the bag soon fills 
with blood. CURLY strikes him with the pipe one last time.

<b>INT. BEVERLY SUNSET MOTEL - NIGHT

The camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block 
wall.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          After Ginger took off, she wasn't 
          much help to anybody. She found some 
          pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers 
          in LA. And in a few months, they 
          went through all the money and all 
          the jewels.

Suddenly, a door opens and GINGER overdosing, staggers into 
the hall looking for help. She gasps, goes halfway down the 
seedy corridor towards the desk, but collapses and dies.

          what nobody outside the factory knew, 
          was that that model car was made 
          with a metal plate under the driver's 
          seat. It's the only thing that saved

flames come out of the defroster vents. Everything goes silent

with the rising explosion of smoke and fire.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)

NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of the car to greet FAT 
SALLY. HARDY, FUSCO and BEEPER are also waiting there, 
smiling.

          my brother to get fucked around.

NICKY shakes hands with SALLY. FUSCO walks up to say hello.

</b>          I mean, what's right is right. They 
          don't give a fuck about - urgghh!

MARINO hits NICKY in the back with a bat. FAT SALLY grabs 
him by the throat.

HARDY and BEEPER hold DOMINICK by the arms.

MARINO hits NICKY's legs with the bat.

</b>          Huh? Come on, you fuckin' rat.

<b>                      DOMINICK

ahead, forcing him to watch his brother being beaten.

</b>          Fuckin' punk, motherfucker! Piece of

down.

They drag DOMINICK by his feet. MARINO swings at him with 
two bats as he's taken away into the cornfield.

DOMINICK is battered and bloody. MARINO, HARDY and BEEPER 
stand over him, still swinging their bats.

NICKY is on his side, still held down by SALLY and FUSCO. 
His face is a little bloody.

MARINO swings two final blows to DOMINICK's head. NICKY looks 
away, sobbing.

MARINO and BEEPER look on as the other hoods begin the tedious 
work of tossing dirt on to the bodies, shovel by shovel, 
until they are covered up to their necks.

We see NICKY's face, bloodied and battered. He's still 
breathing and groaning.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)

          enough of Nicky. They had enough.  
          How much were they gonna take? So, 
          they made an example of him and his 
          brother. They buried them while they 
          were still breathing.

A full shovel of dirt lands upon NICKY's face and chest with 
a thud.

</b>
A 4,000 room hotel with a 60-foot volcano out front. Tourists 
watch it belch smoke and flames.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          ...knocked out of the box, the 
          corporations tore down practically 
          every one of the old casinos. And 
          where did the money come from...

<b>EXT. THE LUXOR HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT
</b>
A giant glass pyramid 30 stories high with a huge sphinx 
outside.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          ...to rebuild the pyramids?... Junk 
          bonds.

<b>EXT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY
</b>
<b>TITLE IN: SAN DIEGO
</b>
A house very much like ACE's house in Vegas, including the 
fact that it backs up on a golf course. We see ACE inside 
talking on the phone with a bookie.

          Still not sure?

<b>INT. ACE'S SAN DIEGO LUXURY HOME - DAY
</b>
An older, grayer ACE is alone in his living-room with TV 
sets, fax machines and multiple phone lines. He is surrounded 
by newspapers and files. He is very much the way we saw him 
during his earlier handicapping days.

<b>                      RACE ANNOUNCER
</b>               (From a television 
               set)
          They're off and running...

<b>                      ACE

          Probable, but may be questionable. 
          All right. Well, let me know as soon 
          as you can find out.

ACE sets his cordless phone down and jots a few notes on a 
racing form. A television set shows a football game in the 
background.

<b>                      ACE (V.O.)
</b>          But in the end, I wound up right 
          back where I started. I could still 
          pick winners, and I could still make 
          money for all kinds of people back 
          home. And why mess up a good thing? 
          And that's that.

He takes off his glasses, and gazes ahead.
