<br/></b>                               Benny and Joon
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>In Bennyâ€™s garage.
<br/>
<br/>Randy: So were planning our next vacation right. I want Australia, she wants Italy. I like snorkelling. She likes garlic. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, she says to me do I need her? Jesus Benny, what kind of question is that? I mean need, what does it mean to really need somebody?
<br/>
<br/>Eric: Benny, fuel line.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Hey Waldo, could you answer that phone?
<br/>
<br/>Waldo: Yeah, Hello?
<br/>
<br/>Postman: I need a check Benny, C.O.D.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: In a minute, meet me in the office.
<br/>
<br/>Postman: (quietly) all right
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Whoa, put that out, I got a fuel line broke.
<br/>
<br/>Waldo: Hey Benny, itâ€™s Joon on the phone again
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Well tell her Iâ€™ll call her back, ask her what she wants
<br/>
<br/>Waldo: Its an emergency, she says your running low on peanut butter super chunks
<br/>
<br/>Benny: (quietly) Emergency
<br/>
<br/>In the garage office
<br/>
<br/>Benny: (On phone) all right, the issue is jelly, you only like two kinds. You either like grape or poison berry, which? All right. Yeah, yeah peanut butter, I know, super kind, all right, see you at 6. Ok, bye.(Hangs up phone) Hi, thanks for waiting mâ€™am. Erm, im afraid that the best deal we can do for you is going to be, erm, $7750. But I think if you check around youâ€™ll see that that is a really good deal.
<br/>
<br/>Girl: Yeah?
<br/>
<br/>Eric: That really is a very good deal mâ€™am. A little too goodâ€¦
<br/>
<br/>Girl: Letâ€™s do it.Outside Benny and Joonâ€™s house, then inside.
<br/>
<br/>(Benny is walking home from work, he hears shouting inside)
<br/>
<br/>Joon: Get out of my sight!
<br/>
<br/>Smeal: you wouldnâ€™t dare Joon.
<br/>
<br/>(Joon screams and throws plate across room.)
<br/>
<br/>Benny: what is going on here? (He rushes in) Joon! Mrs Smeal! Mrs Smeal, please.
<br/>
<br/>Smeal: Beware the winds of reason shall blow stern.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: What?
<br/>
<br/>Smeal: I am done Mr Pearl, I am done. The mules turned to glue, she left the house unescorted, she has sudden outbursts. She is simply unmanageable
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Mrs Smeal! Please, wait, please. Let me talk to her. I can talk to her, you cant quit on such short notice.
<br/>
<br/>Smeal: oh, well Iâ€™m sorry sir. In Ireland we have a saying when a boat runs ashore, the sea has spoken.
<br/>
<br/>(Mrs Smeal leaves)In the kitchen, Benny is cooking and on the phone to Eric.Benny: Listen, if she is going to be alone every day until I find another housekeeper, Iâ€™m not leaving her alone at night too.
<br/>
<br/>Eric: Listen bring her, whatâ€™s she going to do? She paints and she reads.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Yeah, she paints, she reads, she lights things on fire.
<br/>
<br/>Eric: that happened once. Look I got a fire extinguisher, just bring her. Now get your ass over here, and donâ€™t forget the Louie Prang record. Remember, always play for keeps.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: all right, all right, all right, Iâ€™ll be there.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Joon Dinner! Spaghetti and salad.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: in that order?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: what happened between you and Mrs Smeal?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: she was given the fits of semi-precious metaphors.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: the womanâ€™s a house keeper Joon, not an English professor.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: she moved things.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: she said you wandered off. Did you leave the house alone?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: define alone
<br/>
<br/>Benny: you know full well what Iâ€™m talking about. Listen, while im at work I cant be worried about whether or not your knocking another house keeper into early retirement. First it was Mrs Larkburg.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: a woman deeply and hygienically disturbed. Her hair smelled.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: but then it was Mrs Piltz.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: Piltz, the answers in the question. Letâ€™s face it Benjamin, hiring house keepers is not your forte.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Oh yeah, well until I do find another house keeper, you are going to stick close to the house, you understand? Now have some salad. Oh by the way, I want you to come with me to my poker game
<br/>
<br/>Joon: Bennyâ€¦
<br/>
<br/>Benny: come on, youâ€™ll have a good timeThey travel to the poker game and Joon sees Sam in the tree. They arrive at the poker game
<br/>
<br/>Man: erm, wet belt buckle
<br/>
<br/>Mike: classical Greek martini shaker
<br/>
<br/>Benny: 6 turkey feather darts
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Iâ€™ll see you with the Diana Durban album
<br/>
<br/>Benny: come on
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: and Iâ€™ll raise you with the stethoscope
<br/>
<br/>Mike: does it have little plastic ear pieces on the end?
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: what do you care? You never win mike!
<br/>
<br/>Mike: well if I do, I donâ€™t want the, stabbing my ear drums. Steering wheel knob
<br/>
<br/>Eric: Salad shooter
<br/>
<br/>Benny: 56 debenture iron
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: foldo
<br/>
<br/>Mike: well you must have a good hand, huh
<br/>
<br/>Benny: no, Iâ€™m bluffing
<br/>
<br/>Mike: really
<br/>
<br/>Benny: come on, you got to play to find out, come on
<br/>
<br/>Mike: ok, 150ft of coaxial cable. Show them
<br/>
<br/>Benny: full house, Jacks over fourâ€™s
<br/>
<br/>Eric: (laughing) oh shit
<br/>
<br/>Mike: I thought he was bluffing
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: well some one get some air to his brain. He was bluffing about bluffing
<br/>
<br/>Mike: youâ€™re a real pal Benny, I tell you what, I got a solution to your house keeper problems, you can have my room mates.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: oh thatâ€™s a terrific offer Benjamin. To save you from the retched chore of Smeal shopping. Those places are such drudgery arenâ€™t they? Montgomery and Smeal, Smeals and Roebuck, Smeals â€˜râ€™ usâ€¦
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Joon. You got a roommate? When did you get a roommate?
<br/>
<br/>Mike: since last week. My cousin landed in town and my life has gone from heaven to hell in 7 days.
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Just like the good lord intended
<br/>
<br/>Mike: yeah, 20 years old and he canâ€™t even read. He spends all day polishing my plastic forks.
<br/>
<br/>Eric: what do you mean when you say he canâ€™t read? You mean words?
<br/>
<br/>Mike: yeah, and he keeps me up all night watching stupid old movies. My works starting to suffer.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: you installed cable TV.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Joon, would you please glue your sequins
<br/>
<br/>Joon: have we an internal sequin issue to deal with Benjamin?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: can we make this the last hand? Come on, come on, play cards.
<br/>
<br/>Eric: 2 tickets to tomorrow nights baseball game
<br/>
<br/>Benny: 1 pocket fisherman
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: fold
<br/>
<br/>Benny: do you ever stay in?
<br/>
<br/>Mike: a snorkel maskNext morning in Benny and Joonâ€™s house. Joon is wearing a snorkel mask and makes a smoothie. She goes outside and holds up the traffic.
<br/>
<br/>In the social workers officeSW: she really knows how to rattle the day help
<br/>
<br/>Benny: you know, I think we need to find someone more understanding than Mrs Smeal
<br/>
<br/>SW: now let me tell you something. How are you two getting along?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: us? Fine, normal, you know fine. Why?
<br/>
<br/>SW: Iâ€™ll level with you. I think its time you gave serious consideration into a group home
<br/>
<br/>Benny: she already has a home
<br/>
<br/>SW: Benny, she needs to be with her peers
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah, she hates her peers. She has already quit the two day centres to prove it. Look all we need right now is a new housekeeper
<br/>
<br/>SW: well I know of no one else. Youâ€™ve been up and down the list. Now you might want to entertain the possibilities that there are some people more capable of handling these episodes than you. I am beginning to that that you living together may not be the best thing any more
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Iâ€™m her brother and her only family. And weâ€™ve done just fine the two of us for 12 years.
<br/>
<br/>SW: yes but her stress level is always a factor in her display of symptoms. Her agitation should be kept to a minimum
<br/>
<br/>Benny: everybody gets agitated sometimes itâ€™s the only option
<br/>
<br/>SW: Benny, donâ€™t get me wrong Iâ€™m impressed that youâ€™ve managed this long. But a group home would give her a chance to develop other relationships. Also we donâ€™t know this but what if she was capable of a part time job? They would encourage her in that direction. These are very nice placeâ€™s, nurturing, supportive
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Iâ€™m not farming her outJoon has held up the traffic and the drivers are getting angry and shouting at her. A police man arrives
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I have every right to be outside officer. I have ever right.
<br/>
<br/>Police: yes mâ€™am. May I see some ID please? In Bennyâ€™s garage
<br/>
<br/>Benny: hey Waldo, did you start that brake job yet?
<br/>
<br/>Waldo: Joon called. She says that youâ€™ve run out of tapioca.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: she what?
<br/>
<br/>Waldo: oh, and the police will cooperate
<br/>
<br/>Benny: holy shit. Listen Jack, you want to go to the baseball game tonight,
<br/>
<br/>Jack: hey thanks Benny.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: box seats. Hello, Joon?Back at the house. Joon is painting.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: time for your medicine JoonBenny in his bedroom
<br/>
<br/>Benny: night SteveAt the garage
<br/>
<br/>Benny: oh hello, howâ€™s it going?
<br/>
<br/>Girl: I appreciate the deal on the engine
<br/>
<br/>Benny: oh yeah, no problem. Is it running alright?
<br/>
<br/>Girl: yeah, itâ€™s running great
<br/>
<br/>Benny: oh, good
<br/>
<br/>Girl: so can I erm, make it up to you with some dinner.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: some dinner? Erm you serious?
<br/>
<br/>Girl: yeah, dinner with you
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Erm, you know what I canâ€™t. I mean Iâ€™d like to but I canâ€™t
<br/>
<br/>Girl: ok
<br/>
<br/>Benny: ok
<br/>
<br/>Eric: stupid, stupidAt the house playing table tennis
<br/>
<br/>Benny: 18:15
<br/>
<br/>Joon: 17:16
<br/>
<br/>Benny: 18:15
<br/>
<br/>Joon: it caught the corner.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: it was a foot off the table
<br/>
<br/>Joon: it was not
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Juniper
<br/>
<br/>Joon: Benjamin. Donâ€™t underestimate the mentally ill. We know how to count
<br/>
<br/>Benny: ok, fine 17:16
<br/>
<br/>Joon: you canâ€™t give me what was already mine. Youâ€™re trying to cheat
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Iâ€™m not cheating
<br/>
<br/>Joon: cheating
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Joon, I donâ€™t cheat. Youâ€™re the one whoâ€™s cheating
<br/>
<br/>Joon: Youâ€™re all trying to cheat me, youâ€™re trying to cheat. Joon throws the racket and smashes a lamp. She then runs upstairs
<br/>
<br/>At the hospitalThomas: (On the phone at the hospital) yeah, alright I spoke to some of the guys from the staff Benny. Nobody wants to be your house keeper. I will keep trying but I got to tell you I donâ€™t think so
<br/>
<br/>Benny: (on the phone at home) yeah, ok thanks. ByeJoon is playing with a fan and some paper. She lets go of the paper and it flies into a candle setting alight. Benny puts it out and goes upstairs. He sits on the bed
<br/>
<br/>Benny: ok StevieHe goes to feed his fish, but it is dead. He takes it to the bathroom and flushes it down the toilet.
<br/>
<br/>Outside Ericâ€™s houseBenny: I mean I cant even keep a goldfish alive. What chance do I have with Joon? If something bad happened to her Iâ€™d, Iâ€™d never ever be able to forgive myself
<br/>
<br/>Eric: a group home is the right thing for her Benny.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah, this is defiantly for her own good
<br/>
<br/>Eric: hey, itâ€™s for both your own good. How much longer can you do this to your self? Youâ€™re life is literally passing you by
<br/>
<br/>Benny: youâ€™re right. Youâ€™re right. What am I doing with myself? I spend my life working on cars and taking care of my sister. I cant even have a relationship without having to worry how Joon is going to fit in.
<br/>
<br/>Eric: you know, once you get settled in you can actually take a vacation. Travel a little. I can hold down the fort no problem.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: travel? Travel?
<br/>
<br/>Eric: Benny, there is a whole world out there man, I mean picture yourself on the open road, wind in the hair in the Alcamino. Highway stretching out b- whatâ€™s that? Up ahead? A lovely motorist. Stranded. Carburettor trouble. Better investigate.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah right, Iâ€™m going to be stopping at a pay phone every 15 minutes to call Joon to see how sheâ€™s doing.At another poker game
<br/>
<br/>Mike: Ok lets see, Black Sabbath over there
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: you got that flash light?
<br/>
<br/>Mike: its not a flashlight. it turns out its a brush kind of thing. Hat
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Whereâ€™s the batteries?
<br/>
<br/>Mike: you didnâ€™t win any batteries. what are you talking about?
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: who gets the ice shaker? it goes on mine
<br/>
<br/>Mike: ok guys come one, hurry it up huh or we'll start without you
<br/>

<br/>Sam: mentally ill. Really?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah. Benny: but I mean donâ€™t worry about it. Just let her go about her routine, you know. Her routine is everyday therapy. Oh and donâ€™t hang around her room while sheâ€™s painting. She hates that.
<br/>
<br/>Sam: no
<br/>
<br/>Benny: she runs hot and cold on you, just ignore it. Thatâ€™s just the way it works. Oh listen erm, she starts talking to herself, donâ€™t worry about it but donâ€™t answer.
<br/>
<br/>Sam: ok

<br/>
<br/>Sam: ok
<br/>
<br/>Benny: ok
<br/>
<br/>Benny goes out to work and leaves Joon and Sam. Joon is making a breakfast smoothie and Sam is watching as he walks in.

<br/>
<br/>Benny and Joonâ€™s house
<br/>
<br/>Sam is cleaning and Joon is in the garden. She hears the loud music that Sam is playing and runs inside.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: aah, too loud.
<br/>
<br/>Sam: aah, what? (Joon points to the radio) oh.
<br/>
<br/>He switches the radio off and Joon takes it away.
<br/>
<br/>Benny walks home as he walks in he sees Joon alone at the table
<br/>
<br/>Benny: hey whereâ€™s Sam?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I didnâ€™t mean to kick him out. I mean I didnâ€™t kick him out he just left.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: whoa, whoa, whoa what, what happened? Did something happen?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: he just he just left. He was, he was in the air and, and, and with a thing and it was really loud. It was really loud. And all, I just kept seeing. He didnâ€™t mean to do it.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: do it? What? What, did he, what did he do?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: he cleaned the house
<br/>
<br/>Benny: and you kicked him out for that?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: (laughs)
<br/>
<br/>Benny: (laughs)
<br/>
<br/>There is a knock on the door and a jack-in-the-box is left on the floor. Joon picks it up. They both look up and see Sam sat on the mail box.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: maybe I should invite him back in
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah before someone sticks a stamp on his head and mails him to Guam.
<br/>
<br/>Back in the house
<br/>
<br/>Sam is making grilled cheese sandwiches with an iron
<br/>
<br/>Joon: some cultures are defined by their relationship to cheese
<br/>
<br/>Benny: is that a fact?
<br/>
<br/>Joon is in bed and Benny walks in
<br/>
<br/>Joon: he can really cook cant he?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: uh-uh yeah. All for the grilled cheese I might of used the wool setting.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: thatâ€™s what I told him
<br/>
<br/>Benny: really? What did he use?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: rayon. Silk would have been too soggy. Cotton would
<br/>
<br/>Benny: would of burned it
<br/>
<br/>Joon: right. Fortunately he consulted me before giving it steam. I was four square against it. I wish he could be my new smeal.
<br/>
<br/>Joon hums a tune and they both start singing the words. It flashbacks to when they were kids and their parents died in a car crash.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: good night
<br/>
<br/>Joon: good night
<br/>
<br/>The next morning and Sam is writing a letter to him mum
<br/>
<br/>Joon: you need some help? Dear mum, I have departed Mikes with love and gratitude and am not living with Benny and Joon pearl, two magnificently devoted new friends. Bennyâ€™s pre-disposition to hyper tense Irish monologue is sub standing and he has given me a job as a domestic engineer and is pleased with my performance so far. Love Sam
<br/>
<br/>Sam: wow, I didnâ€™t know how to talk like that
<br/>
<br/>They go outside and post the letter
<br/>
<br/>Sam: tapioca?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: oh, yes
<br/>
<br/>In the diner
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: ok
<br/>
<br/>Sam: thank you Ruthie
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: youâ€™re welcome Sam. Let me know if you need anything ok?
<br/>
<br/>Sam: you donâ€™t like raisins?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: not really
<br/>
<br/>Sam: why?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: they used to be fat and juicy and now theyâ€™re twisted like they had their life stolen. They taste sweet but really they are just humiliated grapes. I cant say Iâ€™m a big supporter of the raisin council.
<br/>
<br/>Sam: did you see those raisins on TV? The ones that sing and dance and stuff
<br/>
<br/>Joon: they scare me
<br/>
<br/>Sam: yeah me too
<br/>
<br/>Joon; its sick, commercial people make them sing and dance so people will eat them
<br/>
<br/>Sam: itâ€™s a shame about raisins
<br/>
<br/>Joon: cannibals
<br/>
<br/>Sam; yeah. Do you like avocadoes?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: theyâ€™re a fruit you know.
<br/>
<br/>Sam: Ruthie, do you got any avocadoes?
<br/>
<br/>At Benny and Joonâ€™s house
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Joon
<br/>
<br/>He looks outside and sees a car pull up. Ruthie, Sam and Joon get out of the car.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: youâ€™re very pretty when youâ€™re off work Ruthie
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: thank you. Maybe I should quit my job huh?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: where the hell have you two been?
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: oh donâ€™t worry, they were with me. We were just running some errands.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: oh how you doing?
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: Hi
<br/>
<br/>Benny; running errands? You ran an errand?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: yes I did, I ran an errand.
<br/>
<br/>Joon hands Benny two new fish
<br/>
<br/>Benny: oh look

<br/>
<br/>Sam: look, look, look Ruthieâ€™s movie

<br/>
<br/>Benny: come on in, come on in
<br/>
<br/>By the river
<br/>
<br/>Benny: so why did you leave?
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: LA? I wasnâ€™t that good of an actress
<br/>
<br/>Benny: well thatâ€™s not how Sam tells it. Heâ€™s raving about you
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: yeah well, heâ€™s sweeter than he is judgemental. How long have you known him?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Sam? Erm 72 hours
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: be serious
<br/>
<br/>Benny: I am, serious
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: really
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Iâ€™m always serious, Iâ€™m too serious. Did you ever get to the point in your life when nothing makes any sense?
<br/>
<br/>Inside watching the movie
<br/>
<br/>Sam is talking along with the movie
<br/>
<br/>Outside trying to start Ruthieâ€™s car
<br/>
<br/>Benny: try it again. Now thereâ€™s only two reasons a car wont start. Either youâ€™re not getting fuel or youâ€™re not getting fuel. Youâ€™ve got fire. I think youâ€™d better let me drive you home. Sorry
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: thanks
<br/>
<br/>Pulling up outside Ruthieâ€™s house
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: here it is, right here
<br/>
<br/>Benny; 2nd job huh/

<br/>
<br/>Benny: down right un-American if you ask me
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: yeah
<br/>
<br/>Benny: you can have one of mine if you want
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: no I couldnâ€™t possibly. They were a gift
<br/>
<br/>Benny: but you know you could borrow it. But you know we could share it. Like joint custody. You could take it on the weekends you know. What is this?
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: sit down son, youâ€™re making me nervous

<br/>Benny and Joonâ€™s house
<br/>
<br/>Sam and Joon kiss. Sam blows up a balloon and lets the air out of it slowly so it makes a tune. It pops and they laugh
<br/>
<br/>At the social workers office
<br/>
<br/>SW: see you next week

<br/>Joon: right thank you

<br/>SW: she sheâ€™s lying? I mean is it a man or isnâ€™t it?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: well yes technically. Heâ€™s really just a guy, a friend.

<br/>
<br/>Owner: hello

<br/>Sam: I wanna help
<br/>
<br/>Owner: ah wonderful ok. If youâ€™d like to fill out this application Iâ€™ll be right with you.

<br/>He tries to put his hat on his head but it just pops off again. He does it to Joon and tries to do it to Benny.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: come on we should go. Knock it off.
<br/>
<br/>He knocks the hat out of Samâ€™s hand and it goes flying. Sam does an acrobatic show for the people in the park
<br/>
<br/>Benny: he is, heâ€™s incredible. Heâ€™s amazing
<br/>
<br/>Joon: did you have to go to school for that?
<br/>

<br/>Sam: like what?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: I donâ€™t know all I know is that they were saying this guy is something else. Youâ€™re special. Youâ€™re not some regular schmoe like the rest of us who do it because we have to do it. Youâ€™re blessed

<br/>Sam: because it seems to me that, well except from being a little mentally ill, sheâ€™s pretty normal you know?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: do you realise you could be the next Buster Keeton?
<br/>
<br/>Sam is sat outside the video store contemplating whether to go in

<br/>Benny: whatâ€™s your problem? This is his chance to do something, be somebody
<br/>
<br/>Joon: he is somebody
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah I know, but he wants to be more
<br/>
<br/>Joon: you donâ€™t know what he wants
<br/>
<br/>Benny: I know he doesnâ€™t want to be a house keeper for the rest of his life. If youâ€™re worried about getting a new Smeal weâ€™ll get you a new Smeal
<br/>
<br/>Joon: heâ€™s not my Smeal
<br/>
<br/>Benny: house keeper, whatever
<br/>
<br/>Joon: we have to tell him
<br/>
<br/>Benny: what? Tell me what?
<br/>
<br/>Sam: err Bennyâ€¦Joonâ€¦ andâ€¦ and Iâ€¦ areâ€¦ you know.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: bullshit! Youâ€¦
<br/>
<br/>He gets up and drags Sam from the table
<br/>
<br/>Sam: no, no
<br/>
<br/>Joon: donâ€™t
<br/>
<br/>Benny: get the fuck out!
<br/>
<br/>Joon: you cant throw him out. I won him
<br/>
<br/>Benny: just settle down, just settle down
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I love him!
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah? Well youâ€™re crazy!
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I am not crazy
<br/>
<br/>Benny; you see what weâ€™ve come to? You see?
<br/>
<br/>He gets out the group home leaflet
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
<br/>
<br/>In Joonâ€™s bedroom
<br/>
<br/>Benny: can I get you anything?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: tapioca
<br/>
<br/>Benny: tapioca? Ok. Anything on it?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: raisins
<br/>
<br/>Benny: ok
<br/>
<br/>He goes downstairs and checks the fridge. There is none left so he goes out to get some. Sam is sat in the tree outside and Joon burns a picture of her and benny when they were children. Sam goes to the door and Joon goes out to him
<br/>
<br/>Joon: Hi
<br/>
<br/>Benny arrives at Ruthieâ€™s house
<br/>
<br/>Benny: hi. How you doinâ€™?
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: youâ€™re out late
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah. Listenâ€¦ do you have any tapioca?
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: jeez Benny, Iâ€™ve heard a lot of lines in my time butâ€¦
<br/>
<br/>Benny: no, no, no its not for me. Its for Joon
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: come on in
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah?
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: yeah
<br/>
<br/>Sam and Joon get on the bus with two bags. They sit down and Joon starts to talk to herself
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I cant hear you
<br/>
<br/>Sam: Joon. Ok?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: yeah
<br/>
<br/>Sam: good good good
<br/>
<br/>He tries to calm her down
<br/>
<br/>Joon; Iâ€™m not no, no Iâ€™m not
<br/>
<br/>Sam: ok? All right? Hold tight ok? Shh. Its ok. Its ok
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I am not, I am not, I am not
<br/>
<br/>Joon starts to cry and Sam is still trying to calm her down
<br/>
<br/>Joon: shut up!
<br/>
<br/>Sam: no, no, no, no. Shh. Shh. Joon. Please. Come on
<br/>
<br/>Joon: no its not all in my head
<br/>
<br/>Sam: sir? Sir! Stop the bus! Please stop the bus!
<br/>
<br/>Benny is driving back fromRuthieâ€™s and he sees the bus stopped. An ambulance arrives and the crew climb aboard the bus
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I donâ€™t want to talk to you
<br/>
<br/>Sam: Joon
<br/>
<br/>AM1: all righty. You want to step out?
<br/>
<br/>Sam: yeah ok, ok
<br/>
<br/>AM1: how you doinâ€™ hon.?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: you think I donâ€™t know who you are. I know just who you are. So just leave, leave. Leave! donâ€™t touch me! donâ€™t touch me!
<br/>
<br/>They grab her and put her in the ambulance. Benny runs to the front of the crowd of people
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Joon, Joon!
<br/>
<br/>He sees Sam sat in the ambulance
<br/>
<br/>At the mental hospital
<br/>
<br/>Benny: look I a going to see my sister. Would you please tell me her room number?
<br/>
<br/>Woman: please sir, just come back in the morning
<br/>
<br/>Benny: let me talk to her god damn doctor
<br/>
<br/>In the social workers room
<br/>
<br/>SW: Iâ€™m sorry. She doesnâ€™t want any visitors. Not you or anyone else
<br/>
<br/>Benny: she doesnâ€™t want to see me?
<br/>
<br/>SW: no and she doesnâ€™t want to leave. Benny why donâ€™t you go home? Get some sleep. I promise Iâ€™ll keep in touch
<br/>
<br/>He goes out of the room and sees Sam in the waiting room
<br/>
<br/>Benny: I hope your happy. I hope youâ€™re happy with what you have done to her.
<br/>
<br/>He grabs Sam
<br/>
<br/>Benny: you just stay the hell away from my sister
<br/>
<br/>Sam: no, no
<br/>
<br/>Benny: want to know why everybody laughs at you Sam? Because youâ€™re an idiot. Youâ€™re a first class moron
<br/>
<br/>Sam: youâ€™re scared
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Iâ€™m what?
<br/>
<br/>Sam youâ€™re scared. I can see it. And you know why? I used to look up to you but know I cant look at you at all.
<br/>
<br/>It flashes to Joon in bed and Benny walking by the trains. It shows Joon again but awake by the window and Sam at Ruthieâ€™s. Benny is playing with a jack-in-the-box back at the house and Sam is outside the hospital.
<br/>
<br/>At the video store
<br/>
<br/>Sam: I think that Fred Astatine is the way to go
<br/>
<br/>Lady: yeah?
<br/>
<br/>Sam: thatâ€™s a good choice
<br/>
<br/>Lady: whoâ€™s that woman who starred in the romanâ€¦
<br/>
<br/>Sam looks up and sees Benny
<br/>
<br/>Sam: Audrey hepburn
<br/>
<br/>Lady: yeah Sam. Thanks a lot
<br/>
<br/>Sam: have a nice day. Can I help you?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah I hope so.
<br/>
<br/>At the mental hospital
<br/>
<br/>Sam and Benny are in a room. Thomas walks in
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Thomas, how is she? Tell me the truth
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: sheâ€™s been better Benny
<br/>
<br/>Benny: well youâ€™ve got to tell me what room number sheâ€™s in
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: 335. But donâ€™t even think about it Benny. itâ€™s a closed ward. No visitors
<br/>
<br/>Sam: no weâ€™ve got to find Joon. Please
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Thomas youâ€™ve got to get us in there, to see her
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: its impossible Benny
<br/>
<br/>Benny: what do you mean its impossible? Listen I just need 2 minutes with her
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Iâ€™ll be fired
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Thomas, Iâ€™m begging you as a friend
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Iâ€™d love to help out but Garveyâ€™s going to be in there to check on her soon. My hands are tied. My hands are tied!
<br/>
<br/>Thomas leaves
<br/>
<br/>Benny: what room did he say?
<br/>
<br/>Sam: 335
<br/>
<br/>At the waiting room they sit down. The door opens to the closed ward and Sam throws his hat in the way of the door do it doesnâ€™t close. They go through and as they are walking through the corridors they hear some men coming the other way.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: shit. What are you doing?
<br/>
<br/>Sam slides down the hall towards the men
<br/>
<br/>Sam: Mommy?
<br/>
<br/>Man1: what are you doing here?
<br/>
<br/>Man2: I donâ€™t think you are supposed to be here
<br/>
<br/>Man3: what room did you come out of?
<br/>
<br/>The pick him up and carry him back through the door.
<br/>
<br/>Man1: get the door
<br/>
<br/>Man3: how did he get past security?
<br/>
<br/>Man1: hey, watch the door
<br/>
<br/>The coast is clear so Benny continues until he find Joonâ€™s room.
<br/>
<br/>Benny: Joon, look, I know you want to be left alone but you do not belong in here. Not how would you like to try living in youâ€™re own apartment?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: an apartment?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah! Thereâ€™s an apartment available in Ruthieâ€™s building
<br/>
<br/>Joon: youâ€™d let me live in an apartment?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: thatâ€™s up to you. Iâ€™m through making those decisions for you. Listen Iâ€¦ Iâ€™m sorry I was such a jerk. And about Sam. I was wrong, dead wrong.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I scared him away
<br/>
<br/>Benny: no you didnâ€™t. heâ€™s here
<br/>
<br/>Joon: he is not
<br/>
<br/>Benny: he is. He got me in here. Heâ€™s somewhere in the building.
<br/>
<br/>Joon: he is not. Youâ€™d never let me have him. God. Why do you hate me so much?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: I donâ€™t hate you
<br/>
<br/>Joon: you just need me to be sick
<br/>
<br/>The social worker enters the waiting room and goes over to the desk.
<br/>
<br/>SW: Juniper Pearlâ€™s chart please. Thank you
<br/>
<br/>Thomas sees the men carrying Sam away
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: hey wait! Wally! Wait! Wait! Wally put him down. Heâ€™s mine. Iâ€™ve been looking for him
<br/>
<br/>Man1: you sure?
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: yeah Iâ€™ll take care of him. Sam you cant be in here
<br/>
<br/>Sam: whereâ€™s Joonâ€™s room?
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: come on
<br/>
<br/>Sam: Iâ€™ve got to see her
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: come on, come on
<br/>
<br/>The social worker is walking down the hall to Joonâ€™s room and sees Benny
<br/>
<br/>SW: can you give me any reason why I shouldnâ€™t have you arrested?
<br/>
<br/>Sam and Thomas are outside
<br/>
<br/>Thomas points to Joonâ€™s room
<br/>
<br/>Thomas; thatâ€™s the one
<br/>
<br/>Sam: yeah
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: see?
<br/>
<br/>Sam: ok
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Sam, where are you going?
<br/>
<br/>In Joonâ€™s room
<br/>
<br/>SW: Benny, this is exactly what we were trying to avoid. By now Joon would be in a caring and controlled environment. Isnâ€™t it obvious that you two need some distance?
<br/>
<br/>Benny: what donâ€™t we ask Joon what she wants?
<br/>
<br/>Outside
<br/>
<br/>Sam is climbing up the building
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Sam what are you doing? Hey Sam come on! Get down right now!
<br/>
<br/>In Joonâ€™s room
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I donâ€™t know exactly what I want. I do knowâ€¦ that I am tired of everyone telling me what to do
<br/>
<br/><b> 
<br/></b>
<br/>Outside
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Sam come down. donâ€™t touch that
<br/>
<br/>Sam winds up the window cleaners hoist
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Sam leave that. Iâ€™m begging you.
<br/>
<br/>In Joonâ€™s room
<br/>
<br/>SW: Joon, we want whatâ€™s best for you
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I know that
<br/>
<br/>She sees Sam swinging across the window
<br/>
<br/>Joon: Iâ€¦
<br/>
<br/>Outside
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Sam come down now. Sam youâ€™re going to get in trouble
<br/>
<br/>Inside
<br/>
<br/>Joon: I think I want to try living in my own apartment
<br/>
<br/>Benny looks outside and sees Sam. The social worker looks outside but doesnâ€™t see anything
<br/>
<br/>SW: hmm, I donâ€™t know
<br/>
<br/>Outside
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: Sam stop swinging
<br/>
<br/>The line of the hoist starts to come loose
<br/>
<br/>Inside
<br/>
<br/>SW: but Iâ€™m willing to let you try. Iâ€™ll prepare the papers for her release
<br/>
<br/>Benny: thanks doctor Garvey
<br/>
<br/>Outside
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: come down Sam!
<br/>
<br/>The hoist breaks and Sam falls down
<br/>
<br/>Thomas: whoa! Whoa! Are you ok?
<br/>
<br/>Sam: ouch, ouch
<br/>
<br/>In the hospital
<br/>
<br/>Joon tries to say something but cant get the word out
<br/>
<br/>Benny: I know, me too. Iâ€™m going to go and check you out. Ok?
<br/>
<br/>Joon: ok
<br/>
<br/>Joon goes out and Sam is waiting for her in a wheel chair. He gets up and they hug
<br/>
<br/>At Joonâ€™s apartment
<br/>
<br/>Benny pulls up outside and Ruthie is sat on her porch. He hands her some white roses
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: havenâ€™t we tried this before
<br/>
<br/>Benny: yeah but my lifeâ€™s a lot less complicated now. Is Joon inside?
<br/>
<br/>Ruthie: yeah
<br/>
<br/>Benny: ok
<br/>
<br/>He looks in her room and sees Sam and Joon making grilled cheese with an iron. He leaves her some roses at her door.
