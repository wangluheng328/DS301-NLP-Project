Peter Martin and John Blane decide to take a holiday in a high tech amusement park, Westworld.
Here they get to play cowboys - saloon brawls, saloon girls and quick draws against the town's gunslinger - with lifelike robots.
All is well for the first few days but when the park's central computer malfunctions, the built-in safety features are turned off and the robots begin to attack the guests.
The gunslinger in particular seems indestructible and relentlessly pursues his prey.
