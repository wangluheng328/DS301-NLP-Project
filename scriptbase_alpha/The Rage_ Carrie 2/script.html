</b>

                         
                                   Written by 

                                  Rafael Moreu


                         

                         
<b>                                                      13 FEBRUARY 1998
</b>                         

                         
          "I wish that I could write you a melody so plain
          That would save you dear lady from going insane"
          Bob Dylan, Tombstone Blues                   

                         

                         

                         
<b>          BLACK
</b>
          MUSIC UP: Slow, sad, ethereal.
          Perhaps even eerie.

<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
          On a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without
          waves or ripples.

          A thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint.
          The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood.
          FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal...

<b>          INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving
          a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out.
          A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can,
          then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall:
          until it reaches &amp;pleated drape --
          -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the
          same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped.

<b>          A PUPPY,
</b>          a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit
          perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird.
          The dog looks over to...

<b>          A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
</b>          standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark
          haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the
          verge of tears.

          The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture
          frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral,
          forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame.

          Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel
          to the floor, extending around a modest living room.

          Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn,
          haggard- She hasn't slept in a while.

          The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as
          the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a
          little frightening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>
                         Mommy

          BARBARA hears nothing, says nothing, just wipes a paint drip.
          This is a very careful line.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Momma, come play with me. In my room.
          But her mother keeps painting across a door.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Right now, mommy, okay?
          BARBARA looks at her, or rather through her. And continues
          her task. RACHEL steps forward, tugs on her mom's

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          I got a idea, we could--
          -- and gets , , splat, right-in the face with the brush

<b>                         THE KITCHEN
</b>           A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor. RACHEL's tiny hand
           deliberately presses a button on it. The TOY responds with a
          wheep whe ep siren, then:

<b>                         AMBULANCE VOICE
</b>
<b>                         (CANNED; TINNY)
</b>          If you need help, dial nine one one.
          If you need help, dial nine one one.

<b>          A WALL-MOUNTED PHONE
</b>          RACHEL's HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1.
          BARBARA's still painting the wall in the background.

<b>          RACHEL (O.S.)
</b>          Hello? It's my mom. She's doing
          some... some wrong things. She's
          doing wrong things, so, and, you
          should come.

<b>          EXT. THE STREET - FROM ABOVE - NIGHT
</b>
          A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE
          Its dashing red lights
          CRUISER with its doors flung open.
          splash over the umbrella carrying NEIGHBORS, in pajamas and
          robes, watching...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          TWO E.M.S. WORKERS drag a struggling BARBARA across a lawn,
          her hands in plastic restraining cuffs.
          A wet RACHEL stands by a kneeling POLICE OFFICER holding a
          poncho over her head.

<b>                         POLICEMAN
</b>          Rachel? Rachel, are you okay?
          She keeps staring off, watching her mother being stuffed into
          the ambulance.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Momma!
          She starts towards her, but the OFFICER holds her back.

<b>                         POLICEMAN
</b>          Honey, she just has to go somewhere,
          to get some rest, so she'll feel
          better.
          As the AMBULANCE pulls away, RACHEL catches a glimpse of her
          mother in the rear windows, watching her.

<b>                         POLICEMAN
</b>          is your dad around? When's he get
          home from work?
          I don't have a dad.
          The POLICEMAN collects himself.

<b>                         POLICEMAN
</b>          Okay. Then we're going to take you
          someplace nice, with a family, a
          really nice family, till we get all
          this sorted out.

<b>                         (QUIETLY)
</b>          No.

<b>                         POLICMIAN
</b>
<b>                         WE'LL JUS
</b>
<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          She breaks free, races into.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.
</b>
<b>          INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
          Where she runs down the entrance hall. Behind her, outside,
          as the POLICEMAN runs toward the front door, it --
          SLAMS by itself, right in his face.
          FOLLOW RACHEL as she rushes through the living room and down
          a hall. Another door slams shut behind her.

<b>                         HER ROOM
</b>          She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her. To
          her left...
          A WINDOW crashes shut, startling her. Then, like a wave
          moving in a circle around her, another WINDOW bangs down, a
          DOOR slams shut, another WINDOW. Scared, RACHEL backs into

<b>                         A CLOSET
</b>          where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms.
          The CLOSET DOOR swings shut, sealing her off from the world.

<b>                         FROM ABOVE
</b>          In the dark, RACHEL is in a fetal position on the floor, dry
          eyed, in shock, curled around her puppy.
          There's the far-off sound of POUNDING on a door.

<b>                         DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>          NT. A DARKENED BEDROOM - DAWN
</b>          RACHEL, now 17, is curled in bed around WALTER, also now a
          far more senior dog. She's enmeshed in tangled white
          Small TATTOOS come into view -- A delicate angel with broken
          wings on her ankle. A small EGYPTIAN ANKH is etched on her
          shoulder blade.
          Wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant THORN BAND
          encircling a HEART, either protecting or imprisoning it.
          There's a knock on her bedroom door.

<b>          WOMAN (O.S.)
</b>          Rachel. c et up. You're gonna be late
          again.
          She rolls over, blinks awake. She's beautiful, with sensual
          lips framed by raven black hair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          joy.

<b>                         CUT TO

<b>           M. O N D A Y
</b>
<b>                          FADE INTO:
</b>
<b>          A PAN AROUND RACHEL'S ROOM
</b>          the usual teenage mess, clothes strewn everywhere. A POSTER
          of Jim Morrison reads: "No One Here Gets Out Alive."
          RACHEL stands before her dresser mirror, in a ratty bathrobe,
          putting on a small nose stud. She dons her daily armor --
          -- Slipping on multiple earrings.
          -- Applying Kohl around her eyes.
          -- Shrugging on a T-shirt with a photo of Sharon Tate
          captioned "Manson Sucks".
          -- Disheveling her long black hair.
          Scooping up WALTER, she kisses him, takes him to an open
          ground floor window.
          Sorry, Walt.
          And gently lowers him outside.

          It's not the home RACHEL lived in with BARBARA. This one is
          run down and in the section of town where people have cars in
          their yards they've abandoned tinkering with. The lawn is
          overgrown, there's broken glass on the street.

          The crammed eat-in-kitchen of the WALLACE house. EMILYN,
          40's, is ironing a waitress uniform on the counter. A groggy
          BOYD, 40's, enters, he's a trucker and looks like one. He
          goes straight for the refrigerator.
          BOYD and his wife EMILYN have taken in RACHEL as a foster kid
          to augment their income.

          Without waiting for a reply, she stands and gathers the bowl.
          (casually, a routine)
          And you should take that thing outta
          your nose. Don't you have enough
          holes in your head?

          beautiful in an eerie "Fall of the House of Usher" way.

</b>          The school mascot, a scrappy BULLDOG wearing a CROWN tilted
          at a rakish angle, is also drawn on the banner.
          FADE IN -- KNOTS of STUDENTS, like spectral figures.
          The two major school cliques are...
          on the front steps. Land of burnouts, step-kids, Metalheat s
          skateboard junkiei-and other lost souls.
          A STONER KID kicks his skateboard up and catches it. HIS
          BUDDY follows suit and misses, suffering the embarrassment of
          watching his board shoot down the steps whose metal rail

</b>          a courtyard with concrete tables where the school's royalty
          hold court. The cleancut "Patio People" are the jocks,
          student government types and others who have no idea what it
          is to be alone on a Saturday night.
          At the patio is a pack of muscular jocks in football letter
          jackets reading "Bulldogs", some sport caps marked "Dawgs:
          There's JESSE RYAN, handsome, longish hair, a young Eddie

          MARK BING, good looking, with a body like a fist.
          Behind them, arrayed around a concrete table are the large,
          doltish BRAD, hearty rich boy CHUCK, and the arrogant ERIC.
          CHUCKS looks over a plain looking GIRL on the Patio.

          A group of PATIO GIRLS sit at another table. Among them is
          MONICA, a stunning brunette, AMY a cute redhead and TRACY, an
          icy BLONDE who could spend all day checking her makeup.
          JESSE looks over. TRACY graces him with a smile and turns
          away. MARK leans in to JESSE.

          only way to get up is to wake her.
          So you gnaw your arm off instead.
          BRAD snorts a laugh.
          A goatee'd ENGLISH TEACHER nods to both camps as he passes.

<b>                         ENGLISH TEACHER

          A BELL goes off and the STUDENTS start filing into school.
          LISA waves the tips of her fingers to RACHEL, bye-bye.
          RACHEL looks over, catches a glimpse of JESSE, across the
          line of demarcation. For a piece of a second it seems as if
          he's looking back. She drops her head, walks away.

          eventually separated by death.

<b>                         JESSE

          below the table.

          He hands MARK the cup under the table and takes JESSE's cup.
          The PLAYERS smile at each other.

</b>          Absolutely. We're gonna crush Carlin
          Friday and make it seven years in a'row.

          A CRASH of metal as the lock is cut off Lisa Parker's locker
          with a pair of boltcutters held by SHERIFF KELTON, 30"s, a
          former Bulldog himself. The PRINCIPAL and SUE stand nearby.
          Opening the locker, KELTON finds LISA's NOTE. As he pulls it
          out, something falls from the note.

</b>
          Photos glide out of the developing machine. RACHEL pulls the
          pictures out, stops dead when she sees they're shots of LISA;
          With RACHEL, laughing. LISA with Rachel's dog.
          RACHEL's finger tenderly slides along LISA's face.
          She's shocked to find a picture of --
          LISA AND ERIC -- his arm draped around her in the backseat of
          a car. LISA's holding the camera at arm's length.
          JESSE's CAR pulls up outside. MARK sits beside him.

</b>          Sorry, didn't scare you, did I?
          RACHEL turns, slides LISA's PICTURES into an envelope. MARK
          checks her out, likes what.he sees, nudges JESSE.

<b>                         JESSE

          She nods, surprised he knows she's alive, much less knows her
          name.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          I'm Jesse.

</b>          Uh-huh. The true romantic.
          MARK leans over JESSE, his voice low now, intimate.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          So, Rachel, there were some pictures
          Lisa took. They have, what you might
          call sentimental value.
          She just stares at him. MARK pulls a twenty from his wallet.

</b>          Well it's not like she's gonna be
          picking them up, is it?
          RACHEL turns away. JESSE glares at MARK.

<b>                         JESSE

          off and, you know, take you for a ride?
          JESSE cocks an ear for her reply, but she doesn't answer.

</b>          C'mon, I don't bite... not unless you
          want me to.

</b>          Cause I'm a dyke.
          JESSE laughs. MARK doesn't. He knows she's putting him on
          and bores holes into her.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Let's go, Jess.
          The car pulls away, MARK glances in the REARVIEW MIRROR at
          RACHEL, framed like a target.

          Seconds later, a SHERIFF'S CRUISER pulls up.

          A star-filled sky hangs above the town's makeout spot, a hill
          overlooking Bergen. MARK and CHUCK stand outside a car
          sipping beers. JESSE's CAR, a blue G.T.Â©, is several yards
          away, with foggy windows.

</b>          I'm sorry, it's not you. its me.

</b>          It's okay. You should save your
          energy for the game anyway.
          JESSE opens the door, stands outside, tucking in his shirt.
          MARK and CHUCK make a crude humping gesture to JESSE. He
          hesitates, then nods at them.
          MARK pulls out the SCOREBOARD and enters JESSE's name with
          TRACY's and the number 10.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          He shoots, he scores.
          ON TRACY -- in the front seat, using the rearview to adjust
          her makeup, pleased with what she sees. She glances at JESSE
          as he re-enters on the driver's side.

<b>                         TRACY
</b>          What are you thinking about?

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          Nobody.

<b>                         TRACY
</b>          Why? She wasn't anybody.

          She leans over and nibbles on JESSE's ear. He pulls away,
          forces a smile and turns the ignition.

          SMASH as a dish drops onto the floor. RACHEL is at the sink,
          doing dishes. She crouches to retrieve the broken plate.
          WE PAN along the chorus line of dishes, glasses, and
          silverware on the counter as the metronome of the sink
          faucet's DRIP, DRIP, DRIP and the micro-explosions of the
          soap bubbles in the water intensify to deafening levels.
          TIGHT ON a SPOON atop the counter which suddenly begins
          dancing. Pots and pans on a hanging rack start rattling.
          A RUMBLE as more dishes and utensils vibrate and rattle, as
          if by a paranormal force.
          But as RACHEL casually straightens up and looks out the

          There's the low BLEAT of a TRUCK'S HORN and then...
          The high, piercing SQUEAL of a wounded animal.

          The bed of a speeding PICK-UP TRUCK is jammed with kneeling
          TEENAGE BOYS wearing children's Halloween masks. They're
          screaming bloody murder as they fire RAW EGGS at...
          The BERGEN STUDENTS gathered at the entrance.
          The PICK-UP speeds off as STUDENTS recover, straightening up
          from their ducking positions. MARK and his cohorts go
          running after the truck.

          ON RACHEL and JESSE as she tells him what happened last
          night. He gets more and more agitated.
          TRACY is wearing her glasses as she and MONICA watch JESSE

          Twenty-four, twenty-six, hut, hut,
          hut.
          He drops back to pass the NOTEBOOK.

<b>                         CHUCK
</b>          Go long, Bradzilla.
          MARK laughs as BRAD circles around RACHEL, twists between
          other dancers. CHUCK tosses the NOTEBOOK over RACHEL and
          BRAD leaps up to catch it.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Post-pattern, Mark!
          Ducking around DANCERS, MARK raises his hands for the pass.
          KIDS start to notice their antics and start laughing.
          BRAD passes the book over to MARK who catches it, mimes
          spiking it for a touchdown and does a silly victory dance.
          MONICA laughs and turns to RACHEL, who laughs, even though
          she still looks a bit befuddled.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Rachel, catch!
          He throws the NOTEBOOK through the air, where it tumbles end
          over end for a few slow beats, then is caught by her.

<b>          BEHIND RACHEL --
</b>           THE TV SET -- keeps playing football highlights, but suddenly
          there's an almost subliminal --
          FLASH of TWO INTERTWINED BODIES.
          RACHEL holds the NOTEBOOK, unsure of what to do with it. The
          boys are a little out of breath, but still grinning and
          dancing.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Open it. Go 'head, read off the

</b>          Start with Eric.

<b>                         CHUCK
</b>          Yeah, start with poor Eric.
          She opens the book, looks at the pages with a quizzical
          expression. She sees the Bulldog names across the top of the
          page with lists of girls beneath each one. Every girl has a
          number next to her with a total at the bottom.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          What's Eric's score?

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Twenty-two?
          RACHEL stops dancing as she spots LISA PARKER's name at the
          bottom of ERIC's column with the number four next to it.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          What's up, Rach? You know someone on

          Lisa.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Oh, yeah, Lisa, forgot about her.

<b>                         CHUCK
</b>          How many points was she?

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Four. But maybe he shoulda lost
          those when she offed herself.

          RACHEL looks down JESSES's column sees-her name with thirty
          points next to it, then, above hers, sees TRACY with ten.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          No, more than that, remember, we
          thought Rach was a dyke. He got
          extra-points for the conversion.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          points?
          Try thirty.
          RACHEL stares at the book, stunned, trying to make sense of
          it.

<b>                         MONICA
</b>          Look at her face, this is priceless.
          At the front door, JESSE walks in, TRACY behind him. He
          looks around, hasn't seen what's going on yet. ERIC
          intercepts him, turning JESSE away from the TV.

<b>                         ERIC
</b>          Hey, man, what did the scout say?
          Behind Rte...
          THE TV SET -- between shots of players grunting, tackling
          and smashing into each other, longer and longer segments
          appear of...

<b>          A COUPLE MAKING LOVE --
</b>          from the waist up, with thick scan lines that almost make it
          look surreal. It's obvious that the girl is RACHEL, and the
          boy is JESSE.
          DANCING KIDS notice what's on the TV and start to point and
          laugh at the set. RACHEL is completely unaware of what's
          going on behind her.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Lookie, lookie, Rachel.
          RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her,
          then laughing at her. She turns and sees...
          The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV.
          Her face goes slack with horror.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Oh, God
          MARK leans in to RACHEL, who hasn't noticed JESSE.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Jess was disappointed with the picture
          quality, but I told him it was better
          than Pam and Tommy Lee's tape.

<b>                         CK

</b>          Hey, Jesse! Over here!
          JESSE looks over and his eyes meet RACHEL's, but she just
          stares back, horrified. Then he sees the TV set behind her

<b>                         JESSE
</b>          What...
          JESSE pushes his way through the crowd, trying to get to
          RACHEL. TRACY throws an arm around him, kisses his neck.

<b>                         TRACY
</b>          He told me he was thinking of me
          when he fucked you.

</b>          Rachel...
          He tries to shrug off TRACY, but ERIC and CHUCK grab his arms
          and pull him back into the crowd.

<b>                         JESSE

          MARK pushes RACHEL towards BRAD.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Rachel! Rachel!
          She tries to get away, but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who
          shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting.
          Rachel!

<b>                         MONICA
</b>          Rachel!
          Rachel!
          Drowning out JESSE's cries.
          RACHEL's P.Q.V. -- spinning around. A NIGHTMARISH GALLERY of
          dancing, jostling torsos, TWISTED FACES and LAUGHING MOUTHS,
          smirking and pointing at her.

<b>                         INTERCUT WITH:

          chanting and images crescendo with...
          BRAD grabbing RACHEL's bare arm below her HEART-THORN TATTOO
          forcing her to face the TV screen.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Hey, is that a zit on your ass?
          RACHEL has tears streaming down her face for the first time
          since she was four years old.
          She bows her head.

</b>
<b>          A LAUGHING BRAD
</b>          glances down at RACHEL's arm.
          The THORN VINE around the HEART TATTOO looks bigger, edging
          up her arm.
          He looks away, shares a laugh with MARK, looks back and...

<b>          THE HEART TATTOO
</b>          on RACHEL's upper arm is growing, etched from within, the
          thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm.

<b>                         BRAD
</b>          Holy shit.
          He releases her.
          RACHEL raises her head, eyes glowing with pain and rage, her
          broken heart turned to stone.,
          The delicate THORN VINE has grown across her chin, cheekbone
          and forehead, swirling around to end on her other cheek.
          A stunned BRAD backs away from her.
          JESSE breaks free of ERIC's grip, slugs CHUCK and pushes his
          way towards RACHEL.
          Her HEART POUNDS at an alarming rate as she slowly turns and
          sees JESSE coming at her, his arms out to take her in his
          embrace.

<b>                         A KNIFE
</b>          on the bar dances and rattles, then...
          A WHIP PAN finds...
          JESSE, as his back arches in pain and he screams. The KNIFE
          embedded in his open palm, nailing his hand to the wall.
          MARK and the other boys stare in shock.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          What the fuck?
          ON JESSE -- as he screams again.
          A CORKSCREW has pierced his other hand, at waist level. The
          SCREW spins around, burrowing into his flesh.

          bizarre sight.
          RACHEL straightens up and...
          The kitchen door CLOSES...
          The glass doors to the back yard slide SHUT...
          The front door SLAMS.

          The floor starts to shake like a small earthquake. All the
          PARTYGOERS go still, looking around at each other. The room
          is frozen, even though the music keeps pounding.
          MARK looks at RACHEL, her disheveled hair partially obscures
          her features, but her eyes are glowing.

<b>          THE GLASS WINDOWS

          A plate.
          The BEEFY BOY spins around, clutcning at a shard protruding
          from his neck, his carotid artery spewing blood like a lawn
          sprinkler.

          Reeling into the stereo, the BOY scatters CDs everywhere.
          On RACHEL, clothes spattered red, tears streaming down her

          TRACY straightens up, having been protected by MONICA, who`s
          screaming, her face a lacerated pulp with glass, shards
          sticking out of it like a pincushion.
          Surviving PARTYGOERS panic as they struggle to their feet and

          MUSIC CDs fly off a shelf and...
          Spin through the air at high velocity.
          One of the deadly frisbees buries itself in AMY's back,
          spinning her around. More CDs embed in her stomach, chest
          and throat.

          But RACHEL turns her head slightly and...
          A TELEKINETIC PULSE travels across the row of LIQUOR BOTTLES
          at the bar, exploding them one-by-one, spraying alcohol which
          douses SUE.
          A FLAMING LOG erupts from the fireplace...
          Striking the alcohol-drenched BAR, setting a blazing trail
          and lighting the curtains on fire, creating a wall of FLAMES
          before the windows.

<b>                         SUE

          drenched clothes catch flames... and she , A.

          In the eye of the storm is BARBARA, shaking her head in

          from behind. They take off in the other direction, TRACY

          through and into...

<b>          EXTâ€¢ THE BACK YARD - NIGHT
</b>          Where they almost stumble into the swimming pool.
          Toting their rifles, MARK, ERIC and TRACY turn to find
          RACHEL, at a gunfighter's distance, coming towards them.
          TRACY and BRAD cock their weapons and bring them to their
          shoulders. TRACY slips on her glasses.

<b>                         MARK
</b>          Wait till she's closer.
          TRACY tightens her finger on the trigger.
          RACHEL's eyes narrow and...
          TRACY's glasses shatter into her eyes, spewing blood
          milky fluid.
          Aaaaa...
          She staggers, fires her shotgun into ERIC's groin and he
          lands sitting next to the pool. A dying ERIC stares at his
          shredded lap, then falls over.
          MARK looks at his dead friend.
          Oh, shit.
          .recovers, and swings his aim back at RACHEL. But his
          rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty
          feet behind him.
          He makes eye-contact with a grim RACHEL advancing toward him,
          and hauls ass.
          RACHEL glances at a coiled GARDEN HOSE and it springs to
          life, slithering through the grass and across the concrete at
          high speed to wrap around MARK's ankle and trip him up.
          He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose
          twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python.

<b>                         HIS HAND
</b>          grasps for the rifle, but falls short as the hose pins his
          other arm to his side, then curls around his windpipe in a
          stranglehold.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          104.
</b>          His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees
          RACHEL standing over him.
          He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it.
          RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold,
          splashing into the pool.
          But she jolts on two...

<b>                         GUNSHOTS
</b>          RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt
          with his pinned hand and fired.
          She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the
          pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood.
          MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He
          gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's
          silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers.
          He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into
          the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a
          mechanical whirring, and turns.
          A POOL COVER starts to unfold.
          At that moment...

<b>          RACHEL'S BLOODY ARM
</b>          bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her
          forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool.

<b>                         UNDERWATER --
</b>          As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she
          holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting
          out the light from above.
          MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but
          the POOL COVER blocks his escape.
          He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as
          his feet kick to keep him afloat.

<b>          ON THE SURFACE --
</b>          The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the
          water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg,
          slides, then clutches at the edge of the pool. His fingers
          slip under as the cover completely shuts.

</b>          M RX's head bulges the POOL COVER, then his hands punch
          feebly at it a few times. Then... nothing.

<b>          BARBARA (O.S.)
</b>          Rachel!
          A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping
          out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA.
          RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared
          little girl reaching for her mother.

<b>                         RACHEL

          but it's a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, pristine, without tattoos.
          BARBARA blinks and her P.O.V. is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL,
          reaching for her.
          Mama, please.
          BARBARA blinks and it's now...
          The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, covered in blood and tattoos.
          She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror.

<b>                         BARBARA

          But her mother disappears into the shadows.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Please, I don't have... anyone.
          She rolls onto her back, looks up at the STARRY NIGHT.

<b>                         RACHEL
</b>          Please, God, let me die...
          And she tightly shuts her eyes.

          The fire is spreading, licking its way across the burning
          SCOREBOARD NOTEBOOK, and along the floor toward...
          JESSE, in pain, still pinned to the wall. He raises his head
          and starts in fear as...
          o the center of the room, facing him.
          He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her
          gaze to...

          intimate moment at the cabin, with a sleeping RACHEL laying

          JESSE looks at RACHEL clinging to him, asleep, peaceful. He
          gently runs his fingers across her brow.

<b>                         JESSE
</b>

          ON TV -- the moment of JESSE saying 'I love you" to her while
          she was asleep.

</b>          RACHEL falls to her knees, tears running down her face. She
          turns back to JESSE, amazed.
          A BLAZING CHUNK of ceiling falls near her.

<b>                         JESSE

          And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him.
          He falls to the floor, drags himself over... and takes RACHEL
          in his arms. He cradles her. She whispers and he bends over
          to hear. She whispers again...

<b>                         RACHEL

          JESSE tenderly kisses her lips.
          And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body
          Love.
          Her face is serene.
          JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the
          flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's
          nightmare.
          JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the
          back windows, but stumbles and goes down. Her eyes flutter
          open.

          Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve
          of his jacket catches flames. And he accepts his fate.
          RACHEL shuts her eyes, gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH...

          And a BODY is flung out the back window like a rag doll,
          clothes in flames.
          The BODY goes fifteen feet and falls onto the pool cover, its
          weight bowing the cover enough for water to rush over it.

          JESSE is slumped over, asleep on a desk layered in textbooks
          and a notebook. An all-night study session.
          His hair is shor., he's wearing a beard. His face is more
          mature, sadder. The beard largely hides some burn scars on
          one side of his face.
          Over the desk is a MIRROR and a "Fighting Irish" pennant.
          The only light comes from his desk lamp.
          He jerks awake with a spasm, glances at a digital clock
          glowing on his desk: 11:S$ A.M.

          The sad-eyed DOG whimpers'and,JESSE scratches him.
          In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING
          MIDNIGHT: One, two...
          As JESSE looks down and his eyes widen in surprise:
          Somehow, he's scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in
          front of him:
          kINg of HELL
          Or, if you only look at the capitalized letters, it reads:
          Around it, the same phrase is written over and over again:
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
          kINg of HELL kINg of HELL

          How did...
          Trails off as he stares at the page.
          The CLOCK BELL in the background is still CHIMING: give, six,

          resumes his cram session.
          On the floor, the DOG looks at the open French doors, then
          scurries under the bed.

          A LOUD SCREAM as JESSE jerks awake at his desk. His heart
          FATIM like it's about to explode from his mouth.
          He looks down at the paper in front of him. Filled only with
          his study notes.
          The dog, WALTER, is awake on the bed, blinking, having been

          He turns back to his reading, his heart BEATING WILDLY again.
          Glances up at the mirror. Nothing.
          His HEARTBEATS and the BELL CHIMES get increasingly LQ=
          as,.. .
          He reads, glances up at the mirror, shivers, and it isn't
          in the cold.

          Move, to ANOTHER ANGLE :
          Where his image is MULTIPLIED TO INFINITY in the two mirror!
          Fear is written on his face.
          And we know he'll be looking over his shoulder...
          Until the day he dies.
