Joe, the saxophone player, is Josephine in the all girls band that he joined with Jerry, the bass violin player, to be one step ahead of the mob after witnessing the 1929 St. Valentine's Day Massacre in Chicago.
After a train ride that sets a record for number of people in an upper berth, they are In Miami.
Joe decides to be the man of Sugar Kane's dreams and invites her out to a yacht he doesn't have.
But he can use Osgood Fielding's yacht if Jerry -- as Daphne -- will keep Osgood dancing.
The pace gets even giddier when the Chicago mob arrives in Miami for a convention.
