</b>               GRAHAM DALTON, twenty-nine, drives his '69 Cutlass while smoking 
               a cigarette. One could describe his appearance as punk/arty, 
               but neither would do him justice. He is a man of obvious 
               intelligence, and his face is amiable. There is only one key 
               on his keyring, and it is in the ignition.

                         Garbage. I started thinking about 
                         what happens to all the garbage. 
                         I mean, where do we put all of 
                         it, we have to run out of places 
                         to put it eventually, don't we? 
                         This happened to me before when 
                         that barge with all the garbage 
                         was stranded and nobody would take 
                         it? Remember that?

                         out the garbage, and he kept 
                         spilling things out of the 
                         container, and I started imagining 
                         a container that grew garbage, 
                         like it just kept filling up and

                         you'll see that the object of your

                         run around thinking about how happy 
                         they feel and how great things 
                         are? I mean, maybe they do, but 
                         I doubt those people are in 
                         therapy. Besides, being happy isn't 
                         all that great. My figure is always 
                         at its best when I'm depressed. 
                         The last time I was really happy 
                         I put on twenty-five pounds. I

</b>                         Did you know that if you shut 
                         someone up in a room, and the only 
                         clock he has reference to runs 
                         two hours slow for every 
                         twenty-four, that his body will 
                         eventually adjust to that schedule? 
                         Simply because the mind honestly 
                         perceives that twenty-six hours 
                         are twenty-four, the body follows.
                         And then there are sections of time. 
                         Your life can be broken down into 
                         the sections of time that formed 
                         your personality (if you have one). 
                         For instance, when I was twelve,
                         I had an eleven minute conversation 
                         with my father that to this day 
                         defines our relationship. Now, 
                         I'm not saying that everything 
                         happened in that specific section 
                         of time, but the events of my 
                         childhood involving my father led 
                         up to, and then were crystallized 
                         in, that eleven minutes.

                         appearance can affect people. Men
                         want to possess you, women wish
                         they looked like you. And those
                         that don't or can't resent you.
                         And the fact that you're a nice
                         person just makes it worse.

</b>                         No, I really can't. I find it
                         healthy never to characterize
                         people I don't know or
                         conversations I haven't heard.
                         I don't know what you and your
                         sister discussed about me or
                         anything else. Last time I saw
                         Ann she left here very...confused,
                         I would say. And upset.

                         him take one, too. He said okay,
                         and then we went into the woods
                         behind our house. I got this
                         feeling he was chickening out
                         because he kept saying, "Ladies
                         first!" So I pulled down my
                         underpants and urinated, and he
                         ran away before I even finished.

                         would be, and the skin was softer
                         than it looked. It's weird.
                         Thinking about it now, the organ
                         itself seemed like a separate
                         thing, a separate entity to me.
                         I mean, after he pulled it out
                         and I could look at it and touch
                         it, I completely forgot that there
                         was a guy attached to it. I
                         remember literally being startled
                         when the guy spoke to me.

</b>               Cynthia picking up her jacket from beside the bed after having
               sex with John. The earring slips out of the pocket and bounces
               under the edge of the bed.

               it with the bottom of a water glass, trying to smash it to
               pieces. She soon realizes the futility of trying to break a
               diamond.
<b>

               dressed in John's clothing, she frantically rips the shirt and
               pants from her body as though the material were burning her
               skin. Popped buttons skid across the floor.

               Ann stands against the wall of the hallway, her head down, her
               breathing deliberate. Concerned, Graham slowly begins to lead
               her inside. Impulsively, she hugs him tightly.

</b>               Unaccustomed to physical contact, Graham's hands hang awkwardly
               at his side. Ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and sits
               down. Graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a glass of
               water. He gives it to her and sits in the chair opposite. Ann
               holds the glass in her hand, staring at it.

                         lies, let's talk about lies, Ann.
                         Let's talk about lying to yourself.
                         You haven't been able to sleep
                         with your husband because you're
                         no longer in love with him, and
                         maybe you never were. You haven't
                         been honest with yourself in longer
                         than you can remember.

                         Yeah, you're right. But I never
                         claimed to know everything like 
                         you, and have all these little
                         theories. I'm still learning, I
                         know that. But I don't feel like
                         I've wasted time. If I had to go
                         through my marriage to get to where

</b>               Once again she brings Graham's hand to her face. She moves his
               hand to her neck and throat, painting her skin with his fingers.
<b>          
</b>               Soon each hand is exploring the other. Fingers search for and
               find hidden areas.

</b>               Ann stands.
<b>          
</b>               Their hands remain together, and Graham's eyes remain closed.
               Ann moves onto the couch with Graham.
<b>          
</b>               She gently lowers herself into a sitting position on his waist.

</b>               She slowly moves both of her hands onto Graham's chest. They
               move forward and back, like a lazy tide.

               to his nose.

</b>               Graham's hands make their way up Ann's back until they have

</b>               The kisses become more meaningful, and the touching becomes
               more passionate.

                         trouble, even. So you can stop
                         making her into a saint. She was
                         good in bed and she could keep
                         a secret. And that's about all
                         I can say about her.

</b>               John drops Graham's keys to the floor and leaves. Graham stands,
               fighting back tears, and walks into his apartment.

</b>               He pulls Ann's tape from the videotape player.
<b>          
</b>               He reaches inside the cassette cartridge and pulls the videotape
               itself out, ruining it forever. He does the same to every other
               tape in both the boxes. Calmly. Deliberately. Methodically.
<b>          
</b>               He walks over to the camera/recorder, trailing a mound of
               videotape behind him. He breaks the lens off the camera body,
               and smashes the inner workings against the edge of the table.
               He then drops the damaged unit into the pile of destroyed tape,
               where it disappears.

                         alone, what's so bad about that?
                         It's not like I've decided to live
                         a life of crime, right?
                         It's just how I feel, you can't
                         help the way you feel, you just
                         have to be honest about it.

               wordlessly moves into the room, her movements like a slow
               breeze, her expression calm.
<b>          
</b>               Graham watches her go by.
<b>

<b>          
</b>               Graham moves toward her slowly. Sensing him behind her, her
               breathing becomes deep.
<b>          
</b>               Graham slowly enfolds her in his arms, his face against her
