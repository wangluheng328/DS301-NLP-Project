Howard Beale (Peter Finch), the longtime anchor of the Union Broadcasting System's UBS Evening News, learns from the news division president, Max Schumacher (William Holden), that he has just two more weeks on the air because of declining ratings.
The two old friends get roaring drunk and lament the state of their industry.
The following night, Beale announces on live television that he will commit suicide on next Tuesday's broadcast.
[3] UBS fires him after this incident, but Schumacher intervenes so that Beale can have a dignified farewell.
Beale promises he will apologize for his outburst, but once on the air, he launches back into a rant claiming that life is "bullshit".
Beale's outburst causes the newscast's ratings to spike, and much to Schumacher's dismay, the upper echelons of UBS decide to exploit Beale's antics rather than pull him off the air.
In one impassioned diatribe, Beale galvanizes the nation, persuading his viewers to shout out of their windows "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"
