<b>     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS

</b>



<b>     FADE IN:
</b>
     All we can see is black filling the screen...  Black on
     black...

<b>     INT. A JEEP, LEBANON - DAY
</b>
     And we're in a speeding SOVIET JEEP...  Two men in front,
     shouldering assault rifles.  HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS...  And there
     are three MEN in the back.  A middle-aged Man wearing a tired
     suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on.  And on either
     side of him, two Men, blindfolded.  The man on one side is in
     his forties, hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled
     black-leather jacket...  A stocky man, with the edge of a
     J.D. Salinger character, he's seen everything at least once.
     But even he has lost some of his self-confidence, here,
     turning his head, sensing the wind, a blast of Arabic music
     that disappears behind him...  He's LOWELL BERGMAN.  On the
     other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a
     voltmeter around his neck, NORMAN.

<b>     EXT. THE BEQA'A VALLEY, BAALBEK, LEBANON - DAY
</b>
     The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese
     village.  It's shadowed by a Jeep in front, and in back, each
     carrying personnel armed with AK's and a few RPG's...  And in
     the third Jeep are two blindfolded, not very threatening
     Lebanese soldiers.  And as the speeding convoy passes a
     captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with
     Arabic graffiti, looking down on them from huge murals are
     the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and a Hezbollah
     religious leader, the Sheikh Fadlallah...  And, suddenly the
     convoy skids to a stop...  And blindfolded Lowell and Norman
     are roughly taken out, and pushed, stumbling, through the
     cloud of dust without sight...  The lanky cameraman is
     stopped, told to wait, while Lowell is pushed past armed men
     guarding a small stone house, and inside...

<b>     INT. A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY
</b>
     A round-faced Man in his mid-forties, with large-framed
     glasses, black hair and a grey-black beard, wearing a
     dullbend, a turban, sits informally at a kitchen table...
     It's the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from
     walls.  A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous
     purple armchair in a corner.  A torn poster of the Seychelles
     is on one wall.  Another Gunman stands by a window.  Lowell
     is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table...

<b>                         THE SHEIKH
</b>               Coffee?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Yeah...  Thank you.

<b>                         THE SHEIKH
</b>               How have you liked your stay?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (droll)
               What I've <u>seen</u>...I've liked.

     The Sheikh smiles.  And the smile passes as quickly as it
     came.  A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse
     is put down.

<b>                         THE SHEIKH
</b>               Please to explain, why I should agree to
               interview...with pro-Zionist American
               media?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Because I think Hezbollah is trying to
               broaden into a political party right now.
               So you care about what you're thought of
               in America.  And in America, at this
               moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a
               face.
                   (confident)
               That's why.

     And we've first realized this man is not a hostage; he's come
     here voluntarily.

<b>                         THE SHEIKH
</b>               Perhaps you <u>prove</u> journalism <u>objectivity</u>
               and I see the questions first.  Then I
               decide if I grant the interview.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (blunt)
               No.  We don't do that.
                   (beat)
               You've seen "60 Minutes" and Mike
               Wallace.  So you know our reputation for
               integrity and objectivity.  You also know
               we are the highest-rated, most-respected,
               TV-magazine news show in America.

     The Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him, studying
     him.  And Lowell "closes":

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               So.  Mr. Wallace.  Should he get on a
               plane or not?

     The Sheikh thinks it over and then...

<b>                         THE SHEIKH
</b>               Tell him I will see him day after
               tomorrow.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               That's good.  That works.
                   (after a beat)
               Uh, you know, I want to ask you
               something...I know it sounds odd...but...

     It's quiet...too quiet...

<b>                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
</b>               Hello, Sheikh...?
                   (no answer)
               Hello, Sheikh...?

     Silence.  He hesitates, starts to lift his blindfold...  He
     lifts it.  And he sees the Sheikh, and his gunmen, are gone.
     The house empty.  Only his Cameraman, the lanky man, left
     there, standing by the door still in his blindfold...

<b>                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
</b>               Norman.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               What?  What?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Take your blindfold off.

     The lanky man does and we see the cameraman is Asian-
     American.

<b>                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
</b>                   (sarcastic)
               Welcome to the world.

     Norman gives Lowell an ironic look and tests the local
     current at an electrical outlet.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               Fluctuating all over the place.  Anywhere
               we shoot, here, it's gonna be portable
               gennies and we'll run cable...

     Lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding
     height.  Baalbek and the Beqa'a Valley below gold-domed
     mosques.  A moment of triumph.  He dials his cell phone...

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
</b>               Hello?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (into phone)
               Mike, it's me.  We're on...

<b>     AND WE HEAR PEOPLE LAUGHING AND ENCOURAGING "GO AHEAD...
</b><b>     OPEN IT..."
</b>
<b>     INT. A LABORATORY, BROWN &amp; WILLIAMSON, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY
</b><b>     - DAY
</b>
     We're in a SCIENCE LABORATORY...  OUT OF FOCUS LAB
     TECHNICIANS, in white lab coats, celebrating a heavyset Black
     woman's birthday...  Half her presents are opened.  Balloons,
     incongruous, floating above the lab...  And there's a sense
     that somebody is watching...  And from the waist up, a
     disembodied figure comes into FOCUS behind a glass partition,
     as if quarantined, isolated, an expressionless MAN in his
     late forties, watching them...

<b>     INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
     The office soundproofed, he watches the people laughing,
     their lips moving.  His hair not yet settled on grey, his
     face is changing, always interesting.  Born in the Bronx,
     educated in Upstate New York, he retains little of the accent
     and much of the directness.  He's JEFFREY WIGAND.  He turns
     to resume gathering things from his desk...some technical
     books, a medical text on asthma...putting them in his
     briefcase.  And as he leaves the office, the silent party
     like a bizarre mime behind him...

<b>     INT. LOBBY, BROWN &amp; WILLIAMSON BUILDING - DAY
</b>
     Briefcase in hand, Jeffrey appears from the elevator from
     ABOVE, from WIDE and in FRONT, his eyes, frozen pools...  And
     like a bad dream, a broad-shouldered Man, leaning against the
     wall near the reception island in a suit he's not comfortable
     in, wearing an earphone, saying something into a lapel
     microphone after Jeffrey's passed.

<b>     INT. WIGAND'S CAR, LOUSIVILLE - DAY
</b>
     Light mottled through trees reflects off the car window...
     Jeffrey's face goes in and out of the tunnel of light and
     shadow...down this tasteful, suburban Louisville street of
     neat houses and manicured lawns...  He pulls into driveway
     behind a 3 series BMW.  It's a grey French provincial
     replica...

<b>     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY
</b>
     Jeffrey comes in and a young Girl, six, is watching
     television in the den...BARBARA.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Hi, honey.

<b>                         BARBARA
</b>               Hi, Daddy.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               What's new?

<b>                         BARBARA
</b>               Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Yeah?  What for?

<b>                         BARBARA
</b>               For reading.

     He pours himself a drink at a wet bar.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               That's great...  Little early for
               cartoons, isn't it?

<b>                         BARBARA
</b>               Okay.

     Dutiful, she shuts off the TV, going upstairs.

                         BARBARA (cont'd)
               Deborah?  Debbie?

     He looks outside.  A Woman is sitting on the back porch
     drinking wine, reading a paperback book, drinking wine.
     There's something like a Hockney painting about her against
     the manicured lawns.  Right now the Woman comes in.  She's
     pretty, tall, languid, reserved, somebody it would be nice to
     wear on your arm.  LIANE WIGAND.  She has an odd delay
     between a thought and her speech...

<b>                         LIANE
</b>               Oh, I didn't know you were home...  It's
               early...  Isn't it?

     He doesn't say anything...

<b>                         LIANE (CONT'D)
</b>               Gotta take Debbie to ballet...

     And it all feels suburban, familiar.  Suddenly there's a
     shout...

<b>                         BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER)
</b>               Mommy!

     Jeffrey goes quickly up the stairs into...

<b>     INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE - DEBORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     And a little girl, eight, sitting on the floor in a ballet
     leotard, her head back, wheezing, her neck muscles
     contracting and bulging, her face pale, lips white, and her
     eyes filled with fear as rapid, shallow breathing induces a
     sense of suffocation.  DEBORAH WIGAND is having a severe
     asthmatic attack...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Sweetheart, c'mon.  C'mon.

<b>                         BARBARA
</b>               She was playing with my Pooh doll
               again...

     Jeffrey sits her on the side of her bed next to which is a
     Nebulizer, an air compressor to deliver medication via a tube
     into a circular mouthpiece.

     The compressor whirs.  Deborah breathes in the medication.
     Jeffrey brushes the hair back from her face and wipes
     perspiration from her forehead as...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Slow down.  Slow down.  Slow down.
               Breathe deep.  Breathe deep.  Slow down,
               honey.  Slow down.  Slow down.

     Liane rushes in with rolled-up towels, kneels in front of
     Deborah, smiling to mask anxiety, and goes into the bathroom
     with the towels and turns on full blast the bathtub's hot
     water.  We don't know why yet...

     Deborah's chest heaves.  She's scared.  Jeffrey gets in front
     of her and talks to her to arrest her attention.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               Here we go.  Deep breaths, deep breaths.

<b>                         BARBARA
</b>               She was playing with the Pooh doll.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Pooh's dusty, sweetheart...he's dusty,
               and you breathed him in, okay?  So what's
               - what's happening to you now is... cells
               called mast cells told your lungs "don't
               breathe any more of that dust in."
                   (beat)
               ...and the airways in your lungs are like
               branches.  And when the branches close
               up, you get an asthmatic attack.  And, we
               give you medicine, and you get better.
               Huh?  Okay?  You're better already,
               aren't you?

     And the medication's taking effect and she's calmer.

     Liane, hands clutched in her lap, smiles at Deborah.  Now she
     takes Deborah's hand and exchanges a look with Jeffrey.
     Jeffrey's a good father, a natural caregiver.

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               Okay, baby?

<b>     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - EVENING

     She opens Jeffrey's car looking in the front seat at the cup

               The payments on this house?

     He looks at her.  There's an unspoken moment when it seems
     he's desperate for her to ask how he's feeling...  But she
     doesn't and now there's a wall up and the moment passes...

     She's stunned.  He leaves.  And as Liane's completely still,
     her accessories seeming literally to weigh her down, she
     wants to ask how <u>he</u> is, how he must be feeling, and she turns
     into CAMERA towards him to do that.  But he's driven off down
     the street.

<b>     INT. ANOTHER HOUSE IN BAALBEK - DAY
</b>
     The Sheikh, wearing a fresh white robe and skull cap, comes
     into the room...

<b>                         THE SHEIKH
</b>               I am very pleased to receive you as my
               guest, Mr. Wallace.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               Thank you for having us...

     REVERSE:  Norman's camera crew is setting up.  MIKE WALLACE
     is there.  A dangerous combination of intelligence,
     arrogance, and celebrity, there's a kinetic quality about
     him.

     Wallace sits across from the Sheikh on a dais of patterned
     linoleum in incongruous armchairs against a wallpaper mural
     of a French formal garden.  A Sound Technician wires the
     Sheikh and Mike with microphones.  Norman says something to
     Lowell and then goes out.

<b>                         NORMAN
</b>               I think I've got a problem with the
               gennie.  I have to go outside.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (going outside)
               Norman...?

     Mike turns his chair to face and slides it closer to the
     Sheikh's chair.  The Head Bodyguard barks something in
     Arabic.  The Interpreter says something back in Arabic.  The
     Sheikh, absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview,
     ignores all of this.

<b>                         INTERPRETER
</b>               He says you must not sit so close.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               What?
                   (re:  Bodyguard)
               I can't conduct an interview from back
               there.

     The Bodyguard, bristling at Wallace's tone, barks more
     confrontational Arabic.

<b>                         INTERPRETER
</b>               You must move back your chair.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               Will you tell him that when I conduct an
               interview, I sit anywhere I damn please!

<b>                         INTERPRETER
</b>               There is no interview.

     As Mike leaps forward, moving inches from the Bodyguard's
     face with such sudden ferocity, even the Bodyguard flinches.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               You!  I'm talking to you!

     More armed men start to enter.

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               What the hell do you think I am?  A 78-
               year-old assassin?  You think I'm gonna
               karate him to death with this notepad?
                   (to Interpreter)
               Are you interpreting what I'm saying?

<b>                         INTERPRETER
</b>               Yes.

<b>                         LOWELL

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               Good, well ask him if Arabic is his
               second language.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (to Interpreter)
               Don't interpret that!
                   (to both)
               Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it!  Slow,
               <u>slow</u>!!
                   (to the Sheikh)
               Sheikh, do you mind...if you would just
               turn your chair a little bit to face Mr.
               Wallace?

     The Sheikh looks up from his notes, nods, fixes his chair,
     goes back to his notes...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Is that okay?

<b>                         INTERPRETER
</b>               Okay.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (Bodyguard assents; to Mike)
               Are you ready?  Or you want to keep
               fucking around and warm up some more...?

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               No.
                   (wry)
               ...that's got my heart started.

     They know each other well.  Lowell smiles.  Wallace sits
     down.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Alright, Todd, give me the three-button
               on Mike, please.  Okay.  We are rolling.
               Okay, Mike.

     They roll camera...  "60 Minutes"...  "Hezbollah"...

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>                   (charming)
               Sheikh Fadlallah, thank you so <u>much</u> for
               seeing us.
                   (changes)
               Are you a terrorist?

     The Sheikh didn't expect the Mike Wallace opening shot
     between the eyes.  He recovers...

<b>                         THE SHEIKH
</b>               Mr. Wallace, I...am a servant of God.

     That expression of incredulity...

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               A servant of God?  Really...

     Mike, tipping his glasses down while the hostile Gunmen,
     cradling weapons, watch him through the doorway...

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)

               contributed to the bombing of the U.S.
               Embassy.

     And they go out the gate, talking, walking off along the
     Berkeley street.  The box left waiting by the door.

               I can't...  I've got to fly to Boston
               tomorrow.

     Lowell comes with the box back to bed.  He's already
     unwrapped it.  Inside are stacks of papers...  He looks at
     the box cover.  No return address.  An anonymous sender; not
     unusual for him.  He casually looks through the papers.

     We see a MAN in his forties, eating a late lunch, getting
     paged in a crowded cafeteria.  An old 1930's WPA mural on the

     "Hello."

     Behind Lowell is a humming Berkeley street.  He gestures
     familiarly to a Server, who brings out his two take-out

     And she hangs up.  Lowell's motionless...  And his interest
     piqued, he sets down his cleaning.  He calls back...  The
     phone rings and rings...  A MACHINE picks it up...  Jeffrey
     Wigand's Voice:  "This is the Wigands'...  If you'd like to
     leave a message or send a fax, start now..."

<b>     INT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, JEFFREY'S OFFICE, LOUISVILLE - DAY

     He hangs up.  Jeffrey doesn't react, quietly working on his
     computer.

<b>     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - DAY
</b>
     Lowell's restless, waiting...  And not getting a call back,
     he tries another tact.  He writes a FAX, "Please call me
     at..."  He writes his number down.  He sends the Fax.  He's
     still.  It's quiet.  And not getting an answer he gets up,
     starting to leave the room.  And suddenly the fax machine
     RINGS...  He turns.  He reads a message emerging from the
     machine..."I can't talk to you..."  He's quiet.  He writes on
     a piece of paper..."Can't talk to me?"  "Won't talk to me?"
     "Don't want to talk to me...?"  As he faxes it back...

</b>
     Wigand reading the return fax from Lowell...

<b>     INT. LOWELL'S OFFICE, BERKELEY - DAY
</b>
     Lowell, waiting...  The fax machine rings again...  He reads
     Jeffrey's answer.  "Can't."  "Won't."  "Don't want to..."
     He's quiet, more than just interested, now.  There's
     something beyond intriguing here.  He turns.  He looks
     through a stack of phone books for something...a nationwide
     800 directory.  He looks through it and dials Wigand's phone
     number again...

               o'clock...

     Lowell clicks off.  And as Wigand sits at his computer,
     giving no indication what he might do...

<b>     INT. THE SEELBACH HOTEL LOBBY, LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - EARLY
</b><b>     EVENING
</b>
     An old hotel with faded carpets.  Lowell in the lobby reading
     a <i>New York Times</i>, waiting...  And instead of looking up every
     time somebody passes, he looks down at people's shoes.  A
     pair of black wing tips walking by...  A woman's high
     heels...  A pair of men's tasseled loafers.  A lace-up brown.
     A pair of tennis shoes.  A cordovan wing tip.  The pair of
     tasseled loafers walking by again...  And Lowell looks up...

     And the Man in the tasseled loafers, turns away...  It's
     Jeffrey Wigand in a suit and a tie with a Fortune 500,
     corporate-executive bearing...  Lowell crosses to the
     elevators.  Wigand looks around the lobby and follows Lowell
     in, and as the doors close...

     Brilliant late afternoon sunlight.  We PULL BACK to see
     Jeffrey, standing by a window, silently looking outside to
     the left...  Lowell, cool, waiting, hands in his pockets, in
     the middle of the large room...

               That's room service.  They usually knock
               first.
                   (calls)
               Come on in...  Over here, please.

     Room Service brings in a tray with coffee.  As Lowell signs
     the bill, the Room Service Waiter waiting, looks at Wigand...
     Their eyes meet...  The Waiter looks away.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               Thank you.

     And the Waiter leaves...

<b>                         WIGAND

     Lowell gives him his cup of coffee.

<b>                         WIGAND (CONT'D)

     Lowell smiles.

<b>                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
</b>               I know what I have to know.

</b>               Just so I know you know, when I talk to
               people in confidence, it stays that way.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (abruptly)
               How did a radical journalist from
               Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?

     Lowell looks at him, he does his homework...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               I still do the tough stories.  "60
               Minutes" reaches a lot of people.

     Wigand's quiet, measuring him.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (after a beat)
               Let me see the documents...

     Lowell gives him the box of papers...  Wigand sits down, the
     box on his lap, quietly looking through them...flips to a
     different heading, consults a chart...

<b>                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
</b>               ...this is a Fire-Safety Product Study

               I could very easily explain this to you
               in layman's terms, because it's from
               another company...

     He puts the papers down...

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               ...but that's as far as I go...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Far as you go where?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (a beat)
               This issue is a drop in the bucket.  I
               can talk to you about what's in here.
               But I can't talk to you about anything
               else.

     And Lowell knows something else is going on here...

<b>                         WIGAND (CONT'D)

               seriously.
                   (after a beat)
               Where do you work?

<b>                         WIGAND

</b>                   (fast)
               Did work.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (the bottom line)
               How much would I get paid?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               That, you have to discuss with CBS
               Business Affairs.  But, for something
               like this, I would say anywhere between
               10, 12 thousand.

     Wigand nods "Okay."

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Should I just take the documents now?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               If you want to do it.

     He turns to leave...  Lowell gets the door for him...  Wigand
     momentarily slows...

<b>                         WIGAND

               President.  Mr. Bergman...

     And he goes out the door...  Lowell's still.  Wigand's job
     title resonates.  Lowell turns to the window, casually
     looking into the early evening...and he comes face to face
     with what Wigand was staring at, The Brown &amp; Williamson
     Tobacco Company Headquarters Building, lit up right across
     the street...

     Meanwhile, it's static.  Still, frozen.  Jeffrey sits in the
     RECEPTION AREA of The Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Company
     headquarters.  Complimentary cigarettes are arranged on
     tables.  A dark quiet.  The hush of big business.  Standing
     in the background by a wall next to the banks of elevators,
     is an ever-present Man, another one, with an earphone and

               Sorry.  I'm accepting an award from the
               Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation.  It's
               going to kill the rest of my day.

     THOMAS SANDEFUR is absorbed in spreadsheets of regional sales
     figures.  Dark pouches are under his eyes.  He doesn't look
     up.  He doesn't look healthy.  We're in a luxurious office
     with a view of Louisville.  Jeffrey is waiting in a chair.
     Sandefur is Brown &amp; Williamson's CEO.  Two LAWYERS, their
     briefcases, like weapons, close at hand, sit on a couch.
     Their jackets are off.  They wear expensive shirts.

               So.  You had a chance to play golf?

     Surprisingly affable, Sandefur prides himself on his
     salesman's sunny manners.  He has a mellifluous Georgia
     accent...

               than anybody I've ever met.  It's spooky

               I knew that if I ever broke my promise

<b>                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
</b>               ...we worked together for, what was it,

               Okay.
                   (a beat, honest)
               I don't believe you can maintain
               corporate integrity without
               confidentiality agreements.  I was paid
               well for my work.  The health and welfare
               benefits are good.  The severance package
               is fair.  I have no intention of
               violating my confidentiality agreement
               and disclosing that which I said I
               wouldn't.

<b>                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
</b>               I appreciate all that, Jeff.  But, upon
               reflection...we've decided to expand our

     And there's a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room...

               "confidential."  Nobody will be able to
               say, "Well, hell's bells, Margaret, I
               didn't know that was a secret..."

               We'd like you to sign it.

     And he's acutely aware of the threat behind it...

               If we "arrive" at the conclusion you're
               acting in bad faith?  We would terminate,
               right now, payouts under your severance
               package.  You and your family's medical
               benefits.  And initiate litigation
               against you, Mr. Wigand.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               <u>Dr</u>. Wigand.

               <u>Dr</u>. Wigand...after you've examined the
               document, you will see it is in your own
               best interest and you'll sign it.

     Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney.  And we see on his
     face the true nature of this man.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               So, what you are saying is:  it isn't
               enough that you fired me.  For no good
               reason!  Now you question my integrity?
               On top of the humiliation of being fired?
               You threaten me?!  You threaten my
               family?!
                   (beat)
               It never crossed my mind not to honor my

               But I will tell you, Mr. Sandefur, and
               Brown &amp; Williamson, too...  Fuck me?
                   (a beat)
               Well, fuck you!!

     And with that he gets up, and leaves...  And it's quiet...

<b>                         A LAWYER

     And he slams down the phone.

<b>     INT. THE RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - DAY
</b>
     Lowell, holding the dead phone in his hand...

<b>     EXT. A GOLF DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT
</b>
     We see a brightly lit, golf driving range, empty, the wet
     grass under the lights vibrant, emerald green...  A caged
     cart, with one big yellow headlight, like some kind of
     strange insect, drives across the range, picking up golf
     balls.  And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls, driving one
     after another, after another...  His swing is powerful,
     angry, a lone golfer, trying to chill out.  He pauses, spent.
     Settling down, he exhales.  Then, he looks down the way...
     And he slows...  He sees in the far distance, spot-lit, one
     other lone golfer, a Stocky Man, incongruously in a suit and
     tie, watching him...  And the Man in the suit right then,
     with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a
     golf ball...  The ball slamming into the steel net.  And the
     lights SUDDENLY go out.  The range closing for the night.
     The "insect" comes to a stop.  And it's quiet, dark.  Jeffrey
     gathers up his clubs.  He crosses, his golf shoes, the metal
     cleats, clicking on the pavement, toward the PARKING LOT.
     And there's the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind
     him.  He turns.  And the stocky Man in the suit, carrying a
     golf bag walking some distance behind him, staring at him.
     Jeffrey comes to the parking lot.  It's empty.  Just
     Jeffrey's car, and despite all the empty spaces, another car,
     purposely or otherwise, parked right next to his.  He crosses
     to his car, getting in...

<b>     INT. WIGAND'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
     He drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind
     the wheel.  He turns.  And he sees the Man in the suit has
     gotten in the car next to his.  They look at each other.  The
     Man, in no hurry, lights a cigarette, relaxes.  It's
     malevolent as hell.  And Jeffrey, suddenly, grabbing a golf
     club, jumps out of his car...

<b>     EXT. THE PARKING LOT, DRIVING RANGE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT
</b>
     Golf club in hand at the driver side window...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (motioning with the club,
                    threatening)
               Stay away from me!  You stay away from
               me!

     The Man starts his car, and drives off nonplussed.  It's
     still.  And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty
     parking lot, not knowing what's threatening him, something
     real, something imaginary...

<b>     EXT. THE WIGAND HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - WIDE SHOT: WIGANDS'
</b><b>     HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
</b>
     A violent rain's falling.  And we see Jeffrey coming out of
     the house holding an umbrella over his little Girls.  They
     start towards the car.  There's the sound of a car door
     shutting.  Liane, carrying lunch boxes, comes after them...

<b>                         LIANE
</b>               Jeffrey, you forgot their lunches --

     She slows, seeing someone.  Jeffrey turns:  it's Lowell.
     He's surprised.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Mrs. Wigand, how do you do?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               I'm Lowell Bergman.  We spoke on the

     The Girls climb in the car.  Lowell crosses behind the Audi
     around the far side.

<b>                         LOWELL (CONT'D)

     Jeff closes the door on his daughters and joins Lowell around
     the far side of the car.

     It starts to rain harder.  They look at each other.  Jeffrey,
     without saying a word, gets in the Car.  He backs out.
     Lowell, left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain.
     Liane goes back into the house.  And Lowell starts back
     across the street to his car.  There's a sound.  He turns.
     Jeffrey's car, having gone around the corner, has come back
     and stopped in the street.

     They drive away.  Lowell, incongruously sitting in the back
     seat with Barbara.  Jeffrey and Deborah in the front seat.

     Jeff's car in the field, the giant Colgate-Palmolive clock

     empty lot.  Lowell's in the front seat.  And we get the

<b>                         LOWELL'S VOICE (OVER)
</b>               Just give me an example...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               For example.  James Burke, the CEO of

               that some lunatic had put poison in
               Tylenol bottles, he didn't <u>argue</u> with the
               FDA...  He didn't even <u>wait</u> for the FDA

               America.  Instantly.  And then he
               developed the safety cap...  Because,
               look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a
               great businessman, right?  But he's also
               a man of science.  He's not going to
               allow his company...to put on the
               shelf...a product that might hurt people.

               You come from corporate cultures where
               research, really, creative thinking,
               these are core values.  You go to
               tobacco...  Tobacco is a sales culture.
               Market and sell enormous volume.  Go to a
               lot of golf tournaments.  The hell with

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Nothing's wrong with that.  That's it;

               with that?

<b>                         WIGAND

<b>                         LOWELL (CONT'D)

               people for their welfare really <u>do</u> need
               to know...and you feel impelled to
               disclose it and violate your agreement in
               doing so, that's one thing.  On the other
               hand, if you want to honor this
               agreement, then that's simple.  You do
               so.  You say nothing.  You do nothing.
               There's only one guy who can figure that
               out for you.  And that's you.  All by
               yourself.

     Lowell's evenhanded...is it <u>too</u> evenhanded?  As Wigand
     contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet.  Then
     Wigand sees the time...

     Lowell nods.  Jeffrey starts the car.  The windshield wipers
     screech on a dry window.  Their eyes meet.  As they drive
     off...we HOLD on the Colgate-Palmolive Clock.

     The aftermath of a high school lunch.  Tables, covered with
     litter, as far as the eye can see.  And we see Jeffrey
     sitting with a formidable Black Woman in her mid-fifties, the
     High School Principal, CYNTHIA WATSON, drinking cups of
     coffee...

     mind.

<b>                         MRS. WATSON

     She nods, studying him.  They get up.

<b>     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY
</b>
     The house is nearly empty.  Liane, arms folded across her
     chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room.  Jeffrey
     comes down the stairs...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               That's it...

               That's where our babies were born...
               Debbie took her first steps, right
               there...in the grass.

     And they're quiet.

               Simpler...easier...more time.  More time

               imagine me coming home from some job
               feeling good at the end of the day?  This
               is gonna be better.  This is gonna be
               better.

     And instead of this downturn turning them against each other,
     it brings them closer together.  And as they stand in the
     empty house...

<b>     INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     We see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen.  Country-
     western music is playing on a radio.  And we see Liane busily
     putting things away in a cabinet.  And, then, stops and looks
     out the window.  She tightens a knob on a cabinet.  There's a
     moment of domestic peace for her as she sees...

<b>     EXT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, THE BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
     Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in
     the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small
     tomato trellises.  We see the house, now.  It's a small, one
     story.  Deborah sees her mom and waves.  It's an image from
     the 1950's post-war boom.  Liane waves back from behind the
     pane of glass...

<b>     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     Jeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him.
     His arm is draped over her, protectively.  There's a sound.
     He turns.  And he sees Barbara in her nightgown, standing in
     the doorway...

<b>                         WIGAND

<b>                         WIGAND

<b>                         BARBARA
</b>               I heard them.

<b>                         WIGAND

<b>                         BARBARA

     Fast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and
     trousers...

<b>     INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     Jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner
     from the furnace, where his "office" is now.  Unpacked boxes
     are on the floor.  He fumbles with the combination lock on a
     small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun.
     Barbara followed him.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?  Why don't you

               paper and draw me a picture, okay?  What
               are you gonna draw me, baby?  An animal,
               something like that?  You stay down here
               until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara?
               You stay down here.

     He keeps it hidden from Barbara.  He goes up the stairs.

<b>     EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     It's still.  He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark
     shrubs and small tree in the corner.

<b>     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     Meanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water
     heater comes on, scaring her.  She goes up the stairs to
     follow after her father...

<b>     EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     Meanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back
     corners.  Sudden rustling.  He spins, gun ready.  And the
     yellow eyes of a RACCOON stare at him.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (to himself)
               You almost got your damn head blown
               off...

     The raccoon defiantly bares its teeth.

     Jeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops...

     Meanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door...

     Jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped
     on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct,
     fresh, deep FOOTPRINTS...

<b>                         BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER)

     Wigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it...
     EXTREMELY CLOSE ON JEFFREY, as he covers, trying to keep from
     his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (reassuring her)
               It's just a raccoon, baby...nothing.

     He crosses to her, putting his arm, around her, walking her
     back inside...

<b>                         WIGAND (CONT'D)

     He locks the sliding glass door, takes a last look outside.

     upon her face and discover she's been up all along and her
     eyes are pressed shut, her hands over her ears...her reaction

               Nothing?!  My girls are crying, so fuck
               them!  I want to tape!  I'm done thinking

               I heard you.  But I got to arrange a
               legal defense first.  I got to get you to
               testify in court, get it on public

               Then hold it off the air until you got
               that.  But I want to go to New York.
               And I want to go on the record.  Right

<b>     INT. WIGAND'S HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT
</b>
     And two older, local FBI AGENTS #1 and #2 are sitting with
     Jeffrey in his living room...

<b>                         FBI AGENT #2
</b>               Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Yes, I'm afraid I did.

<b>                         FBI AGENT #1
</b>               We won't be able to lift usable prints.

<b>                         FBI AGENT #2
</b>               Do you own a gun, Mr. Wigand?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               A gun?  Yes.

<b>                         FBI AGENT #2
</b>               What caliber is your gun?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               What caliber is my gun?

<b>                         FBI AGENT #2
</b>               Yes, sir.  What caliber is your gun?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (a dawning realization)
               What does that have to do with the price
               of tea in China?

     Now one of the kids is crying, Liane trying to calm her,
     takes her out of the room.

<b>                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
</b>                   (a beat, realizing)
               You think I put that bullet in the
               mailbox myself...?

<b>                         FBI AGENT #2
</b>               If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...

     And he gets up...  They follow him into the bedroom.  He
     unlocks the side drawer on his night stand, taking out a gun,
     giving it to one of the Agents.

<b>                         FBI AGENT #1
</b>               Why do you keep this gun?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               I don't think it's unconstitutional <u>yet</u>
               to own a gun.  I'm a target shooter.

<b>                         FBI AGENT #2
</b>               That bullet was for a .38 caliber.  Do
               you own a .38?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Yes, I do.  A .38 Target Master.  In my
               gun safe downstairs.  A .45 Gold Cup.  A
               .22 target pistol.  So what?

<b>                         FBI AGENT #2
</b>                   (after a beat)
               Do you have a history of emotional
               problems, Mr. Wigand?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Yes.  Yes, I do.
                   (beat)
               Yes, I get extremely emotional when
               assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!

     And we hear Liane's voice from downstairs...

<b>                         LIANE'S VOICE (OVER)

               I didn't tell you that so you could just
               pick it up and take it away.  Jeffrey!

     And we see Liane following FBI Agent #3, coming up the stairs
     from the basement, and the Agent is carrying Jeffrey's
     computer...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               What's going on?

<b>                         LIANE
</b>               I told him that you had an E-mail death
               threat that said if you didn't shut the
               "F" up, they were going to kill you...

     Agent #3 starts out of the house with the computer followed
     by #2.  Jeffrey runs out after them.

               ...my files!  Personal correspondence...

     Agent #3 ignores him, putting the computer in the trunk of
     their car.  And FBI Agent #1, the .38 bullet in a baggie,
     comes out of the house.

<b>                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
</b>               ...letters to my brother...my will.

     His shoes slip on the grass and he falls.  And the FBI are
     getting into their car.  And NEIGHBORS have come out,
     watching them.  Liane and the girls, standing halfway down
     the front lawn, the neighbors looking at them.  She and
     Jeffrey look at each other.  Will she go to him or not?  She
     goes to him as he rises...

                         WIGAND (cont'd)
               That computer has everything...

     And we see a Man in his early forties, a neatly-dressed man

<b>                         LOWELL

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE

               An interview!  Do you know what they will
               do to us...!  I thought...  Sorry.

     But she suddenly gets up and leaves, hurrying out of the
     dining room.  And Jeffrey oddly doesn't move.

<b>                         LOWELL

               Liane, this is a preliminary...
                   (after a beat)
               You didn't tell her we were taping?
               What did she think she was coming to New

               I had a plan to ease her into it.  But, I
               really - I didn't know how to do that...

     Jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby Bar.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Oh, man.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE

               Ordinary people!  Under <u>extraordinary</u>
               pressure, Mike.  What the hell do you
               expect?  Grace and consistency?

     And Lowell leaves the table.  And as Mike Wallace sits at the
     table, looking around, wondering what the fuck he's doing
     there.

<b>     INT. THE BATHROOM, NEW YORK HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
     Liane folds her arms protectively across her chest...

<b>     INT. A STUDIO, CBS - MORNING
</b>
     And we see a small TAPING STUDIO separated by flats and black
     curtains from other CBS News sets.  Cameras are set up.

<b>     INT. THE STUDIO, CBS - DAY
</b>
     And we enter mid-scene on Jeffrey in a more formal demeanor,
     sitting in a chair, Mike Wallace sitting across from him,
     under the lights, taping an interview.  Lowell, off camera.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               You heard Mr. Sandefur say before
               Congress that he <u>believed</u> nicotine was
               <u>not</u> addictive...?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (nods)
               ...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured
               himself because I watched those
               testimonies very carefully.

     Lowell's reaction.  Jeffrey's statements are stunning and
     powerful revelations...and dangerous ones to make.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               All of us did.  There was this whole <u>line</u>
               of people...whole line of CEOs up there
               all swearing.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Part of the reason I'm here is I felt
               that their representation clearly
               misstated, at least within Brown &amp;
               Williamson's representation, clearly
               <u>misstated</u>...what is common language
               within the company...we are in the
               nicotine delivery business.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               And that's what cigarettes are for...?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               A delivery device for nicotine.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               A delivery device for nicotine.  Put it
               in your mouth, light it up, and you're
               gonna get your fix...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               You're gonna get your fix...

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               You're saying that Brown &amp; Williamson
               manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix,
               not by artificially adding nicotine, but
               by enhancing the effect of nicotine
               through the use of chemical elements such
               as ammonia...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (nods)
               The process is known as "impact
               boosting..."  While not spiking nicotine,
               they clearly manipulate it.  There's
               extensive use of this technology, know
               as "ammonia chemistry."  It allows for
               the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed
               in the lung and therefore affect the
               brain and central nervous system.

<b>     INT. THE STUDIO, CBS - LATER

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               The straw that broke the camel's back for
               me and really put me in trouble with
               Sandefur was a compound called
               "coumarin."  When I came on board at B&amp;W,
               they had tried to transition from
               coumarin to a similar flavor that would
               give the same taste, and had been
               unsuccessful.  I wanted it out
               immediately.
               I was told that it would affect sales, so
               I should mind my own business.  I
               constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur
               indicating I could not in conscience
               continue with coumarin in a product that
               we now knew, we had documentation, was
               similar to coumadin, a lung-specific
               carcinogen...

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               And you sent the document forward to
               Sandefur?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               I sent the document forward to Sandefur.
               I was told that we would continue to work
               on a substitute, we weren't going to
               remove it as it would impact sales, and
               that that was his decision.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               In other words, you were charging
               Sandefur and Brown &amp; Williamson with
               ignoring health considerations
               <u>consciously</u>...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Most certainly.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of
               Brown &amp; Williamson had you fired.  And

<b>                         WIGAND

</b>               Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't
               done it.  There are times I feel
               compelled to do it.  If you asked me
               would I do it again?  Do I think it's
               worth it?  Yeah, I think it's worth it.

               me...you'll have to do so in private...

               Okay...  I find chemistry to be magical.
               I find it an adventure.  An exploration
               into the building blocks of our physical
               universe...
                   (beat)
               So, how many of you have taken chemistry
               before?

     Nobody raises their hands.

               we're gonna be fine.

     A couple of laughs...  And we feel Jeffrey, for the first

<b>     EXT. WIGAND'S HOUSE #2, LOUISVILLE - TWILIGHT
</b>
     Jeffrey drives up the block and onto his driveway.  Seeing a
     MAN in a suit, an ear piece in his ear, disappearing around
     the corner of his house, Jeffrey leaps out of the car.  But
     the front door's open.  So instead of chasing after, he runs
     inside...

<b>     INT. THE WIGAND'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY/TWILIGHT
</b>
     And he sees another Man is in the living room...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Who the hell are you?!  What are you
               doing in my house?!

     And he sees Lowell enter from the dining room...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               It's okay, Jeff.

<b>                         SECURITY GUARD

               It's okay.  You got your own security
               now...

     Wigand catches his breath.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Lowell, I can't afford --

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               ...they "volunteered."  A friend owns a

</b>               How are you doing, Mr. Wigand?  I'm Jon

     And Wigand looks at Lowell...  Barbara comes into the living
     room and holds onto her father's leg.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               I called Richard Scruggs in

<b>                         LOWELL

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               I'm going to be a witness for them in
               their litigation.  So I'm going to fly to

               Want to play that game we were playing
               before?  You know, I think you got it up
               to five.  I was ahead of you.

     She goes over and holds his hand.  And as he holds her hand,
     seeing what his life has become, he looks up and his glance
     connects with Lowell...

<b>     INT. THE KITCHEN, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     We see out the window a Security Guard, incongruous, walking
     by.  And we see Liane, finished with the dinner dishes,
     silently wiping off the sink.  There's a pall you could cut
     with a knife.  A moment, and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen
     door from the garden...  He stops to wash his hands in the
     sink.

<b>                         LIANE
</b>               Please don't wash your hands in the sink.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Where should I wash them?

<b>                         LIANE
</b>               Use the bathroom.

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               What's the difference...

<b>                         LIANE
</b>               That's for food.

     But he ignores her, washing his hands...  And she turns the
     water off.  He turns it back on.  He thinks, then turns it
     off.  Then <u>she</u> turns it <u>on</u>.

                         LIANE (cont'd)
               Leave it on!  Just leave it on, okay?!

     And she turns and leaves the room, coldly, all her anger
     repressed.  For Jeffrey, everything else and now this?  The
     running faucet.

<b>     EXT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     The house on the quiet suburban street.  A Security Guard,
     incongruous, a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster
     is, sitting watch under the porch light on the small front
     porch in a metal porch chair.

<b>     INT. THE BASEMENT, THE WIGANDS' HOUSE - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     And we see Jeffrey, unable to sleep, sitting at his desk,
     alone in the basement, listening to classical music.  He
     instinctively turns.  And he sees Liane, in her bathrobe, has
     come down to sit on the basement stairs.  He looks over at
     her.  And he thinks she's come down to make up.  And all she
     really wants him to do is say, "I need you..."  But he
     can't...  And like ships that pass in the night, nothing's
     said.  It's quiet.  She puts her hands protectively in her
     robe pockets.  And she starts to cry...

<b>                         LIANE
</b>               I don't think I can do this...  I want to
               stand by my husband...  I really do,
               Jeffrey.  But I don't think I can do this
               anymore.  I am so sorry...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Can we talk about this when I get back?

<b>                         LIANE
</b>               Yes...Jeffrey.

     She goes back up the stairs.  And as Jeffrey sits in the
     basement, and the music plays.

<b>     INT. THE LOUISVILLE AIRPORT - DAY
</b>
     We see Jeffrey and his Security Man.  He passes a small
     Filipino Woman in a nurse's uniform and a Man in clerical
     garb, who hands him a small American Flag, asking for
     donations.  And, now, he passes through the metal detector.
     He nods thanks and walks towards us, relaxing, looking behind
     every so often to see if anybody is following him.  As he
     passes Gate 3, he HEARS over his shoulder...

<b>                         THE MAN
</b>                   (friendly)
               Jeff...?

     Jeffrey turns and the Man throws a sheaf of SUBPOENAS at his
     chest...

<b>                         THE MAN (CONT'D)
</b>                   (nasty)

     And he turns and walks off.  And as Jeffrey looks down at the
     subpoenas...

<b>     INT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' KITCHEN - 7:00 A.M.
</b>
     Jeffrey is sitting with Scruggs and Motley in Scruggs'
     kitchen around a semi-circular counter.  Coffee and sweet
     rolls.  It's casual.  No one's dressed for court.  Scruggs
     has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas.  About
     Motley, we sense power held in reserve.

<b>                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
</b>               Now, what this one is, is a temporary
               restraining order, a gag order, issued by
               a Kentucky court.

     Meanwhile, a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a
     tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on
     the arm of a chair.

<b>                         RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONT'D)

<b>                         MICHAEL MOORE
</b>               Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.

<b>                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
</b>               Mike's our Attorney General down here.
                   (to Moore)
               I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a
               Kentucky court to issue a gag order to
               stop his deposition today.

<b>                         MICHAEL MOORE
</b>               Right.

<b>                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
</b>               Now, they tried to get the Mississippi
               Court to honor it, but the judge threw it
               out...
                   (to Jeffrey)
               However, for you, there is a more
               perilous effect to the Kentucky gag
               order...

<b>                         MICHAEL MOORE
</b>                   (after a beat)
               Dr. Wigand, you do understand what could
               happen, don't you?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               I'm not free to testify...here...?

<b>                         MOTLEY
</b>               That's right.  If you violate the
               Kentucky order, when you step foot back
               in Kentucky, they can find you in
               contempt and they can incarcerate you.
               And you ought to know that.

     And Jeffrey fairly turns white, it's never occurred to him he
     might go to jail...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Jail?

<b>                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
</b>               Possibly, yes.  That is one of the
               possible consequences of your testifying
               here today.  That's right...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               How does one..."go...to...jail?"  What
               does my family do?  Go on welfare?  If my
               wife has to work?  Who's going to look
               after the kids?  Put food on the table?
               My children need me.  If I'm not
               teaching...there's no medical...no
               medical...even on co-pay, that's like...
               Tuition...

<b>                         MICHAEL MOORE
</b>               Dr. Wigand, listen, you may not be able
               to do this thing.  As I understand from
               Dick, you're our key witness.  And, I
               hope you don't withdraw.  I guess we'd
               all understand if you did...

               Guys, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late
               for court.  I'll see y'all a little
               later.  Dr. Wigand, good luck.

     He leaves.  And Jeffrey's quiet, frightened.  Having shaken
     the departing Moore's hand, he now turns away from Scruggs
     and Motley, thinking about consequences.

<b>                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
</b>               I know what you're facing, Jeff.  And, I

     A white, traditional, Southern house, with a veranda and
     gables...a large front lawn with weeping willows.  And we see
     Lowell, hands in his pockets, not an insider or an outsider,
     waiting alone on the expansive lawn.  The front door opens.
     A Mississippi State Trooper, putting on his round brimmed hat
     comes out and crosses the driveway.  Then Jeffrey coming out
     with Motley.  Motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment
     and then heads towards his car.  Meanwhile, Jeffrey comes
     down over to Lowell on the lawn.

     And Jeffrey looks off, across the street from the house, at
     the Gulf.  And we see the street is blockaded by Mississippi
     State Police cars.  An armed camp.  Other men in suits,
     Lawyers and state officials, wait.  Ron Motley gets in his
     car and drives away.

     And they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their
     coats...  He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship
     passing by.  He watches its slow progress...

     And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands
     in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...  And
     Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside
     Lowell...

     with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to
     the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers.  Some hang out

     on his cell phone...

<b>                         TOBACCO LAWYER
</b>                   (into phone)
               Hold on a second...
                   (seeing Motley enter; to Jr.
                    Lawyer)
               Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he
               expects his witness to appear or not...?

     JR. LAWYER crosses to Motley.

<b>     EXT. SCRUGGS' HOUSE, DOCK - DAY
</b>
     Jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.  Trying to
     decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.  A
     moment.  He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs.  Then.
     it's the three men, standing on the lawn.  Time seems to
     slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally
     and historically...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (severely conflicted)
               I can't seem to find...the criteria to
               decide.  It's too big a decision to make
               without being resolved...in my own mind.

     They're quiet.  Jeffrey, getting nowhere.  Lowell offers...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Maybe things have changed...

     Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future.  And
     something just got resolved.  He asks Lowell, rhetorically...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               What's changed?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (unsure)
               You mean...since this morning?

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               No.  I mean since whenever...

     Nothing's changed.  Wigand looks at them.  He found his own
     answer.

<b>                         WIGAND (CONT'D)
</b>               Fuck it.  Let's go to court.

     And Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat
     flawed, very courageous man...

<b>                         RICHARD SCRUGGS
</b>                   (to unseen staff)
               Dr. Wigand would like to leave now.

     And there's a sudden flurry of activity.  Jeffrey and Scruggs
     walk to a Mississippi State Police car.  Lowell gets into his
     car and drives away, separately.  Police, State Officials,
     run to their cars.  Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's
     car pulls into position.

<b>     INT. SCRUGGS' CAR - JEFFREY - DAY
</b>
     in the back seat with Scruggs.  The driver's a State
     Policeman.  Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old
     buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by.  It's all
     heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow.  And he
     exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus...

<b>     EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY
</b>
     Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging
     across Canty Street by their cars.  And now they see the
     police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards
     the courthouse.  The caravan stops.  First, Scruggs gets out.
     A moment, then Jeffrey appears.  And the Reporters pounce on
     Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him
     through the crowd...  Moore appears at courtroom door
     (already there).  And as he's whisked away into the
     courtroom.

<b>     INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY
</b>
     The tobacco lawyers become dead quiet.  Cell phones are hung
     up.  Newspapers are put away.  Jackets are donned.  This is
     now very serious business.  Motley meets Jeffrey, all eyes on
     him.

<b>                         MOTLEY
</b>               Okay, Jeff, I'm going to sit you down at
               that table over there.  I'm going to
               start as fast as possible.  I don't want
               to give them a chance to get another
               restraining order, okay?  Let's go.

<b>                         MICHAEL MOORE
</b>               Good luck, Doc.

     Motley calmly motions Wigand to take a chair.  He settles in.

<b>                         STENOGRAPHER
</b>               Please stand.  Raise your right hand...

<b>                         WIGAND

</b>                   (after a beat)
               Jeffrey S. Wigand.

     He spells it for them...

</b>
     Lowell, waiting with the other journalists...

<b>                         PHOTOGRAPHER
</b>               Got any idea what's going on in there?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               No, I don't have a clue.

<b>     INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY
</b>
     Motley still conducting the inquiry...  And the tobacco
     lawyers, like a pack of dogs, waiting to pounce...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               That is correct.

<b>                         MOTLEY
</b>               In other words, it acts as a drug?

<b>                         TOBACCO LAWYER

<b>                         MOTLEY

<b>                         MOTLEY

<b>                         MOTLEY

               record.  So now I'll proceed with my
               deposition of <u>my</u> witness.  Does it act as

               Dr. Wigand.  I am instructing <u>you</u>...
                   (to Wigand)
               ...<u>not</u> to answer that question in
               accordance to the terms of the

               not to disclose any information about
               your work at the Brown &amp; Williamson
               Tobacco Company.  And in accordance with

               restraining order that has been entered
               <u>against</u> you to by the court in the State of

<b>                         MOTLEY

               Oh, you got rights <u>and</u> lefts!  Ups and
               downs and middles!  So what?!  You don't
               get to instruct <u>anything</u> around here!

                   (to Wigand)

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (slams it home)
               Yes.  It produces a physiological
               response, which meets the definition of a
               drug!  Nicotine is associated with
               impact, with satisfaction.  It has a
               pharmacological effect that crosses the
               blood-brain barrier intact...

<b>                         MOTLEY
</b>               Thank you, Doctor.  Thank you.

<b>     EXT. THE SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - NIGHT
</b>
     Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain.  There's
     a slight sound.  He turns.  And Jeffrey's come outside.  He
     stands leaning on the porch railing, looking out at the rain
     and windswept trees.  They're quiet.  They share a look.
     They nod to each other.  The smallest nod of accomplishment.
     And they're there on the porch, alone, outside the house in
     Pascagoula, Mississippi.

<b>     INT. CBS EDITING ROOM, NEW YORK - AFTERNOON
</b>
     We see Lowell, unusually buoyant in the same clothes as
     yesterday.  He's working with Tony Baldo on a cut of the
     show, the net result of his architecture of events, his
     combination of persuasion and integrity...

     We see on the Avid monitor a single of Jeffrey...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (on monitor)
               "Part of the reason I'm here is I felt
               that their representation clearly, at
               least within..."

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's
               not addictive."  Run that on-camera.
               Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe
               they perjured..."  Then go wide to the
               CEOs all taking the oath.  Back on Jeff
               and play the pause after the word "felt"
               on the B-side...

     Widen to include Debbie DeLuca, the Intern, two other
     Editors, Felling.  They have gathered behind Lowell in the
     doorway.  This is a <u>hot</u> show and it's generated excitement
     among Lowell's co-workers.  And while Baldo cuts, we see...

<b>     INT. CBS, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EDITING ROOM - DAY
</b>
     ...the group has spilled out the doorway, watching Lowell's
     story come together.  Beyond them, approaching, is Mike
     Wallace, coming to work...

<b>                         BILL FELLING
</b>                   (leaving)
               ...helluva show, Mike.  Explosive
               material.

     People separate as Mike pushes in.  Lowell sees Mike.  While
     Tony Baldo is making the edits on the Avid...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (to Mike)
               It went great in Mississippi, Mike.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               Good.

     Don Hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket.

<b>                         DON HEWITT
</b>               I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal
               the secret formula of "Kools" to the
               world.
                   (seriously)
               "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs'
               litigation, and since we're the only ones
               with the story, I believe we're sitting
               on an exclusive.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               I like <u>that</u>...

<b>                         DON HEWITT
</b>               Corporate has some questions.  We've got
               a meeting at Black Rock first thing in
               the morning.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               When's the air date?

<b>                         DEBBIE DELUCA
</b>                   (to Lowell)
               Excuse me, Lowell.  Sharon's on line 3.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Tell her I'll call her back in ten.

<b>                         BALDO
</b>               Here we go.

     Baldo now runs Lowell's edit of the above sequence.  And we
<b>     SEE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT.
</b>
     Sandefur in CLOSE-UP states "I believe that nicotine is not
     addictive."  Wigand in matching CLOSE-UP states "I believe he
     perjured himself."  Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand
     up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of
     Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says "...the whole
     line of people, the whole line of CEO's up there, all
     swearing that."  And Wigand says off-screen with great
     emphasis "Part of the reason I'm here is I FELT"...and it
     cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word "FELT" resound
     and, then, he goes on to say on-camera "that their
     representation clearly <u>misstated</u> what they commonly knew.
     We're a nicotine delivery business."  We see the combination
     of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity
     that's stirring and beautiful...

<b>     EXT. LOUISVILLE - DUSK
</b>
     We see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown
     Louisville.

<b>     INT. THE RENTAL CAR - NIGHT
</b>
     It's Jeffrey in the front seat, driven by one of his security
     men.  He's coming home under the cover of darkness.  They
     pass a FLAMING CAR on the freeway shoulder.  Jeffrey turns to
     stare at it.  They turn off onto city streets and stop at a
     light.  Jeffrey's nervous.  Jeffrey instinctively turns.  A
     Police Car stops alongside.  The Policeman looks at him.
     Eyes meet.  Jeffrey looks away.  The signal takes forever.
     It changes.  And as the Police Car moves off...

<b>     EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     The car's stopped at the curb.  Jeffrey gets out.  He starts
     up the walk, and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses
     the lawn to intercept him...

     And Jeff opens the door going inside, anxious to be home...

<b>     INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     The house is quiet, dark.  Too quiet.  Too dark.  Something
     isn't right.  He crosses to one of the children's rooms...the
     master bedroom.  The lights are on.  Both rooms are empty.
     He goes into the kitchen and sees a note that's been left for
     him...  He opens it.  He sits heavily in a chair, reading the
     note.  The Security Guard peers...  And as Jeffrey sits in
     the silent house, the hero come home...

<b>     INT. THE CONFERENCE ROOM, CBS - DAY
</b>
     We're at a table.  Mike and Lowell laugh at some joke while
     HELEN CAPERELLI, CBS GENERAL COUNSEL, enters with the
     President of CBS News, ERIC KLUSTER.

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI
</b>               Shall I send for coffee?  Sorry I'm late.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI
</b>               Are you sure?

     Also there is Don Hewitt.  Caperelli is too well put
     together, too practiced, too polished.

     They nod.  They don't need coffee.

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI (CONT'D)
</b>               Alright, I thought we'd get together
               because there's a legal concept that has
               been getting some new attention recently,
               "tortious interference."
                   (beat)
               If two people have an agreement, like a
               confidentiality agreement, and one of
               them breaks it because they are induced
               to do so by a 3rd party, the 3rd party
               can be sued for damages for
               interfering...hence, "tortious
               interference."

<b>                         DON HEWITT
</b>               Interfering?  That's what we do.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               I think what we're trying to tell you is
               that it happens all the time.  This is a
               news organization.  People are always
               telling us things they shouldn't.  We
               have to verify if it's true and in the
               public interest...  And if it is, we air
               it.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               After we corroborate it.  That's why
               we've never lost a lawsuit and run a
               classy show.
                   (impatient, now)
               Anything else?

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI
</b>               <u>And</u> "60 Minutes'" verification <u>is</u> exact.
               <u>And</u> precise.  <u>And</u> I don't think it would
               hurt to make <u>sure</u> you're right...on this
               one.

<b>                         DON HEWITT
</b>               Why?  You think we have liability?
               What's the CBS News' position, Eric?

<b>                         ERIC KLUSTER
</b>               There's a possibility, it's rather
               remote...

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI
</b>               But one we have to check on, Mike.  I've
               retained outside counsel to do exactly
               that.  On a segment, I might add, that's
               already rife with problems...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               What does that mean?  "Rife with -- ?"

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI
</b>               I'm told unusual promises were made to
               Wigand.

               And, I'm told there are questions as to
               our "star witness'" veracity.

               His "veracity" was good enough for the

               Our standards have to be higher than
               anyone else's, because we <u>are</u> the
               standard...<u>for</u> everyone else...

     Whatever that means...

</b>                   (wry)
               Well, as a "standard"...I'll hang with
               "is the guy telling the truth?"

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI
</b>               Well, with tortious interference, I'm
               afraid...the greater the truth, the

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI
</b>               They <u>own</u> the information he's disclosing.
               The truer it is, the greater the damage
               to them.  If he lied, he didn't disclose
               <u>their</u> information.  And the damages are
               smaller.

<b>                         LOWELL

     And Lowell hears a changed note in Wallace's voice.  After a
     beat.

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI
</b>                   (familiar, seductive)
               If this holds up, and it very well may
               not, Mike...but, if it did.  And we aired
               this segment?  And CBS was sued by Brown
               &amp; Williamson?  I think we could be at
               grave risk.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>                   (a beat)
               How grace?

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI

                    this)
               Well, at the end of the day...because of
               your segment...the Brown &amp; Williamson
               Tobacco Company...could <u>own</u> CBS.

     As if on cue, the alarm on Helen Caperelli's watch beeps.
     She glances at it.

</b>               You know, I am sorry.  But I'm due
               upstairs.

     She gets up, gathering her things.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not
               go to air with this story?

<b>                         HELEN CAPERELLI
</b>               You're getting ahead of yourself.  We're
               <u>all</u> in this together.  We're <u>all</u> CBS.
               We'll find out soon.  Thank you,
               gentlemen.

     And taking up her briefcase, she leaves.  Don and Mike rise.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               "Tortious interference"?  Sounds like a

     the window, a manila folder (the filing) under his arm with
     whatever he found out, like a bomb, feels distant from these

<b>                         ERIC KLUSTER (CONT'D)

               cut an alternate version of the show
               <u>without</u> his interview.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's
               checking with outside counsel first, all

<b>                         ERIC KLUSTER
</b>               That's happening.  And, hopefully we
               won't have to use the alternate, but we
               should have it in the can.

<b>                         LOWELL

</b>               We're doing this with or without you,

               another producer to edit your show...

     hammer...

<b>                         LOWELL

               investigative journalism allowed lawyers
               to determine the news content on "60
               Minutes"?

<b>                         DON HEWITT
</b>               It's an alternate version.  So what if we

               think her being cautious is so damned
               unreasonable.

               For the sale of the CBS Corporation to
               Westinghouse Corporation.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE

<b>                         DON HEWITT
</b>               Yeah, I heard rumors.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               It's not a rumor.  It's a sale.
                   (rhetorical answer)
               If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share
               to Westinghouse and then is suddenly
               threatened with a multibillion-dollar
               lawsuit from Brown &amp; Williamson, that

<b>                         DON HEWITT

<b>                         LOWELL

               trust us, to get him to go on television.
               I do.  I deliver him.  He sits.  He
               talks.  He violates his own fucking
               confidentiality agreement.  And he's only
               the key witness in the <u>biggest</u> public
               health reform issue, maybe the biggest,
               most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case
               in U.S. history.  And Jeffrey Wigand,
               who's out on a limb, does he go on
               television and tell the truth?  Yes.
               Is it newsworthy?  Yes.  Are we gonna air
               it?  Of course not.  Why?  Because he's
               not telling the truth?  No.  Because he
               <u>is</u> telling the truth.  That's why we're
               not going to air it.  And the more truth
               he tells, the worse it gets!

     this room.  Directly across the street is the Brown &amp;

     up.  And in an upstairs office Brown &amp; Williamson lawyers,
     moving around a conference room, talking.  And as Jeffrey
     looks out the window...

     A busy New York street.  Light mist.  And we see Lowell is on
     the phone in a phone booth...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Yeah, I got it.  500 pages of it.  They
               looked in every corner of this guy's
               life...from a spousal abuse charge, to
               shoplifting, to a traffic ticket he got
               once for running a red light.  It's Terry
               Lenzner's outfit, IGI.  Jack, listen to
               me.  Their strategy:  discredit this guy,
               ruin his reputation in <i>The Wall Street
               Journal</i>, and then nobody will ever listen
               to what he's got to say about tobacco.
               He's dead.  Unless I can get this thing
               knocked down.

<b>     INT. A HOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT
</b>
     A townhouse with a commanding view of the Bay.  And we see a
     broad-shouldered man in his late forties sitting at a desk on
     the phone.  JACK PALLADINO.  His wife, SANDRA SUTHERLAND,
     sitting across from him on another phone.  They're Private
     Investigators...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               To make it even a little more attractive,
               I don't know if you're ever gonna get
               paid.

<b>                         SANDRA SUTHERLAND
</b>               Is there any truth to any of it?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               That's a good question.  "Is there any
               truth to any of it?"  I doubt it.

<b>                         PALLADINO
</b>               What's their deadline?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Soon.

     Palladinos exchange looks; she nods.

<b>                         PALLADINO
</b>               Fax me the summary.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               That's great, Jack.

     Lowell hangs up and walks towards us to enter...

<b>     INT. BAR - NIGHT
</b>
     CLOSE on Lowell entering, moving through the crowd of sports
     writers, feature writers, sub-editors, etc.  He comes upon a
     rugged-featured man, JIM COOPER from <i>The New York Times</i>,
     sitting next to Charlie.

<b>                         JIM COOPER
</b>               Hey, Lowell.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               How are you, Jim?

<b>                         JIM COOPER
</b>               Hey, listen, I hear you guys are sitting
               on something sensational over there.

     Lowell looks at Cooper quizzically.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Really?  Hi, Joan.

     Just then Jim's wife enters.  They exchange greetings.

<b>                         JIM COOPER
</b>               Hi, baby.

<b>                         LOWELL

     Cooper and his wife leave.  Charlie and Lowell are <u>alone</u> in
     the crowded bar.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               It's a smear campaign, Charlie.

</b>               Well, it's authoritative and is
               overwhelmingly documented.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               And it's bullshit.  And if I'm right, are
               you going to put the <i>Journal</i>'s reputation
               behind a story that's going to blow up in

<b>                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS
</b>               I'll take a look at what you got.  But I'm
               not moving any deadlines 'cause you say
               so.

     That's the way it lays.  In a different, personal tone...

                         CHARLIE PHILLIPS (cont'd)
               Are you all right?

</b>                   (on monitor)
               CBS is under criticism, because the CBS
               News program "60 Minutes" will not be
               presenting an interview...

     Lowell's destroying his own work product, taking apart his
     creation that we saw earlier to be so impactful.  Tony gets a
     call as Hewitt enters.

<b>                         DON HEWITT

<b>                         DON HEWITT
</b>               No, not that.  I'm talking about the
               Associated Press.  They got this story
               that we pulled this interview and they
               talked to Mike and I.  Did you tell them
               that we were lying?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               No.  I <u>should</u> have.  I told them I
               disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that
               this segment is as good as the original.
               I'm not lying for you.  I'm not gonna
               shut up for you.  Not on any of it.

<b>                         DON HEWITT

     A suitcase is on the floor.  Lowell, finishing packing up his
     things from his office.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
</b>               Lowell.  I decided to preface Sunday's

               protest?  To force it on the air?  The
               answer is "no."  I don't plan to spend
               the end of my days wandering in the

     Wallace waves Lowell's remark aside and exits.  We dwell on
     Lowell until he exits...

     ...into the hall.  Dan Rather introduced Mike.  As Lowell
     exits, we SEE Hewitt, Kluster and Caperelli outside of

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)

<b>     INT. LOWELL'S ROOM, MOTEL, MONTANA - NIGHT
</b>
     Lowell is in a T-shirt and sweat pants, sitting in an old, re-
     upholstered-one-too-many-times chair in a room barely big
     enough for a chair, a bed and the TV/VCR combo on the cheap
     dresser.  It's playing Lowell's cut of the full Wigand
     interview.  He watches the show that will never see the light
     of day.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
</b>               "...like the testimony before Congress of
               Dr. Wigand's former boss, Brown &amp;
               Williamson's Chief Executive Officer,
               Thomas Sandefur."

<b>                         THOMAS SANDEFUR
</b>                   (in CLOSE-UP)

               "I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured
               himself...  Because I watched those
               testimonies very carefully."

     Then it cuts to all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco raising their
     hands and taking the oath in front of Congress to tell the
     truth while...

<b>                         WALLACE'S VOICE (OVER)
</b>               "All of us did...there was this whole

     And the PAUSE after the word makes "FELT" resound, and as it
     CUTS TO Jeffrey ON CAMERA saying...

     And Lowell FREEZES after the image...  He gets up, looking
     out the window through the curtain with the spill from the
     neon motel sign.  Outside are horse trailers.  He goes back
     to watching the show...standing there...in touch with his
     own creative work product and the ideas inherent in it in
     this decision-making process that we feel is critical to him.
     Turning, he dials the phone and we intercut with...

               Are we talking...are we talking Brown &amp;
               Williamson, here?

     MOVING CLOSER into the face of Lowell.  His gaze falters.
     His eyes go back to the motel TV mutely frozen on the show.
     Whatever he's seeing there, his gaze is steadfast.

<b>     EXT. STREET, NEW YORK - 5:30 A.M.

     Newspaper box is loaded with <i>The New York Times</i>.

<b>     EXT. HOTEL, NEW YORK - 5:30 A.M.
</b>
     Cab pulls to curb and a raincoated Man emerges.  We SEE he
     carries a copy of this morning's <i>New York Times</i>.

<b>     INT. A HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK - DAWN
</b>
     A suitcase is half-unpacked on the floor...a sleeping
     figure...  There's a knock.  Irritated, a sleeping Lowell
     gets up to answer it.  He looks through the security peep
     hole.  He opens it.  And Mike Wallace, a newspaper under his
     arm, is standing in the doorway.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               Did I get you up?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               No, I usually sit around in my hotel
               room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the
               morning, sleepy look on my face.

     There's an awkward quiet.  Mike enters.  He slows, looks
     around.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               How many shows have we done?  Huh?
               C'mon, how many?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Oh, lots.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               Yeah, that's right.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               But in all that time, Mike, did you ever
               get off a plane, walk into a room, and
               find that a source for a story changed
               his mind?  Lost his heart?  Walked out on
               us?  Not one fucking time!  You want to
               know why?

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               I see a rhetorical question on the
               horizon.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               I'm going to <u>tell</u> you why.  Because when
               I tell someone I'm going to do something,
               I deliver.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell
               Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down
               the shining path.  To show me the way.

<b>                         LOWELL

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               No, <u>you</u> give <u>me</u> a break!  I never left a
               source hung out to dry, ever.  Abandoned.
               Not 'til right fucking now!  When I came
               on this job, I came with my word intact.
               I'm gonna leave with my word intact.
               Fuck the rules of the game!  Hell, you're
               supposed to know me, Mike.  What the hell
               did you expect?  You expect me to lie
               down?  Back off?  What, get over it?

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               In the real world, when you get to where
               I am, there <u>are</u> other considerations...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Like what?  Corporate responsibility?
               What, are we talking celebrity here?

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               I'm not talking celebrity, vanity, CBS.
               I'm talking about when you're nearer the
               end of your life than the beginning.
               Now, what do you think you think about
               then?  The future?  "In the future I'm
               going to do this?  Become that?"  What
               "future"?  No.  What you think is:  how
               will I be regarded in the end?  After I'm
               gone.

     He trails off.  They look at each other.

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               Now, along the way I suppose I made some
               <u>minor</u> impact.
                   (beat)
               I did Iran-Gate and the Ayatollah,
               Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Saddam,
               Sadat, etcetera, etcetera.  I showed
               them thieves in suits.
                   (beat)
               I've spent a lifetime building all that.
               But history only remembers most what you
               did last.  And should that be fronting a
               segment that allowed a tobacco giant to
               crash this network?
                   (beat)
               Does it give someone at my time of life
               pause?
                   (simply)
               Yeah.

     And the look on Wallace's face is "It did.  Whether it should
     or should not...what difference does that make?  It did."
     And we realize only now that he has not come to argue.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Mike...in my...

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>                   (low)
               You and I have been doing this together
               for <u>fourteen years</u>.

     And he gives Lowell a copy of <i>The New York Times</i>.

                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               This is today's <i>New York Times</i>.
                   (beat)
               In it is the whole sordid story of what
               went on inside our shop.

     Lowell looks down at the page.  The headline is "'60 MINUTES'
<b>     ORDERED TO PULL INTERVIEW IN TOBACCO REPORT."
</b>
                         MIKE WALLACE (cont'd)
               And in the editorial...  It accuses
               us...of betraying the legacy of Edward R.
               Murrow.

     Turning, he walks out and down the hallway.  Lowell looks at
     the newspaper.

                   (beat; to Lowell)
               Yeah, Don's looking for you...

<b>                         LOWELL

               Critic."
               It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the
               worst kind of an organized smear campaign
               against a whistle-blower."

<b>     INT. COFFEE SHOP, NEW YORK - MORNING

     EXTREMELY CLOSE Lowell.

               into its key claims, indicates that many

               contradictory evidence..."

<b>     EXT. STREET, NEW YORK - MORNING

     As Lowell hails a cab in a WIDE ANGLE and runs towards us,
     jumping into the cab...

<b>     INT. DON HEWITT'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
<b>                         DON HEWITT
</b>               The news division has been vilified in
               <i>The New York Times</i>, in print, on
               television, for caving to corporate
               interests!

     We PULL BACK and we see that Lowell's with Hewitt in Hewitt's
     office...

<b>                         DON HEWITT (CONT'D)
</b>               <i>The New York Times</i> ran a blow by blow of

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (shouting)
               No, <u>you</u> fucked <u>you</u>!  Don't invert stuff!
               Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you
               bought it.  <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>,
               here, not exactly a bastion of anti-
               capitalist sentiment, refutes Big
               Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest
               form of character assassination!  And
               now, even now, when every word of what
               Wigand has said on our show is printed,
               the entire deposition of his testimony in
               a court of law in the State of
               Mississippi, the cat totally out of the
               bag, you're still standing here debating!
               Don, what the hell else...do you need?

     And Hewitt, looking around.

<b>                         DON HEWITT

     And Don's taken off stride...

<b>                         DON HEWITT

               Hey, it's old news!  Stick with me.  Like
               always, we'll be okay.  These things have

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE

                   (droll)
               Infamy...lasts a little longer.

     Lowell looks at Wallace.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)

                   (in his face, so there's no
                    doubt)
               Now, this is what we're going to do.
               We're going over to Black Rock...

<b>     INT. A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS, LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON

     Jeff is in front of his class, teaching...

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>               Okay, so let's get back to it.  Alright,
               now, what we saw there was...

<b>     INT. LAX - ECU:  LOWELL - NIGHT
</b>
     Tired, his suitcase at his feet.  We don't know if he's
     coming or going.  He's at a pay phone in the more-deserted-
     than-not airport.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (into phone)
               They cancelled the six o'clock.
                   (beat)
               I don't know why.  I'm on the 8:10.  I
               should be home...9:30.  I'll see you
               then.  Love ya'.  Bye...

     He hangs up and ambles over to a lounge with a few travellers
     sitting in it.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               "CBS Management wouldn't let us broadcast
               our original story and our interview with
               Wigand because they were worried about
               the possibility of a multi-billion dollar
               lawsuit against us for tortious
               interference...  But now things have
               changed."

<b>     INT. JEFFREY WIGAND'S APARTMENT, LOUISVILLE - NIGHT
</b>
     A small apartment.  Jeffrey dishes out second helpings of
     pasta primavera into two pasta plates and brings them into
     the kitchenette to his girls, Deborah and Barbara.  And now
     we SEE AND HEAR the small television on the table playing "60
     Minutes" and...

<b>                         MICHAEL MOORE
</b>                   (on television)
               "...in my opinion, is an industry that
               has perpetrated the biggest fraud on the
               American public in history."

     Deborah looks proudly at her father.

     Wigand's gotten up and gone out of the kitchenette.  He has
     stopped for a moment around the corner in the hallway.  His
     kids can't see him.  We can.  And he watches them and his
     eyes get shiny and start to tear.  And as he stands there,
     watching his girls at the kitchen table witnessing their
     father's hard-earned "truth" on television, we realize that
     of all the audiences, his girls are the one he cares about
     most...

<b>     INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE
</b>
     And Lowell in his moment of victory is watching his "60
     Minutes" double segment on a departure lounge television with
     his feet resting on his suitcase, next to a Chicano woman
     with two kids and her mother and an older man with a beard
     and cane.  An airport cleaner stops to watch, too.  Lowell
     glances at him...

     Unbeknownst to these viewers, arrested by the content on the
     television screen, is that the man who made it sits casually
     among them, watching his work.

<b>     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, KITCHEN, BERKELEY - NIGHT
</b>
     Sharon sits at the kitchen table.  She watches in a far
     corner a small countertop television.  It's "60 Minutes," the
     full show entitled "Jeffrey Wigand, Ph.D." and on the top
     right, "PRODUCED BY LOWELL BERGMAN."  As Sharon continues
     watching the television playing on the counter, the emotional
     currents within her remaining unrevealed...

<b>     INT. MIKE WALLACE'S STUDY - ON MIKE WALLACE - NIGHT
</b>
     watching the show.  He sees himself...

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>                   (to Wigand)
               "You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?"

<b>                         WIGAND
</b>                   (on television, hesitating)
               "There are times...I wish I hadn't done
               it.  But there are times that I feel
               compelled to do it..."
               "I've - if you asked me if I would do it
               again or if it's - do I think it's worth
               it.  Yeah.  I think it's worth it."

     Wallace, satisfied, rises to refill his glass, as...

<b>     INT. AIRPORT LOUNGE
</b>
     Lowell watching show in airport.

<b>     INT. A SURVEILLANCE VAN, LINCOLN, MONTANA - NIGHT
</b>
     And we see the FBI Agent, BILL ROBERTSON on the phone.

<b>                         BILL ROBERTSON
</b>               I promised you a three-hour heads-
               up...well, here it is.  Have a camera
               crew standing by in Helena, Montana on
               Tuesday and I'll give you a three-hour
               head start.  Alright?  By the way, that
               was a hell of a good show tonight...

<b>     INT. LOWELL'S HOUSE, BERKELEY - NIGHT

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (nods, trustworthy)
               Thank you, Bill.

     And he quietly hangs up.  And it's still.  Sharon's laid
     down, closing her eyes.  They lie close together.  After some
     moments, she opens her eyes and lets us know what she's been
     thinking...

<b>                         SHARON
</b>                   (understated)
               You won.

     This time he isn't droll.

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               Yeah?
                   (a beat)
               What did I win?

     There's an odd look on his face, not the look of a victor.
     He shuts off the light.  And as they lie close together in
     the dark in each other's arms...

<b>     WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FAMILIAR CBS EYE ON A TELEVISION SCREEN.
</b><b>     AND THEN THE WORDS:  "SPECIAL REPORT."
</b>
<b>     INT. MASTER CONTROL ROOM, CBS - DAY
</b>
     Lowell, entering through machine rooms, into a state-of-the-
     art Master Control Room.  On a wall are fifty or more
     monitors, in the humidity-and-temperature-controlled nexus of
     CBS operations.  And it's jammed with people, witnessing a
     fast-breaking, major news event.  Mike Wallace stands near
     Felling.  Lowell crosses past Felling and stands next to Mike
     Wallace.

     And we see footage of a handcuffed, bearded, barefoot
     Man...THEODORE KACZYNSKI, the UNABOMBER, being taken in by
     the FBI.  A director counts down.  Dan Rather launches...

<b>                         DAN RATHER
</b>               "Reporting from CBS World News
               headquarters in New York, good afternoon.
               There has been a major break in the case
               of the so-called 'Unabomber.'  CBS News
               has learned that a remote homesite
               outside Lincoln, Montana has been under

<b>                         BILL FELLING
</b>               Thanks for this.  You know, we beat
               everybody.  ABC, NBC, CNN.

     Mike motions Lowell out into the corridor so they can be
     alone.

<b>     INT. CORRIDOR, CBS - DAY
</b>
     The control room and crowd are seen through the glass wall.
     After some moments:

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               That Canada story?  Still interest you?

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>                   (nods)
               Everything interests me.

     Mike nods...  Lowell puts his hands in his jacket pockets...
     After some moments...

<b>                         LOWELL (CONT'D)
</b>               I quit, Mike.

     Mike's startled.

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE
</b>               Bullshit.

     Lowell shakes his head "no."

<b>                         MIKE WALLACE (CONT'D)
</b>               C'mon, it all worked out.  You came out
               okay in the end...

<b>                         LOWELL
</b>               I did?  What do I tell a source on the
               next tough story?  Hang in with us.
               You'll be fine...maybe?

     They look at each other.  Lowell says to Mike, intimately,
     what he knows Mike knows...

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               What got broken here...doesn't go back
               together again.

     Lowell's heartfelt regret.  He starts to leave.  They look at
     each other.

                         LOWELL (cont'd)
               So, uh...

     And Lowell moves off along the hallway, the monitors all
     showing CBS programming.  He doesn't even look back...
