The US Army helicopter pilot Captain Colter Stevens awakes in a commuter train to Chicago in the body of a professor named Sean Fentress, and his last memory is flying in Afghanistan.
A woman named Christina Warren talks to him; there are minor incidents in the wagon and eight minutes later, the train blows-up.
Captain Stevens wakes up in a coffined in a sort of trunk and is contacted by the military Lieutenant Colleen Goodwin.
He learns that he had died in a helicopter crash and now he is inserted in a computer program called Source Code, developed by Dr. Rutledge, which transfers him to the body of a deceased person for the last eight minutes of his life using his after images.
He is advised that he can not change the past, since Source Code is not a time machine, but he can reassign time and change the future.
He is assigned to return to the train and find who the bomber is to avoid his next terrorist attack in Chicago downtown.
Captain Stevens is sent back several times and he and Christina fall in love with each other.
He decides to save the train from the explosion despite Dr. Rutledge tells him that that is effort is worthless.
