               TITLE SEQUENCE:  UNDER WATER - NIGHT

               As titles and music play, we move
               slowly beneath the water off the
               coast of Amity.

               We swim beneath a dock, threading
               our way through pilings...

               We move through the water, swimming,
               just swimming, with all the time in
               the world.

               We move over some junk -- the 
               rusting front end of an automobile...
               We're going somewhere...

               The water becomes shallow and we
               stop.  Up through the surface, the
               images distorted, we see the lights
               of a town...Amity...

               We move on, swimming again, just
               swimming, moving through the water
               until, suddenly, the water swirls
               with motion around us.  We experience
               the sensation of turning and then
               we see it, THE EYE...And, for a
               moment, we think we're going to
               see more...

               But all we see, as titles end, is
               THE EYE...

     FADE IN

1     AN ENORMOUS BLACK EYE                              
     1

     casts its deadly stare straight at us.  Waves of heat, like
     ocean currents, rise up around it.  A sound like that of
     the fires of hell fills our ears.

                       ELLEN (O.S.)
             Stop that....

                       SEAN (O.S.)
             Stop what?

                       ELLEN (O.S.)
             That....

                       SEAN (O.S.)
                  (laughing)
             I'm not doing anything.

     A hand is heard being slapped lightly.

                       SEAN (O.S.)
                  (feigning
                  pain)
             That hurt....

                       ELLEN (O.S.)
             Serves you right.
                  (laughing
                  despite
                  herself)
             Will you please stop....

                       SEAN (O.S.)
             Can't help myself....

     The huge eye rises up toward us, then turns away and
     disappears, to be replaced by another just like it.

2     INT. BRODY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                    
     2

     The eye belongs to a fish and the fish is frying in a pan
     and Ellen has just turned it.  She glances at Sean, her
     son, who's dressed in an Amity police uniform.  He's
     munching a piece of lettuce from the salad, which he's been
     picking at.  It's winter and she's wearing a bit of wool.

                       ELLEN
             You're almost as fast as your
             father.  He could snatch a tomato
             out of a salad faster that a rabbit
             makes love.

     Sean grins at his mother and slowly tries to take more
     lettuce without being seen.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             I see what you're doing....

                       SEAN
             I'm hungry, Mom....

                       ELLEN
             Let me finish dinner before you eat
             it...Chop the peppers....

     He lines up a red and green pepper and eyes them sympatha-
     tically.

                       SEAN
             Sorry fellas....

     He starts chopping them up and Ellen grabs her glass of wine
     and sits herself on a stool to watch him.  Showing off a
     little, he starts adding some professional panache to his
     chopping.

                       ELLEN
             Watch your fingers....

     He cuts himself.

                       SEAN
          Shit....

     The phone rings.

                       ELLEN
             Are you all right?

                       SEAN
             Adds flavor....

     He sucks at his finger as she answers the phone on its
     second ring.

                       SEAN
                  (continuing)
             We don't want any....

                       ELLEN
                  (picking up
                  the phone)
             Hello?
                  (smile
                  broadens as
                  she listens)
             Thea who?
                  (laughs)
             I know it's Thea Brody.  How many
             grandchildren do I have?  I know you
             can use the phone by yourself.
             You're a big girl.  I know you're
             five.

     Sean, still sucking at his finger, eager to talk with his
     niece, moves to the phone and leans in close to the
     mouthpiece.

                       SEAN
             Hi ya, kiddo.  How you doing down
             there in the sunshine?

     Ellen shares the mouthpiece with her son.

                       THEA (O.S.)
             I'm fine, Uncle Sean.  I went swimming
             today.  I'm taking lessons.

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             She already swims like a fish.

                       SEAN
             Hey, Michael!

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             Hey, bro....

                       ELLEN
                  (to Sean)
             The fish.  Check it....

                       SEAN
             You check it....

                       ELLEN
             I'm on the phone....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             I'm paying for the call....

                       SEAN
                  (to Ellen)
             Not if you let me have it.

                       ELLEN
             In a minute....

                       THEA (O.S.)
             What's going on?

                       SEAN
                  (to Thea)
             Your grandmother's a slave driver.
             Tell her to be nice to me.

     Sean makes a face at his mother, who smiles at him, then
     continues her conversation with Thea.

                       ELLEN
             Did you get the book I sent you?
                  (listens)

     Sean studies the fish as it fries in the pan, not sure
     what to do with it.

                       SEAN
             Ask the big doctor about his work.
                  (yelling so
                  Michael can
                  hear him)
             Tough life you Bahamian beach bum...
             Playing in the water all day....

                       ELLEN
             He heard that.

                       SEAN
                  (smiling)
             Good.

     He turns to the fish.

     4

     It's the next day and the main business street of Amity
     is ablaze with Christmas lights and decorations.  The
     streets are busier than usual with traffic.  People move
     about with that extra sense of purpose and good cheer
     which accompanies the holiday season.

     Sean, Ellen and Tiffany, the young woman to whom Sean is
     engaged, are just leaving Ellen's real estate office, a
     storefront on the main street.  They're carrying Christmas
     packages.  Ellen's partner, Agnes Taft, is seen at her desk
     inside.

                       ELLEN
                  (as she leaves)
             Tomorrow we have to get the ads for
             the paper straightened out.  And if
             Mrs. Blodget calls, tell her we'll
             have the final offer tomorrow....

                       MRS. TAFT
             How come you get to leave early?

                       ELLEN
                  (smiling)
             My desk is closer to the door....

     Mrs. Taft grins and goes back to work as Ellen, Sean and
     Tiffany start across the street.  The sign above the door
     behind them reads:  'BRODY AND TAFT, REAL ESTATE.'

                       SEAN
                  (continuing
                  their earlier
                  conversation)
             A big one....

                       ELLEN
             A small one...Your brother won't be
             here....

     The Mayor sees them as he moves along the sidewalk.

                       THE MAYOR
             Merry Christmas.

             ELLEN                  SEAN/TIFFANY
     Merry Christmas, Jim....     Merry Christmas, Mayor....

                       THE MAYOR
             Eggnog time...Thursday night.

                       ELLEN
             I'll be there....

     The Mayor offers a large grin and hurries on.

                       SEAN
                  (to Ellen)
             We're having a big tree and we're
             getting out all the old ornaments
             and we're going to do it right....

                       TIFFANY
             We'll put stockings on the mantel....

                       SEAN
             And we're putting out a sandwich and
             a bottle of beer for Santa....

                       ELLEN
                  (laughing)
             All right...We'll do it all...Tiffany,
             you have no idea what kind of mad man
             you're marrying....

                       TIFFANY
                  (smiling at
                  Sean)
             Oh, yes I do....

     They approach the front of the police station.

                       SEAN
             I've got to check in....

     He kisses his mother on the cheek and plants one on
     Tiffany's lips.

                       ELLEN
             Don't be late.

                       SEAN
             I won't....

     Sean heads for the station.  The two women watch him for a
     moment, then move on.

                       ELLEN
                  (with good
                  humor)
             He has the messiest room in America....

                       TIFFANY
             I know...but he's all mine....

     Ellen gives her a look, then smiles and the two women
     continue on.

5     INT. POLICE STATION - DUSK                         
     5

     Sean moves into the front office, taking off his gloves
     and blowing into his hands.  The secretary, Polly, who is
     close to retirement, is going through a filing cabinet.
     There's a framed picture of Martin Brody on the wall near
     her.  It has a plaque beneath it which reads, MARTIN BRODY,
     POLICE CHIEF, 1973-1985.  She slams the drawer shut in her
     frustration at not being able to find what she's looking
     for.

                       SEAN
             That bad, huh?

                       POLLY
             We're out of decaf...We're out of
             petty cash...And we're out of
             requisition forms....

     He smiles sympathetically and pours himself a half cup of
     coffee and waits for the rest of it.

                       POLLY
                  (continuing)
             You have the safety talk at school,
             one o'clock tomorrow....

                       SEAN
             Anything to do before I go home?

     He sips at his coffee, eager to be gone.  Polly opens
     another file and searches.

                       POLLY
             That man keeps calling about his
             training film.  I can't convince him
             we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.

                       SEAN
             Good night, Polly....

     He takes a final sip of coffee and puts the mug down and
     heads for the door.  The phone rings.  Polly moves to her
     desk.

                       POLLY
             George called about the softball
             league.  He wants you to organize a
             team for next summer....

     He disappears as she picks up the phone.

                       POLLY
                  (continuing)
             Amity Police Department...
                  (listens;
                  then yells 
                  at Sean)
             Hold it!  There's an old dock piling
             drifting in the channel.

     Sean reappears in the doorway looking quizzical.

                       POLLY
                  (continuing;
                  on the phone)
             Maybe it will just keep drifting
             until it goes away.
                  (to Sean)
             It's stuck against a channel marker.

     He starts away again, trying to ignore it.

                       POLLY
                  (continuing;
                  listening;
                  then yelling)
             Hold it again!  Coast Guard's busy
             and it has to be cleared before the
             fishermen come back.

     Sean moves back to the doorway.

                       SEAN
             Where's Lenny?

                       POLLY
                  (hand over
                  the mouthpiece)
             Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow
             tipping.

                       SEAN
             Cow tipping?

                       POLLY
             Claims kids come around at night and
             tip over his sleeping cows.  They're
             not giving milk.

                       SEAN
                  (sighing)
             I'll take care of it.

                       POLLY
                  (on the
                  phone)
             Deputy Brody will take care of it
             personally.

     She hangs up and eyes Sean, who's still framed in the doorway.

                       SEAN
             Call my mother.  Tell her I'll be
             late.

     He shakes his head and disappears at the door.

                       SEAN
                  (continuing)
             Cow tipping....

6     THE DOCKS - DUSK TO NIGHT                         
     6

     A huge banner is stretched above the docks.  It reads:
     AMITY ANNUAL CHRISTMAS PAGEANT.

     The combined forces of the high school band, chorus and
     dramatic society are in the process of rehearsing their
     musical version of the birth of Christ.  Their director,
     Mr. Tarkanian, is jumping about, trying to organize things.

                       TARKANIAN
             Come on people.  Come on.  We go on
             at eight o'clock tomorrow night
             and...
                  (voice rising
                  to a scream)
             No one's ready....

     This gets him some attention and his kids begin taking
     their places -- Mary and Joseph, the Three Wisemen, the
     shepherds...the sheep, the camel, which is a horse with an
     artificial hump.

                       TARKANIAN
                  (continuing)
             You shepherds, find your places.
             And don't forget the sheep....

     Sean pulls up in the police vehicle, gets out and, grinning
     and shaking his head at the confusion, begins to make his
     way through it.

                       SEAN
                  (yelling at
                  Tarkanian)
             Good luck.

                       TARKANIAN
             I'll need it with this bunch....

     Sean pushes on, moving out on the dock.

                       TARKANIAN (O.S.)
             Where's the Frankincense?  This is
             supposed to be a dress rehearsal....

7     THE POLICE BOAT - NIGHT                              
     7

     Sean gets the engine started and casts off and the small
     boat makes its way from the dock.

                       TARKANIAN (O.S.)
                  (shouting)
             You're supposed to be in costume,
             Joseph.  Where's your robe?  Jesus!

                       A KID (O.S.)
             Here I am....

8     THE BAY - NIGHT                                   
     8

     The boat moves slowly toward the channel.  Sean looks
     back and sees the lights and activity on the dock and
     smiles a little, then turns his attention to the job at
     hand, switching on the boat's spotlight, using it to cut
     through the accumulating darkness.

9     THE CHANNEL - NIGHT                              
     9

     Sean brings the boat to the channel marker, with its small
     blinking red light, and kills the engine and examines the
     huge piece of dock piling, most of which is beneath the sur-
     face.  It's lodged against the marker, so heavy in the water
     that it's not moving an inch.  Hardly more than a shadow,
     his face just barely illuminated by the occasional dull red
     light, Sean gathers the towline and begins trying to secure
     it to the piling, a difficult job in the cold, which
     requires him to lean out over the side as far as he can.

     The band is heard starting up on the dock, gradually col-
     lecting itself until it sounds like one, playing "The First
     Noel."  A few moments later, the choir begins singing it.

     Suddenly the water explodes up around him violently and the
     boat rocks in the shock of it and a dark form is seen, for
     an instant, and Sean disappears from our view.  The boat's
     spotlight rocks crazily.  Then the turmoil of the water dies
     and all is calm and the singing from the dock is heard
     clearly again.

     Sean, holding onto his shredded sleeve and coat, bleeding
     profusely, has fallen  to a corner of the stern.  He looks
     off toward the dock and opens his mouth to call for help,
     but nothing comes out.  The music grows louder as the band
     and chorus find their confidence.

     Then a tremendous surge of water explodes upward and the
     dark form is seen again, for an instant, and our view of
     Sean is lost.  When we can see again, Sean and a corner
     of the stern are gone.

     For a moment, Sean is seen holding onto the piece of dock
     piling with his remaining arm.  He cries out for help but
     it's lost in the swelling sound of the Christmas Carol
     coming from the dock.  Then Sean and the pole disappear
     beneath the surface.  He's just gone.  A few moments later,
     the pole pops back to the surface.  In the rocking
     spotlight from the boat, the clear outline of the shark's
     jaws can be seen where it's taken a chunk of it.  In the
     stillness of the night, the band and chorus suddenly stop.

                       TARKANIAN (O.S.)
                  (yelling; his
                  patience
                  exhausted)
             Get the star higher.  Higher!  And
             where the hell are the Wisemen?

10     INT. POLICE STATION - DAY                         
     10

     Ellen in shock, moves down a corridor with Lenny, Sean's
     boss, the Chief.  He holds her arm as they move to a back
     room of the station.  Polly and a handful of townspeople
     watch sadly from the other end.

                       LENNY
             If I didn't have to, I wouldn't.
                  (hates this
                  conversation)
             There's not enough...Law requires a
             positive identification and there's
             not...
                  (can't finish)

     He holds the door open and Ellen goes inside.

11     THE BACK ROOM - DAY                              
     11

     A sheet covers the table in the center of the room.
     There's a slight bulge beneath it.  Ellen moves to the
     table.  Lenny moves to get ahead of her.

                       LENNY
             I wish there was some way to make it
             easy....

     Ellen, still in shock, watches as Lenny pulls back the sheet.
     She goes rigid, staring at Sean's remains without expression.
     He glances at her, then puts the sheet back.  She doesn't 
     move.  He moves to an old desk which sits in a corner and
     takes up a package.  Sean's service revolver, in his holster,
     and his badge are on top of it.  He brings them to her.

                       LENNY
                  (continuing)
             His things....

     She looks dully at Lenny, then at the package, staring at
     the service revolver.

                       LENNY
                  (continuing)
             I thought you'd want them....

     She takes what he offers and leaves.

     Ellen stops and uses all her strength to compose herself.
     Her expression is etched with controlled rage.

     15

     A taxi pulls up in front and Michael Brody, in his late
     twenties.  Carla, his wife, mid-twenties, and Thea, their
     five-year-old daughter, get out.  As the driver gathers their
     luggage, they look sadly at the house, then start for it.
     Thea doesn't really understand what's going on.

16     INT. HOUSE - DAY                              
     16

     Michael and his family move into the house.

                       MICHAEL
             Mom?

     There's no answer and he looks in the living room.  It's
     empty.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Anybody home?

     Polly moves into the hall, followed by Mrs. Kintner, Agnes
     Taft, and another woman.  They all look as though they've
     been working in the kitchen.

                       POLLY
             Michael....

     He moves to her and they embrace.  Polly looks at Carla and
     the two women exchange sad smiles.

                       MICHAEL
             Where's Mom?

     Polly points out toward the beach.

                       POLLY
             She's been out there for hours....

                       MICHAEL
             How's she doing?

     Polly gives him a look, as if to say, not very well.

                       MRS. KINTNER
             We just came from Tiffany's house....

                       MRS. TAFT
             Poor girl...The doctor's had to sedate
             her....

     Michael nods and leaves.  Polly smiles at Thea.

                       POLLY
             I hardly recognize you, Thea.  You're
             so grown up....

                       THEA
             Uncle Sean is dead, you know.
                  (to Carla)
             Will he ever come back?

             POLLY                  CARLA
        (to Thea)                  (to Thea)
     You want something to eat?     We'll talk about it some
                         more later.

                       THEA
                  (to Polly)
             I had a hamburger on the plane.

                       POLLY
             We can do better than that.....

     Polly offers her hand and Thea takes it and they head for
     the kitchen.  Polly and Carla exchanging the knowledge of how
     difficult this all is for a child.

                       POLLY
             How about a funny bone sandwich?

     Thea giggles and they disappear into the kitchen.

17     THE BEACH - DAY                                   
     17

     Ellen stands at the shoreline, looking out toward the bay,
     her expression empty of feeling;  stoic suppression of her
     feelings.  Michael moves down the beach toward her.

                       MICHAEL
             Mom....

     She turns and, for a long moment they look at each other,
     then he moves to her and takes her in his arms.  They hold
     onto each other for a long time.  Tears begin to well up in
     his eyes.  She looks at him, then kisses him gently, then
     looks back out at the water.

                       ELLEN
                  (with deadly calm)
             It came for him.  It waited all this
             time and it came for him....

                       MICHAEL
             Mother....

     But she doesn't hear him.  Her mind and heart are somewhere
     else.

18     INT. BRODY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                    
     18

     Carla is organizing the evening meal.  Michael moves into
     the room.

                       MICHAEL
             She's putting Thea to sleep.

     He gets a can of beer from the refrigerator and pops the
     top, then looks at it.  She studies him.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             I bought him his first legal drink.
             He got so pissed that night....

                       CARLA
             He told me you both did....

     They look at each other, sharing their grief.

                       CARLA
                  (continuing)
             He told me a lot about you two....

     Carla catches Ellen entering from the corner of her eye.
     Michael follows her gaze.

                       MICHAEL
             Sit down, Ma....

                       ELLEN
             You guys must be starving....

     Ellen moves to the counter and starts pulling out pots and
     pans, as though she's lost control of herself.  Carla moves
     to calm her down.

                       CARLA
             I'm making dinner.  You should....

     Ellen pulls herself free from Carla's hand and continues
     pulling out the pots.  She stops suddenly, holding one in
     her hand.  She lets it drop and turns to look at Michael.

                       ELLEN
             I want you to get out of the water....

                       MICHAEL
             What?

                       ELLEN
             I want you to give up that terrible job.

                       MICHAEL
             Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....

                       ELLEN
                  (her voice
                  rising)
             You're damn right I'm serious....

                       MICHAEL
             I'm just getting started....

                       ELLEN
             I don't want you in the water anymore....

     She stops suddenly, aware that Michael and Carla are
     staring at her.

                       MICHAEL
             Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....

                       ELLEN
             I won't have anyone in my family any-
             where near the water....
                  (coming
                  unglued)
             Never again...Never....

     Michael moves to her, trying to take her in his arms,
     trying to comfort her.

                       MICHAEL
             Hey, come on, you can't believe that
             voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder.
             They don't pick out a person....

                       ELLEN
                  (pulling away
                  from her son)
             It picked Sean...It killed your
             father....

                       MICHAEL
             Dad died from a heart attack....

                       ELLEN
             He died from fear...From having to
             go out there after it....

     She starts from the room unable to control herself, not
     wanting to unravel completely in front of Michael and Carla.

                       MICHAEL
                  (a last attempt
                  to reason with
                  her)
             There's never been a great white
             where we live.  It's warm water...
             They don't like it....

                       ELLEN (O.S.)
                  (as she moves
                  away)
             Your brother's dead...Your father's
             dead....

     Michael and Carla look at each other with grave concern.

19     THE BEACH - DAY                                   
     19

     The sand is hard from the cold and it's empty of people.
     The water is calm.  The day is sunny and peaceful.

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             He was such a good-natured kid...
             Always going out of his way....

                       CARLA (O.S.)
             He was doing his job....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             It was a piece of wood.  A shitty
             piece of wood.  It's not fair....

     Michael and Carla move into view, their backs to us,
     bundled against the cold.

                       CARLA
             He was just doing his job, Michael.

     They walk on in silence for a moment and we see them coming
     toward us.  Michael is deeply troubled.  Carla is concerned
     about him.

                       MICHAEL
             God, he could make me laugh sometimes.
                  (pauses)
             He was always tagging after me when
             we were kids.  He wanted so much to
             do what I was doing....

     Suddenly Michael starts running.  Carla watches him for a
     moment, then starts running after him.

                       CARLA
             Where are you going?

                       MICHAEL
             Nowhere....

     He starts running flat out and Carla runs with him, stopping
     finally because he's too fast and she can't keep pace.  She
     watches as he works every muscle in his body, trying to
     exhaust himself, trying to rid himself of what he feels.

21     INT. BRODY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (FROM JAWS)

     Sean, a small boy, and Martin are at the table.  Martin is
     lost in thought, reflecting on his dilemma about the
     appearance of a great white shark in Amity and the refusal
     of the town fathers to shut down the beaches.  Sean imitates
     his father's every move, mimicking him in every way.

     Ellen is smiling, her expression reflecting her memory of
     her son and her husband.  Sean is being buried.  The Minister
     is conducting the gravesite service.  Thea stands next to
     Ellen, holding her hand.  Carla is next to her.  Michael
     stands on the other side of his mother.  Tiffany stands next
     to him.  She's crying.  Hundreds of townspeople have come
     to pay their last respects, Polly, Lenny, Mrs. Kintner,
     Mrs. Taft, Tarkanian, the Mayor and several Selectmen among
     them.

     Martin and Sean are still at the table.  Martin finally
     catches his son and makes a funny face at him and Sean
     makes one back.  Martin opens his arms and Sean comes to
     him and the boy kisses his father.  Ellen watches from
     the doorway.

     24

     Ellen is still smiling.  Thea is looking up at her, smiling
     to herself, trying to figure out what's amusing her grand-
     mother.  Michael and Carla look at Ellen with concern.

                       MINISTER
             A time to keep silence, and a
               time to speak;
             A time to love and a time to
               hate;
             A time for war, and a time for
               peace.

25     AVRIL BAY - NIGHT                              
     25

     The water laps gently against the shore.  A person's legs
     are seen walking into it.  Ellen is revealed walking slowly,
     deliberate out into the cold water of the bay.  Her
     expression is set with sad determination as though she's
     going to keep on walking, until the water swallows her up.
     Finally she stops, and slowly raises her right hand.  It
     holds Sean's service revolver.  She points it toward the
     water in front of her and one by one, coldly, methodically,
     fires all six rounds into the bay.

26     EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY                              
     26

     Ellen, Michael, Carla and Thea leave the store and move off.
     Thea is unwrapping a lollipop.

                       CARLA
             You'll spoil her.

                       THEA
             That's what grandmas are for.

     Ellen, constantly surprised by her granddaughter, laughs.
     It pleases Michael and Carla.

                       MICHAEL
             I want you to come back with us.

     Ellen looks at him with a raised eyebrow.  Michael's
     concern for her is evident.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Change of scenery...Spend more time
             with Thea....

                       THEA
             Yes!

     Ellen looks at Carla, silently asking for her response.

                       CARLA
                  (smiling;
                  taking Ellen's
                  arm)
             What do I think?  I think it's a
             lovely idea....

                       MICHAEL
             Please, Mom.  At least consider it.
             You should get away.  You shouldn't
             be alone now....

                       ELLEN
                  (mimicking
                  Thea)
             Yes!

                       THEA
             You can stay in my room.

                       ELLEN
                  (to Thea)
             I'd like that.
                  (to Michael)
             I need to be away from here.

     Michael, surprised, pleased by how quickly his mother
     agreed, smiles and she returns it, the first smile she's
     had for anyone but Thea and the memory of her son and
     husband since Sean was killed.  Carla looks at Michael,
     her expression etched with love and concern.

29     THE FERRY - DAY                                   
     29

     Michael with Thea in his arms, Ellen and Carla stand
     together near their taxi as the ferry leaves Amity and
     heads for the mainland, the first leg of their journey to
     the Bahamas.  Thea is playing a game with Ellen, pretending
     to whisper a secret.  Ellen does it back and Thea giggles
     hysterically.

                       THEA
             Grandma said, buzz, buzz, buzz....

     Ellen laughs at her granddaughter's delight.  Michael and
     Carla grin.

                       THEA
                  (continuing)
             Swing me...Swing me....

     Michael and Carla start swinging Thea between them.  As
     Thea laughs, Ellen, suddenly, without warning, moves away
     and starts crying, unseen by the others.  She looks back
     toward the island, sobbing now, finally letting it out,
     taking a last look at her home.  Carla, Thea and Michael
     are heard laughing as they continue their game.

30     AVRIL BAY - DAY                                   
     30

     From the surface of the water, the ferry is seen becoming
     smaller and smaller as it moves away.  The old dock piling
     that Sean tried to dislodge from the channel marker, that
     cost him his life, has washed up on the beach.

     It's in several pieces and bears the distinct outline of
     the great white shark's jaws.  Several of its teeth are
     lodged in the wood.

     30-B

     A large Eastern airline jet descends to the airport,
     finally touching down and braking as it brings the Brody
     family to the Bahamas.  The plane flashes past....

31     NASSAU BAY - DAY                              
     31

     A blur of red flashes past.  A Parachutist is being pulled
     by a speedboat.  Several others are revealed, then a crowd
     of swimmers, and banana boats, and sailfish.  The busy bay,
     it's "high season," is seen from the point of view of a low
     flying aircraft.

                       CARLA (O.S.)
             I've always wanted to ride one of
             those....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             No way....

                       CARLA (O.S.)
                  (laughing)

32     INT. PLANE - DAY                              
     32

     Ellen stares down at the water, carrying her mood from
     Amity.  Michael and Carla ride next to and just behind her
     and eye Ellen with concern.  Michael is dealing with his
     own grief, forcing himself to put on a "strong" face for
     his mother.  Thea looks back from the front seat.  She's
     riding next to Hoagie Newcombe, the pilot, a man of Ellen's
     age who looks the "free spirit" he is.

                       THEA
             Can I ride one sometime...?

                       ELLEN
                  (breaking
                  free from 
                  her trance)
             It's too dangerous....

                       CARLA
                  (teasing)
             Like mother, like son....

                       MICHAEL
             My mother always told me, if God had
             intended us to ride parachutes for
             fun, we'd have been born with free
             tickets....

                       ELLEN
                  (laughing)
             I never....

                       THEA
                  (to Hoagie)
             Where's the lady who brings the soda?

     Hoagie laughs.

                       THEA
                  (continuing)
             They had them on the big one....

                       HOAGIE
             I have coffee in the thermos.

                       THEA
             I'm too young for coffee.  Can I
             drive the plane?

                       CARLA
             Thea....

                       THEA
             Sometimes my father puts me in his
             lap and lets me steer the Jeep.

                       CARLA
             Don't bother Hoagie....

                       HOAGIE
             Sometimes I let special people sit
             on my lap and steer the plane....

     He helps Thea undo her seat belt and she climbs into his
     lap and he puts her little hands on the wheel, then puts 
     his over them.

                       MICHAEL
             Jake tells me you're going to have
             to fly for the rest of your life to
             pay off what you lost at the crap
             table....

                       HOAGIE
             Good news travels fast....

     He throws a smile back at Michael, who smiles back, just a
     little.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             I'll get it back next time.

                       THEA
             How come it bumps up and down when
             there's no road?

                       HOAGIE
             The wind does that.
                  (to Ellen)
             Ever been to the Bahamas before?

                       ELLEN
             No....

                       HOAGIE
             First time for everything is the
             best.  After that you know too much
             and it's never quite the same.

                       ELLEN
             You must get bored easily.

             MICHAEL                       HOAGIE
     Not from what I've heard....          Only on Tuesdays...The
                              rest of the week is
                              interesting as hell.

                       MICHAEL
             Hoagie likes adventure....

     Michael glances at Carla, who's smiling at Thea, as Hoagie
     gives Ellen his most charming smile.  Ellen is looking from
     Michael to Hoagie, not sure what to make of it all.

                       THEA
             What's that?

     She's pointing to a gauge with a horizontal white line
     across it.

             HOAGIE                  CARLA
     It tells me if I'm flying         (to Michael)
     level.  Sometimes it's hard     You okay?
     to tell without a road.
                                 MICHAEL
             THEA               Yeah.
     How do you make the plane
     go up and down?                       CARLA
                             (looking at
              HOAGIE              Ellen; then
     Like this....                   Michael)
                         She'll be okay too....

     Carla takes Michael's hand and holds it as Hoagie puts the
     plane into a steep dive.  Everyone holds on.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             Want to go for a little ride?

                       THEA
             I do....

                       ELLEN
             Can you just go off...?

                       HOAGIE
             I'm the captain of this majestic
             ship.  It goes where I take it....

     He gestures to Ellen to look below and she looks out her
     window.

     Palm trees stir in the gentle breeze.  The terminal is
     decorated for Christmas.  A half-dozen islanders eye the
     air taxi as its wheels touch down.

35     VACATION HOUSE - DAY                              
     35

     We move past large, expensive houses off a narrow road.
     They're landscaped beautifully.  The sound of "The Christmas
     Song" being sung by "someone" is heard.

35-A     A CAR - DAY                                   
     35-A

     Ellen stares at the houses from an early model white
     Cadillac as it makes its way toward Michael's house.  "The
     Christmas Song" is coming from its stereo speakers.

36     INT. CAR (MICHAEL'S NEIGHBORHOOD) - DAY                    
     36

     Carla is in back with Ellen.  Thea is between them, resting
     her head against her mother's arms.  Michael is in front,
     next to Romeo, the driver, an Islander, black.  His car has
     glitter stars attached to the roof.  The stereo speakers
     are in back.

                       CARLA
                  (to Ellen)
             No cooking while you're here...No
             washing dishes...No cleaning....

                       ELLEN
             I'm not on vacation....

                       THEA
             I like Grandma's cooking....

                       ELLEN
             Thank you....

                  (pointing)
             Neptune's Folly...Our boat....

     Ellen sees, from her point of view, an old, patchwork forty-
     five-foot sailboat with a long bowsprit tied to a dock.

                       ELLEN (O.S.)
             Oh, it looks like my uncle's.  He
             taught me how to sail when I was a
             kid....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
                  (continuing)
             It's Jake's actually...Our floating
             lab....

     Ellen looks back at her son and offers a tentative smile.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Beats going to the office....

     He turns and points to the small neighborhood of houses
     they're entering.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Jake lives over there....

     Ellen looks at several small, rundown houses with Christmas
     decorations.

     Romeo, who's been eyeing Ellen in his rearview mirror,
     picks up his "tour guide" microphone and lowers the stereo
     player and starts singing, doing a perfect imitation of Nat
     King Cole, singing the same song.  Michael and Carla grin
     and Thea pulls herself forward to watch.  Ellen catches on
     and laughs.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Romeo does Tony Bennet and Johnny
             Mathis too.  But they all sound
             like Nat King Cole....

     Romeo grins and keeps on singing.

38     MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY                              
     38

     The Cadillac makes its way to a house like the others and
     stops.  A Jeep is parked in the drive.  An outbuilding,
     Carla's studio, is nearby.  A small dock is in front.
     Despite its condition, the house is charming and is
     situated right on the beach.  Romeo is still singing.

     The family piles out.  Thea heads for the dock.

                       MICHAEL
             I'll help you with the bags, Romeo....

                       ROMEO
             You can take the big one....

     Michael laughs.

                       CARLA
             It sure is good to be home....

                       MICHAEL
             It sure is....

     Romeo hums as he and Michael start unloading luggage.
     Carla checks the backseat.  Ellen stretches and looks at
     the house, trying to hide her mother's concern about the way
     her son is living.  Carla sees her and smiles and puts her
     arm around her.

                       CARLA
             It'll grow on you.

                       ELLEN
             I like it.  Really....

     She looks at Carla and finds herself smiling back.

                       CARLA
             It has its virtues.  It hasn't
             fallen down yet....

                       THEA (O.S.)
             Watch me, Grandma....

     Ellen turns and sees Thea just grabbing an old automobile
     tire which is suspended by a rope from a beam on the dock.

                       ELLEN
             Stop!

     Thea swings out over the water and Ellen runs toward her.
     Carla and Michael follow.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             Thea!  Get down from there...Thea!

     Thea swings back to the dock and lets go of the tire,
     looking from  her mother to her grandmother, not sure what
     she's supposed to do.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing;
                  as she
                  approaches)
             No, no...It's too dangerous....

                       CARLA
             Not today.  Come on, Thea....

     She moves to her daughter to pick her up and Thea balks.
     Her exhaustion from the trip is too much.  She starts to
     cry.

                       THEA
             Daddy, why can't I...?

                       CARLA
                  (becoming
                  angry)
             Did you hear what I said?  Come
             inside....

                       THEA
             I don't want to.  I want to swing....

     Thea grabs the tire and Carla grabs her and Thea starts
     screaming through her tears.

                       CARLA
             You can swing later.  We have to
             unpack now....

     Thea struggles in Carla's arms as they start for the house.

                       ELLEN
             Oh, I didn't mean....
                  (trying to
                  lighten
                  the moment)
             I'm being such a Grandma....

                       MICHAEL
             Come on, I'll show you around.

     Michael takes her arm and they start for the studio.

                       ELLEN
             I didn't mean to start that....

                       MICHAEL
                  (smiling)
             Don't be such a Grandma...I was
             always climbing something....

                       ELLEN
             You were a monkey....

     Thea is heard crying as Carla takes her into the house and
     they move on to the studio.

39     INT. STUDIO - DAY                              
     39

     An enormous abstract metal sculpture sits center room.  It
     has a huge gaping crevice near its top, not unlike a mouth.

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
                  (as they
                  approach)
             All you all right?

                       ELLEN (O.S.)
             I'm fine....

     Ellen finds a smile for her son as they enter the studio.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             How are you doing?

                       MICHAEL
                  (shrugging)
             Okay.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             We haven't had a real talk, have we?
             We'll do that before I go.

     He nods.  She studies his concern.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             I'll be all right, Michael.

                       MICHAEL
                  (finding
                  his smile)
             Good.  So will I....

     They look at each other for a moment, then his gaze shifts
     to the piece of sculpture.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.'
             Local government commissioned it.
             For the public beach....

                       CARLA (O.S.)
                  (yelling from
                  the house)
             We forgot to stop at the store.

     Ellen studies the piece of sculpture.  The studio is filled
     with other metal pieces and Carla's tools, which include
     tanks of gas and welder's gear.  Ellen doesn't quite know
     what to make of it.

                       MICHAEL
                  (yelling back)
             Make a list.

                       CARLA (O.S.)
             We need milk....

                       MICHAEL
             Big unveiling ceremony in a couple
             of weeks....

                       CARLA (O.S.)
             We need beer....

                       MICHAEL
             I'll be right there.

     She looks at him, not quite sure what to say.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Incredible, isn't it?

     His grin is contagious and she smiles and they start out
     together.

     The huge abstract sculpture, with its gaping crevice of a
     mouth, fills our vision.

44     THE WATER - DAY                                   
     44

     Ellen swims off the beach by Michael's house.  She is the
     only person in sight.

44-A     BENEATH THE WATER - DAY                              
     44-A

     Ellen is seen from the point of view of something watching
     her, stalking her, as she swims.  We move closer until
     we're beneath her.  She stops swimming and treads water.
     We move closer and closer.

     Ellen sees what's coming toward her and her expression
     floods with terror.  She starts swimming as fast as she can.
     The water becomes violent as she's attacked.  She struggles
     and the water begins to fill with blood.  Her blood.

45     THEA'S ROOM - NIGHT

     Ellen's eyes pop open, wide.  Her face is still filled 
     with fear.

46     BENEATH THE WATER - DAY                              
     46

     From the point of view of someone, something, we move slowly
     through the water, exploring the seascape, which is filled
     with exotic plants and fish and, nearby, the old wreck of
     a rusting freighter.

                       JAKE (O.S.)
                  (through a
                  small underwater
                  speaker; an
                  unhappy voice)
             Stop farting around....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
                  (voice somewhat
                  garbled)
             Stop busting my hump....

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             Try the area around the wreck....

     A small wet submersible comes into view, working its way
     slowly over the flat sea bottom.  Michael, in wet suit and
     scuba gear is inside.  He's spotted a group of conch and
     parks the sub.

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             Bingo....

     He lifts the bubble and leans out and starts checking the
     conch to separate males from females.  A single conch is seen
     shooting out the appendage which it uses to move, sinking it
     into the sea bottom and pulling itself forward.

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             How many...?

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             Will you leave me alone...?

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             You tagging them...?

                       MICHAEL
             I'm separating the ladies from the
             gentlemen....

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             You moved any slower, you'd grow
             roots...We've got a schedule...shake
             it, man....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             The females have eggs....

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             We'll pass around cigars....

     Michael starts putting small round electronic tags on the
     conch, which he secures with epoxy.

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             We're being paid to see where they
             go...How they propagate....

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             If we had some decent money, I'd be
             able to read their temperatures...
             Study their motor systems....

                       MICHAEL
             If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able
             to get my work done....

     Michael swims free of the sub, to get free from the range
     of the speaker which carries Jake's voice.

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             Once a grunt, always a grunt.  You
             got no vision, Michael.  I'm getting
             a signal from the first one.  You
             tag it right?  It's buzzing.  Sounds
             like a hornet trying to get out of a
             closet....

     Michael ignores him.

47     THE BARGE - DAY                                   
     47

     Jake, an Islander, black, is listening to his headset.
     He's agitated.  Clarence and William, the surface crew,
     both Islanders, watch Jake carefully.  The barge is low
     in the water and broad of beam and is permanently moored
     to this site.  A dinghy, with an outboard, is tied to the
     barge.

                       JAKE
                  (through 
                  the phone)
             Michael!
                  (to Clarence)
             This thing working?

                       CLARENCE
             You rigged it...You spent all that
             money on an education and you come
             back looking like this....

                       JAKE
                  (yelling; on
                  the phone)
             Michael!

     Clarence shakes his head sadly, having fun.  Jake looks
     at him, annoyed.

     Michael continues to tag conch.

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             Michael...I know you can hear me....

     Michael looks toward the sub and the sound of Jake's voice,
     then continues his work.

     48-C

     A flame, almost too bright to look at, welds metal to
     metal.

     Carla works on her sculpture, adding yet another appendage
     to its trunk.  She looks off a something, then lowers the
     flame of the torch and lifts her mask and studies what she
     sees, her expression reflecting both a sadness and 
     understanding.

     From her point of view, Ellen is seen washing windows
     outside the house.  Her back is to Carla.

     Carla watches Ellen for a long moment, a sad smile finally
     working the corners of her mouth.

                       CARLA
             I was afraid to ask if you did
             windows....

     Ellen turns and sees Carla and, for just a moment, is
     troubled at being caught.  Then she offers a smile and a
     shrug.

                       ELLEN
             I don't usually...Not at these rates.

     Ellen, her hair tied back, her expression showing fatigue,
     and Carla, looking more like an auto-body worker than an
     artist, look at each other, neither sure what to say next.

                       CARLA
             I could use a half-dozen more arms
             ...I've only got two weeks to get this
             thing finished....

                       ELLEN
             Do you and Michael ever talk about
             his work...?  About spending so much
             time working in the water?

                       CARLA
             Usually it's all he talks about...You
             mustn't worry....

                       ELLEN
             I can't help it....

                       CARLA
             I used to worry...But you know what
             happens, you find out that scuba
             diving's safer than climbing into
             the bathtub....

                       ELLEN
             I shouldn't interfere...
                  (smiles)
             My mother-in-law is so neat she puts
             paper under the cuckoo clock....

                       CARLA
             Henny Youngman....

                       ELLEN
             You caught me....

                       CARLA
             You're not interfering, Ellen....

     The two women look at each other for another moment, then
     Ellen goes back to work.  Carla watches her, then flips
     down her mask and turns the flame back up and returns to
     her welding.

49     THE BARGE - DAY                                   
     49

     The sub is being secured by Clarence and William.  Michael
     is peeling out of his wet suit.  Jake is studying Michael's
     clipboard.

                       MICHAEL
                  (yelling)
             I know how to tag a damn conch....

             The readings suck....

                       MICHAEL
             Maybe it's the tags that suck....

                       JAKE
             I made them, man....

                       MICHAEL
             I stuck them on, man....

                       JAKE
             You didn't stick them on right....

                       MICHAEL
             If you made them right, it wouldn't
             happen...They leak....

                       JAKE
                  (yelling)
             A blind man could find more conch on
             a mountainside....

                       MICHAEL
             You couldn't find your ass with both
             hands....

                       JAKE
             You leave me high and dry...You come
             back looking like a zombie....

                       MICHAEL
                  (squaring
                  off)
             Hey!

                       JAKE
             Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm
             sorry about your brother....

                       MICHAEL
             Yeah, well, just stop yelling.

     Jake approaches, a big grin plastered on his face, and
     Michael backs off, shaking his head.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Come on, Jake....

     Jake wraps his arms around Michael and lifts him off the
     deck.

                       JAKE
             I missed you, is all.  It's dull
             around here working alone...Smelling
             all that sweet cologne....

                       MICHAEL
             Put me down....

                       JAKE
                  (looking at
                  Clarence and
                  William)
             They won't fight with me....

                       MICHAEL
             Put me down, damnit....

     Jake puts him down and laughs and Michael grins.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Maybe I missed you too....

                       JAKE
                  (still grinning;
                  to Clarence)
             Where the hell's the beer...?

                       CLARENCE
             Thought you'd never ask...Coming up....

                       WILLIAM
             Goes good with conch stew...King
             Conch....

     Clarence opens a cooler and pulls out four bottles of beer.

                       JAKE
                  (to William)
             Conch...conch...conch research isn't
             sexy, William.  Doesn't attract the
             big bucks.

                       WILLIAM
             Conch is very important to our
             economy.  It's a good thing to study
             ...So we'll always have them.

                       CLARENCE

                  of beer)
             Besides, no one respectable would
             hire you gents anyway...not with hair
             like that...a while ago he couldn't
             get into a restaurant.  Sign said, no
             hats...no platts...dreads, man, dreads.

     They screw the tops off the beer bottles and Jake holds his
     up.

                       JAKE
             To anything but an honest job....

     They laugh and drink.

52     INT. HOUSE - DAY                              
     52

     The Christmas tree, a shiny green fake job, glitters with
     decorations.  Thea is opening the last of her presents.  Ellen,
     Michael and Carla, who's been playing Santa Claus, Jake and
     Louisa, a very attractive Islander, black, in her midtwenties,
     sit on the floor.  They've all got drinks, and they're all 
     into Thea.

                       ELLEN (O.S.)
             Your father was six then.  Just like
             you....

                       THEA
                  (looking up)
             I'm still five....

     Jake makes a face and Louisa smiles at Ellen, who's sitting
     in a chair, taking her only pleasure from the day, her first
     Christmas since Martin's death, from Thea's joy.

                       ELLEN
             He was always getting into some sort
             of mischief....

                       JAKE
             I have no doubt....

                       MICHAEL
             Nothing out of the ordinary....

                       ELLEN
             Once he locked himself in the
             bathroom and your grandfather had to
             get the ladder and climb in through
             the window....

                       JAKE
             Bad boy....

                       MICHAEL
             I didn't do it on purpose....

                       ELLEN
                  (smiling)
             He didn't spank you very hard.

     Thea pulls new sneakers from a box.

                       THEA
             Mommy spanked me once.
                  (to her
                  parents)
             Oh, these are good.  Thank you.

     She puts them down and starts unwrapping her last present,
     a big box.  Michael takes an outrageous Hawaiian shirt from
     his box.

                       CARLA
             You're welcome.  I was the one who
             cried.

                       THEA
             Was Uncle Sean ever bad?  Did you
             ever spank him?

     Ellen reacts.  Michael covers quickly.

                       MICHAEL
             Sharp shirt, Jake....

                       JAKE
             May your sex life be as busy as your
             shirt....

                       CARLA
             Thank you....

                       JAKE
             Every tropo needs one....
                  (to Louisa)
             Don't you want to see what Santa got
             you...?

                       LOUISA
                  (eyeing him
                  mischievously)
             I'm not sure....

                       CARLA
             Marry the man and put him out of his
             misery....

                       JAKE
                  (to Louisa)
             Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm
             tall, dark and handsome...two out of
             three ain't bad....

                       LOUISA
             Don't flatter yourself....
                  (laughing)

     Thea rips the paper off the box and Michael, Carla, Jake
     and Louisa turn their attention to her excitement.  Ellen
     watches them, her smile fading as Thea moves to Jake and
     Louisa with the box.  Ellen's thoughts turn to Sean and she
     glances out the window toward the ocean.

                       THEA (O.S.)
             If I had a baby brother, I'd be the
             oldest.  I could be in charge....

     Ellen leaves the room, unobserved by the others.

                       CARLA
             Only children are my favorites.
             That means you, MaGee....

                       THEA
             My tea set.  I got my tea set.
                  (to Jake
                  and Louisa)
             Thank you....

                       LOUISA
             Everyone should have a tea set....

     Michael glances over at his mother and sees that she's
     going and moves to a window.

                       THEA (O.S.)
             It has a teapot and cups and
             saucers....

                       LOUISA (O.S.)
             And a sugar bowl and creamer....

                       THEA (O.S.)
             Can I put real tea in it?

                       LOUISA (O.S.)
             Yes, you can put real tea in it....

     Michael sees his mother staring sadly at the sea.

                       THEA (O.S.)
             Can I make sandwiches...?

                       CARLA (O.S.)
             Yes, you can make sandwiches....

     The phone rings.

                       THEA (O.S.)
                  (yelling as
                  she goes)
             I've got it.  I've got it....

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             If it's National Geographic, tell
             them we only do covers....

     Michael continues to watch his mother as the phone rings
     twice more, then is answered.

                       THEA (O.S.)
             Hello?

53     THE KITCHEN - DAY

     Thea is on a chair, holding the phone.

                       HOOPER (O.S.)
             Ho-ho-ho....

                       THEA
             Who's this?

                       HOOPER (O.S.)
             Santa Claus....

                       THEA
             Come on, Uncle Sean, I know it's
             you....

     There's stunned silence at the other end.  Thea can't
     figure it out.

                       THEA
                  (continuing)
             Uncle Sean...?

     Michael moves quickly into the room, his expression etched
     with confusion and concern.  He grabs the phone.

                       MICHAEL
             Who is this?

54     INT. APARTMENT - DAY

     Matt Hooper is standing at a window, looking out over a
     city.  He feels terrible.

                       HOOPER
             Michael...Jesus, I'm sorry.  I...Thea
             thought...I'm sorry about Sean...I
             was away...A project at the Antarctic
             ...I just heard....

     Michael has his arm around Thea, who is still on the chair.

                       MICHAEL
             Matt?

                       HOOPER (O.S.)
             Tell Thea I'm sorry....

     Michael gives Thea a squeeze and lifts her off the chair.
     She looks at her father with concern, then is attracted to
     the noise and laughter in the other room and heads for it.

                       HOOPER (O.S.)
                  (continuing)
             I don't know what the hell to say....

                       MICHAEL
             You don't have to say anything, Matt
             ...I know how you feel....

                       HOOPER
             Yeah....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             Still chasing fish?

                       HOOPER
             Still tagging conch?

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             We'll be done pretty soon....

                       HOOPER
             Tricky little devils, aren't they?
             How's the degree doing?

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             Inch by inch....

                       HOOPER
             How's Ellen?

     Ellen stands perfectly still, as though hearing something
     no one else can hear, staring with a fixed expression at
     the ocean.  She seems terribly sad.

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             She has good days and bad...I don't
             know....

                       HOOPER (O.S.)
             She's a tough lady....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             I wish there was something I could
             do....

                       HOOPER (O.S.)
             She's had a lot to deal with...She
             needs time....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             Would you talk to her?  She's got it
             in her head that the shark came for
             him.  She still blames it for my
             father's death....

                       HOOPER (O.S.)

     where he was watching his mother.

                       MICHAEL
             I miss him, Matt.  I still can't
             believe he's gone.

                       CARLA (O.S.)
             Tell Matt he should be here....

                       HOOPER
             I wish I was...Remember the Christmas
             I spent with you on the island?  You
             were still kids...Martin put on that
             stupid Santa Claus suit....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             The stuffing came out of the pillow
             he was wearing....

                       HOOPER
             Feathers all over the place....

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             It was like having snow in the house
             ...Jesus, I miss them.

                       THEA (O.S.)
                  (heard yelling)
             Tell Uncle Matt my new Teddy bear
             can move its arms and legs.

                       HOOPER
                  (beginning
                  to crack)

     Michael is beginning to cry.  The silence builds as he and
     Matt deal with the memory of Sean and Martin.

                       HOOPER (O.S.)
                  (pulling
                  himself together)
             Let me speak to Ellen....

                       MICHAEL
             I'll get her.  Have a good Christmas,
             Matt....

                       HOOPER (O.S.)
             You too, Michael....

     Michael puts the phone down and collects himself, then
     leaves.  A moment later Carla moves into the kitchen and
     picks up the phone.

                       CARLA
             I thought I'd steal a moment with my
             second favorite marine biologist.

                       HOOPER (O.S.)
             I was going to bring you back a
             penguin I couldn't find one that
             wanted to winter in the Bahamas....

     She smiles, a little.

     Ellen stares out to sea, her expression unchanged.  Michael
     moves out of the house, working to put on a "face" for her.

                       MICHAEL
             Matt's on the phone.

     She turns and heads for the house, as though Michael's not
     there.  As she passes, she stops and looks at him.

                       ELLEN
             I want you to give up your work....

                       MICHAEL
             Mom, please don't start that
             again....

                       ELLEN
             You could teach...You could....

                       MICHAEL
             I'm not going to quit now....

                       ELLEN
             You're all I have left...I don't
             want you going in the water....

     He puts his hands on her shoulders.

                       MICHAEL
             What I do is perfectly safe.  Jake
             and I are scientists.  One of these
             days we'll be PHDs...Perfectly
             Harmless Derelicts...We know what
             we're doing.  There's nothing to
             worry about.  It's warm water here,
             remember?  Great whites hate it...
             Wrinkles their skin...Makes them
             look like prunes....

     He smiles and she manages a small one in return.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Come on...You can do better than
             that.  You've got a big one in there
             somewhere....

     Her smile grows.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             A little better.  But you'll have to
             do better than that.  Now go talk to
             Matt.  He misses you.

     He kisses her and she offers a genuine smile, then moves
     into the house.  He watches her go, still concerned.

66     THE BEACH - DAY                                   
     66

     Thea and Ellen are at the water's edge, building a sand
     castle.  Up the beach, at the point, there's a speedboat
     near the shore.  Hoagie is wading out to it, holding out
     an envelope, which the man in the boat finally is able to
     grab.

                       ELLEN
             We have to dig it deep so the water
             will go all the way around...So we
             can swim to it....

                       THEA
             You're silly....

     They dig the moat, Thea with her shovel.  Ellen with her
     hands.

                       ELLEN
             It will be Buckingham Palace and
             you'll be Princess Di and there'll
             be a big Parade of Horse Guards
             and you'll ride in a golden
             carriage.

     Thea giggles and Ellen smiles her pleasure at being able 
     to do that, even as she begins to shudder, as though her body
     temperature has suddenly dropped thirty degrees, and she
     looks out over the water, feeling something which fills her
     with fear.

                       ELLEN
                  (quietly; with
                  conviction;
                  as though
                  talking to
                  something
                  unseen)
             You're coming, aren't you...?

                       THEA (O.S.)
             Who's coming?

     Ellen looks around.  Thea is still digging.

                       ELLEN
             No one.  Nothing.
                  (starts
                  digging)
             We've got to get this finished before
             the tide comes in.

                       THEA
             It's not nice to be evasive.

     Ellen looks at her, still surprised by what her granddaughter
     is capable of saying.  The man in the boat looks in the
     envelope as Hoagie starts wading back to the beach.

                       THEA
                  (continuing)
             My mother says that to my father.

     Ellen laughs.

                       MAN IN THE BOAT
             Next time don't keep me waiting....

                       HOAGIE
                  (shouting;
                  unhappy)
             Yeah...yeah...yeah....

     Ellen has turned and watches as the speedboat roars off and
     Hoagie grab his fishing gear and starts down the beach
     toward her.  Thea keeps digging.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing;
                  as he spots
                  Ellen; a big
                  smile)
             Hello, Ellen....

     He waves.  She watches as he comes closer.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             I don't know why I fish here...Never
             catch anything...Must be a sign under
             the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'

                       THEA
             You're the man who drives the plane.

                       ELLEN
                  (correcting her)
             Flies the plane....

                       HOAGIE
             Mostly it feels like driving.  You
             digging for buried treasure?

                       THEA
             We're building a sand castle.

     Hoagie sets his gear down and squats to take a closer look.
     He eyes Thea playfully.

                       HOAGIE
             You the architect?

                       THEA
             I'm the artist.  Like my mother.

     Hoagie grins at her, then eyes Ellen, who's looking out
     over the water again, her expression set with foreboding.

67     NEPTUNE'S FOLLY - DAY                              
     67

     Conch larva are seen under a microscope.

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             You know why?  That's what happens
             when you lead one of those Norman
             Rockwell sheltered lives.  That's
             what's wrong with you....

     Michael is revealed at the microscope, studying the conch
     larva.  A large fish tank, with is filled with them --
     they can't be seen with the naked eye -- is nearby.

                       MICHAEL
             You can talk...You weren't exactly a
             deprived kid.  Next thing you're going
             to start about going back to your
             roots and that rock reggae crap.  Cut
             that hair and you're nothing but a
             three-piece suit....

     Jake is at the bench which holds lab equipment and tools,
     writing figures in a notebook.  Above him are shelves of
     bottled, preserved specimens.  Clarence is drumming a native
     rhythm against a bulkhead.  It's slowly getting on Jake's
     nerves.

                       JAKE
             We have three months of work and
             approximately no money left to
             support it....

                       CLARENCE
             Spent it all on beer....

     Jake gives Clarence a dirty look and turns back to Michael.

                       JAKE
             Bahamian Fisheries Department isn't
             exactly Fort Knox....

     He slides the notebook to Michael, who studies the figures.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             Office of Naval Research has some
             money....

                       MICHAEL
             Forget it....

                       JAKE
             Money is money....

                       MICHAEL
             They put bombs on dolphins....

                       JAKE
             I know a guy who got money from them
             to study eels....

                       CLARENCE
             Tough to put a bomb on an eel....

     Jake gives Clarence another dirty look.

                       JAKE
                  (to Michael)
             I'm busting my ass to get my degree...
             I'm tired of all this paradise shit....

     Jake moves for the cabin door, to the deck above.

                       MICHAEL
             I like it here....

     Michael follows Jake.

67-A     TOPSIDE - DAY                                   
     67-A

     Jake moves above decks.

                       JAKE
             A regular tropo...Spend the rest of
             your life in a bathing suit, living
             off nickel and dime grants.  You
             want to be a bum all your life, be
             my guest.  Not me.  I'm not growing
             old chasing snails and dying from
             terminal crotch rot....

                       MICHAEL
             It's not a bad life, Jake....

                       JAKE
             You're afraid of the competition out
             there....

                       CLARENCE
                  (coming topside;
                  doing his drumbeat
                  as he goes)
             Sweet breezes...Sweet women....

                       JAKE
                  (to Clarence)
             You have something to say about
             everything....

     Clarence keeps drumming.

                       MICHAEL
             He's just trying to keep you
             from disappearing up your own....

                       JAKE
             You're nothing but a bunch of
             goddamn romantics.  You're never
             going to amount to anything.

     Jake heads for the dinghy which is tied up next to the boat.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing;
                  as he goes)
             I expect to come back here some day
             and find you trying to teach conch
             to talk.  And knock off that stupid
             drumming....

     Clarence stops in midbeat, creating a pocket of silence for
     William, who's just coming down the dock carrying two six-
     packs of beer.

                       WILLIAM
             I like conch....

     Jake gives him a dirty look, leaving poor William confused.
     Michael shakes his head, suppressing a grin.

68     THE BEACH - DAY                                   
     68

     Thea works on her sand castle, shaping the building
     inside the moat.

     Ellen and Hoagie sit at the water's edge, far enough away
     not to be heard.  She stares out at the water.  He studies
     her.  She looks at him finally, trying to rationalize the
     conversation they've already had.

                       ELLEN
             I don't know why I've told you all
             this.  I hardly know you.

                       HOAGIE
             Sometimes talking to a stranger is
             easier....

                       ELLEN
             I...I can't explain it.  It's just
             something I feel.

                       HOAGIE
             I always listen to my feelings....

     She shifts her gaze back out over the water.

                       ELLEN
             Sometimes I think I'm going crazy.
             The nightmares....

                       HOAGIE
             It could have been an accident....

                       ELLEN
                  (looking at him)
             It was no accident....

                       HOAGIE
             I'm not saying you're wrong, just
             that there are other possibilities....

                       ELLEN
             When it killed Sean it was like a
             stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute
             certainty that it had come for him.
             I knew that.  I know it's coming....

     She's moving toward the edge, trembling now and he takes
     her hand and holds it between them.

                       ELLEN
                  (suddenly;
                  matter-of-
                  factly)
             What's it cost to take a ride on
             that plane...?

                       THEA (O.S.)
             The water's coming in...The water's
             coming in....

     Ellen stands and they move together to Thea.

                       HOAGIE
             Depends on where you want to go....

                       ELLEN
             Doesn't matter....

                       THEA
             Hurry!

                       HOAGIE
             Just like that?

                       ELLEN
                  (laughing)
             Just like that....

     She turns her attention to Thea, who's helping the water
     fill her moat.

69     INT. PLANE - DAY                              
     69

     Hoagie and Ellen are side by side in a private aircraft.

                       HOAGIE
                  (in the midst
                  of it)
             He was struck by lightning, this
             man, seven times.  Took his toenail,
             his shoe, his hat...set his hair on
             fire.  But it didn't kill him.  No
             one could explain that....

     She glances at him, amused by his efforts to entertain her.

                       ELLEN
             How can you just take the plane like
             this?

                       HOAGIE
             Boss' day off...Take the wheel....

                       ELLEN
             I can't....

                       HOAGIE
             Sure you can....

                       ELLEN
             I don't know how....

                       HOAGIE
             No one does till they learn....

     He lets go of the wheel and the plane starts to lose
     altitude.

                       ELLEN
             What are you doing?

                       HOAGIE
             If you don't take it, we'll be
             swimming in a minute.

     She hesitates, then grabs the wheel in front of her and he
     puts a hand on one of hers and guides the wheel back so the
     plane levels off.  She's gripping the wheel so tightly her
     knuckles are turning white.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             Easy does it.  Hold her gently.
             She'll damn near fly herself.

     She tries to relax, and after a few moments, he takes his
     hand off hers.  She tenses.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             It's just like driving a car....

                       ELLEN
             Where do I pull off...?

                       HOAGIE
                  (laughing)
             You're doing fine.  I'll keep you
             out of trouble.  Relax....

     Ellen stares straight ahead, trying to get the feel of it.

                       ELLEN
             Where are we going?

     He answers with a mischievous grin.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             I'm only doing this to get out of my
             family's hair....

                       HOAGIE
             One time I was flying supplies up
             the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....

                       ELLEN
             You're not going to tell me, are you?

                       HOAGIE
             Got picked up by a tribe of head-
             hunters....

                       ELLEN
             You're impossible....

                       HOAGIE
             They took me to the chief, who took
             a long look at me, then took me in
             his hut....

                       ELLEN
             The plane's turning....

     The plane is indeed starting to slip into a gentle banking
     turn.  It's Hoagie's doing.  He's nudging his wheel
     slightly.

                       HOAGIE
             In the hut, sitting on a pole was a
             shrunken head.  My head.  Me.

     She glances at him, then looks ahead, not sure whether she's
     should be nervous about the plane's behavior.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             It was like looking into one of those
             mirrors which says, objects may be
             closer than they appear.  Chief
             said, there are two of everybody in
             the world and since we already have
             one of you, the other one can go.

     Ellen laughs.  Hoagie grins.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             How do you like flying?

                       ELLEN
             It's wonderful....

     She eases the plane into more of a turn and enjoys the
     sensation.  She glances at him and he nods that she's doing
     just fine.

                       HOAGIE
             You are crazy, Ellen.  No matter
             what anyone says....

     She laughs and turns her attention to flying.

70     AN ISLAND - NATIVE QUARTER - DAY                    
     70

     A native festival, a parade filled with masked and costumed
     dancers and musicians and marchers, blasts its way through
     the ancient, narrow streets of an early Bahamian settlement.

     Hoagie, wearing a windbreaker, and Ellen, who's changed her
     clothes, thread their way through the throng, moving like
     Salmon upstream against the flow of the mass of humanity
     moving the other way.  She's fascinated by the music and
     noise and color of what's around her.

                       HOAGIE
                  (yelling)
             A few more streets....

     She casts a smile at him, then returns her attention to the 
     parade.  Hoagie navigates them through the crowd.

71     A STREET - DAY                                   
     71

     Hoagie leads Ellen up a street no wider than an alley.  The
     old houses seem to lean toward each other.  The street is
     empty because its residents are all at the festival, whose
     noise follows them as they move away from it.

                       HOAGIE
             A few more houses....

     They move on.

72     EXT. HOUSE - DAY                              
     72

     Ellen watches from the street as Hoagie and Charles
     Townsend, an islander, black, talk quietly on the porch.
     She sees Hoagie take a small, bulging envelope from his
     pocket and give it to Charles, who looks inside, smiles,
     then puts it in his pocket.  The two men shake hands.

73     THE BARGE - DAY                                   
     73

     Michael and Clarence are sitting at the edge of it, their
     feet in the water.  William is flanked out near the winch,
     reading.

                       MICHAEL
                  (on the horn)
             How many?

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             Stop busting my hump....

                       MICHAEL
             Oh, it's okay for you, but not for
             me....

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm
             counting... spade work....

74     BENEATH THE SURFACE - DAY                         
     74

     Jake maneuvers the sub above an enormous group of conch,
     trying to take measure of what he's come across.

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             I wish you wouldn't say that....

                       JAKE
             What?

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             Spade's a garden tool....

     Jake looks up from his clipboard and sees staring at him,
     the dead black eye of a fish whose pupil looks to be about
     the size of a bowling ball.  He freezes, staring back at it.

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
                  (continuing)
             Trouble with you, Jake, is you have
             no sense of humor....

                       JAKE
                  (finding
                  his voice)
             Holy shit!

     The eye disappears and Jake starts looking for it.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             Got a big fish down here....

75     THE BARGE - DAY                                   
     75

     Michael stands to scan the water and the shark explodes out
     of the water, over the low side of the barge, passing within
     a few feet of Clarence, who freezes, his mouth open with
     terrified surprise, and goes straight for Michael, who
     throws himself to the deck.  The shark misses him by inches,
     unable to close its great jaws about him because of the
     width of the barge.  As quickly as it appeared, the shark
     is gone.

76     THE STREET - DAY                              
     76

     Hoagie and Ellen fight their way across the street, through
     the festival parade.  The noise is deafening.

     Suddenly Ellen stops.  She shudders as she did on the beach.
     Hoagie looks back and sees her and threads his way to her,
     bumping into several dancers as he goes.  She's staring off
     into the distance, seeing something beyond the reach of her
     vision.

                       HOAGIE
             What's wrong?

                       ELLEN
             Nothing....

     She looks at him and manufactures a smile.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             I'm fine.

                       HOAGIE
             No, you're not....

                       ELLEN
             I'm terrific... Come on....

     She grabs his hand and pulls him into a group of dancers,
     picking up their rhythm, trying desperately to get into
     it.  He's forced to dance with her, though every bone in
     his body resists the idea.

                       HOAGIE
                  (yelling above
                  the din)
             Give it up....

     She ignores him, throwing every ounce of energy she has
     into the dancing.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing;
                  yelling)
             You can't keep doing this....

     Again she ignores him and he's bumped into and they lose
     each other for a moment.  She dances on and he has to run
     to catch her.  He takes her arm and stops her.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             I can't keep doing this....

     The merrymakers pass around them like a river rushes past
     a rock.  A band passes them and they can hardly hear
     themselves think.

                       ELLEN
                  (shouting)
             You promised me a drink....

                       HOAGIE
                  (shouting back)
             Sharks come and go, Ellen.  People
             don't have anything to do with it....

                       ELLEN
                  (shouting)
             The kind with an umbrella in it....

                       HOAGIE
             Give it up... Kick it in the ass...
             Get on with your life....

     The band passes and the noise settles, momentarily, to a
     dull roar as more dancers move around them.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             I know what you're going through.
             The nightmares will go away...
                  (grins)
             I ever tell you about the time I flew
             the pandas from China to a Zoo?  The
             lady panda fell in love with me....

     Ellen starts to laugh.  She can't stop herself.  The music
     grows louder.  He holds out his hand and she looks at it,
     then takes it and they look at each other for a long moment.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             A drink with an umbrella in it....

                       ELLEN
             A big one....

                       HOAGIE
             A big one....

     They push their way through the parade until they disappear
     from view.

79     THE BARGE - DAY                                   
     79

     Clarence and William, still excited, and not a little
     frightened, glance at the water as they secure the sub.

             CLARENCE                  WILLIAM
     Never saw anything that          Should have gone for
     big.  Never...               Jake.
         (to Michael)              (to Jake;
     I was right next to you.         explaining
     The bastard went right              himself)
     past me....               Had you right there.
                         Why would it come up...?

     Michael is still shaky, trying to get control of himself.
     Jake's not buying any of it.

                       CLARENCE
             What the hell's it doing in warm
             water anyway...?

                       JAKE
             What difference does it make?  It's
             here....

     Michael turns from the water and looks at Jake.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             You guys are making this into some-
             thing that just isn't so... It's just
             a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful
             shark.  Don't say anything to anyone.
             The locals find out they'll panic.
             They'll want to kill it.
                  (his excitement
                  growing)
             We've got us a great white, Michael.
             We're going to do us some real
             research....

                       MICHAEL
                  (quietly;
                  matter-of-
                  factly)
             Don't say anything about this to my
             mother....

     Michael looks back out over the water.

                       JAKE
             Oh, shit, man, I'm sorry....

     He moves to Michael.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             I didn't mean to run off at the mouth
             like that.  She's going through a lot.
             I know you re hurting about your
             brother....

     Michael doesn't answer.  He continues to stare at the sea,
     his expression filled with ambivalence.  Jake puts his arm
     around him.

79-A     EXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT                         
     79-A

     Headlights break the darkness as a car pulls up.  Ellen gets
     out.

                       ELLEN
             Good night....

     She shakes his hand and starts to take it back and he holds
     it, looking at her in a way that suggests he'd like more.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             Please, Hoagie....

     He smiles and lets go of her hand.

                       HOAGIE
             Good night, Ellen....

     The car pulls away and Ellen starts for the house.

                       CARLA (0.S.)
             Come to bed....

79-B     INT. HOUSE - NIGHT - BEDROOM                         
     79-B

     Michael stands at the window, in the dark, watching his
     mother.  He's seen and heard it all.  Carla is in bed.

                       CARLA
             He took her sightseeing.  You
             work.. .I work... She needs someone to
             help take her mind off things....

     He looks at her, his expression troubled.  She smiles and
     pats the bed next to him.

                       CARLA
                  (continuing)
             I'll take your mind off things,
             sailor....

     He finds a small smile and moves to her open arms.
     can be heard moving into the house.

80     INT. CASINO - NIGHT                              
     80

     Playing cards settle softly on a felt table. Blackjack
     hands are being dealt to five players.

     Louisa deals, her fast hands expertly distributing the last
     of the "up" cards.  She deals her own, then glances past the
     players as they study their cards.

     Jake, Carla, Ellen and Michael, all dressed for a big
     night out,. stand in back of the players.  Jake points to
     his watch impatiently.

                       JAKE
                  (mouthing the
                  words silently)
             How much longer?  This is supposed
             to be your party.

                       LOUISA
                  (mouthing back;
                  smiling)
             In a few minutes....

     Louisa starts dealing the first "hits."

     Michael glances about.  He seems on edge.

                       MICHAEL
             I'll check the table....

     Michael leaves, heading for another room.  Ellen watches
     him go, exposing her concern for his troubled mood.

                       CARLA
                  (to Ellen)
             You want to try your hand at
             something...?

                       ELLEN
          I'd be afraid of losing....

                       JAKE
             I'm afraid of winning.  I wouldn't
             know what to do with the money....

                       CARLA
             Fat chance, cowboy....

     Jake grins as a groundswell of excitement carries across
     the room, which is filled with gamblers and decorations
     for New Year's Eve.  The joint is jumping.  They look
     for its source and see Hoagie at the crap table, accepting
     the congratulations of those around him.  He smiles as a
     large pile of chips is raked in front of him, adding to
     the pile he already has.  Irma, an Islander, light-skinned
     who's dressed in a low-cut satin gown with sequins, is
     hanging on him.

                       CARLA
                  (continuing)
             Come on... I want to see....

     Jake, Ellen on one arm, Carla on the other, moves across
     the room as Hoagie rolls again, and wins again.

81     THE CRAP TABLE                                   
     81

     Hoagie sees them approaching as the pile of chips in front
     of him grows.  He smiles at Ellen, as he's given the dice
     again.  Irma gives Ellen a look.  The excitement at the
     table is high.  Bets are being placed. Everyone is eyeing
     Hoagie, who is slightly "pissed" and has a mischievous glint
     in his eye.

                       HOAGIE
             Couple of more passes and I'll buy
             my own airplane.. Hell, maybe my own
             airline....

                       ELLEN
                  (eyeing the
                  chips)
             You're not going to bet it all....

                       HOAGIE
             All or nothing.  You want to roll
             them for me?

                       ELLEN
             No!

     Irma doesn't know what to make of Hoagie's interest in
     Ellen.  Hoagie grins, closes his eyes for a moment, making
     his secret incantation, then opens them, smiles once more
     at Ellen and rolls.  The dice skip down the table, bounce
     off the other end and settle.  A soft moan goes up from
     the people around the table.  Hoagie's grin wavers, then
     is restored.  Irma has just seen her big night go up in
     smoke.

                       HOUSE MAN (O.S.)
             Snake eyes....

                       ELLEN
             Is that bad?

                       HOAGIE
             Depends on your point of view....

     He pushes his chips toward the center of the table, accepting
     condolences from a few of the players, then steps away..

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us
             all a drink....

                       JAKE
             We'll buy you one.  We're having a
             party....

                       CARLA
             Louisa's birthday....

                       HOAGIE
             On New Year's Eve?

                       CARLA
             Beats Halloween....

     They all start for the lounge.  Louisa is seen talking to
     her relief dealer.  Irma takes Hoagie's arm.

                       ELLEN
                  (to Jake)
             When do you and Louisa get to see
             each other?  Between your working
             days and her working nights. ...

                       JAKE
                  (laughing)
             I get her at two in the morning,
             when she's at her best.  Besides,
             how many marine biologists can cut
             cards with one hand and fan a
             deck....

     They thread their way through the gaming tables.

                       JAKE (0.S.)
                  (continuing)
             She's the Albert Einstein of gambling.
             Quote the odds on every game in the
             house....

82     THE LOUNGE - NIGHT                              
     82

     A trio plays softly.  A dozen couples dance.  The tables
     are full.  Hats, horns and decorations are everywhere.
     Ellen, Hoagie, Irma, Michael, Carla, Jake and Louisa,
     who's had time to make a fast change and looks terrific,
     wait as Shirley, their waitress, sets the last of their
     drinks on the table.

                       SHIRLEY
             On the house....

     Jake grins at her, then at the others.

                       JAKE
             I knew there was a reason I could
             afford this.
                  (toasting
                  Louisa)
             To the woman of my dreams.. Who
             grows more beautiful....

                       LOUISA
             Here it comes....

                       JAKE
             Who grows more beautiful....

                       LOUISA
             Here comes the cow ca-ca....

                       JAKE
                  (pressing on)
             More beautiful with each passing
             minute...

                       LOUISA
             I told you....

                       JAKE
             Now wait a minute... I'm being
             serious here....

                       LOUISA
             Oh, Jake...
                  (smiles)

                       JAKE
             Happy birthday, darling. ...

     They raise their glasses in a chorus of "Happy Birthday,"
     then drinking.  Louisa grins, then eyes Jake.

                       LOUISA
             Don't go weak in the knees on me
             tonight....

                       JAKE
             I just want to make an honest woman
             of you....

                       LOUISA
             I'm not going to marry you until you
             straighten out your life and your hair.

     Irma watches it all, her gaze shifting from face to face as
     though she's watching a tennis match.

                       CARLA
             At least he doesn't have a beard....

                       ELLEN
                  (to Louisa)
             Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?

                       JAKE
             She's in management....

                       LOUISA
             I'm training to....

                       JAKE
             Manage the whole damn place some day.
             I'm looking forward to living in the
             style to which I would like to become
             accustomed....

                       LOUISA
             I'd have to manage a nookie parlor
             to do that....

     Hoagie roars.  Ellen laughs.  Carla nearly spits out her
     drink.  Irma's  not sure what's going on.

                       HOAGIE
             I knew a piano player once who....

                       CARLA
             Never mind.

     Michael eyes Hoagie, none too pleased that he's joined them.
     Hoagie smiles at him and Michael smiles back steadily, a
     kind of challenge.

                       LOUISA
             You want to marry me, you' re going to
             have to straighten out your life....

                       ELLEN
                  (getting
                  into it)
             He looks perfectly responsible to me....

                       LOUISA
             Jake's idea of responsibility ends with
             dressing himself in the morning....

                       ELLEN
                  (teasing)
             Well, I think he's cute....

                       JAKE
             Woman has taste....

                       LOUISA
             When he has a pillow over his head....

                       JAKE
             You want to be careful how you talk
             to me... I'm about to become
             famous...You should see....

             MICHAEL                  LOUISA
         (almost coming          No shop talk... You
         out of his               promised....
         chair)
     Jake!

                       JAKE
                  (catching
                  himself)
             Sorry....

     Michael starts to breathe again.  Hoagie stands.

                       HOAGIE
                  (to Ellen)
             Would you suffer through a dance with
             me?

                       ELLEN
                  (standing)
             You'll be sorry.

     Michael shifts his gaze from Jake, who he's angry at, to
     Hoagie and his mother, a situation that's creating fresh
     alarm.  They're moving to the dance floor.  Irma is
     abjectly unhappy.

                       HOAGIE
             I have two right feet.

                       ELLEN
             Good.  I have two left....

                       CARLA
                  (to Michael)
             Will you lighten up.  This is
             supposed to be a party....

                       LOUISA
             My party....

                       JAKE
             He's depressed because he's started
             to count conch when he goes to
             sleep....

     Michael casts an unhappy look at Jake, then stands.

                       MICHAEL
             Excuse me....

     He heads for the dance floor.

83     THE DANCE FLOOR                                   
     83

     Ellen smiles at Hoagie, caught up in the story he's started
     telling her.  He stops when he sees Michael heading for
     them.  She sees her son.

                       MICHAEL
                  (as lightly as
                  he can)
             Mind if I cut in?  Your date's
             lonely....

                       HOAGIE
             The world would be a better place if
             more sons danced with their mothers.

     Hoagie returns to the table and Michael and Ellen start
     dancing.

                       MICHAEL
                  (finally; a
                  trace of
                  sarcasm)
             You're having a good time....

                       ELLEN
             I am.

     Michael eyes Hoagie, who's joining the others, already
     getting caught up in their conversation.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             Stop pouting.  You look like you did
             when you were six and didn't get
             something you wanted.

     He looks at her.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             I enjoy his company....

                       MICHAEL
             I don't like him chasing around
             after you...I don't trust him....

                       ELLEN
             He's not chasing and I'm not running.
             And that's ridiculous....

     Michael clams up and she studies him.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             I've been a pain in the ass and I'm
             sorry.

     He looks at her quizzically.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             I'm not going to bother you anymore
             about your work....

                       MICHAEL
             You're not a pain in the ass....

                       ELLEN
             Will you let me finish.  I've been
             working on this all day.

     She smiles at him, then becomes serious.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             Your brother's death almost killed
             me.  I m not sure I'll ever get over
             it.  But I can't allow myself to
             keep on believing it was intentional.
             I'm not going to let an obsession
             run my life.

     Michael stares at his mother uncomfortably.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             It's not easy.  None of it is.  I
             have to find some way to get on with
             my life and I'm going to try.  I
             finally figured that out.  I'm going
             to do my best....

                       MICHAEL
             Good.

     He doesn't seem all that happy.

                       ELLEN
             That's it?  Good...I thought you'd
             break out the champagne....

                       MICHAEL
             I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....

                       ELLEN
             No more sharks.  I'll stay for another
             week, then....

                       MICHAEL
             You just got here....

                       ELLEN
                  (laughing)
             Children are never satisfied.  I have
             my house, my friends, my job...My
             life, Michael.  I have to live it.
             Besides, I'll be back.  Now show
             your mother what a good dancer you
             are.

     She rests her head on his shoulder and they dance on.  His
     expression reveals confusion.  He's caught between her effort
     to get rid of an idea and his suspicion that it may be true.

84     THE DOCK - DAY                                   
     84

     Michael walks from the Jeep to Neptune's Folly.  It's the
     beginning of a new day and he hasn't slept and looks
     terrible.

85     NEPTUNE'S FOLLY - DAY                              
     85

     He boards her, looking for Clarence and William.

                       MICHAEL
             Where is everybody?

                       JAKE (0.S.)
             Down here....

     Michael heads for the cabin.

86     BELOW DECKS - DAY                              
     86

     Jake is at the bench, soldering wires into a small cylin-
     drical device.  Another device like it is nearby on the bench
     along with several small speakers and an Oscilloscope.

                       MICHAEL
             What happened to Clarence and...?

                       JAKE
             Gave them the day off....

     Michael moves to the bench, not sure what's going on.  He
     watches Jake work.

                       MICHAEL
             What for?  We've got a job to finish
             ...Why are you making the monitor?

                       JAKE
             As the sun slowly sets in the West,
             we bid a fond farewell to the family
             of conch....

     As Jake speaks he presses the barbs from the monitor to
     Michael's chest and the sound of his heart is heard over a
     speaker and its rhythms are seen on the oscilloscope.

                       MICHAEL
                  (pissed off)
             What the hell are you talking about?

     Jake puts the barbs against his chest and his heart is
     heard and seen.

                       JAKE
             We're out of money, partner.. We wrap
             it up, write it up and turn it in...
             How come your heart sounds stronger
             than mine?  You got two of them...?

                       MICHAEL
             We don't write up anything until
             we're done....

                       JAKE
             Okay.. .we're done, man....

                       MICHAEL
             When we got the grant....

                       JAKE
             When I got the grant.....

                       MICHAEL
             When I signed on....

                       JAKE
             When I invited you...

                       MICHAEL
             We got it together, Jake....

                       JAKE
             Okay...we got it together....

                       MICHAEL
                  (voice rising)
             We have at least three months' work
             left.  We can't write a report...We
             don't know enough....

                       JAKE
             We've got a rare bird here, Michael.
             Great whites don't come to the
             Bahamas.  There's never been one
             down here before.  I'm not just
             going to let it swim away.

                       MICHAEL
             My name goes on that report.  It's a
             half-assed job, I don't get my
             doctorate.  Neither do you....

                       JAKE
             The shark will get it for us.

     Michael takes a hard look at him, then starts to leave.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             I thought we were planning a long
             rosy future together.

                       MICHAEL
             So did I....

     Jake goes after him.

                       JAKE
             Hey!

     He grabs Michael and they face each other.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             Even if it's there, it won't be
             around forever.  It'll figure out
             the water's too warm and take off.
             We'll never get this chance again....
             It's what we were trained for, for
             Christ's sake.  It's why you spent
             all that time on the books....

     He looks at Michael, who's hesitating.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing;
                  grinning)
             We'll give it a few days, then it's
             back to the snails.  Indulge me,
             Michael....

     There's a long moment of silence as the two men stare at
     each other.

                       MICHAEL
                  (finally)
             I don't know shit about electronics....

                       JAKE
                  (laughing)
             You don't know shit about anything.
             Time you learned....

87     EXT. HOUSE - DAY                              
     87

                       CARLA (O.S.)
                  (yelling)
             This is the third time this month
             you've forgotten to take it out.

     She appears around the corner hauling a large plastic bag
     of garbage, heading for the street.

                       MICHAEL (O.S.)
             I have a lot on my mind....

     He appears behind her, engaged in the same task.

                       CARLA
             It doesn't take much to remember what
             day they come....

                       MICHAEL
             My brain is shrinking.  There's only so
             much room.

                       CARLA
             Don't give me that preoccupied
             scientist crap.  I'm trying to get
             ready for....

                       MICHAEL
             I thought artists worked with their
             subconscious....

     She gives him a dirty look as they deposit the garbage bags
     in their "pickup" spot.  He tries out a smile on her.  It's
     not working today.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             How come it's my responsibility?

                       CARLA
             Because....

     She starts for her studio.

                       MICHAEL
             Oh, okay.  Now I understand.  All
             you had to do was explain it.

     She ignores him and he watches her, frustrated, until she
     moves inside.  Then he starts after her.

88     INT. STUDIO - DAY                              
     88

     She grabs her welder's mask, then fires up her torch.  He
     enters.

                       MICHAEL
                  (before he's
                  seen)
             I take out the garbage, because...I'm
             glad we got that straightened out....

                       CARLA
             We don't have anything straightened
             out.  You're uptight about something
             ...what's wrong?

                       MICHAEL
             Why should there be anything wrong?
             I'm sitting around the house,
             enjoying my day off and you start
             yelling at me about garbage....

     She gives him a hard, steady look which says, there's more
     to it than garbage.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing;
                  quietly)
             What the hell are we arguing about?

                       CARLA
             I don't know...You...I don't know.

     He moves toward her and she holds the torch toward him.

                       MICHAEL
             No fair, I'm not armed.

                       CARLA
             Then don't come any closer.

                       MICHAEL
             Turn it off....

                       CARLA
             No....

                       MICHAEL
             Off....

                       CARLA
             I have work....

                       MICHAEL
             I've always wanted to make love to
             an angry welder.  I've dreamed of
             nothing else since I was a small boy.

     She can't help smiling.  She turns the torch off and he
     moves the rest of the way to her and kisses her.

                       CARLA
                  (murmuring)
             Close the door.

                       MICHAEL
             They're at the beach....

     She kisses him this time.

59     THE BARGE - DAY                                   
     59

     Jake is secured to the davit with a line.  Michael is tying
     another line around his waist.  Clarence and William are
     chumming the water with meat and blood.  Several large
     chunks of horse meat are on lines, over the side.  Jake
     holds a long pole to which the heart monitoring device,
     with its barbs, is attached.  The big boat, their floating
     lab, is secured to one side of the barge.

                       MICHAEL
             You sure you've done this before?

                       JAKE 
             Lots of times....

     Michael tests the knot, then Jake moves to the edge of the
     barge and leans out as far as he can.

                       MICHAEL
             And it's always worked?

                       JAKE
                  (grinning
                  back at him)
             So far..

                       CLARENCE
             It's coming....

     They see the fin making its way toward the barge.  Michael
     tenses, moving back toward the center of the barge until
     the line he's holding goes taut.

     Jake, the pole held high, watches as the shark gets closer,
     his body tensing as he gets ready.

     Michael is rigid, mesmerized with the approaching shark, his
     expression filled with what he's wondering -- will it try to
     get him?

                       JAKE
             You remember how to pull a rope...?

     Michael looks at Jake blankly, then stares at the oncoming
     shark, which comes closer and closer, then, at the last
     moment rolls to its side and opens its great jaws and goes
     for the horse meat.

     Jake waits until the shark's underside is at its most exposed,
     then rams the pole into it, then pulls it back quickly.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             Hot damn!  We got it!

     Michael is still transfixed.  Jake looks back at him.

                       JAKE
             Now would be a good time....

     Michael remembers his job and pulls Jake back to the barge.

     The shark, a thirty-pound piece of horse meat in its mouth,
     rolls away, disappearing beneath the surface.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             Let's see if the damn thing works....

90     WATERFRONT CAFE - DAY                              
     90

     The ocean is like a blue-green lake, its placid surface
     reflecting the early afternoon sun.

                       HOAGIE (0.S.)
             You don't have to go....

     Ellen stares out at the water, her expression wistful.

                       HOAGIE (O.S.)
                  (continuing)
             You don't have to do anything you
             don't want to....

     She turns to Hoagie, who's sitting across the table from
     her.  He sips his coffee and studies her.  She looks past
     him to the others who are still eating lunch.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             Our little island seems to agree
             with you....

                       ELLEN
             I have my own little island.

                       HOAGIE
             But it gets cold in winter....

     She smiles at that and sips her coffee.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             I tried winter once.  Burlington,
             Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I
             have a bone in my foot that still
             hasn't thawed.  When I was a small
             boy....

                       ELLEN
             That's hard to imagine....

                       HOAGIE
                  (grinning)
             I dreamed about always being warm...
             Stay a while....

     His tone of voice causes her to look at him quizzically.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             I could take some time off....

                       ELLEN
             You're always taking time off....

                       HOAGIE
             I like to travel....

     She smiles and he returns it.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             I'll nick the boss' plane again....

                       ELLEN
             What?

                       HOAGIE
                  (grinning)
             I borrow it without telling him....

                       ELLEN
             Won't you get in trouble...?

                       HOAGIE
             Only if he finds out... It's a short
             hop to the Caribbean.  We could take
             a few days....

                       ELLEN
             There must be plenty of women who
             would be glad to go....

                       HOAGIE
             There are...I'm tired of one-way
             conversations....

     They look at each other for a long moment.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             I have this overwhelming desire to
             kiss you, Ellen Brody.

                       ELLEN
                  (her cheeks
                  flooding with
                  color)
             Why?

                       HOAGIE
                  (laughing)
             Because it wouldn't occur to you to
             know why.  Blushing suits you....

                       ELLEN
             I'm sorry...I....

                       HOAGIE
             There's nothing to be sorry about.

                       ELLEN
             The whole idea is preposterous....

     His expression takes on the color of his feelings.  He
     likes this woman, a lot.

                       HOAGIE
             I don't think so....

     She's flustered and unsure how to respond.

                       ELLEN
                  (finally;
                  trying to
                  make light
                  of it)
             You sure you don't need glasses?

                       HOAGIE
             My vision is perfect....

     He leans across the table and kisses her.

90-A     NEPTUNE'S FOLLY - DAY                              
     90-A

     The shark's heartbeat is heard, then seen on the scope.
     Jake glances at it, then at Michael, who's at the wheel.

                       JAKE
             What are we getting out of this old
             bucket?

                       MICHAEL
             What she's got.  Nine knots....

                       JAKE
                  (muttering)
             Shit....

     He turns his attention back to the scope.  The heartbeat
     line is beginning to flatten.  Jake climbs up on the boom
     and scans the water.  Michael does the same from his position
     at the wheel.  He looks to Jake, who's shielding his eyes
     against the glare, holding the mast with his other hand.

                       MICHAEL
                  (finally)
             How long have you known Hoagie?

                       JAKE
             What?

                       MICHAEL
             How long have you known Hoagie?

                       JAKE
             What the hell does Hoagie have to do
             with this?

                       MICHAEL
             How long?

                       JAKE
             As long as he's been here....

     Jake turns his attention back to the water.  The sound of
     the heartbeat is growing weaker.

                       JAKE
             Bring her to starboard.

                       MICHAEL
                  (turning the
                  wheel)
             How long has he been here...?

                       JAKE
             Who?

                       MICHAEL
             Hoagie.

                       JAKE
             I don't remember.  One day he was
             just here....

                       MICHAEL
             What do you know about him?

     Jake checks the EKG scope.  The line is nearly flat.  The
     heartbeats are a whisper.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             He's after my mother....

     Jake laughs, looking at Michael as though he's crazy.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             What's so funny about that?

                       JAKE
             You think he's not good enough for
             her?  You're right.  If she was my
             mother, I'd send her home right now.

     He turns his attention back to the scope, then scans the
     water.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             Bring her about.  We're headed in
             the wrong direction....

                       MICHAEL
             Half the pilots down here fly drugs
             ...He's always going off....

                       JAKE
             Half don't...Bring her about....

                       MICHAEL
             I am...You must know something about
             him....

                       JAKE
             He gambles...He likes a good time...I
             see him around....

                       MICHAEL
             I hear he flies a lot of private
             charters....

     The heartbeats have stopped and Jake snaps around to look
     at the scope.  The line is dead flat.  He's stunned.

                       JAKE
             We lost it....

                       MICHAEL
             Maybe the gear crapped out....

                       JAKE
             If you hadn't been gassing about
             Hoagie....

                       MICHAEL
             Maybe it's gone....

     Jake gives him an angry look, then starts fiddling with the
     gear.  Finally, in his frustration, he bangs it with his
     hand.  Michael seems quietly relieved.

                       JAKE
             We'll look for it tomorrow....

     Michael doesn't respond.

90-B     INT. STUDIO - DAY                              
     90-B

     Carla works on her sculpture, securing a large piece of
     metal near the top with a wrench, tightening huge chrome
     nuts.

                       ELLEN (0.S.)
             All he did was kiss me....

                       CARLA
                  (smiling)
             It's beginning....

     Ellen is at the base of the sculpture, watching Carla, her
     back to the door.

                       ELLEN
             Beginning of what?

                       CARLA
                  (laughing)
             Whatever happens next.....

                       ELLEN
             I always thought when I grew up I'd
             know what to do about things like
             this...I don't even know if he's
             serious....

     Neither of them sees Thea, who's moved into the studio and
     has decided not to announce herself.

                       CARLA
             Give it some time, Ellen...See what
             happens.

                       ELLEN
             Part of me wanted to go off with
             him, the rest of me couldn't...I
             don't know why he wants me....

                       CARLA
             Maybe he's got good taste...I don't
             think he's spent much time with a
             woman like you....

                       ELLEN
             I don't know what he thinks...I don't
             know what I think...I don't even know
             why I'm talking about it...
                  (laughing)
             It's silly...I'm getting too old for
             this sort of thing....

     She spots Thea and stops suddenly.  Carla follows her gaze.

                       THEA
             You said it wasn't polite to interrupt
             people....

                       CARLA
             Yes, I did.

                       THEA
             It's time for tea, Grandma.

                       ELLEN
             I almost forgot....

                       THEA
             I didn't.

     Thea moves to Ellen, offering her hand, which Ellen takes.

                       THEA
                  (continuing)
             I put everything in my room.  My
             Teddy bear is joining us.

                       ELLEN
                  (to Carla)
             Thanks for the consultation....

                       CARLA
             Office hours, nine to five.  Rates
             go up after cocktails....

     The two women smile at each other, then Ellen leaves with
     Thea and Carla returns to her work.

90-C     INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                         
     90-C

     Michael stands at the window, looking out at the night.
     He's troubled.  He clasps his hands behind his back,
     unaware that Thea is standing behind him, her troubled
     expression a mirror of his, her hands behind her back, her
     tiny feet spread apart exactly like his.  He scratches his
     cheek unconsciously and she does the same.  She checks his
     facial expression and resets hers.

     He sighs and she sighs and he hears and looks down,
     surprised to see her, then noticing that she's assumed his
     body posture in every way.  He makes a funny face and she
     makes one back and he smiles and she returns it.

                       THEA
             Uncle Sean could make funny faces....

     He snatches her up off the floor and hugs her, holding onto
     her tightly.

     Ellen watches from the doorway, unobserved, her concern for
     her son etched into her expression.  He sees her and she
     offers a quick smile.

                       ELLEN
                  (to Thea)
             Time for bed, peanut....

     Michael gives his daughter a kiss and puts her down and she
     moves to her grandmother.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             I'll be in to read you a story.

                       THEA
             Good night, Daddy....

                       MICHAEL
             Good night, dear heart....

     Thea leaves and Michael takes a beer from the refrigerator
     and moves to the table where three empty cans are lined up
     neatly.  He pops the top of the new one and takes a long
     drink, then sits and returns to the writing of his report
     on their conch project.  There are several open textbooks
     and several notebooks in front of them.

                       ELLEN
                  (finally)
             It's late....

                       MICHAEL
             Trying to write our report....

                       ELLEN
             You look tired....

                       MICHAEL
             I'm fine....

     She studies him as he tries to write.

                       ELLEN
             I saw you and Thea....

     He looks up, making it clear that he doesn't want to talk.
     She sees it but presses on.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             You and Sean used to make....

                       MICHAEL
             I have to get this finished.

                       ELLEN
             I'm leaving in a few days.  I don't
             want to do that with you unhappy....

                       MICHAEL
             I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe...
             Discouraged a little.  It'll work
             out....

                       ELLEN
             I'm worried.. We haven't had our....

                       MICHAEL
             There's nothing to worry about....

                       ELLEN
                  (smiling)
             I'm your mother.  It's my job....

     He offers a small smile, then goes back to work.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             You looked just like your father...
             The first time the shark came to
             Amity....

                       MICHAEL
             I don't want to talk about that.

                       ELLEN
             It's a terrible thing to know some-
             thing no one else wants to believe.

                       MICHAEL
                  (angry)
             I'm tired of hearing about it.
             There's no shark.  Sean wasn't
             killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't
             die because of it...It's all wrong...
             Some fantasy you've concocted...You
             keep bringing it up.

     He goes back to work, ignoring her.  She wants to say more
     but stops herself.  Instead she starts looking through the
     refrigerator.

                       ELLEN
                  (finally;
                  quietly)
             You hungry?

                       MICHAEL
             No.

     She watches him, her expression sad and filled with concern.

90-D     THE WATER - NIGHT                              
     90-D

     The surface is searched, as though something is being
     looked for.  The shark is seen, swimming, just swimming,
     its fin slicing through the water as though it's hearing
     its own music.  Then, without warning, it attacks, coming
     straight at us, its great jaws opening wide, rolling to one
     side as it comes for the kill -- its great rows of teeth
     enveloping us, closing down on us, consuming us, until it
     goes dark.

     hyperventilating.

     Jake watches the scope, which is dead flat.  There's no
     sound coming from the speaker next to it.

     Clarence and William, on the barge, search the surface of
     the water with binoculars.

     Michael continues to search for conch.  From his point of
     view, the water is clear, filled only with colorful fish
     and streaks of sunlight from above.  Then he spots a small
     group of conch.

                       MICHAEL
             I've got about a half dozen...I'm
             going to tag them.  You hearing
             anything?

                       JAKE (0.S.)
             Nothing.. But stay within a quarter
             mile...I've got a three-mile radius
             on the monitor.  If he comes back
             I'll hear him.  You'll have time to
             get up.

     search visually for signs of the shark.

                  (into the
                  phone)
             Looks like....

     The sound of the shark's heartbeat suddenly pounds out of
     the speaker, stopping Jake in midsentence.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             I've got him...Bring it in....

     Michael is turning the sub as quickly as he can, looking
     around frantically for the shark.  There's nothing to be
     seen.

     The heartbeats are coming stronger.  The line on the scope
     is fluctuating wildly.

                       JAKE
             Michael, get your ass up here...Now!

     The sub moves toward the barge, making its way slowly -- to
     the eye almost leisurely, even though it's going full out.

                       MICHAEL
             I'm coming...How close is it?

                       JAKE (0.S.)
             Close...I don't know...Just get the

     Clarence suddenly goes rigid.

                       CLARENCE 
             There it is....

     From his point of view, seen through binoculars, the fin
     slices through the water.

93-B     BENEATH THE WATER - DAY                              
     93-B

     Michael pushes the sub to its limit, when suddenly it's hit
     and Michael's teeth are rattled as the sub is knocked
     through the water.

                       MICHAEL
                  (yelling)
             Jake!  Jake!

     The shark hits the sub again, his great jaws tearing into the
     canopy and prop, damaging the sub badly.  It turns then and
     almost leisurely swims away, its mouth bleeding, its head
     raked with cuts.  Michael eyes it, then the nearby wreck
     and pushes himself free of the sub, swimming as fast as he
     can toward the freighter.  The shark turns and starts after
     him, closing the distance rapidly as Michael makes for an
     opening in the wreck's hull.

                       JAKE (0.S.)
                  (yelling)
             Michael!  Can you hear me....

     Jake is watching the scope.  The line indicates a heart
     that's gone crazy.  The heartbeat from the speaker is
     booming.

                       JAKE
             Are you all right, Michael?  What's
             going on?

95     BENEATH THE WATER - DAY                              
     95

     Michael swims the last few feet to the wreck, moving through
     a hole in its hull just as the shark is about to get him.

96     INT. WRECK - DAY                              
     96

     Michael swims into a corridor which is filled with light
     coming from one end.  He turns and looks back at the hole.
     The shark is gone.  He looks up and down the corridor, then
     starts swimming away from the light.

     The corridor begins to turn dark as a huge black shadow
     fills the other end.

     Michael senses something and looks back and sees the shadow
     of the shark against the wall.  He freezes as the shadow
     moves toward him, finally covering his face.

     The shark comes closer and Michael starts backing up.  The
     shark moves closer, almost lazily opening its jaws as it
     prepares to devour him.  Michael keeps backing up, then
     trips and falls backwards through a door, his arms coming
     up as he tries to stop himself.

     His fall takes him down into a room.  Light floods into it
     from above.  He gathers himself and looks up.

     There's no sign of the shark.  He looks about quickly, taking
     measure of his situation, then the light above is blacked out
     as the shark swims slowly over the room.  Michael watches,
     barely breathing, until the light returns.  He listens and
     looks and waits.  The silence builds.  Where the hell is it?

     The submersible pops to the surface, its ballast tank
     destroyed by the shark.  Water pours from the space Michael
     occupied.  The heartbeats continue to be heard.  Jake,
     Clarence and William stare at the sub.

                       JAKE
             Get the bang sticks.  We're going
             down.

                       CLARENCE
             Bang sticks are like yelling at it....

                       JAKE
             We're going down.  All of us....

     Clarence starts moving quickly to the boat.

                       CLARENCE
                  (as he goes)
             They won't kill it....

                       JAKE
             We'll divert it...We'll do something....

     William is breaking out wet suits.  He throws one to Jake.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             Screw the wet suits.  No time....

     Jake gets out the air tanks and regulators.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing)
             We'll do something...Michael's down
             there.  Get the lead out....

     Michael eyes the opening above him.  That, and the door he
     fell through, are the only way in or out.  His breathing
     has returned to normal.  He takes off his air tank, handling
     it with care.

     There's an explosion of wood and metal next to him and the
     shark bursts through the bulkhead.  Quickly Michael pulls
     the regulator, blows the air from the tank, and rides
     upward on the force of air coming from the bottle, just
     barely escaping the great jaws.  He shoots up through the
     opening above him, ripping his arm against the side of the
     opening as he passes through and the water starts to fill
     with blood.

101     THE WATER/THE BARGE - DAY

     Jake, Clarence and William have their air tanks strapped on.
     They each hold bang sticks and are getting ready to go in,
     when Michael explodes up above the surface right in front of
     them, gasping for air.

     Jake jumps in the water and grabs Michael and Clarence and
     William pull Michael aboard and Jake climbs up after him.

     Michael crawls away from the edge of the barge.  He's shaking.
     Jake moves to him.  Clarence and William gather around.

                       JAKE
             Are you all right?

     Michael doesn't answer and Jake looks at him with concern.

     Michael sits bolt upright, as though he's been discharged
     from a gun.  He's sweating.  Carla sleeps peacefully next
     to him.  He gets himself under control and leaves the bed.

104     THE BATHROOM - NIGHT

     The light comes on and Michael looks at himself in the
     mirror, not sure he recognizes the image staring back at
     him   His arm is bandaged where he cut himself escaping
     from the shark.  He can hear his own heart beating.

104-A     THE SUBMERSIBLE/THE BARGE/NEPTUNE'S FOLLY - DAY               
     104-A

     Michael is in the sub.  Jake, Clarence and William stand at
     the side of the barge.  The sub is taped together and has
     no canopy.

                       JAKE
             It's my turn in the barrel, man....

                       MICHAEL
             You fall off a horse, you get right
             back on or you don't ride again....

                       JAKE
             I don't like it....

                       MICHAEL
             I didn't ask you to....

                       JAKE
             What about Carla's gig?

                       JAKE
             She's not going to like it....

     Michael puts his regulator in his mouth and starts slowly
     to move away and down beneath the surface.  Jake watches
     for a moment, an unhappy man, then moves quickly to the
     monitor and scope on the boat.  Clarence and William take
     up their stations with binoculars.

                       CLARENCE
             I hope the man knows what he's doing....

                       JAKE
             He knows what he has to do....

     Jake's expression belies his words.  He's deeply concerned.

     Michael has already spotted a group of conch.  He parks the
     sub and quickly gets to work tagging them.  He looks about
     quickly as though something is coming up behind him.
     There's nothing there.  He finishes and returns to the sub
     and maneuvers it up off the ground and continues his search
     for more conch.

                       MICHAEL
             You getting a reading on them?

                       JAKE (O.S.)

             right?

             What about the monitor...?  You
             getting anything on the shark?

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             Nothing...Hey Michael...You know I was
             thinking about yesterday.  Maybe all
             that was wrong was he was hungry....

                       MICHAEL
             How come only me?

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             Maybe he only likes white meat....

                       MICHAEL
             Funny, Jake...Funny.

                       JAKE (O.S.)
             Just trying to be helpful....

     As Jake speaks, the head of a Moray eel explodes out of a
     rock crevice right in front of Michael and his heart nearly
     stops.

118     THE PUBLIC BEACH - DAY                              
     118

     The beach and water are crowded with sunbathers and
     swimmers, with several banana boats and sailfish.

     Up from the beach, a short distance away, a crowd has
     gathered to witness the unveiling of Carla's statue.  The
     Mayor of the island, Mr. Witherspoon, a dignified black
     man, is in the midst of his dedication speech.  The statue
     looms behind him, shrouded beneath its cloth.  Carla, Ellen,
     Thea and Louisa, who totes a camera, along with several
     local "big-wigs" stand next to him.

     Where the hell are they?     Something we look at every
                         day, something we think
              CARLA          beautiful...Something that
     They'll be here....          makes us stop and ponder...

     Michael's absence.

     Thea, who's bored stiff, eyes a group of friends getting
     ready to go out on a banana boat, a long "hotdog" which
     five riders straddle, holding onto grips in front of them.

     bored she is.

             CARLA                  WITHERSPOON (0.S.)
     Okay...Be careful....              (continuing)
                         We see a sunset in all its
             THEA               glory, yet the artist sees
     I will....               something that isn't there
                         for the rest of us....

     Thea runs to join her friends, yelling at them to wait as
     she tears across the beach.  Ellen watches with concern.
     Carla sees it.

             CARLA                  WITHERSPOON (0.S.)
     Banana boats are fun....         (continuing)
                         Something from the inner
             LOUISA          eye...
     I'd go with her if I could....         (Pauses)
                         Today we are privileged
             CARLA          to dedicate a work of art
     Thanks....               that reflects the true
                         spirit, the free expression
             LOUISA          of life here in the
     What are friends for...?     Bahamas....

     Carla looks at Mr. Witherspoon cross-eyed and Louisa
     stifles a laugh and the two women exchange smiles.  Then
     Carla looks at Ellen, who manages a small smile, then turns
     her attention back to Thea, who's taking the last empty
     seat, one from the back, just in front of Margaret's mother.

                       WITHERSPOON (O.S.)
             Carla Brody, a grand addition to our
             community, an artist of growing
             reputation, was commissioned to
             express our way of life in permanent
             form....

     The boat takes off behind its speedboat and the kids in it
     begin to shriek, Thea loudest of all.

                       WITHERSPOON (O.S.)
                  (continuing)
             So that whoever visits our public beach
             will be able to share in that spirit.

     Ellen continues to watch Thea, Mr. Witherspoon signals to
     Carla and she moves forward to join him.

                       WITHERSPOON
                  (continuing)
             Ladies and gentlemen, Carla Brody....

     Applause greets her introduction and she nods and smiles
     her thanks, then she and Mr. Witherspoon both take hold of
     the cord which will pull the cloth from the statue.  Louisa
     begins to video tape the proceedings.  Someone gets in her
     way and she says something, then jostles for better position.

     Ellen eyes Thea as the banana boat makes a sweeping turn
     and heads back across the water in front of them.

     As Mr. Witherspoon and Carla pull the cord, Ellen sees the
     fin pop up out of the water behind the banana boat.  As the
     cloth comes free of the statue, the crowd breaks into loud,
     anticipatory applause.  It covers Ellen's scream.  She
     starts running for the beach, yelling as she goes.   The fin
     moves closer to the boat.  The applause begins to trickle
     away as the crowd begins to realize the nature of the huge
     abstract work of art.  They don't understand it.
     Mr. Witherspoon looks at it quizzically.

     Ellen's screams are heard now and Carla sees her running
     along the beach, waving her arms.  Then she sees what Ellen
     sees, the fin, and she and Louisa and the others start
     running.

119     THE BANANA BOAT - DAY                              
     119

     Margaret's mother sees what's going on on the beach and
     finally looks in back of her and sees the fin and then the
     shark as it comes up out of the water for Thea.  She
     grabs the child, pushing her forward, putting herself in
     the way.  The shark rips into her and she's pulled into the
     water, then beneath it.  Thea screams, but nothing comes
     out.  Air starts leaking from the inflatable boat.  The
     water around it starts filling with blood.

     Ellen watches her granddaughter, horrified.

     Dozens of people line the water's edge around her, yelling,
     crowding around as the speedboat brings what's left of
     the banana boat to shore.  Thea and the other two kids
     and remaining adult are holding on for dear life as they're
     dragged through the water.

     Carla, with Louisa at her heels, wades out toward them,
     frantic, yelling....

                       CARLA
             Thea...I'm here, Thea...Mommy's
             here....

     Ellen stares at the sea, then at her granddaughter, who
     Carla has reached.  When she sees that Thea is in one
     piece, unseen by anyone, she moves back through the crowd
     and starts away.  She walks deliberately, then begins to
     march.  Finally she breaks into a run and disappears from
     view.

121     THE BIG BOAT/THE DOCK - DAY                         
     121

     As a hand fumbles with a key and finally gets it into the
     engine, the distant sound of singing is heard.

     The key is turned and the          MICHAEL AND JAKE (O.S.)
     engine cranks over a few          (singing)
     times, then starts,          'I found my thrill on
     drowning out the singing.     Blueberry Hill -- on
                         Blueberry Hill -- when
                         I found you.  The moon
                         stood still on Blueberry
                         Hill....'

     Ellen moves to the bow and casts off, throwing the lines to
     the dock.  She does the same at the stern, then experiments
     with the clutch and the boat starts pulling away.

122     THE WATER/THE BOAT - DAY                         
     122

     From another point of view, a point of land at the end of
     the beach where Michael and Jake live, the boat is seen
     heading out into the Atlantic.

123     EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH   DAY                    
     123

     A dozen beer bottles are lined up on the rail of the
     porch.  Michael and Jake's feet are seen resting on the
     rail near them.

                       MICHAEL AND JAKE (0.S.)
                  (singing)
             '...I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill....

                       MICHAEL (0.S.)
             I don't like that song....

                       JAKE (0.S.)
             You don't know the words....

     They're sitting side by side, both holding bottles of beer,
     both half in the bag.  They both take long swallows at the
     same time.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing;
                  grinning;
                  singing)
             A Moray eel...A Moray eel....

                       MICHAEL
                  (singing)
             'It was so ugly...It was so big....'

                       JAKE
                  (singing)
             'A Moray eel....'

                       MICHAEL
                  (singing)
             'Snuck up on me....'

                       JAKE
                  (singing)
             'It got us in hot water...We should
             have been there for Carla....'

     The mention of it, the memory of what caused him to miss
     the ceremony, his need to confront his fear, all make him
     suddenly unhappy.

                       MICHAEL
             Shit....

                       JAKE
             Don't be so down, man.  Money's
             gone...Shark's gone...We're back to
             conch...We've got it made....

                       MICHAEL
             Shove it....

                       JAKE
             You'll be the eternal tropo...The
             old man and the sea...Know the words
             to this one?
                  (singing;
                  "Mack The
                  Knife")
             'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear,
             and he shows them pearly white...'

                       MICHAEL
             Stop that!

                       JAKE
             You don't like my voice...?

                       MICHAEL
             I don't like the song.

                       JAKE
             Tough shit.
                  (singing)
             'When the shark bites with his
             teeth, dear...'

     Michael stands and grabs Jake in a single motion.

                       MICHAEL
             I told you....

     Jake grabs Michael's shirt.  He's still sitting.

                       JAKE
             You told me what?

                       MICHAEL
             Screw you, Jake....

     Michael pulls away and starts off.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Screw you....

     Jake laughs as Michael storms off.

                       JAKE
                  (singing)
             'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth,
             dear....'

     His grin fades as Michael disappears from view.  He takes a
     swallow of beer, then mutters, "sorry..."   Alone he seems
     as unhappy as Michael.

124     THE BOAT/THE WATER - DAY                         
     124

     The boat is well out into the ocean now   There's no land
     in sight.  Ellen is a tiny figure at the wheel.  She stands
     straight and tall.

125     EXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY                         
     125

     He completes the short walk from Jake's and enters his
     house.

                       MICHAEL
                  (as he enters)
             Carla?

126     INT. HOUSE - DAY                              
     126

     He moves inside, looking for people.

                       MICHAEL
             Carla!  Mom?

     He looks in a room, then moves on.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing)
             Thea?

     He moves toward his daughter's room.

127     THEA'S ROOM - DAY                              
     127

     Michael looks in and comes up short.  He sees Carla on
     Thea's bed, rocking their daughter gently in her arms.
     Thea's eyes are wide open, her expression blank.  Louisa
     sits in a chair next to them.

                       CARLA
                  (hissing a
                  whisper)
             Where have you been...?

                       MICHAEL
             What's wrong?  What happened?

                       CARLA
             Thea was attacked by a shark....

     Michael is stunned.  He can't believe it.

                       CARLA
             The doctor said she should be all
             right...She's in shock....

                       MICHAEL
             But it went away...We would have
             known....

                       LOUISA
             What went away?

                       MICHAEL
             We were doing research.  It disappeared.
             We thought....

                       CARLA
             You knew...?

                       MICHAEL
             It went away....

     He moves to the bed, to look at his daughter, who stares
     past him, as though he's not there.  It breaks his heart.

                       MICHAEL
                  (continuing;
                  softly)
             Sweetheart....

                       CARLA
                  (furious)
             She could have been killed...You
             knew and you didn't tell us...You
             let your mother think....

                       MICHAEL
             Where is she?

                       CARLA
             How could you do that?  Your own
             daughter....

                       MICHAEL
             Where's my mother?

                       CARLA
             I don't know....

     He starts from the room.

                       CARLA
                  (continuing)
             Why didn't you tell us?
                  (breaking;
                  enraged)
             Why didn't you tell us?

                       MICHAEL 
                  (looking back)
             I'm sorry.  Please, Carla.  I didn't
             think there was any danger.  I'm sorry.
             I love you.  Both of you.

     It suddenly strikes him.  He knows where his mother has
     gone.  He goes to the window.

128     THE DOCK - DAY                                   
     128

     From the window, from Michael's point of view, he sees
     that the boat is gone.  He runs from the room, passing
     Louisa, who looks at him angrily.

                       LOUISA
             Where's Jake?

     He doesn't answer.

129     EXT. HOUSE - DAY                              
     129

     He runs from the house and heads for the dock.

                       MICHAEL
                  (yelling as
                  he goes)
             Jake!  Jake!

131     THE BIG BOAT - DAY                              
     131

     Ellen steers the boat at full throttle, out farther into
     the Atlantic, scanning the water for the shark, determina-
     tion set deeply into her expression.

132     THE POINT - DAY                                   
     132

     Hoagie is setting up to fish from the point at the end of the
     beach where Michael and Jake live.  He checks his bait and
     hook, then casts, then sees the dinghy heading toward him.

133     THE DINGHY/THE POINT - DAY                         
     133

     Jake rides in the bow.  Michael steers.  They see Hoagie,
     and Jake starts waving at him.

                       JAKE
                  (yelling)
             You see our boat?

             HOAGIE                  MICHAEL
         (yelling)                   (yelling)
     I just got here....          My mother took it....

                       HOAGIE
                  (yelling)
             I hope she's a good sailor....

                       JAKE
                  (yelling)
             A shark attacked Thea and some
             kids...She's going after it....

             HOAGIE                  MICHAEL
         (yelling)                   (yelling)
     She's going after it...?     We've got to stop her....

Hoagie understands what's going on and starts reeling in.

                       HOAGIE
                  (yelling)
             You're going after her in that?
             You're crazy...It'll take all day
             in that bathtub....

                       JAKE
                  (yelling)
             You got a better idea...?

134     THE AIRPORT - DAY

     A small, low-wing aircraft takes off.

135     INT. PLANE - DAY                              
     135

     Hoagie is already turning to head out over the water.
     Michael is straining to see the ocean.  They have to yell
     to be heard over the din of the engines.  Jake rides next
     to Hoagie.

                       HOAGIE
             When we find her we'll radio her
             position...The Coast Guard will pick
             her up.  Don't worry....

                       JAKE
             She'll be all right, partner.. She'll
             never find it.  We couldn't....

                       MICHAEL
             It will find her....

     Jake looks at him like he's crazy.  This is something he
     hasn't heard.

                       JAKE
             What do you mean, it'll find her?

                       HOAGIE
             She said it was coming....

             JAKE                       MICHAEL
     What do you mean, it's          What the hell are you...?
     coming...?

                       HOAGIE
             She has it in her head that the
             shark that killed Martin and Sean
             is....

             JAKE                       MICHAEL

     He's not talking about our     What do you do when you're
     shark....               not flying people?

                       HOAGIE
             I deliver laundry...We're going to
             circle northeast....

     Hoagie changes directions....

             JAKE                       MICHAEL
     You saying she thinks the     Everything's a joke to
     shark is after her...?          you....

                       HOAGIE
             Not Ellen.... 

                       MICHAEL
             She doesn't need a drug dealer
             for....

     Hoagie starts laughing.  Jake is looking at them both with
     disbelief.

             MICHAEL                  JAKE
     What the hell's so funny...?     That's a lot of crap...
                         Sharks don't....

                       HOAGIE
             I want to find her as much as you do,
             Michael....

                       MICHAEL
             I want you to leave her alone.  I
             don't want you involving her in....

                       HOAGIE
                  (spotting
                  something)
             What's that....?

     He points and they see a tiny dot of a boat in the
     distance.  Hoagie starts for it and they watch as he drops
     altitude.  There's a long silence as they strain to see the
     boat.  When they get closer they see that it's a pleasure
     sailor.  The people aboard wave at them.

                       MICHAEL
                  (not ready
                  to give it up)
             What do you deliver on all those
             charters you...?

                       HOAGIE
             I fly elephants for smugglers....

136     THE BOAT - DAY                                   
     136

     Ellen searches the water for the shark.  She puts the boat
     into a long slow turn.  All she can see is the endless
     expanse of ocean around her.

137     THE WATER - DAY                                   
     137

     The boat is seen from the surface, from the point of view
     of something following her, keeping pace with her.

     The shark is stalking her.

138     INT. PLANE - DAY                              
     138

     Hoagie, Michael and Jake fly on in search of Ellen.
     Michael is raw nerve ends.

                       MICHAEL
             Can't this thing go any faster?

                       HOAGIE
             Any faster and it'll turn into a flying
             Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....

     Hoagie banks the plane, changing direction to search
     another area.

139     THE BOAT/THE WATER - DAY                         
     139

     Ellen turns the wheel, beginning another sweep, searching
     for the shark.  At first she doesn't see anything, then she
     goes rigid.

     A hundred yards away she sees the fin.

     She shuts off the engine and, in the quiet, moves to the
     stern and looks at the shark, which is keeping its distance.

                       ELLEN
                  (quietly; with
                  deadly calm)
             Come and get me, you son-of-a-bitch.
             Take me and leave my family alone....

     The silence builds as only the water lapping up against the
     side of the becalmed boat is heard.

     The fin disappears beneath the surface and Ellen, still at
     the stern, her body trembling, looks for it.  She can't
     see anything.  The silence builds.  She waits.

     Then, in the intense calm, the distant sound of an airplane
     engine droning is heard.

140     INT. PLANE - DAY                              
     140

     Jake sees the boat and points.

                       JAKE
             There she is....

     They see the boat and the tiny figure of Ellen at the stern.
     Hoagie alters course, dropping altitude as he goes.  He
     starts fishing for a chart so he can radio her exact loca-
     tion.  Michael rises in his seat to get a better view.  He
     sees something in the water and strains to make out what
     it is.

141     THE WATER - DAY                                   
     141

     The dark form of the shark is visible beneath the surface
     as it moves rapidly toward the boat.

142     INT. PLANE - DAY                              
     142

     They strain to see the form in the water as the plane moves
     rapidly closer to the boat.

                       HOAGIE
             Is that what I think it is...?

     No answer is necessary as they watch the shark close the
     distance to the boat.  It's going for Ellen.

                       JAKE
             Holy Christ....

                       MICHAEL
                  (a whisper)
             Mom....

143     THE BOAT - DAY                                   
     143

     The shark comes exploding up out of the water for Ellen,
     missing her by only a few feet, taking a piece of the stern
     off the boat, then disappearing beneath the surface.

     Then she hears the plane and looks but doesn't seem to see
     it.  She's in shock from the shark's attack, but is still
     dedicated to her mission.

     The plane flies in low, buzzing the boat, the great roar
     of its engine causing Ellen to duck out of the way.

144     INT. PLANE - DAY                              
     144

     Hoagie makes a tight circle and starts back.

                       MICHAEL
             Slow it down....

     He starts to open a door.  Jake stops him.

                       JAKE
             What the hell are you doing?

                       MICHAEL
             I've got to get to her....

                       JAKE
             You jump, you'll kill yourself....

                       HOAGIE
             What are you worried about...?  You
             make it, the shark will kill you
             anyway...I'm going in....

     Hoagie grabs his microphone and switches it on.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing;
                  on the horn)
             Thomas, my boy, you there?  This is
             PBN 17452....

                       THOMAS (0.S.)
                  (laughing;
                  from the
                  speaker)
             Boss is going to be pissed at you
             for taking his plane, Hoagie....

                       HOAGIE
                  (grinning)
             Wait till he finds out what I'm
             going to do with it....

145     THE BOAT - DAY                                   
     145

     Ellen watches the plane with horror as it comes in on a
     line parallel to the boat, coming closer and closer to the
     water.

146     INT. PLANE - DAY                              
     146

                       HOAGIE
                  (still on
                  the horn)
             A couple of boats, fast, and someone
             who knows how to kill a shark.  A
             big one....

     He puts the microphone back and starts preparing to bring
     the plane into the water.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             Grab your socks....

                       JAKE
             You sure you know how to do this.

                       HOAGIE
             Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you
             think I am...?

147     THE BOAT/THE PLANE/THE WATER - DAY                    
     147

     Ellen backs away from the stern as the plane nears the
     surface and its engine sputters, then quits.  It hits the
     water and its nose rocks forward, then it settles forward
     and skips some seventy-five feet, plowing through the water
     violently, finally coming to a stop near the boat.

     Hoagie pushes the door open and water starts coming in.

                       HOAGIE
             Hell, that wasn't half bad.. Get
             going...I'll keep it busy....

                       JAKE
             It'll come for the plane.  It's
             attracted to metal.  The electro-
             magnetic impulse....

                       HOAGIE
             Will you get the bloody hell out of
             here....

     Jake jumps into the water and starts swimming for the boat.

                       MICHAEL
             Come on, Hoagie....

                       HOAGIE
             All you passengers are the same....
             Complain...Complain....

     He pushes Michael out.

149     THE BOAT/THE PLANE - DAY                         
     149

     Ellen sees Jake, then Michael swimming frantically for the
     boat.

                       ELLEN
                  (screaming)
             Michael!  No, goddamnit!  No!

     Then she sees the shark heading for the plane and Hoagie
     and she stares at it and the image of Hoagie, who backs up to
     the door behind him.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing;
                  barely
                  audible)
             Hoagie...No....

150     THE PLANE - DAY                                   
     150

     The shark attacks the plane, going straight for the cockpit,
     rising up out of the water, blocking Hoagie from view,
     taking a mouthful of door, then rolling off and disappearing
     beneath the surface.  Hoagie is gone.

     Michael and Jake scramble aboard.  They move quickly to
     Ellen and Michael puts his arm around her, trying to offer
     comfort.  She's in shock.  They stare at the plane as it
     starts to sink, scanning the water, looking for Hoagie.

                       MICHAEL
                  (quietly)
             It got him....

                       ELLEN
                  (angry;
                  passionately)
             Why'd you come out here?

                       MICHAEL
             Why'd you take the boat?

             ELLEN                  MICHAEL
     Why'd you bring them...?         (his voice
                             rising)
                         Didn't you realize what
                         you were doing...?
     It kept coming...There was     You shouldn't have done
     no other way to stop it....     it....

                       ELLEN
             I had to.  It was all I could do....

     Suddenly her anger explodes.  Michael tries to hold her but
     she pulls away.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             I tried to tell you...I tried....

                       HOAGIE (O.S.)
                  (yelling from
                  the other side)
             Give me a hand here for Christ's
             sake....

     They turn and see Hoagie struggling to climb aboard and
     move quickly to help him.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing;
                  grinning)
             That thing has terrible breath....

     They pull him aboard and he smiles at Ellen, who is very
     happy indeed to see him.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             What say we get the hell out of
             here, Ellen Brody. ...

                       JAKE
             Get her started....

     Hoagie and Michael start for the engine.  Ellen watches
     them, then looks out over the water for the shark.  Jake
     turns on the heart monitor and EKG scope and a moment later
     the sound of the shark's heartbeat, which is faint, starts
     coming through the speaker, and the sight of its rhythmic
     beating is seen on the scope.

                       JAKE
             It's working....

     Hoagie watches as Michael tries to get the engine started.
     It won't turn over.

                       HOAGIE
             Not the engine, pal....

     Jake heads for the cabin.

                       JAKE
                  (as he goes)
             Get it going, Hoagie.  Michael....

     Michael follows Jake below.  Hoagie jumps down into the
     engine pit and starts checking the fuel line.

     Ellen stares out to sea, waiting for what she knows will
     happen.

                       HOAGIE
             Maybe the plane gave it indigestion....

                       JAKE (O.S.)
                  (from below;
                  yelling)
             They spend half their lives looking
             for food and the other half eating
             it   They don't care what it is....

                       ELLEN
                  (softly)
             It's not food it's after....

     The distant sounds of the shark's heart continue to be heard.

152     BELOW DECKS - DAY                              
     152

     Jake takes the top off an underwater strobe light and
     begins rewiring rapidly, changing connections.  Michael
     watches.

                       JAKE
                  (in the
                  midst of it)
             If it works, if we can get it inside
             the bastard and set it off, it'll
             shock the hell out of it.  We'll
             need a slave switch to set it off.
             Pull the dry cell out of the radio.

                       MICHAEL
             Anybody ever tell you you're nuts....

     Michael starts pulling the battery.

                       JAKE
                  (grinning)
             All the time....

                       MICHAEL
             It'll work....

                       JAKE
             Theory, partner...If it responds to
             external electrical impulse, it
             might respond to one coming from
             inside it...Confuse it...Drive it
             away....

                       MICHAEL
             If we're real lucky, it'll eat
             itself....

153     ABOVE DECKS - DAY                              
     153

     Hoagie hands Ellen sparkplugs, which she dries with a rag.
     She continues to glance at the sea, her expression set with
     the inevitable.  The shark's faint heartbeats are heard.

154     BELOW DECKS - DAY                              
     154

     Jake is taping a cover over the strobe base.  Michael is
     wiring another strobe light to the battery.

                       JAKE
             Wait for the sucker to charge, then
             hit the switch.  Just like taking a
             picture.

                       MICHAEL
             The big picture...If we can't get
             him to swallow it, we'll shove it
             up his....

                       JAKE
                  (laughing)
             I forgot my rubber gloves.  Let's do
             it.

     They head for the deck

155     ABOVE DECKS - DAY                              
     155

     As Michael and Jake move topside, they see Hoagie and Ellen
     staring at the speaker and EKG scope.  The heartbeats have
     stopped.  The line on the scope is flat.

                       MICHAEL
             Your equipment has crapped out
             again....

                       JAKE
             My equipment doesn't crap out....

     Jake grabs a pole from the deck and throws it to Michael,
     then starts tying the device to the end of it.  His hands
     are trembling.

                       HOAGIE
             Maybe it had a heart attack.  Too
             much fatty food.  Humans are full of
             cholesterol.

     Hoagie gets the last sparkplug screwed back in and tries
     the engine and it kicks to life.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             Son-of-a-bitch!

     Jake starts for the bow.

                       JAKE
                  (to Michael)
             Get a line....

     Michael grabs a coiled line from the deck and follows Jake
     forward.

                       HOAGIE
                  (to Ellen)
             We're going to make it....

     She just stares at him, not believing it for a moment.

     Jake is standing at the bow, looking out over the water.
     Michael reaches him with the line.

                       MICHAEL
             I'll do it, Jake.

                       JAKE
             No way....

                       MICHAEL
             It's my fault...I have to....

                       JAKE
             We need it to eat electronics, man
             ...Not you.  Get it on me....

                       MICHAEL
                  (a plea)
             Jake.

                       JAKE
                  (grinning)
             I'm the one who wanted to study
             it....

     Michael relents and quickly ties the line around Jake's
     waist.  Jake makes his way out to the end of the bowsprit,
     using the guy wire from the mast for support.  Michael
     passes him the pole with the device at the end of it.

     Ellen and Hoagie watch from the stern.  He's underway.

                       JAKE
                  (continuing;
                  yelling back)
             Keep it steady....

                       HOAGIE
             Aye, aye, Captain....

     The shark explodes up completely out of the water, clearing
     the surface, opening its jaws as it comes directly for
     Michael, who leaps back.

                       ELLEN
             Michael!

     Jake moves back on the bowsprit, getting in the shark's
     way, and as the shark flies up toward Jake, he rams the
     pole down its throat.  The pole snaps and the shark takes
     the device, Jake and a piece of the bowsprit.

     Ellen screams.

     The guy wire flies loose and the already weakened mast
     begins to fall.

     Michael pulls at the line, which goes limp in his hands.

     Jake, in the shark's mouth, goes crashing into the water.

     The mast crashes into the boat and water.

     Ellen and Hoagie are running forward.

     Michael watches as Jake and the shark disappear beneath the
     surface.

     In the distance, the three of them see the shark rise up
     out of the water.  Part of Jake is seen in its jaws.  Then
     they're gone.

     The heartbeats are heard again.

     Michael opens his mouth and a great wail of anguish comes
     out and carries out over the water.

     Hoagie dashes back toward the controls.  Ellen, taking
     strength from her son's need, grabs his arm, hard.

                       ELLEN
             Michael!

     There are tears in his eyes.

                       HOAGIE
                  (yelling)
             Get that goddamn gizmo of Jake's
             working....

     Michael stares at the sea.  Ellen looks at her son
     compassionately, then Michael starts for the cabin and
     Ellen follows to the deck near Hoagie, where she watches
     the water.

     The shark's heartbeats are getting louder and closer
     together.  Hoagie eyes the speaker as he opens the throttle,
     giving it everything its got.

156     BELOW DECKS - DAY                              
     156

     Michael grabs the slave switch and turns it on and it
     begins to whine as the strobe unit in the shark's stomach
     begins to charge.

                       HOAGIE (O.S.)
                  (yelling)
             It's coming....

     He hits the switch too soon.   Nothing happens.  He can hear
     the heartbeats thumping a frenzy as the shark begins its
     attack.

                       MICHAEL
                  (yelling)
             What happened?

                       HOAGIE (0.S.)
             Nothing!  What the hell are you doing
             down there?

     The whine begins to build again.

157     ABOVE DECKS - DAY                              
     157

     The heartbeats sound like an invitation to hell.  Hoagie
     grabs Ellen's arm.

                       HOAGIE
             Take the wheel....

     He leaves it before she does and runs to the cabin.  She
     takes his place, glancing at the water, seeing the fin.
     Her expression floods with rage and she turns the wheel
     toward the shark, trying to meet it head on.

158     BELOW DECKS - DAY                              
     158

     Hoagie sticks his head in the door.

                       HOAGIE
             The damn thing is going to have our
             asses....

                       MICHAEL
             It needs more time to charge.

     They start topside.  Michael brings the slave switch with
     him.

159     ABOVE DECKS/THE WATER - DAY                         
     159

     Ellen is bringing the boat directly toward the shark, which
     is coming straight for them.  The heartbeats are deafening.

     As Hoagie and Michael move topside, the boat and the shark
     collide head on, sending shock waves from stem to stern.
     Ellen holds onto the wheel with both hands and keeps her
     feet.  Michael and Hoagie are knocked on their asses.

     The heartbeats retreat, then start growing louder and
     stronger again.  The whine of the strobe has stopped.
     Michael hits the switch several times and it starts again.

     Ellen sees the fin and steers toward it.  The shark is
     coming again, like an old boxer looking for the knockout
     punch in the fifteenth round.

     The boat and the shark are heading for each other, the
     distance between them closing fast.

     Ellen drives the boat toward it.

     The slave switch makes a popping sound, and Michael hits the
     switch and the flash in his hand goes off.

     The water explodes as the shark receives an enormous jolt
     of electricity.  It thrashes about wildly then, in slow
     motion, some twenty-five feet from the boat, right in front
     of it, the shark rises up out of the water, exposing half
     its body.  It seems suspended there, its great head pointed
     right at Ellen, its dead black eyes seeming to stare
     straight at her.

     Holding fast to the wheel, her expression set hard, Ellen
     drives the boat straight at the shark.  She pushes the
     throttle forward, hard, getting the last bit of speed from
     the engine, driving straight into the beast, impaling it in
     the throat with what's left of the sharp jagged end of the
     bowsprit.

     The shark goes crazy, its weight pulling the bow down into
     the water as it tries to free itself, thrashing about so
     violently that it turns the bow into splinters.

     Ellen, Michael and Hoagie are thrown into the water.

160     THE WATER - DAY                                   
     160

     They watch as the shark dies its violent death, taking what
     remains of the boat beneath the surface with it.

161     BENEATH THE SURFACE - DAY                               
161

     The shark and the boat sink slowly to the bottom.

162     THE SURFACE - DAY                              
     162

     Ellen, exhausted, emptied of everything, begins to sob.
     Everything she feels, everything she's suppressed about
     Sean's death pours out of her.  She begins to slip beneath
     the surface.  Hoagie grabs her.

                       ELLEN
             I can't....

                       HOAGIE
             Yes you can....

     Michael reaches them and together, helping Ellen, they swim
     to a large piece of the boat which is floating nearby.

     Holding it, catching their breath, Ellen still crying, they
     look out across the water, silently remembering Jake.

                       MICHAEL
                  (quietly)
             It's over....

     Ellen stares at the sea, her expression etched with
     uncertainty.  Is it over?  Will it ever be?

     Our vision shifts from Ellen to her point of view of the
     endless expanse of ocean.  In the distance the clouds seem
     to be reaching for its surface.  Slowly, almost
     indiscernibly at first, the closing music begins.  Another
     sound, that of airplane engines is heard.

164     THE AIRPORT - DAY                              
     164

     The noise of the air taxi's engines, as they're warmed up,
     is loud.  The music, which builds slowly, relentlessly,
     continues.  Closing credits begin, like punctuation marks.
     Hoagie is in the cockpit.

     Ellen, who's dressed for travel, Michael, who carries Thea,
     and Carla approach the plane.

                       ELLEN
                  (yelling
                  to be heard
                  above the
                  noise)
             I want you all to come to Amity this
             summer.

                       MICHAEL
             There's a lot...I want to talk about
             it....

     He's having trouble.

                       ELLEN
             We will...We'll have a lot of time
             together.
                  (pauses)
             What are you going to do now?

                       CARLA
                  (yelling)
             We'll be there....

                       ELLEN
                  (to Thea)
             You make sure they come?

                       THEA
                  (yelling;
                  liking the
                  excitement)
             I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.

                       ELLEN
                  (laughing)
             I'll miss you....

     They've reached the plane and Hoagie and Ellen make eye
     contact.

                       MICHAEL
                  (eyeing
                  his mother
                  and Hoagie)
             Promise me you'll be all right....

                       ELLEN
                  (turning
                  to him;
                  yelling)
             Promise me....

                       MICHAEL
                  (yelling)
             I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful
             ...I'll be....

                       HOAGIE
                  (yelling;
                  grinning)
             Mothers and sons...Mine used to tell
             me to wear clean shorts.... 

                       ELLEN/HOAGIE 
                  (both yelling;
                  both enjoying
                  the moment)
             In case you got hit by a car....

     They laugh above the noise.  Michael and Hoagie eye each
     other.

                       MICHAEL
                  (yelling
                  at Hoagie)
             You know, you try harder not to give
             a damn than anyone I've ever met?

     Hoagie, straining to hear, grins.

                       HOAGIE
                  (yelling)
             What?

     Michael moves closer, Thea still in his arms.

                       THEA
                  (before
                  Michael
                  can repeat
                  himself;
                  yelling).
             Can I fly the plane again...?

     The music dips now, as Hoagie takes a long 1ook at Thea,
     his smile building warmly.

                       HOAGIE
             Absolutely...Any time....

     He beckons her with his finger and Michael holds her closer.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             Can you keep a secret?  Something no
             one else knows?

                       THEA
                  (still
                  yelling at
                  the top of
                  her lungs)
             Yes I can....

                       HOAGIE
                  (yelling
                  back)
             I own the airplane.  I can do
             whatever I want.  I'm the boss.

     Michael, Ellen and Carla react.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing)
             Which means I have to go a lot of
             places to pay my debts and borrow
             money to keep it going....

     He looks at Michael with mischief in his eye.  The music
     begins to build again, toward its climax.  Credits continue.

                       HOAGIE
                  (continuing;
                  yelling louder)
             Remind me when I get back to tell
             you about the time I flew a hundred
             nuns to Nairobi....

     Michael and others laugh, but it's lost in the sound of the
     engines and the music.  The family moves to the plane's
     door.  Ellen kisses Carla and Thea good-bye, then turns to
     Michael.

                       ELLEN
                  (above the
                  noise)
             We never had that talk, did we?

     He looks at her, troubled, and she smiles at him.

                       ELLEN
                  (continuing)
             We will...We'll have a lot of time
             together, Michael....

                       MICHAEL
                  (shouting)
             I'm going to finish what Jake and I
             started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I
             owe him everything....
                  (shouting;
                  hardly heard)
             I'll get something important done
             for both of us....

     Ellen and Michael embrace, then kiss each other good-bye.

                       HOAGIE
                  (yelling)
             There they were, all hundred of
             them....

     His last words are drowned out by engines and music and he
     shrugs as he and Ellen smile at each other.  She takes a
     last look at her family, then boards the plane and the door
     closes behind her.

165     THE AIRPORT/THE PLANE - DAY                         
     165

     As music and credits continue, the plane takes off and
     starts out over the ocean, heading for Nassau.

     Michael, holding Thea, and Carla, her arm through his,
     watch as the plane becomes smaller and smaller, until it is
     lost in the vastness of the sky and the sky is transformed
     into ocean and music and credits end.

                                   FADE OUT

                         THE END
