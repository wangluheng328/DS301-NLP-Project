In the small Texas town of Rio County, a body is found and on it is a Rio County Sheriff's badge.
Now the consensus is that the body is Charlie Wade, the Sheriff who terrorized and shook down most of the minorities during his time.
One day he just disappeared.
Now some people suspect that one of his deputies, Buddy Deeds, who stood up to Wade killed him and buried him.
He would succeed Wade as Sheriff and be extremely revered.
Now the current Sheriff is Deeds' son Sam, who didn't exactly have good relationship with his father, so he's leaning towards his father killing Wade.
