                                    by

                              Brian Helgeland


                     Based on the novel by James Ellroy








                                                 November 16, 1995
                                                 Minor Revisions












<b>        FADE IN:
</b>
        OVER the opening strains of "I LOVE YOU, CALIFORNIA," a
        MONTAGE:  a mixture of headlines, newsreel footage and
        live action.  <u>Economy Booming</u>!  <u>Postwar Optimism</u>!  <u>L.A.:</u>
        <u>City of the Future</u>!  But most prominent among them:
        <u>GANGLAND</u>!  Police photographers document crime scenes.
        The meat wagon hauls ex-button men to the morgue.  Where
        will it end?


<b>        EXT. L.A. SKYLINE - SUNSET
</b>
        Palm trees in silhouette against a cherry sky.  City
        lights twinkle.  Los Angeles.  A place where anything is
        possible.  A place where dreams come true.  As the sky
        darkens, triple-kleig lights begin to sweep back and
        forth.


<b>        EXT. MANSION (HANCOCK PARK) - NIGHT
</b>
        The KLEIG LIGHTS are out front.  Valets hurry to park a
        line of elegant cars.

<b>                                MAYOR (V.O.)
</b>                  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
                  the future of Los Angeles!


<b>        INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
        The MAYOR yanks a cloth to reveal a MODEL of L.A. criss-
        crossed by an elaborate FREEWAY SYSTEM.  The CROWD oohs.
        A COUNCILMAN claps.  A SOCIETY MATRON nods her approval.

        PIERCE PATCHETT, 50, tuxedoed, watches off to one side.
        A behind-the-scenes power broker, Patchett exudes
        authority much more so than the Mayor does.

<b>                                MAYOR
</b>                  The Arroyo Seco freeway is just
                  the beginning.  We're planning
                  freeways from Downtown to Santa
                  Monica, from the South Bay to the
                  San Fernando Valley.  Twenty
                  minutes to work or play is the
                  longest you'll have to travel.

        More applause.  One REPORTER asks a little too loudly...

<b>                                REPORTER
</b>                  How many bodies you think Mickey
                  Cohen'll be able to hide in all
                  that cement?

        The Mayor wears a plastic smile, ignores it.


<b>        INT. THE MOCAMBO - NIGHT
</b>
        A CLUB PHOTOGRAPHER pops snapshots, but the real action
        is on the floor where MICKEY COHEN does a wicked "Lindy
        Hop" with THREE different GIRLS at once.  A fireplug of a
        man, he hardly seems a public menace.  Nearby is his
        bodyguard JOHNNY STOMPANATO.  Over it all:

<b>                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
</b>                  Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey C to
                  his fans.  He's the big moocher,
                  local L.A. color to the nth
                  degree.  You know Mickey.  He runs
                  dope, rackets and prostitution.
                  He kills a dozen people a year.
                  But who you may not know is
                  bodyguard Johnny Stompanato.

        His hair in a slick pompadour, Stompanato keeps an eye on
        Cohen and comes onto a CIGARETTE GIRL at the same time.

<b>                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
</b>                  Johnny's handsome, ladies, but the
                  real attraction is below the belt.
                  Second only to Steve Cochran, he's
                  sometimes known as 'Oscar' because
                  of his Academy Award-size
                  appendage.

        Mickey works a sweat on the dance floor.  A bottle of
        champagne pops; Stompanato reacts, nearly draws a pistol
        from his shoulder holster.  As he laughs at himself...


        INT. <u>HUSH-HUSH</u> MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY

        Lurid page one headlines cover the wall where SID
        HUDGEONS types.  The essence of sleaze, Sid is the
        publisher-photographer-writer of <u>Hush-Hush</u> magazine and
        keeper of inside dirt supreme.  As he continues...

<b>                                HUDGEONS (V.O.)
</b>                  Remember, dear readers, you heard
                  it here first, off the record, on
                  the Q.T. and very <u>Hush-Hush</u>.


<b>        INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
        The party continues.  The Mayor has moved off to the side
        with the power brokers.  Patchett is a presence.

<b>                                MAYOR
</b>                  We're selling an image, gentlemen.
                  Beautiful weather.  Affordable
                  housing.
                         (re:  model)
                  Trouble-free transportation.  And
                  the best police department in the
                  world to keep it all running
                  smoothly.


<b>        EXT. STOREFRONT - NIGHT
</b>
        A dozen people watch a display windoe TELEVISION as it
        rolls the opening of the hit show "Badge of Honor."  Over
        familiar THEME MUSIC, "Sgt. Joe Reno" (actor BRETT CHASE)
        walks the streets of Los Angeles.

<b>                                CHASE (V.O.)
</b>                  My name?  Joe Reno.  The city?
                  Los Angeles.  A big town.  Full of
                  all sorts of people.  It's my job
                  to help them.  I like what I do.
                  I'm a cop.


<b>        INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
        The Mayor continues.

<b>                                MAYOR
</b>                  But with a second rate Al Capone
                  out there, L.A. looks like Chicago
                  in the '30s.  Something has to be
                  done.

        As Pierce Patchett nods sagely.


<b>        INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</b>
        Wrestler GORGEOUS GEORGE primps and poses before flatten-
        ing an opponent with a drop kick.


<b>        INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
</b>
        An enthusiastic crowd adjusts their 3-D glasses.


<b>        EXT. COHEN MANSION (BEVERLY HILLS) - DAY
</b>
        In monogrammed silk pajamas, Mickey Cohen answers the
        door, his pet BULLDOG Mickey Jr. at his feet.  The police
        are waiting.  REPORTERS' flashbulbs pop.

<b>                                POLICE OFFICER
</b>                  Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest.

<b>                                COHEN
</b>                  Bullshit.  What's the charge?

<b>                                POLICE OFFICER
</b>                  Non-payment of federal income tax.

<b>                                COHEN
</b>                  <u>Bullshit</u>.


<b>        EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE - DAY
</b>
        JOHN WAYNE gets his hand prints in the sidewalk.


<b>        EXT. WESTCHESTER BEAN FIELD - DAY
</b>
        MIGRANT WORKERS hurry to finish the harvest.  We PAN
        TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS who wait impatiently with bull-
        dozers under a "Spirit of the Future" BANNER.  As the
        last picker leaves the field, the bulldozers move in,
        leveling the bean rows to make way for a housing tract.


<b>        EXT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - STEPS - DAY
</b>
        Flashbulbs pop as Mickey Cohen exits and starts down
        the steps.  Accompanied by his LAWYERS, bodyguard
        Stompanato and mob lieutenants DEUCE PERKINS and NATE
        JANKLOW, Cohen ignores REPORTERS' shouts.

<b>                                REPORTER
</b>                  How's your bullshit now, Mickey?!

        As Cohen gets into a waiting car, the media turn their
        attention to District Attorney ELLIS LOEW.  A singularly
        ambitious man, Loew loves the spotlight.

<b>                                LOEW
</b>                  Today is an auspicious one for the
                  city of Los Angeles.  Mickey Cohen
                  has just been sentenced to ten
                  years in federal prison for
                  failure to pay income tax.
                  As the District Attorney for Los
                  Angeles County, it is my pleasure
                  to declare our great city
                  organized crime free.  It is truly
                  the dawning of a new day.

        The SONG ENDS and so does the MONTAGE.


<b>        INT. PACKARD (ACROSS FROM BULLOCKS WILSHIRE) - NIGHT
</b>
        December 24th.  Wendell "BUD" WHITE, 30, stares at the
        enormous Christmas tree on the deco platform over
        Bullocks' entrance.  An LAPD cop, Bud's rep as the
        toughest man on the force has been well earned.  In the
        back seat, with cases of Walker Black and Cutty Sark, is
        Bud's partner -- DICK STENSLAND.  Older, but also a tough
        hump, "Stens" sucks on a pint of Old Crow.

        The passenger door opens and Mickey Cohen bodyguard
        Johnny Stompanato slides in.  Guinea handsome, Johnny
        wears his curls in a tight pompadour.  With his boss
        behind bars, he's out of work.  Bud just stares at him.

</b>                  Officer White.  I heard you got a
                  hard-on for wife beaters.

<b>                                BUD

                  <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?

        Stompanato smiles.  Nervous.  Through the window, Bud
        watches a Salvation Army Santa palm coins from a kettle.

<b>                                STENSLAND

                  talk, Stompanato.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  Look, Mickey C's doing time and
                  half the other guys who'd hire me
                  are dead or left town.  I need
                  money.  If your snitch-fund's
                  green, I'll get you some fucking-A
                  collars.

        Impatient, Bud tugs at a finger, CRACKS a KNUCKLE.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  There's this guy.  He's blond and
                  fat, about forty.  Likes the
                  ponies.  Been pimping his wife to
                  cover his losses.  Knocks her
                  around to keep her in line.

        Bud's eyes narrow at this last bit of info.  Stompanato
        holds up a slip of paper.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  I figure the address is worth
                  twenty.

        Bud digs into his wallet, pulls out twenty bucks,
        exchanges it with Stompanato.  Stompanato smiles smugly,
        grabs a bottle of Scotch from the back.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  Yuletide cheer, fellas.

        Without warning, Bud grabs Stompanato's tie and yanks,
        slamming his forehead into the dash.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Happy New Year, greaseball.

        A stucco job in a row of vet prefabs.  A neon Santa
        sleigh has landed on the roof.  Through the front window,
        we see a fat guy browbeating a woman.  Puff-faced, 35-
        ish, she backs away as he rages at her.

        The Packard pulls up out front.  Stensland could care

        steps to the house.  Inside, we hear SLAPS, MUFFLED
        CRIES.  Bud grips an outlet cord coming off the roof and
        yanks.  The sleigh crashes to the ground with REINDEER
        EXPLODING around it.  A beat.  The fat guy runs out to
        investigate, trips over Rudolph.

        Bud pounces.  Fat guy takes a swing, misses.  Grabbing
        fat guy's hair, Bud smashes his face to the pavement.
        Once, twice.  Teeth skitter down the walk.

        Another face full of gravel.  Fat guy's WIFE watches with
        apprehension from the steps as Bud cuffs her husband's
        hands behind his back, empties his pockets.  A cash roll
        and car keys.  Bud looks over at her.

        Bud watches as she gets into a pre-war Ford in the drive.

        The "Badge of Honor" set.  A Christmas party in full
        swing.  Eating, drinking, and dancing.  Star Brett Chase,
        seen earlier on television, is holding court.

        LAPD Sgt. "Trashcan" JACK VINCENNES, late 30s with slick,
        good looks, dances with a young ACTRESS.  Grinding their
        way through a ballad, they're obviously hitting it off.

<b>                                ACTRESS
</b>                  Brett Chase told me you're the cop

                  These 'Badge of Honor' guys like
                  to pretend, but being the real
                  thing must be a thrill.

        The arc light floods the living room about the same time
        that Jack kicks the door in.  The room is caught flush:
        Christmas tree, a bag of weed on the couch, two kids
        necking in their BVDs.  MATT REYNOLDS and TAMMY JORDAN.

        tow.

        Jack scoops the pot, flips through an address book.  A

        Jack looks from the card out the window at the kids being

        with a YOUNG OFFICER.  Exley is an up-and-comer.  Burning
        with ambition.  The faster he rises through the ranks,

        Tinsel-trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  A case each of gin, Scotch, and
                  rum.  Everything top shelf.  None
                  of that watered-down stuff you
                  push on Errol Flynn.

                  Sounds like a helluva party.

        Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it
        up.  There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn.  She
        seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie
        stars.  Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the
        counter.  Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a
        moment.

<b>                                OWNER

        The Owner begins indiscriminately loading hard liquor
        into a cardboard box, leaving Bud and Lynn to look at
        each other.  Bud says the only thing he can think of.

<b>        EXT. HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - NIGHT

        Bud exits with his booze, heads for the car.  Something
        catches his eye.  A woman in the rear passenger seat of a
        new Cadillac.  SUSAN LEFFERTS.  Both her eyes are black.

        Bud starts over.  The case on his hip, he motions for her
        to roll down the window.  The driver's side door opens
        and bodyguard TURNER "BUZZ" MEEKS menaces his way out.

<b>                                MEEKS
</b>                  Get lost why don't you?

        Meeks stops short as Bud shoves his badge in Meeks' face.
        Setting the case on the car's hood, Bud spins Meeks
        around, pats him down.  He finds a .38 in a shoulder
        holster.

<b>                                MEEKS
</b>                  I got a license for that.

        Bud removes Meeks' wallet, checks the ID.

<b>                                MEEKS
</b>                  Cut me some slack.  I used to be a

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Turner Meeks?  Never heard of you.

                  We just call him Buzz.

        Bud raps on Susan's window with his badge.  It comes
        down.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  You okay?

        Beside her, a man leans over.  Pierce Patchett, seen
        before at the freeway unveiling, is a man used to being

        holder.

                  I'm not asking you.

        Patchett has no idea he's walking on thin ice.  As he
        stares impatiently at Bud, Bud looks back to Susan.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Somebody hit you?

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  It's not what you think.

        Bud looks to see Lynn Bracken moving to the driver's
        door.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  What is it then?

<b>                                SUSAN
</b>                  You got the wrong idea, Mister.
                  I'm fine.

        Susan laughs.  Patchett eases back into the shadows.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                         (getting in the car)
                  But it's nice to know you care.

        Bud considers Meeks' gun license, then hands him back the
        .38 and wallet.  Lifting his booze, Bud watches Meeks get
        back in the car.

        Stensland steps up as the cabbie starts to pull away.

</b>                  What's going on?

        For an odd moment, Stensland and Meeks lock eyes.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  You know him?

<b>        CLOSE ON DUDLEY SMITH
</b>
        Fifty, handsome in his police captain's uniform.  Singing
        "Silver Bells" in a beautiful low tenor.  Tough,
        respected, Dudley goes to bed as a cop every night of his
        life.  He's a department power to be reckoned with.


<b>        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
        An <u>L.A. Herald Express</u> REPORTER and photographer listen
        along with the gathered patrolmen as Dudley finishes to
        applause.  Dudley joins the press.

<b>                                REPORTER
</b>                  Captain Smith, I --

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Drop the formalities; it's
                  Christmas Eve.  Call me Dudley.

<b>                                REPORTER
</b>                  Dudley, I came up with a title for
                  the story.  I'm calling it "Silent
                  Night with the L.A.P.D."

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Excellent.  How's this?
                         (dramatic pause)
                  The sanctity of the night is an
                  invitation to the darker criminal
                  element.  Our vigilance will not
                  be diminished.

        As the Reporter scribbles down the quote...

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  That's Smith with an S.

        They laugh.  Dudley points the way out.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  This way, gentlemen.

        Dudley's the last one out the door.  As he goes, he turns
        back to give the men a wink.  He's no sooner out the door
        when the first case of Johnny Walker is brought in.


<b>        INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT
</b>
        Ed Exley gets another report from the Young Officer.

<b>                                YOUNG OFFICER
</b>                  Two police officers were assaulted
                  in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski.

        He hands the report to Exley.  It's now that Dudley comes
        through on his press junket.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of
                  the legendary Preston Exley.  He's
                  the watch commander tonight and a
                  damn fine job.

        As the photographer snaps Exley's picture...

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  I was fortunate enough to be
                  partnered with his father when I
                  was a rookie.  It makes a man feel
                  old.  That's a fact.
                         (a beat)
                  Feel free to get a feel for the
                  place.

        As the Reporter and photographer wander off, Dudley turns
        to Exley a bit more serious.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  A word with you, lad.


<b>        INT. DUDLEY SMITH'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
        Dudley pours two drinks, hands one to Exley.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  To the memory of your father.

        They drink.  Exley looks to a photo on the wall.

        Himself as a ten-year-old standing between Dudley and his
        father Preston, both in police uniform.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  The day he got the Medal of Valor.
                  A simpler time.

        Remembering, Exley invokes his father's favorite toast.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  To the solving of crimes that
                  require absolute justice.

        Exley raises his glass, but Dudley just watches him.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  That was his favorite toast.

                  I saw the test results on the
                  lieutenant's exam.  You placed
                  first out of twenty-three.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  The youngest applicant by eight
                  years.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  You'll make lieutenant inside a
                  year.  Patrol division?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I was thinking Detective Bureau.

        We can see Dudley doesn't approve.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  You don't have the eye for human
                  weakness to be a good detective.
                  Or the stomach.  You're a
                  political animal, Edmund.

        The criticism stings, but Dudley's a straight shooter.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  You're wrong.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Am I...?  Would you be willing to
                  plant corroborative evidence on a
                  suspect you knew was guilty in
                  order to ensure an indictment?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Dudley, we've been over this.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Answer yes or no.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I... No.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Would you be willing to rig crime
                  scene evidence to support a
                  prosecuting attorney's working
                  hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  No.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Would you be willing to beat
                  confessions out of suspects you
                  knew to be guilty?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  No.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Would you be willing to shoot
                  hardened criminals in the back to
                  offset the chance --

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  No.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Then for God's sake, don't be a
                  detective.  Stick to assignments
                  where you won't have to make those
                  choices.  Patrol, Internal
                  Affairs, but not the Bureau.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I know you mean well, Dudley, but
                  I don't need to do it the way you
                  did.  Or my father.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  At least get rid of the glasses.
                  I can't think of one Bureau man
                  who wears them.

</b>                  And fuck your mother too.

        Bud sees red.  Letting go of Stensland, Bud White picks
        up Garcia by the neck.  There are cheers, "Attaboys" and
        "Holy Fucks" as Bud bangs Garcia's head on the ceiling.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                         (arriving)
                  Stop, Officer!  That's an order!

        Cops block Exley's way.  As Bud looks over, Garcia kicks
        him in the balls.  A dangling shot.  Bud keels into the
        bars, Garcia stumbles out of the cell, smack into Jack.

        Jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer,
        then puts Garcia down with a left-right.

        Exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  You're going in my report!  All of
                  you!

        Exley has just started taking names when Bud grabs him by
        the scruff of the neck and hauls him off balance into...


<b>        HALL
</b>
        As Exley struggles, a cop opens the door to the store
        room.  Bud slings Exley inside, then slams the door
        tight.  Exley is locked in.  As Bud moves off, we hear
<b>        POUNDING.
</b>
<b>                                EXLEY (V.O.)
</b>                  Let me out!  That's an order!


<b>        CELL BLOCK
</b>
        The <u>Herald</u> Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned
        and unnoticed.  Stensland swings like a madman.  That's
        when a flashbulb goes off.  Freezing everyone in black
        and white.

<b>                                                   DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>        INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
        The CHIEF sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform.
        Dudley Smith sits to his left, D.A. Ellis Loew to his
        right.  Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press
        conference, Loew is the only civilian.  Bud White stands
        across from them.  There to be judged.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  Officer White, you've refused to
                  cooperate with Internal Affairs.
                  But you should know this is bigger
                  than a police board.  Indictments
                  may be handed down.  Quite
                  frankly, we need police witnesses
                  to offset the damage done to the
                  Department's image.  Will you
                  testify?

        Bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  No, sir.  I won't.

        The Chief sighs, looks to Loew.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  District Attorney Loew.

        Loew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell
        block photo.  The headline:  "BLOODY CHRISTMAS."

<b>                                LOEW
</b>                  Bloody Christmas.  The press love
                  to label.  You and Officer
                  Stensland brought the liquor into
                  the precinct.  Stensland was
                  already drunk.  Do you see how
                  appearing as a voluntary witness
                  against him could offset the
                  damage you've done to yourself?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  I won't do it.
                         (staring at mirror)
                  I won't testify against my partner
                  or anyone else.

<b>                                LOEW
</b>                  This man is a disgrace.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  Your badge and gun, Officer.

        Bud sets them on The Chief's desk.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  This is the new L.A.P.D., White.
                  You're suspended from duty and
                  dismissed.

        Turning, White shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as
        he makes his way out.  Dudley Smith hides a smile.


<b>        OTHER SIDE OF GLASS
</b>
        Exley watches, involuntarily leans back as Bud passes on
        the other side of the glass.


<b>        THE CHIEF'S OFFICE
</b>
        Dudley, Loew and The Chief wait as Exley enters.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  Ed, your observations have been
                  astute.  What's your assessment of
                  this situation?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  The public demands justice, sir.
                  This was a full-fledged riot of
                  policemen.  Shift the guilt to men
                  whose pensions are secured.  Force
                  them to retire.  But someone has
                  to swing.  Indict, try and convict
                  Stensland and Bud White.  Secure
                  them jail time.  Feed them to the
                  sharks, sir.  Protect yourself;
                  protect the department.

        Dudley gives Exley a look.  He's angry with him.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight
                  D fitness reports from every C.O.
                  he ever served under.  But White
                  is a valuable officer.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  White's a mindless thug.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  No, Edmund.  He's a man who can
                  answer yes to those questions I
                  ask you from time to time.

        The Chief interrupts with his own concern.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  I want to know who we give the
                  public in contrast?  The
                  department needs role models.
                  Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the
                  public can admire.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid
                  to do what's right.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  And I'll promote you.  You'll be a
                  lieutenant immediately.

        Exley seizes the moment, going over Dudley's head.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  <u>Detective</u> lieutenant.

        The Chief and Dudley exchange a look.  Neither approves.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't
                  make lieutenant until he was 33.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I know that, sir.  I also know
                  that when he made lieutenant, it
                  was as a detective.

<b>                                LOEW
</b>                         (interrupting)
                  Before we start polishing our
                  laurels, it would look better if
                  we had a corroborative witness.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  That'll be hard to come by.  The
                  men hate a turncoat.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Jack Vincennes.  He's the
                  technical advisor on 'Badge of
                  Honor,' sir.  He lives for it.
                  That's the way to get him.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  All right, Ed.
                         (into desk
                          intercom)
                  Call Sergeant Vincennes.

        As Exley starts out, Dudley pulls him aside, speaks low.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  You'll reap the benefits, but are
                  you truly prepared to be despised
                  within the department?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Yes, Dudley.  I am.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  So be it.


<b>        JACK VINCENNES
</b>
        Looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the...


<b>        CHIEF'S OFFICE
</b>
        Round two.  Centred on Jack.  Exley is gone.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Sergeant, we'll get right to it.
                  Nine civilian witnesses have
                  identified you as hitting Ezekiel
                  Garcia.

<b>                                LOEW
</b>                  But my office has a stellar
                  witness who will tell the grand
                  jury that you hit back only after
                  being hit.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  What do I have to do?

                  pensions.  Our key witness will
                  testify roundly, but you can plead
                  ignorance to questions directed at
                  the other men.

<b>                                CHIEF

                  followed by a temporary transfer
                  from Narcotics to Ad Vice.
                         (a beat)
                  When you transfer out of Vice,
                  you'll be back on the show.

        The Chief just got Jack where he lives.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  John, I doubt you've ever drawn a
                  stupid breath.  Don't start now.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Okay.  I'll do it.

        Smiles all around.  Loew smiles at the two-way.  A move
        not lost on Jack who wonders who might be on the other
        side.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  Dismissed, Vincennes.

        Jack leaves.  The Chief steps to the mirror, looks
        through.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  So be it.  <u>Detective</u> Lieutenant.


<b>        OTHER SIDE OF GLASS

        Exley clenches his fist in victory.  The Chief continues.

<b>                                CHIEF

<b>        INT. ROOM 114 (GRAND JURY WITNESS ROOM) - DAY

        Glasses off, Exley waits, looks up as Jack enters.

<b>                                JACK

<b>                                EXLEY

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  You're playing an angle, college

                  of this so you don't have to
                  hobnob with the fucking rank and
                  file cops who'll hate your guts
                  for snitching.  If they're making
                  you a detective, watch out.  Some
                  Bureau guys are gonna burn in this
                  and you're gonna have to work with
                  friends of theirs.

<b>                                EXLEY

                  week.  Next to you I'm clean.  And

        At that, a CLERK steps in from the hallway.

<b>                                JACK

                  of his life.  They already
                  suspended him.  Just pray he cops
                  a deal and stays on the Department
                  because that is one civilian you
                  do not want on your case.


<b>        INT. TWILIGHT LOUNGE - NIGHT

        An old black guy in a frayed, threadbare tux plays piano.
        Bud, nursing a highball at the bar, steps over to a
        REDHEAD with too much make-up on too many miles.

<b>                                BUD

                         (as she nods)
                  My name's Bud.

<b>                                REDHEAD

        A hand on Bud's shoulder.  He turns to see Dudley Smith.

        Dudley sits at a table.  A newspaper is opened, a little
        mound underneath.  Bud joins Dudley.

<b>                                BUD

                  indicted?  Does it say Exley's a
                  hero for squealing me and
                  Stensland off?

                  necessary adjutant to the job.
                  And I am most impressed with your

<b>        INT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

        A nerdy 14-YEAR-OLD asks Brett Chase:

</b>                  Why'd you become a policeman?

<b>                                CHASE
</b>                  I'm not a policeman.  I just play
                  one on television.  But I think I
                  can answer for them.  To help
                  people.  That's why I do the show.

        Chase looks over and winks at Jack who waits in the
        wings.

<b>                                CHASE
</b>                  To protect and serve.  It's not
                  just a motto.

        As the kids applaud, Chase joins Jack who gives him a
        quick drag of a cigarette.  A nervous PA joins them.
        Chase points out a fetching girl in the second row.

<b>                                CHASE

                  wait.

        Chase and Jack watch the PA ask "Sweater" a question
        while pointing to Chase.  Maybe sixteen, she nods "yes"
        eagerly.

        the cover to reveal several bags of white powder.
        Heroin.

                  Mostly narcotics and prostitution

        As Exley pulls in, his two-way drones:

        Accompanied by Bud, Dick Stensland crams the contents of

        back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks
        like he's going to cry.

        It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face
        with them.  This is hatred.

        Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley.  It's a mauling.
        Four vicious body shots.  A potentially lethal head shot
        sails wide as Exley falls to the ground.

        As four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him.

        Stensland gets in the car, drives off.  Bud is left
        alone.

        Exley sits alone in a sea of desks.  The SQUAWK BOX
        DRONES.  Exley squints at the clock on the wall, can't
        make it out.  He takes his glasses from the inside of his

        Exley takes mental snapshots.  Ten stools front a

        perched on street signs.  On the right a string of
        tables.  Three in disarray.  Food spilled, dishes broken.
        A high-heel pump by an upended chair.

        Heel drag marks across the linoleum floor heading back

        Blood-soaked bodies on the floor.  Five, maybe six in a

        The motel is surrounded by a barbed-wire fence.
        Abandoned but for a pair of LAPD cars and a light burning

        Bare.  A table and chair bolted to the floor.  A tough
        FLAT-NOSED GANGSTER is cuffed to the hot seat.  On the
        table are a .45 and a fat roll of $100 bills.

        Breuning and Carlisle watch as Bud White delivers a
        couple of short, stiff body shots.  Flatnose is not used
        to being on the receiving end.  All the same, we get the
        idea Bud's a bit reluctant.

        Bud's back is to Dudley and Exley who enter behind him.

        but a sheet hides the real damage.  It's the girl Bud saw
        outside Hollywood Liquor.  Without the black eyes, she
        does look like Rita hayworth.

        As Bud and Exley appear, Mrs. Lefferts looks confused.

<b>                                CORONER
</b>                  Is this your daughter, Mrs.
                  Lefferts?

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  I -- I don't know.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  We know this is difficult.  Just
                  take your time and look again.

        Exley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  It seems like my Susan, but...

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  When was the last time you saw
                  her, Mrs. Lefferts?

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  At Christmas.  We had fought.  I
                  didn't like her boyfriend.  I --
                  she has a birthmark on her hip.

        The Coroner lifts the sheet.  Mrs. Lefferts gasps.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  It's her.  My baby.  Dear God...

        As Mrs. Lefferts swoons, Bud and Exley both hold her up.


<b>        INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
</b>
        The room buzzes, jammed to the rafters with every
        detective standing ready.  The Chief waits as Dudley
        Smith takes the mike, holds up an <u>L.A. Times</u> headline.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  'Nite Owl Massacre.'  Hyperbole
                  aside, this is a heinous crime
                  that requires a swift resolution.
                  The public will demand it and this
                  department will provide it.  Six
                  victims.  One of them, one of our
                  own -- Dick Stensland.
                         (as the cops react)
                  As it happens, he was a Nite Owl
                  regular.  In the wrong place at
                  the wrong time.

        Bud White listens, not too sure.  Stensland said he had
        something big going on...

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Robbery looks like the motive.  We
                  have rubber glove prints on the
                  register and preliminary forensics
                  strongly lean toward a trio of
                  gunmen.  We do have one hot lead,
                  so listen well.  Three Negro
                  youths were seen last night
                  discharging shotguns in the air at
                  Griffith Park.
                  A park ranger I.D.ed them as
                  driving a 1948 to 1950 Mercury
                  Coupe, purple in color.  An hour
                  ago, a canvassing crew found a
                  news vendor who saw a purple Merc
                  Coupe parked across from the Nite
                  Owl around 3:00 A.M.

        The room goes loud, a big rumbling.  Dudley holds up a
        list.

                  registered to Negroes in L.A.
                  County.  Fifty two-man teams will
                  shake three names apiece.  Hot
                  suspects you'll bring here.
                  Interrogation rooms have been set
                  up.  They'll be run by Lieutenant

        Catcalls.  Boos.  The Chief steps to the mike.

<b>                                CHIEF
</b>                  Enough on that.  Gentlemen, just
                  go out and get them.  Use all
                  necessary force.  The people of
                  Los Angeles demand it.

        The men exchange knowing looks.  The real message:  kill
        them clean.  Exley doesn't approve.  As the men hurry
        out...

<b>                                EXLEY

        watches everyone go.  Wishes he could be part of the
        action.  He spots Jack talking to his REDNECK partner for
        for the day.

        As Redneck thinks, Exley steps up.  He's overheard.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I'll take those odds.

        Jack stares.  Redneck shrugs, spits tobacco juice in a
        cup.

        A big, pink Spanish mansion with lots of tile.  Also last
        seen outside Hollywood Liquor on Christmas Eve, Pierce
        Patchett is in the front yard, chipping golf balls over a
        koi pond.  They land in a tight grouping.  As he tees up:

        Bud's halfway up the walk.  Patchett sees the cuffs
        hooked to his belt.  Patchett is cool as can be.

<b>                                 BUD

                  Is it the cops?

        She waves him off.  As he practices pointing his finger
        like Ladd points a gun, Lynn reacts to the news on the
        phone.

        A South Central plywood and tar-paper dive.  A BLACK
        BOXER pounds a heavy bag/speed bag combo bolted to the
        porch.  Wiry, a welterweight, he doesn't see Jack and
        Exley till they're almost on top of him.

<b>                                JACK

        The Boxer leans on the bag to catch his breath.  Looking
        them over, he finally nods.

<b>                                JACK

        Exley nods, this is true.  The Boxer's still listening.

<b>                                JACK

        Jack holds the DMV list out to the Boxer, who waves it

                  Sugar Ray Coates.  Drives a '49

                  his thrills killing dogs.  He is
                  righteous trash.

        Jack and Exley scan the list.  Jack's finger stabs down
        on, "Coates, Raymond, 9611 South Central, Room 414."

<b>                                JACK

        Lynn does her best to usher the slightly disheveled
        Older Gentleman out the door.

        Bud's standing at the bottom of the stairs.  The Older
        Gentleman strikes a pose.  He still thinks he's Alan
        Ladd.

        Sputtering, the Older Gentleman exchanges a look with

                  probably something bigger on the
                  side.  He doesn't want any

                  Actually, it was two.  You're
                  different, Officer White.  You're
                  the first man in five years who
                  didn't tell me I look like

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  He takes a cut of our earnings

                  us quit the life at thirty.  He
                  doesn't let us use narcotics and
                  he doesn't abuse us.  Can your
                  policeman's mentality grasp
                  those contradictions?

<b>                                BUD

                  the news that's fit to print.

        Lynn starts toward the door.  Bud watches her a moment,
        then follows.  She takes his glass at the door.

        Out the door, Bud turns back.  Blurts:

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Look.  I want to see you again.

<b>                                LYNN

<b>                                BUD
</b>                         (suddenly unsure)
                  I don't know.

<b>                                LYNN

                  If it's a date I think you'd
                  better tell me your first name
                  because I --

                  Forget I asked.  It was a
                  mistake.

        Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away.
        He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off.
        A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car...

        An L-shaped walk-up.  Jack coasts the car to the curb.
        He leaps out with Exley.  Exley holds up at the sight
        of a late model sedan.  He leans down to look in the

        VOICES from the carport ahead.  We see a chrome bumper,
        the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe.  A door slams.
        Drawing a .45, Jack starts over with Exley, .38 in hand.

        bringing up the rear.  Squinting, Exley reaches to his
        pocket for something.  Not there.

                  Just don't shoot me.

        The door to 414.  Two men on either side.  Breuning rears
        back.  Jack rears back.  They kick at the same instant.
        The door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black
        men, LARRY FONTAINE and TY JONES, waking from a couple
        of flop mattresses.

        Fontaine jumps up.  Entering, Carlisle aims, but Exley
        grabs his arm.  The BLAST rips the ceiling.  Jack aims.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Freeze!

        Fontaine freezes.  Jones doesn't dare get up.

        Jack and Exley burst into a...


<b>        SECOND BEDROOM
</b>
        Another black, RAY COATES, passed out on mattress, sur-
        rounded by empty beer cans.  Jack sticks his .38 in his
        back, starts to cuff him.  As the cuff ratchets down...


<b>        INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</b>
        Dudley watches intently as Ed Exley skims a report,
        memorizing names and dates.  Jack and other brass are
        also here along with a stenographer.  So's Bud.  One of
        these guys killed Stensland.  Through tinted glass, the
        three suspects in three different rooms.

                  saw them burning clothes.

        Satisfied, Exley sets the report down.

<b>                                DUDLEY

<b>        INT. #1 ROOM - DAY

        Exley closes the door.  Ray Coates is cuffed to a chair,
        dressed in baggy County denims.  One eye swollen shut,
        lip split, a smashed nose with one nostril split.

        Exley unlocks his cuffs. drops cigarettes and amtches
        on the table.  As Coates rubs his wrists...

<b>                                EXLEY

                  They say Robinson can throw a
                  four punch combination in one
                  second.  Do you believe that?

        Coates just stares at him.

        No bite.  Coates just stares back.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  You look like Robinson after

                  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You
                  did the Casitas Youth Camp with

                  business.

        Unseen by Coates, Exley reaches under the table, takes
        hold of one of three toggle switches.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Sugar, Larry told me you went

                  found yourself a big white boy
                  to look after you.  He said
                  they call you 'Sugar' because
                  you gave it out so sweet.

        Exley flips the toggle.

        Coates nods.  Exley flips up the toggles as he leans
        in.

        The door blasts open.  Bud slams Jones up against the
        wall.  As Exley stands, he bangs his knee on the table.
        Pulling a .38, Bud breaks the cylinder, drops 5 shells
        on the floor.

        Bud shoves the barrel into Jones' mouth, pulls the
        trigger twice.  CLICK, CLICK.  Jones starts to slide
        down the wall.  Bud jerks him back up, roars.

<b>                                BUD

        Bud is out the door and scooting down an alley.  Exley

        Bud vaults a fence, pads up the back porch.  A screen

        inside.

        Bud heads for a blind-covered door.  Unlocked, he

        A NUDE GIRL spread-eagled on a mattress.  Bound with

        Directing him.  Raising the .38, Bud enters...


<b>        THE KITCHEN
</b>
        Sylvester Fitch sits naked at the table wolfing Rice
        Krispies and watching "Badge of Honor" on a flickering
        TV.  He looks up, sees the .38 before he sees Bud beyond
        it.  Fitch drops his spoon, raises his hands.

        Bud SHOOTS him in the face.  Dead, Fitch just sits there.

        Bud moves behind him.  Pulling a spare piece from an
        ankle holster, Bud FIRES back at the door from Fitch's
        line of fire, then puts the gun in Fitch's hand.

        We hear the FRONT DOOR CRASH OPEN.  As Fitch slides off
        the chair to the floor, Bud dumps the Rice Krispies on
        him.

        The Girl on a stretcher.  Being carried to an AMBULANCE.
        Bud White walks alongside, looking like some ferocious
        pet pit bull.  The ATTENDANTS get her inside.  One joins
        her.  The other closes the door, pauses to light a smoke.

        Bud rips the cigarette out of his mouth, nearly taking
        the guy's lips with it.

        Bud goes after Exley, but ten hands pull them apart.
        Dudley on Exley.  Four cops genuinely having trouble
        on Bud.

        And as if things couldn't get crazier, shouts from the
        cops on the street.  POLICE RADIOS CRANKED UP.

        Exley strides through with purpose, beelines to a filing
        cabinet.  Exley pulls the file he's looking for.  He
        scans an interrogation transcript, reads to himself the
        words he's looking for:

        A few cops mumble they haven't.  As Exley decides what
        to do, Carlisle from the original arrest steps over.

        Exley squints, reaches to a pocket.  <u>No glasses</u>.  He
        passes an elevator, rounds a corner.  There's 408.  Exley
        pumps the shotgun, nods to Carlisle who kicks the door
        in.

        Fontaine and Caucasian NAVARETTE at a table.  Coates on

        Fontaine and Navarette raise their hands.  A jostled BEER
        BOTTLE CRASHES to the floor.  Reacting, Carlisle JERKS
        the TRIGGER.  Fontaine goes down.

        Navarette draws a .38, SHOOTS Carlisle twice in the
        chest.  Exley BLASTS Navarette.

        Screaming, Jones pulls a .45 from his belt.  Exley FIRES,
        blowing him right THROUGH the WINDOW.

        Coates draws and FIRES, makes a run for it.  A bad pull
        takes out half a back wall.  Coates is out the door.

        flecked with blood, he's clapped on the back by Dudley

        gives her a peck on the cheek and continues in past her.
        Lynn's about to follow him in when she pauses to deadpan
        a look down the street.

        Bud's Packard is parked there and we can see his darkened

        Exley steps up.  The Chief hangs a gold medallion around
        his neck.  Flashbulbs pop as the two men shake hands.

        Exley then accepts a handshake from Dudley.  The
        policemen stand on cue, applaud without enthusiasm.
        Dudley lifts the medal from his chest.

                  Matched forensically.  A few loose
                  ends don't matter.

                  inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?

        Dudley puts an arm around Exley's shoulder, smiles out as
        more bulbs flash.

                  It's natural.  Just keep it
                  inside.  Between you and you.

        Exley considers his medal.  It is an appealing thing.

        In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat.  No one's
        watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows
        pretend smoke off the barrel.  As the song ends...

        Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes.  Chase then winks
        knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile.

        Hudgeons scans the crowd, points someone out.

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  You remember Matt Reynolds?

        Jack spots Matt Reynolds -- one of the young actors Jack
        arrested on Christmas Eve.

</b>                  The Grauman's Chinese pot bust.
                  He just got off the honor farm.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  What's he doing here, Sid?

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  You tight with the D.A., trash?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Sure, he just tried to throw me
                  off the force last Christmas as a
                  little joke.

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  How'd you like a little payback?
                  Not to mention a donation to the
                  widows and orphans fund.  Did you
                  know Loew was a swish?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  And Reynolds?

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  He's queer too.  Metro paid him
                  two grand a week to fake it with
                  ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm
                  getting him to fuck the D.A. for a
                  hundred bucks.
                         (winks)
                  That's twice the fifty you got for
                  wrecking his career.

        Even Jack's not immune to a comment like that.

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  Matt!  Over here!

        As Hudgeons heads over, Hudgeons points out...

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  That's D.A. Loew right there.

        Reynolds gets a nervous bead on Loew.  Hudgeons realizes:

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  You need a drink, kid... Jack,
                  look after him a minute.  Kid,
                  this is Jack.  No secrets between
                  me and him.

        Hudgeons heads off.  Reynolds, plae, nods at Jack.

<b>                                REYNOLDS

</b>                  Yeah.

        Jack doesn't really feel like talking to him.  Reynolds'
        nerves won't let him stay quiet.

<b>                                REYNOLDS
</b>                  Was it a party?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Something like that.

<b>                                REYNOLDS

                  Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party,
                  right?

        Jack remembers the name, plays along for what it's worth.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you

</b>                  Dope, liquor, hookers that look
                  like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett
                  has it all.

        Jack recognizes the name, bluffs for more information.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way
                  back.

<b>                                REYNOLDS
</b>                  Pierce isn't like regular people.
                  I dig him, but he scares me too.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Really?  How?

<b>                                REYNOLDS
</b>                         (shakes his head)
                  You know, when I came out to L.A.,
                  this isn't exactly where I saw
                  myself ending up.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Yeah.  Me neither.

        Reynolds looks like he's going to cry.  Hudgeons returns
        with a double Scotch straight up and a hot dog with
        sauerkraut.  He hands the drink to Matt.

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  Dutch courage, kid.  Drink up.

        Reynolds downs a few gulps, looks across the room at
        Loew.

<b>                                REYNOLDS
</b>                  I don't know if I should do this.

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  Hey, it's not like you don't know
                  how.  And Jack here has
                  connections on 'Badge of Honor.'
                  Pull this off and there'll be a
                  part for you.  I smell a comeback.
                  Don't you, Jack?

        Reynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Loew's free.  Congratulate him.

        Reynolds nods, drains his glass and heads off.  Hudgeons
        hands Jack a folded slip of paper.

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  If Reynolds works his charms,
                  which he will, this is the address
                  where they'll be.  Meet me at
                  midnight.  I guarantee all sorts
                  of illegal activity.

        Hudgeons takes out a President Grant $50 bill.  Jack
        doesn't take it.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Sid, why would a guy like Pierce
                  Patchett get involved with running
                  dope and hookers?

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  Where'd you hear that?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Around.

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  Jackie, all I know is what you
                  know.  The man is very rich.  And
                  he's invested in freeway
                  construction so he's gonna get a
                  lot richer.  But that's it.
                  Patchett's what I like to call
                  'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he
                  ain't Red, he can't help me in my
                  quest for prime sinuendo.

        Jack takes the $50 as Reynolds returns, shaking his head.

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  <u>What</u>?

<b>                                REYNOLDS
</b>                  I can't do it.

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  Talk to him, Jack.  Tell him about
                  the opening on the show.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  I'm pretty sure I can get you a
                  part on the show... But tonight?
                  Pretend it's an acting job, kid.
                  Showbiz.

<b>                                REYNOLDS
</b>                  And no one'll know about this?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  It'll be our secret.

<b>                                REYNOLDS
</b>                  Showbiz.

        Emboldened by Jack's promise, Reynolds heads off.  Jack
        and Hudgeons watch as he strikes a conversation with Loew
        who's captivated.  Hudgeons chomps a bite of his hot dog,
        gives Jack the high sign, but Jack just feels like a pimp.

        Screams.  A cauliflower-eared Cleveland mob enforcer on
        the hotseat.

        Breuning works him with a rubber hose as Dudley asks
        unanswered questions.  Bud watches, revulsion growing.

<b>                                DUDLEY

                  Go back to Cleveland, lad.  This

                  haven't got any wings.

        More screams as the hose thwops down.  Bud looks away,
        then shuffles blindly out of the room.


<b>        INT. VICTORY HOTEL - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
        Bud runs water in the sink to drown out the SCREAMS.  It
        doesn't work.  Finally, he leans down and sticks his head
        under the stream of water.  That doesn't work either.


<b>        EXT. VICTORY HOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
        Hair dripping wet, Bud makes it to his car.  The tires
        spit gravel as he tears away.  Dudley appears in the
        doorway, watching curiously.  As cauliflower continues to
<b>        SCREAM...
</b>

<b>        INT. BUD'S PACKARD - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - NIGHT
</b>
        Bud watches Lynn Bracken's apartment,  Colored lights
        play on the windows.  Shadows pass.  Finally the front
        door opens.  There's Veronica Lake, all sparkles and
        spangles, kissing another distinguished gentleman
        goodnight.  Bud watches the man into a waiting limo.  As
        it pulls away...


<b>        INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - LIVING ROOM -
</b><b>        NIGHT

        Now Lynn just looks tired.  As she puts away Scotch
        bottles and picks up empty glasses, there's a KNOCK on
        the door.  Lynn sighs, become sultry Veronica Lake before
        our eyes.


<b>        INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

                  Did you forget some --

        Bud stands there, filling up the door frame.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  I wondered when you might ring the

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  It's Bud.

        Bud looks at Lynn a moment, then down at his own feet.
        Embarrassed.  She smiles.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  You should see yourself.  You look
                  like you're ten years old.

        Bud looks back up.  Lynn's smile fades as she studies his
        face.  She's not going to ask questions.  Lynn looks at
        him a moment more, then runs a hand through the blonde
        hair covering one eye.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  If you'd called first, I wouldn't
                  look this ridiculous.


<b>        INT. LYNN BRACKEN'S (1736 NOTTINGHAM) - BEDROOM - NIGHT

        Lynn comes to Bud naked, her hair brushed back.  Bud goes
        slow, gently, takes time with his kisses:  like she was a
        lonely woman he wanted to love to death.

        Lynn plays off his timing:  her kisses back, her touches.
        Finally, Bud forces himself to stop.  He pulls back so he
        can see her.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  You're wondering if Patchett told
                  me to be receptive.

        Bud doesn't answer, but yes.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  It doesn't matter.  I like you,
                  Bud.  I really do.

        She kisses him.  Softly, drawing it out.  Not a job.  She
        wants to make love to him.  And as Bud stops thinking...


<b>        EXT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE (HOLLYWOOD) - NIGHT

        Jack sits in his car waiting.  He checks his watch...
        1:30.  Well past midnight.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Come on, Sid.  Where are you?

        Jack decides.  MOVE WITH him as he gets out and crosses
        the street.  The apartment is dark, the front door a few
        inches ajar.  Suspicious, Jack listens.  Dead quiet.  He
        enters...


<b>        INT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE - NIGHT

        No one here it seems.  Till Jack nearly trips over a
        body.  Matt Reynolds.  Soaked in blood.  Throat slit.
        Jack looks down in horror as Reynolds seems to stare back
        up at him.  Jack stumbles out the door.  We hear his CAR
        DOOR SLAM shut, the SCREECH of RUBBER down the street.


<b>        EXT. 2345 HALBORO (HUDGEONS' HOUSE) - NIGHT

        Jack pounds on Sid's door till lights switch on.

<b>                                JACK

        is the President Grant fifty.  The things he's done for
        fifty bucks... As he looks up with despair at his
        reflection in the bar mirror, the Bartneder sets down a
        bottle and shot glass.  He plucks the fifty from Jack's
        hand.

        Jack grabs the bottle and starts out.

        Spent, Bud and Lynn lie in bed.  SHe traces a finger over
        his bicep as he muses on the ceiling.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Who was that guy who was here
                  earlier?

        Lynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small
        white scar.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  It doesn't matter.  All they get
                  is Veronica Lake.  You got the
                  real Lynn Margaret Bracken...
                         (re: scar)
                  Where'd this come from?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  When I was ten, my old man threw a
                  bottle at my mother.  I guess I
                  got in the way.

<b>                                LYNN

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Yeah.  But not for long.

        Bud looks away.  Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about
        it.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  Do you like being a cop, Bud?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  I used to.  What I do now is
                  strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff...
                  No, I don't like it.  If I could
                  work Homicide like a real
                  detective...

        Lynn listens sympathetically.  Bud's opening up.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  There's something wrong with the

                  the wrong guys.  But they made him
                  a hero and whoever killed my
                  partner is still out there.

        Frustrated, Bud pokes at his own chest.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  In here I know it.  But I can't
                  prove it.  I'm not a detective.
                  I'm not smart enough.  I'm just
                  the guy they bring in to scare the
                  other guy shitless.

        Bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of
        himself.  Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her.

<b>                                LYNN

<b>                                BUD

        Lynn nods.  That simple.

                  think of anything.

        Pinker is ticked as Bud steps over to where a group of
        Nite Owl crime scene photos are posted on the wall.  Bud
        pauses at a photo which shows the floor around the table.

                  If she was sitting here, then it's
                  facing the wrong way.  What are

<b>                                PINKER

        Pinker rummages a shelf for a glass jar which he hands
        Bud.  Inside are two wax-saturated cotton balls.

        Mrs. Lefferts talks directly to a photo of her daughter.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  Susie, I told you I didn't approve
                  of that boyfriend.  He was too old
                  for you.  You let him come into
                  this house and be fresh to me.  I
                  went out one day and old Mrs.
                  Jensen next door saw Susan's
                  boyfriend and another man and
                  thought she heard a ruckus.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  We were never properly introduced.
                  Susan and I were fighting that
                  day.  She called him by a
                  nickname.  Muns or Lunts or
                  something.

<b>                                BUD

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Look at a picture for me.

        Bud hands her a snapshot of Stensland taken in Tijuana.
        Out of uniform.  She recognizes him.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  That's him.  That's him.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  You said a neighbor heard a
                  ruckus.  Was it outside, inside?

        Mrs. Lefferts' eyes go crazy, darting to a closed door.
        Rolled towels are crammed against the bottom of it.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  I don't know.  You'll have to
                  leave now, Officer.

        Bud starts for the closed door.

        Bud kicks away the towels, opens the door, steps into...


<b>        DEN

        Innocuous except for the smell.  It hits Bud right off.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  Don't mind the smell.  I think a
                  rat died behind the wall... My

<b>                                BUD

</b>                  I came home that night and there
                  was blood on the floor.  Susan
                  said Stams -- Stens had cut
                  himself.  They were acting
                  nervous.  And that Stens kept
                  going under the house.

        As Mrs. Lefferts goes shrill, Bud beelines out the door.

        Holding a flashlight, Bud crawls under the house, into...


<b>        CRAWLSPACE

        Bud elbow-crawls over the dirt, between wooden pilings.

        There's a long burlap sack ahead.  It smells bad.  Bud
        rips burlap.  A rat's nest explodes.  Bud sweeps a
        forearm at them.  As they clear, he sees a gristle-caked
        human skull staring back, a .38 hole in the forehead.

        Undaunted, Bud tears the burlap back further.  He pats
        the corpse's pockets, comes up with a wallet.  Bud checks
        the ID.  "Turner Meeks."  Bus knows him by that name and
        another.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Buzz Meeks... Holy shit.

        Bud crawls out, blinking sunlight and gulping fresh air.
        Mrs. Lefferts is there.  She's scared.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS

</b>                  Yeah.  A great big one.

        Bud opens Meeks' wallet, pulls out a couple hundred bucks
        and gives them to Mrs. Lefferts.

                  dumb as I thought.

        As Exley's head swims...

<b>        EXT. LEFFERTS' HOUSE (SAN BERNARDINO) - DAY
</b>
        Mrs. Lefferts waters the grass, watches as a car pulls
        up.  Exley gets up, starts toward her.  She drops the
        hose and runs for the front door  Exley cuts her off.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  Let my Susie rest in peace!

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Mrs. Lefferts, I just want to ask
                  a few questions.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  That other policeman already
                  checked under the house and found
                  not a thing amiss.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Officer White?

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  A sweet man.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                         (thinking
                          out loud)
                  Under the house.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  All he found were rodents.  No
                  signs of foul play.  So there.

        Exley spots the entrance to the crawlspace.  He hurries
        over, enters nearly flat on his belly.  Mrs. Lefferts
        calls in after him.

<b>                                MRS. LEFFERTS
</b>                  My daughter was a virgin!

<b>                                EXLEY (O.S.)
</b>                  I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.


<b>        INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - JACK'S DESK - DAY
</b>
        Jack sits unshaven and hung-over, the dregs of the Scotch
        bottle on the desk.  He considers a framed "Badge of
        Honor" photo:  Jack and Brett Chase, before a banner "To
        Protect and Serve."  Jack punches a fist through it.


<b>        INT. LAPD - FORENSICS LAB - DAY
</b>
        Exley walks alonside as a body bag is wheeled into the
        lab atop a gurney.  Pinker steps over.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I need an I.D. ASAP.  You talk
                  only to me on this one.


<b>        INT. JACK'S DESK - DAY
</b>
        Sitting in disgust, Jack spots something amidst all the
        clutter -- the Great Jerk-Off Books of 1962.  He flips
        one over, looks at the Fleur-de-Lis stamp.  Jack
        remembers something Matt Reynolds told him.  He dials the
        phone.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes
                  requesting.  I need the home
                  address on a Pierce Patchett.

<b>                                OPERATOR (V.O.)
</b>                  Please hold, Sergeant...

        As Jack waits, Exley appears in front of him.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I need to speak to you.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Give me a minute, will ya?

        Exley clicks off the phone.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Damnit... <u>What</u>?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I want you to follow Bud White.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Even I'm not that crazy.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  It's not a request.  I need to
                  know what White knows.  Follow him
                  or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge
                  of Honor.'  Permanently.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Yesterday that might've meant
                  something.  Pull me off.  You'd be
                  doing me a big favor.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Yesterday yes, today no.  What
                  happened last night?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Transfer me, suspend me.  Just
                  leave me alone.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  You make a mistake?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Yeah.  My whole life.

        Jack stands, heads out.  Exley follows; he needs help.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Listen, I think I made a mistake,
                  too.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I
                  can't hear your confession.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Do you make the three Negroes for
                  the Nite Owl killings?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  What?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  It's a simple question.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  You should be the last person who
                  wants to dig any deeper into the
                  Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.

        Exley watches as Jack continues down a hall.  Then:

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Rollo Tomasi.

        Jack stops, looks back at him.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Is there more to that, or do I
                  have to guess?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Rollo was a purse snatcher.  My
                  father ran into him off duty.  He
                  shot my father six times and got
                  away clean.  No one even knew who
                  he was.  I made the name up to
                  give him some personality.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  So what's the point?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Rollo's the reason I became a cop.
                  I wanted to catch the guys who
                  thought they could get away with
                  it.  It was supposed to be about
                  truth and justice and Rollo.  But
                  somewhere along the way I forgot
                  all that... How about you, Jack?
                  Why'd you become a cop?

        Jack looks like he might cry, but smiles instead.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  I don't remember...

        Both men are quiet a moment.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  I'm trying to figure what angle
                  you're playing <u>this</u> time, but I
                  sure as hell can't see one.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I've given up angles for awhile.
                  I just want to solve this thing.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  The Nite Owl was solved,
                  Lieutenant.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I want to do it right.

        So does Jack.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Okay, college boy, I'll help you.
                  But I want half the collar.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  A third.  I don't think we can
                  make a case without Bud White.


<b>        EXT. BROWN DERBY - DAY
</b>
        A Packard pulls up out front.  Bud gets out, heads
        inside.  Another car pulls up across the street.


<b>        CLOSE ON JACK
</b>
        Watching Bud.  Jack gets out, starts across the street.


<b>        INT. BROWN DERBY - BAR - DAY
</b>
        At the bar, Johnny Stompanato looks over as Bud joins
        him.  Stompanato isn't happy about it, but he smiles
        anyway.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  Wendell White, how's tricks,
                  <u>paesano</u>?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  I ain't your <u>paesano</u>, you wop
                  cocksucker.

        Nervous, Johnny taps his pinkie ring on a bottle of beer.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  What do you want, <u>officer</u>?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  You remember an ex-cop named Buzz
                  Meeks?  He works for a guy named
                  Patchett.

        Johnny taps his ring harder.  The bottle almost tips.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  Should I?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  His file listed you as a known
                  associate.  Now spill.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  Oh, yeah.  That was a long time
                  ago.  Before your day.  The last
                  few years he's been muscle for
                  hire.  But I heard he's
                  disappeared.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  More.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  More's gonna cost you.

        Bud's hand flashes out, grabs Stompanato by the crotch.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  How 'bout I give you your balls
                  back?

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                         (in considerable
                          pain)
                  Before Meeks disappeared he was
                  popping off about trying to move
                  eighteen pounds of heroin.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit
                  ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's
                  narcotics lieutenant.  The night
                  he got clipped, eighteen pounds of
                  Mickey's heroin went missing.

        Bud loosens his grip.  Stompanato gasps for air.


<b>        DOOR
</b>
        Jack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato.
        Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out.


<b>        BAR
</b>
        Stompanato's recovering.

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  Meeks is probably in Rio or
                  someplace like that by now.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  He's under a tract house in San
                  Berdoo.  And he don't smell too
                  good.  What happened to the
                  heroin, Johnny?

<b>                                STOMPANATO
</b>                  I don't know.  I swear it!

        Bud starts to raise a hand.  Stompanato cringes, but Bud
        just slaps a twenty down on the bar and goes.


<b>        INT. BROWN DERBY - PHONE BOOTH - DAY

        Jack's on the phone to Exley.

<b>                                JACK

                  Check that.  I gotta go.


<b>        EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY
</b>
        Jack pulls up, sees Bud knock on the front door.  It
        opens and Bud steps in.  Jack doesn't see who opens it.


<b>        EXT. BUSHES - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY
</b>
        LEAVES RUSTLE.  There's movement in the underbrush.  Jack
        appears, followed by Exley.  Jack pulls a gun as they
        near a window.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  What's that for?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Bud White.  He sees us and we're
                  dead.

        They press up to the glass for a partial view.  Bud White
        sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet.
        Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.  This isn't
        the Bud White they're used to.  A pair of woman's hands
        take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin.

        The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her
        policeman.  It may have been a long day, but she's every
        inch Veronica Lake.  Only the hair's not over her eye.

        They stand, kiss again.  Lynn's gown spills down around
        her ankles.  Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of
        them disappear into a bedroom.  A long beat before...

<b>                                JACK

                  And who knows what else?  It's run
                  by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You

        Exley scans.  There's Stompanato with a girl who looks
        amazingly like "LANA TURNER."

        Engrossed, Stomapanato doesn't look up till Exley's nearly
        on top of him.

        A beat.  Exley and Jack don't look like they appreciate

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  I know who you are.  You're the
                  policeman Bud told me about.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Really?  What did White say?

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  He said you were smart.  He also
                  said you were competing with your
                  dead father.  How did he put it?
                  Trying to measure up to a ghost.

        Exley lets it pass.  As he enters...

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Let's concentrate on my smarts.
                  Pierce Patchett made you, didn't
                  he?  He taught you how to dress
                  and talk and think and I am very
                  impressed with the results.  But I
                  need some answers and if I don't
                  get them, I'm going to take you
                  and Patchett down.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  He can take care of himself and
                  I'm not afraid of you.  And you
                  forgot one thing, Lieutenant.
                  Pierce also taught me how to
                  fuck... Can I get you a drink?

        Exley can't help but smile.  Lynn smiles back.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Scotch.

        Exley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  I'm curious about you.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Why?

        She hands him his drink.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  Because Bud hates you more than he
                  loves me.

        Exley stews.  Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  It galls you that I know so much
                  about you.  You don't have
                  information to compete.

<b>                                EXLEY

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  The way you've underestimated Bud
                  White?

        Exley's had it.  A menacing step forward.  Lynn's smile
        becomes a laugh.  Lost to himself, Exley leans in and
        kisses her.  Lynn pulls back, then kisses back.  In a
        beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes.

        As they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder
        at her own reflection in a closet door mirror.

<b>                                LYNN

                  Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks
                  for money.  I see him because he
                  doesn't know how to disguise who
                  he is.  There's more if you want
                  to hear it.

<b>                                LYNN

<b>                                LYNN

        As Exley kisses her...

</b>
        Exasperated that he's still stuck in here, Sid Hudgeons
        checks his watch, shakes his head in disgust.

</b>
        Jack knocks at a darkened house.  The porch lights come
        on.  The door opens to reveal Dudley Smith in his
        bathrobe.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  John Vincennes.  It's three A.M.,
                  lad.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Two minutes, Dudley.  It's
                  important.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Lucky for you that my wife and
                  four fair daughters are at the

<b>        INT. 9608 VENDOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

        Jack sits at the table while Dudley makes coffee.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  You remember Buzz Meeks, Dudley?

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  A disgrace as a policeman.
                  Straight D fitness reports from
                  every C.O. he ever served under.
                  What about him?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Twelve years ago he worked a vice
                  roust with Dick Stensland.  They
                  arrested a Pierce Patchett on an
                  extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers.
                  He'd have them photographed with
                  their johns, then double-dip for
                  some blackmail.  Charges got
                  dropped.  Insufficient evidence.
                  You were supervising officer on
                  the case and I was wondering if
                  you remember anything about it.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  What's this all about, lad?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Part of it has to do with a
                  murder.  I've been working with Ed
                  Exley on it.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  You're Narco, lad, not Homicide.
                  And since when do you work with
                  Edmund?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  It's a private investigation.  I
                  fucked something up and I want to
                  make amends.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                         (smiles, then...)
                  Don't start trying to do the right
                  thing, John.  You haven't had
                  enough practice.

        Dudley walks over, hands Jack his coffee.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Have you discussed this with
                  anyone else, John?

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  No.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Not even with Exley?

        Jack shakes his head.  Dudley raises a REVOLVER.  He
        FIRES it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart.
        Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the
        linoleum.

        Jack opens his mouth to speak.  His lips form the words,
        but no sound comes out.  Dudley crouches down beside him.

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Have you a valediction, lad?

        Dudley leans low, gives Jack an ear.  As he dies...

<b>                                JACK
</b>                  Rollo Tomasi...

        Dudley frowns in ignorance at the name.


<b>        INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY
</b>
        Nothing mobilizes the police like losing one of their
        own.  Dudley is at the podium along with Exley.  Dozens
        of detectives take notes, including Bud White.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Sergeant Vincennes' body was found
                  in Echo Park at ten o'clock this
                  morning.  Killed by a single .38
                  round to the heart.  One of our
                  own, gentlemen.  We cannot
                  tolerate it.  Justice must be
                  swift and merciless.  That's all.

        As the men move odd, Dudley approaches Exley.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Edmund, a word with you.  We
                  received a tip this morning.  Did
                  Vincennes ever mention the name
                  Rollo Tomasi?

        Exley tries to look like he's thinking as Jack calls from
        the grave.  Screaming the name Dudley!

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  No... Where'd the tip come from?

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Anonymous.  Probably nothing.

        As Dudley moves off, Exley watches him go.  Scared.

        Bud looks over as Dudley sits down across from him.

                  way that myself and a few
                  colleagues might someday enjoy a
                  profit dispensation.  That day
                  will soon be here and you'll share

        Pinker goes to his desk for a twenty-year-old photo of
        Meeks.  he hands it to Exley, whose wheels are turning.

<b>                                EXLEY

        A RAIN STORM has turned the courtyard into a mud bath.
        As usual, a light burns in room six.  Bud White parks
        alongside the other cars already here.  He makes a dash
        for the door.

        Sid Hudgeons is cuffed to the hot seat.  Dudley sits
        across from him.  Dudley's henchman Breuning looms.  Bud
        enters.

<b>                                DUDLEY

<b>                                HUDGEONS
</b>                  Okay so we worked together.  It

        get his breath back.

<b>                                DUDLEY

                  Fixed up like movie stars.

        Bud looms, rests his hands on the back of Hudgeons'
        chair.  He doesn't like where this is going.

<b>                                DUDLEY

        Wooden slats pop as Bud tears the bolted chair right out
        of the floor.  Hudgeons and the chair land sideways.

<b>                                DUDLEY

        Bud can't hear him.  He uprights the chair one-handed.
        As his fist cocks back, he's restrained by Breuning and
        Dudley.  This is no act.  They can barely hold Bud back.

<b>                                HUDGEONS

        Bud jams a tire iron into the trunk seam and pops it with
        a ferocious yank.  He tears at the carpeting.  A manila
        envelope.  Bud rips it open and 8x10 glossies of Exley
        and Lynn spill out.  Raindrops dot them, as Bud's in his
        Packard and tearing out of there.

        A wormish CLERK searches dusty filing cabinets with dates
        like 1939 and 1940.  The same ones Jack looked through.
        Exley steps over from another row.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Anything?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  So on active duty, Meeks didn't
                  make an arrest from 1938 to '43.

        Exley ponders the implications.  Taking out the photo of
        Meeks, he gets an idea.

        Blue, Lynn sits on her porch watching the rain come down.
        A SCREECHING on the wet street as Bud's PACKARD pulls up.
        She watches as he gets out and starts for the house.
        Lynn stands, holds her arms out.  Bud stops short on the
        steps, out of reach, the rain soaking him.

<b>                                BUD

        Lightning flashes.  Bud shakes hs head.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  I want to know about Exley.

        More lightning.  Lynn looks God-awful sad.

<b>                                LYNN

        Too tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods.

        Bud backhands her, hard.  Lynn faces straight into the
        next one as Bud hits her again.  A third time as the sins
        of the father are visited on the son.  Bud stops short as
        the self-realization slams home.  Lynn waits stoically.
        She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back
        into the rain.


<b>        INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY

        Drawers are open.  Files are everywhere.  Exley's reached
        the end of the line.  As he looks through one last file,
        he finds a stack of official photos.  Then he stops
        short.  There's a photo of four cadets and an academy
        instructor.

        Two of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick
        Stensland.  The instructor is Dudley Smith!

        Exley looks up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS and Bud is
        there.  Fury.  He slams Exley, knocks him flat.

        Bud's here to kill him.  He hauls Exley up, pummels him,
        then throws him over the table.  Then up into a wall.
        Plaster cracks.  Bud's on some gonzo animal plane.  Bud
        strangles him.  Exley gags.  It'll be over in moments.

        Until Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's .38.  Yanking it
        from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead.
        Bud reels.  But, blind with rage, he moves back in only
        to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his
        eyes.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Why?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Lynn.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  She told you?

        Bud shakes his head.  He's coiled, ready to make a move.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Who told you?  Did Dudley have
                  anything to do with you finding
                  out?

        Bud hesitates, the answer obvious.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack.
                  It has something to do with Buzz
                  Meeks.

        Exley points out the academy photo on the floor.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way
                  back.  Stensland, too.

        Bud sees, but does he really?  As Bud reaches for the
        photo, Exley relaxes slightly.  Bud slaps the gun away,
        drops Exley to the ground.  He grabs, begins slamming his
        head into the floor.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Think, goddamn you.  Think...

        Exley's almost out.  But maybe Bud heard him.  The attack
        slows, stops as Bud does think.  Exley stays conscious.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  I knew Stensland and Meeks knew
                  each other.  Meeks was with Sue
                  Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The
                  night I met Lynn.  Lefferts'
                  mother I.D.ed Stensland as
                  Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens
                  pretended he didn't know either
                  one of them.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Stensland and Meeks.  What were
                  they up to?

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Johnny Stompanato told me when
                  Meeks disappeared, he was trying
                  to move the 18 pounds of heroin
                  that went missing when Deuce
                  Perkins was shot.

</b>                  Then something goes wrong.  Meeks
                  gets killed.  Maybe Stens got
                  greedy, killed Meeks and left him
                  under his girlfriend's house.
                         (a beat)
                  The night he died, Stens was all
                  mysterious.  Said he had something

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  It's Dudley for the Nite Owl.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Pierce Patchett figures in, too.
                  That's the angle Jack was working.
                  Dudley must work for Patchett.

                  I've been trying to be smart.  A

                  fuckers, that would be justice.

<b>                                EXLEY

        Exley and Bud make their way up the walk.  Bud pulls his
        .38 from its shoulder holster, shoves it in his
        waistband.

<b>                                EXLEY

<b>        FRONT DOOR

        Exley RINGS the BUZZER.  Looking back, Bud sees a
        pitching wedge and pile of golf balls abandoned in the
        grass.  A single ball floats in the koi pond.  Bud's eyes
        narrow at the sight.  Not like Patchett at all.

<b>                                BUD

        Bud draws his .38 as he strides in.  Exley tries to keep up.

        Double doors on the left open into a library.  Bud stops
        short, slowly lowers his gun.  Exley steps up beside him.


<b>        LIBRARY
</b>
        Hanging from a ceiling light, Patchett's body slowly
        twists around, a toppled chair beneath him.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I don't think his ex-cop did him
                  much good.

        Bud goes to the body while Exley heads for a side table
        on which rests a typed sheet of paper.

        Bud checks Patchett's right hand, the knuckles are split,
        two of the fingers badly distended.

<b>                                EXLEY

</b>                  Do you want me to call the police,

<b>                                EXLEY

        A beat as Loew considers his options.

<b>                                EXLEY

                  conference to prepare for.

        Loew enters his bathroom.  Bud looks to Exley who nods:
        Go.

</b>
        Loew is at the mirror clipping a few stray nose hairs.
        Bud enters full of menace followed by Exley.

<b>                                LOEW
</b>                  Unless you're here to wipe my ass,
                  I think we're through.

        Bud just glares at him.  Loew shakes his head.

        The MIRROR SPIDERWEBS as Bud slams Loew's face into it.
        Bud swings him around, forces him forward and shoves his
        head in the toilet.

        He holds it there, finally lets Loew up for breath.  Then        
        backhands:  one, two, three.

<b>                                BUD

        More backhands.  Holding Loew by the scruff of the neck,
        Bud marches him past Exley and back into the...


<b>        INNER OFFICE
</b>
        Bud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through
        it.  Loew catches hold of the window framing.  Bud
        hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him
        through.


<b>        OUTSIDE
</b>
        Bud holds his leg.  Loew screams as coins, comb and
        wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street
        below.

        Bud shakes Loew, could drop him at any time.

<b>                                LOEW
</b>                  Dudley's rotten to the core.  He's
                  taking over Mickey Cohen's

        Exley helps pull Loew back inside.  Bud dumps him on the
        floor.  Bruised and bloodied, Loew looks up at Exley.

<b>                                LOEW
</b>                  Dudley's got everyone under his

                  of Police, the lieutenant
                  governor, everybody!

        Exley pulls his .38, shoves it into the side of Loew's
        neck.

<b>                                EXLEY

        Loew looks at Bud, nods, his face a bloody mess.

</b>                  They never made a match on the

                  Breuning and Carlisle took them
                  from the evidence room?  Couple of

<b>                                EXLEY

        A blank look from her.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  A police captain.  I think he's

                  I work for Patchett.  I had a

<b>                                EXLEY

                  hates himself for what he did.

                  I know how he feels.

        A beat as Exley wonders how he should interpret this.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  I don't know if it's pathetic or
                  romantic, but when this is all
                  over I'd like to see you again.

        Lynn looks away, can't help an ironic smile even as she
        starts to cry.  As Exley gives her his handkerchief...


<b>        INT. LAPD - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

        Bud waits at the cage window as a RECORDER returns with
        some information.

<b>                                RECORDER
</b>                  I got your guns, Bud.  Signed in
                  April 3rd, 1950.  Remember the
                  First Western bank robbery?  They
                  were used in that.

<b>                                BUD

        As Bud thinks, a ROOKIE-TYPE approaches.

<b>                                ROOKIE-TYPE

<b>        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - SUNSET

        Bud's Packard crests the rise looking down on the
        Victory.  Exley's Plymouth is in the courtyard.

        Exley in the hotseat.  Sitting there thinking.  At a CAR
        DOOR CLOSING, he goes to the door.


<b>        ANOTHER ANGLE
</b>
        Exley opens the door as Bud approaches, toting a shotgun.
        The sun is down.  The sky is just a dull glow.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  You wanted to meet here?

                  message that...

        As the reality sinks in, Bud and Exley hear TIRES on the
        GRAVEL; CARS are COMING.  Being in a concavity, they
        don't see them yet.  Then the CARS STOP.   But still Bud
        and Exley can't see anything.  They hear the CLICKS of
        CAR DOORS OPENING, but they don't hear them shut.  There
        are FOOTSTEPS, MURMURED WHISPERS.  More CARS PULL UP.

<b>                                EXLEY

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Too late.

        A beat.  Resigned, Exley nods.  They retreat back to Room
        6, disappear inside.  A beat.  There's MOVEMENT in the
        shadows to the left.  To the right.


<b>        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM 6 - NIGHT
</b>
        There's a big back window.  Bud covers most of it with a
        ratty old mattress.  He pumps the shotgun.

        He pulls a .45 automatic from his waistband.

<b>                                BUD
</b>                  Here.

        He throws the auto to Exley, pulls out a .38.  Bud's
        armed for bear.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  You figured this was a set-up?

<b>                                BUD

                  It's as good a place as any for it
                  to end.

        Bud switches off the light.  They wait in silence.  Then:

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  You know, all I ever wanted was to

        A CREAK outside the front door.  Bud levels the SHOTGUN.
        BOOM!  The DOOR is BLOWN OFF ITS HINGES.  We see the
        figure of a man sprawl back in the dirt.  In the darkness
        beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES from all around.  Exley and Bud
<b>        RETURN FIRE.
</b>
        We hear the BACK WINDOW BREAK under a MUFFLED BLOW.  Bud
        charges back, yanks down the mattress revealing two men
        climbing through.  Sitting ducks:  torn apart by THREE
        TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS close in.  A beat, then...

<b>                                EXLEY

        Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP.
        A third man looks through the window.  BOOM!  Bud nails
        him.

        Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window.


<b>        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

        Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting
        the room.  Two sets of feet shuffling along.  Bud FIRES
        the SHOTGUN.  Shrieks as the men go down.  Bud extends
        the .38 to fire point blank headshots.  Then...

        Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM
<b>        6.
</b>

<b>        INT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT

        Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains
        down.

        The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in.
        Four men with rifles.  One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard.
        They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they
        approach:  "Dead meat."  "Be careful."  Kicks in the
        side.  The men look at each other, sneer.

        Exley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins
        around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All
        four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to
        reload.

        Bud scrambles back through the window.  Exley looks over
        and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun.  It's dead quiet.

<b>                                EXLEY

        At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door.
        He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the
        trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the
        ground.

        The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder
        blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the
        stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A
        THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes.
        Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat.
        He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest.

        Bud falls hard.

        Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to
        shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud.  A frozen
        moment.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  I'm loathe to kill my brother
                  officers, Edmund.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To
                  Stensland.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Jack was a shame, but Dick
                  Stensland had the audacity to try
                  to sell me my own heroin.  Through
                  his whore girl friend.  I sent him
                  to make the buy.  The rest is
                  history.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Why?

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we
                  have in Los Angeles.  Sending
                  Mickey Cohen up created it.  My
                  containment work maintained it.
                  Certain photographs guarantee it.
                  Organized crime has been held
                  back, but there's still a demand
                  for the services it provides.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  And now you'll provide them.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Absolutely.  Prostitution and
                  gambling are victimless crimes.
                  The heroin we'll run down to the
                  coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As
                  long as it's not a middle class
                  problem, no one will care.  It's
                  still a crime free city... for
                  respectable people.

        Dudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer.  We hear
<b>        DISTANT POLICE SIRENS.
</b>
<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  This isn't politics, Edmund.
                  There won't be winners and losers
                  when it's over...

        Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Just the living and the dead.
                  It's always been that way in the
                  Bureau.  You should've realized
                  that before you became a
                  detective.

        It's over.  Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger.  But
        Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left
        calf.  It took all Bud had left.  As he collapses...

        Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun.  Dudley
        FIRES, misses.  A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the
        wall.  Dudley stumbles out the door.  SIRENS BLARE.


<b>        EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT
</b>
        Dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down.  Exley
        steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun.  The
        two of them are bleached white by headlights.

        Dudley raises his badge over his head.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  We're policemen!
                         (winks)
                  Let me do the talking.  They'll
                  make you Chief of Detectives.

        Exley steps ahead to block his way.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  <u>No</u>.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Why not, lad?  Absolute justice?

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Something like that.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  <u>Really</u>?  Would you be willing to
                  rig crime scene evidence to
                  support a prosecuting attorney's
                  working hypothesis?

        Exley doesn't answer.  Dudley smiles.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Would you be willing to beat
                  confessions out of suspects you
                  knew to be guilty?

        Exley glares.  Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward
        the gathering policemen.

<b>                                DUDLEY
</b>                  Are you willing to shoot hardened
                  criminals in the back to offset
                  the chance they'll --

        The SHOTGUN BELCHES flame.  Dudley goes down, shot in the
        back.  Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his
        head.

        A midnight assembly.  The Chief, D.A. Loew and several

        Bloody, exhausted, Exley sits across from two INTERNAL

        As Exley looks to the gray-tinted wall mirror...

        Loew leans over, whispers to the Chief.

        Exley in his dress blue uniform.  The Chief smiles, pins

        Applause.  Flashbulbs.  Lynn watches from the back as
        Exley runs a handshake gauntlet.  Finally, he spots her.
        She's returned to her natural brunette.  Looks even
        better.  Exley steps over.

<b>                                EXLEY

                  I tried to throw it all away and

<b>        EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

        Exley walks Lynn out.

<b>                                EXLEY

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  When?

<b>                                LYNN

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Where is he?

        Lynn gestures ahead.  They walk to her car.  She opens
        the back door.  Bud's in the back.  Braces on his legs,
        head sutured.  Jaw wired shut and tubes running in and
        out.  But his hands still look strong.  Bud forces a
        smile through the wires, tries to say something, but
        can't.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Thanks for the push.

        Exley takes his hand.  Bud squeezes till both men wince.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  You just did what you did.  No

        Exley slips his Medal of Valor into Bud's hand.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  From me to you.  It'll mean
                  something if it's yours.

        Bud takes it, turns away so Exley won't see the tears.

<b>                                LYNN
</b>                  We should go now.

        As Exley steps back, Lynn closes the door.  PARTY noises
        drift from upstairs.  Exley looks to Lynn.

<b>                                EXLEY
</b>                  Do you think I ever could've been

                  get ex-hookers and a trip to
                  Arizona.

        A beat.  Exley wishes he'd gotten the trip to Arizona.
        She kisses him on the cheek, gets in the CAR.  STARTS it.

        Exley looks back at Bud.  Bud presses his hands to the
        glass.  Exley touches his side, palms half the man's
        size.  Hands against hands.

        The car moves. A turn into traffic, a good-bye TOOT on
        the HORN.  Exley's all alone.  As he watches them go...
