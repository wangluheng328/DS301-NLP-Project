LA in the 50's: someone's killing imprisoned mob boss Mickey Cohen's gang.
The police, led by Captain Dudley, convince wiseguys from Jersey, Cleveland, and elsewhere to go home.
Rich developer, Pierce Patchett, runs a stable of high-class hookers who are ringers for movie stars.
The plot to replace Cohen blindsides three plainclothes cops: White watched his father beat his mother to death then vanish, he punishes abusers with quick violence; Exley's father was a hero cop killed mysteriously, he seeks justice by the book; Vicennes, a clothes horse, consults for a Dragnet-like TV show.
Will they escape corruption and murder, will they find their own morality?
