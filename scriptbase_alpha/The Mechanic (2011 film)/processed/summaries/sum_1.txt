Assassin Arthur Bishop is an artist at his craft; he can make any job seem like natural causes or an accident if necessary.
He has learned to stay detached.
But when he is told to kill his friend, Harry, it's hard for him but he does it anyway.
He makes it seem like a car jacking.
Harry's son Steve so despondent over his father's death sets out to go after every carjacker he can find.
But when he gets over his head, Arthur saves him.
Arthur then decides to make Steve his apprentice.
And while Steve is not as refined as Arthur, they continue with their collaboration.
Arthur later learns that the circumstances surrounding Harry's hit is not what he was told.
