      A sound is building.  Like a living wind.  A
      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:

<b>                         "EVIL DEAD"
</b>
      Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.  And as the screams
      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.

      Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.

<b>                              NARRATOR
</b>               Legend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones: <u>NECRONOMICON</u> <u>EX</u> <u>MORTES</u>;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.

               spirits ruled the earth.

      Wispy shapes of animated ghosts move through this
      vortex, coming toward the CAMERA with WAILING and
      MOANING  and then are gone.

      Through animation, the blank pages of the Book are
      scripted in a strange hieroglyphic by an invisible hand.

      Faster and faster the pages turn on the Book as the
      blood red ink is scrawled across them. The pages flip
      furiously until the Book snaps shut, reveal ing its
      gruesome face on the cover.

      The book flaps violently away from camera.

      CAMERA panning down to reveal a magnificent newly built
      castle of stone.  Bright banners fly from its turrets.
      An ox grazes nearby.  4 Warriors on horseback in the BG.

</b>               It was then that the dark spirits
               again rose up to battle the living.

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.
      A red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice.
      Something evil is being unleashed.  A strong wind kicks
      up blowing sand in a furious rage.

      Through the blowing silt, a lone figure appears.  An
      image of power and light.  His clothing is ragged,
      and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed
      longsword.  Two massive columns of stone stand on
      either side.  CAMERA slowly moves closer, but his face
      is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands.

<b>                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>               It is said that a hero came from the
               sky.  A man who defeated this evi and
               buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar.
               And there it lay for 700 years...

</b>
      As the raging dust storm clears to reveal the same
      castle which we saw earlier, but now, in a ruined state.
      It has aged 700 years.  The ox is gone.  Now only its
      petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap.

<b>                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>               ...Waiting.

      A four wheel drive vehicle roars PAST THE CAMERA and
      toward the castle.


<b>7     INT. CASTLE OF KAN DAR - DAY - (STUDIO)               7
</b><b>      TRACKING SHOT
</b>
      The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.

<b>                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>               And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.
      The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

      An old log cabin, built in the valley of a dark forest.
      A great wind billows fog about the place.

<b>                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
</b>               Professor Raymond Knowby and his wife,
               HENRIETTA, brought the book to a small
               cabin where they could study it
               undisturbed.

      Professor Raymond Knowby sits at a writing desk and
      transcribes passages from the Book of the Dead.  A
      small framed photograph of his daughter Annie sits
      upon the table.  Behind him, HENRIETTA sits knitting in
      a rocking chair.

      doorway, and the rotted teeth of the skull are the
      whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin.

      complete the one hundred and eighty degree turn
      necessary to head back down the road the way it

      As he lowers his head.  His horror gives way to sadness.
      From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket
      that dangles from the end of a chain.  In the locket's
      center is a magnifying glass.  He stares mournfully into
      the glass.  BANG!  He looks up sharply toward the main

      swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening

      The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more
      primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat.
      The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with
      sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.
      Ash is repulsed.

      Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges
      away from the hole, disappearing again behind the
      wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's
      progress through its pitter patter sound.

      the hand or not.

      All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle

      side of the wall.

      perplexity.

</b>
      The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow,
      then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is
      forced out of the wall with a greater and greater
      pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire
      hose.

      of deep red blood.

</b>
      The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood
      in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the
      holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood
      changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then
      turquoise.

      Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS
      DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood.
      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.

      In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it
      all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet.
      ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what,
      he's not sure.

      It lands with a sickening thud.  Wiping his face with a

      Ash extends his chainsaw arm, pulling on the starter
      cord.  The CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  With his free arm
      Ash raises the shotgun.  He lowers the blade of the
      chainsaw down upon the barrel.  Sparks fly as the saw
      cuts through it.  The long barrel falls to the floor.
      Ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a
      chainsaw strapped to his other arm.

      With a fancy style western flip to the gun Ash saddles
      the shotgun in a makeshift holster, strapped
      to his back.

      The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS into Ash's face.

      as they move from the workshed to the cabin.  In
      the foreground is a large oak tree.  A gnarled human-
      like face can be made out on the surface of the tree.
      It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a
      dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly
      opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with
      a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain
      at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards
      the cabin.

      suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from

      AT US, hand over foot, screaming.  The chainsaw still
      mounted to his wrist.

      Plunged to the dust.  Debris from the demolished cabin

      Oldsmobile and the old grandfather clock.

      As it seals shut, leaving only the blue sky and the
      sound of tweeting birds.  Ash's view of the serene sky
      changes abruptly as five steel helmets jut into his
      line of sight.  Five armor-clad medieval WARRIORS
      stand directly over him.

      The first warrior raises a bloodstained longsword
      and poises it above Ash's head.

      A "WINGED DEADITE," a female harpy like creature with
      the tail of a sea horse and man-sized bat wings,
      enabling it to fly.  The screaming beast swoops down

      They follow his gaze.  The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands
      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.


<b>692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692
</b>
      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:

<b>                              WARRIOR #1
</b>               Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!

<b>                              WARRIOR #4
</b>               Hail!

<b>                              WARRIOR #5
</b>               Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS <u>BOOM</u>.
