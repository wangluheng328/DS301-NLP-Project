Sequel to The Evil Dead where Ash does not manage to escape the evil from the first movie.
Retelling the story only leaves Ash and his girlfriend in the beginning for whatever reason.
Ash must now survive another night in the cabin accompanied now by the Professor's daughter, a mechanic, an associate of the Professor, and the mechanic's girlfriend.
But the thing in the darkness vows that they will be -- Dead By Dawn.
