The film opens with Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), released from prison and hitchhiking his way back to his parents' family farm in Oklahoma.
Tom finds an itinerant ex-preacher named Jim Casy (John Carradine) sitting under a tree by the side of the road.
Casy was the preacher who baptized Tom, but now Casy has "lost the spirit" and his faith (presaging his imminent conversion to communism).
Casy goes with Tom to the Joad property only to find it deserted.
There, they meet Muley Graves (John Qualen) who is hiding out.
In a flashback, he describes how farmers all over the area were forced from their farms by the deed holders of the land.
A local boy (Irving Bacon), hired for the purpose, is shown knocking down Muley's house with a Caterpillar tractor.
Following this, Tom and Casy move on to find the Joad family at Tom's Uncle John's place.
His family is happy to see Tom and explain they have made plans to head for California in search of employment, as their farm has been foreclosed on by the bank.
The large Joad family of twelve leaves at daybreak, along with Casy who decides to accompany them.
They pack everything into a dilapidated 1926 Hudson "Super Six" sedan adapted to serve as a truck in order to make the long journey to the promised land of California.
