<b>                
</b>
               AN OKLAHOMA PAVED HIGHWAY in daylight. At some distance, 
               hoofing down the highway, comes Tom Joad. He wears a new 
               stiff suit of clothes, ill-fitting, and a stiff new cap, 
               which he gradually manages to break down into something 
               comfortable. He comes down the left side of the road, the 
               better to watch the cars that pass him. As he approaches, 
               the scene changes to a roadside short-order RESTAURANT on 
               the right side of the road. From it comes the sound of a 
               phonograph playing a 1939 popular song. In front of the eatery 
               is a huge Diesel truck labeled: OKLAHOMA CITY TRANSPORT 
               COMPANY. The driver, a heavy man with army breeches and high-
               laced boots, comes out of the restaurant, the screen door 
               slamming behind him. He is chewing on a toothpick. A waitress 
               appears at the door, behind the screen.

<b>                                     WAITRESS
</b>                         When you be back?

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         Couple a weeks. Don't do nothin' you 
                         wouldn't want me to hear about!

               We see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right 
               side. Getting behind the wheel, he is releasing the handbrake 
               when Tom appears at the driver's seat window.

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                         How about a lift, mister?

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         Can't you see that sticker?

               He indicates a "No Riders" sticker on the windshield.

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                         Sure I see it. But a good guy don't 
                         pay no attention to what some heel 
                         makes him stick on his truck.

               After a moment of hesitation the driver releases the brake.

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         Scrunch down on the running board 
                         till we get around the bend.

               As Tom scrunches down on the running board the driver throws 
               the truck into gear and it moves.

               The scene dissolves to the CAB OF THE TRUCK. It is day, and 
               Tom is seated beside the driver, who is surreptitiously eyeing 
               him, trying to confirm some suspicion--an inspection which 
               Tom ignores at first.

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         Goin' far?

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                              (shaking his head)
                         Just a few miles. I'd a walked her 
                         if my dogs wasn't pooped out.

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         Lookin' for a job?

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                         No, my old man got a place, forty 
                         acres. He's a sharecropper, but we 
                         been there a long time.

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                              (after a curious glance)
                         Oh!

               Cautiously, the driver's eyes drop to Tom's feet. We see 
               TOM'S SHOES. They are prison shoes--new, stiff and bulky.

               Curiosity is in the eyes of the DRIVER as they shoot a swift 
               glance at Tom. TOM is looking straight ahead, with the dead-
               pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal 
               something. The DRIVER'S eyes take in Tom's hands and the 
               stiff coat.

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         Been doin' a job?

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                         Yeah.

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         I seen your hands. You been swinging 
                         a pick or a sledge--that shines up 
                         your hands. I notice little things 
                         like that all the time.
                              (After a pause)
                         Got a trade?

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                              (evenly)
                         Why don't you get to it, buddy?

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                              (uneasily)
                         Get to what?

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                         You know what I mean. You been givin' 
                         me a goin' over ever since I got in. 
                         Whyn't you go on and ask me where I 
                         been?

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         I don't stick my nose in nobody's 
                         business.

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                         Naw--not much!

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                              (a little frightened)
                         I stay in my own yard.

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                              (without emotion)
                         Listen. That big nose of yours been 
                         goin' over me like a sheep in a 
                         vegetable patch. But I ain't keepin' 
                         it a secret. I been in the 
                         penitentiary. Been there four years. 
                         Like to know anything else?

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         You ain't got to get sore.

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                              (coldly)
                         Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         I didn't mean nothing.

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                         Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get 
                         along without shovin' anybody around, 
                         that's all.
                              (After a pause)
                         See that road up ahead?

<b>                                     DRIVER
</b>                         Yeah.

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                         That's where I get off.

               With a sigh of relief the driver puts his foot on the brake. 
               The TRUCK stops and Tom gets out. He look at the uneasy driver 
               contemptuously.

               The driver throws the truck into gear. He doesn't like this 
               at all.

               He looks indifferently after the truck and then starts on 
               foot down the dirt crossroad. A wind has begun to blow.

               The scene dissolves to the roadside under a WILLOW TREE in 
               daylight. The wind is still blowing. Sitting on the ground, 
               his back against the tree, Casy, a long, lean man in overalls, 
               blue shirt, and one sneaker, is fixing something on the other 
               dirty sneaker. To the tune of "Yes, Sir, That's My Baby" he 
               is absent-mindedly singing.

               Carrying his coat under his arm, TOM wipes his face with his 
               cap as he cuts off the road to acknowledge the greeting.

                         That's our place.

               The JOAD CABIN is an ancient, bleak, sway-backed building. 
               There is neither sign of life or habitation about it.

                         We better run!

               A DUST STORM, like a black wall, rises into the sky, moving 
               forward. TOM AND CASY are running, but looking back over 
               their shoulders as the DUST STORM nears. Dust rises from the 
               ground to join and thicken the black wall.

               TOM AND CASY are seen racing down the road to the cabin, the 
               wind whipping up the dust. The two men smack open the door 
               and slam it shut after them. The screen begins to grow dark 
               as the storm sweeps over the land. It becomes black.

               In THE CABIN, it is black too, but the sound is different. 
               In addition to the sound of the wind there is the soft hissing

</b>                         There was some pieces of candle always 
                         on a shelf.

               Presently, after shuffling about, he has found them and lights 
               one. He holds it up, lighting the room. A couple of wooden 
               boxes are on the floor, a few miserable discarded things, 
               and that's all. Tom's eyes are bewildered.

</b>                         No. They wasn't people to write.

               From the floor he picks up a woman's high button shoe, curled 
               up at the toe and broken over the instep.

               Dropping the shoe, he picks up a battered felt hat.

</b>                         I never heard nothin' about it.

               Dropping the hat, he moves with the candle toward the door 
               to the back, the only other room of the cabin. He stands in 
               the doorway, holding the candle high.

               In the BACK ROOM the scene moves from Tom at the door across 
               the room to the shadows, where a skinny little man sits 
               motionless, wide-eyed, staring at Tom. His name is Muley.

               MULEY is seen at close range. Not actually crazy, Muley is a 
               little touched. His eyes rove upward as he listens to the 
               sound of the storm, the sough of the wind and the soft hiss 
               of the sand. Then...

</b>                         The way it happens--the way it 
                         happened to me--the man come one 
                         day...

               The scene dissolves to MULEY'S DOORYARD. It is a soft spring 
               day, with the peaceful sounds of the country. Seated in a 
               three-year-old touring car is THE MAN, a city man with a 
               collar and tie. He hates to do what he is doing and this 
               makes him gruff and curt, to hide his misgivings. Squatted 
               beside the car are Muley, his son-in-law, and a half-grown 
               son. At a respectful distance stand Muley's wife, his 
               daughter, with a baby in her arms, and a small barefooted 
               girl, watching worriedly. The men soberly trace marks on the 
               ground with small sticks. A hound dog sniffs at the automobile 
               wheels.

                         what them dusters done to the land, 
                         the tenant system don't work no more. 
                         It don't even break even, much less 
                         show a profit. One man on a tractor 
                         can handle twelve or fourteen of 
                         these places. You just pay him a 
                         wage and take *all* the crop.

                         what I'm telling you.

               Muley stands in anger. The two younger men pattern after 
               him.

</b>                         And for ever' one of 'em ten-fifteen 
                         families gets throwed outa their 
                         homes--one hundred folks with no 
                         place to live but on the road. The 
                         Rances, the Perrys, the Peterses, 
                         the Joadses--one after another they 
                         got throwed out. Half the folks you 
                         and me know--throwed right out into 
                         the road. The one that got me come a 
                         month ago.

               The scene dissolves to MULEY'S FARM. We see the backs of 
               Muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder 
               watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them. It 
               is at some distance. Muley holds a shotgun. His son has a 
               baling hook. The son-in-law has a two-by-four. Behind them 
               is their cabin. Frightened and huddled together are the women 
               and children. The roar of the tractor comes closer.

</b>                              (shouting)
                         You come any closer and I'm gonna 
                         blow you right outa that cat!
                              (He lifts his shotgun)

               The TRACTOR continues to lumber along, its driver goggled 
               and black of face where his dust mask doesn't cover. MULEY 
               lifts his shotgun to his shoulder, and aims.

<b>                                     MULEY
</b>                         I *tol'* you!

               The TRACTOR stops. The driver takes off his goggles and dust 
               mask. Like the others he's a country boy. His face is sullen. 
               Muley is lowering his shotgun. There is a surprise in his 
               face as he recognizes the driver.

<b>                                     MULEY
</b>                         Why, you're Joe Davis's boy!

               He moves forward, followed by his son and son-in-law in the 
               TRACTOR. Davis is wiping his face as they walk toward him.

                         thing for--against your own people?

                         *Used* to be your land. B'longs to

               We see THE WOMENFOLKS. A small girl pulls her mother's dress.

               Back to the TRACTOR AND THE MEN:

<b>                                     MULEY

                         as sure as you touch my house with

                         First place, you'd get hung and you

                         guy here to take my place.

               And the tractor roars into slow motion again...

               We see the HOUSE AND TRACTOR. The womenfolks scamper out of 
               the way as the tractor heads for a corner of the house. It 
               goes over a ramshackle fence and then a feeble little flower 
               bed. Muley and the two younger men walk along. Breathing 
               hard, frightened and desperate, Muley is shouting warnings 
               at Davis, but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice. The 
               dog barks excitedly, snarling at the tractor. THE WOMENFOLKS 
               stand watching, terrified but dead pan, until a cry bursts 
               from Muley's wife.

<b>                                     WIFE
</b>                         Don't! Please don't!

               The little girl begins to whimper.

<b>                                     MULEY
</b>                         I'm tellin' you!

               The TRACTOR moves across the yard, nosing a chair out of the 
               way, and with a rending of boards hits a corner of the house, 
               knocking a part of the foundation away. The corner of the 
               house sinks. MULEY lifts his shotgun, aims it, holds it, and 
               then slowly lowers it. As he stands looking at what has 
               happened his shoulders sag. He seems almost to shrink.

               The scene dissolves to MULEY, once more in the back room of 
               Tom's old home, as the sound of the storm continues.

<b>                                     MULEY

                         What was the use. He was right. There 
                         wasn't a thing in the world I could 
                         do about it.

<b>                                     TOM
</b>                              (bewildered)
                         But it don't seem possible--kicked 
                         off like that!

<b>                                     MULEY
</b>                         The rest of my fambly set out for 
                         the west--there wasn't nothin' to 
                         eat--but I couldn't leave. Somepin' 
                         wouldn't let me. So now I just wander 
                         around. Sleep wherever I am. I used 
                         to tell myself I was lookin' out for 
                         things, so when they come back 
                         ever'thing would be all right. But I 
                         knowed that wan't true. There ain't 
                         nothin' to look out for. And ain't 
                         nobody comin' back. They're gone--
                         and me, I'm just an 'ol graveyard 
                         ghost--that's all in the world I am.

               Tom rises in his agitation and bewilderment.

<b>                                     MULEY

</b>                              (sympathetically)
                         No. You're lonely--but you ain't 
                         touched.

</b>                         It don't matter. If I'm touched, I'm 
                         touched, and that's all there is to 
                         it.

</b>                              (still unable to grasp 
                              it all)
                         What I can't understand is my folks 
                         takin' it! Like ma! I seen her nearly 
                         beat a peddler to death with a live 
                         chicken. She aimed to go for him 
                         with an ax she had in the other hand 
                         but she got mixed up and forgot which 
                         hand was which and when she got 
                         through with that peddler all she 
                         had left was two chicken legs.

               He looks down at Muley.

                         that's all.

               His eyes are dull on the floor. The sound of the dust storm 
               continues strongly.

               The scene dissolves to the EXTERIOR OF THE CABIN at night. 
               It is several hours later and the sound of the storm has 
               faded out. Now all is silence as first Tom, then Casy, and 
               finally Muley steps out of the cabin and looks around. There 
               is still a slight fog of dust in the air, and clouds of 
               powderlike dust shoot up around their feet. All three men 
               have wet rags tied over their mouths and noses.

               A CAR approaches at some distance, the headlights moving up 
               and down as the car rides a dirt road.

               A PART OF THE COTTON FIELD: Muley leads the way.

                         bothered since.

               THE EXTERIOR OF THE CABIN: The car stops. A strong searchlight 
               flashes on and goes over the cabin.

                         He ain't here.

               The car moves on.

               TOM, CASY AND MULEY lie flat, listening to the sound of the 
               car going away.

<b>                                     TOM

                         out on my own place...!

               He whistles, as the scene fades out.

               DRIED CORNSTALKS, seen by daylight, fade in. The cornstalks, 
               their roots blown clean and clear of the earth, lie fallen 
               in one direction. This is what has happened to farms that 
               were once rich and green. Then Uncle John's cabin comes into 
               view. It is just after sunup. The air is filled with country 
               sounds--a shrill chorus of birds, a dog barking in the 
               distance. The cabin is of the same general appearance as the 
               Joad cabin but even smaller. Smoke curls from the chimney.

               We see a PLATTER ON A TABLE, inside the cabin. The platter 
               is filled with sidemeat. Over the scene comes Ma Joad's voice.

                         are about to receive, for His sake. 
                         Amen.

               As she speaks, a man's scrawny hand reaches forward and sneaks 
               out a piece of sidemeat.

               Five people are seated around the breakfast table on chairs 
               or boxes. They are Pa, Grampa, Granma, Noah, and Uncle John. 
               Two children, Ruthie and Winfield, stand to the table, because 
               there are no more chairs. Their heads are all bent as Ma, 
               standing with a fork in her hand between the table and the

               NOAH is solemnly studying a handbill. Over his shoulder the

               RUTHIE AND WINFIELD are snickering. Ruthie has smeared her 
               face with mush. She pulls Winfield around to see.

               She begins to slobber in mimicry. Winfield snickers. At that 
               instant Ma enters, unobserved, and without a word give Ruthie 
               a fine wallop. Nobody else pays any attention to the slap as 
               Ma, a bucket in her hand, moves on toward the door. We see 
               her now in the BACKYARD, first at the door, then moving toward 
               the well. She stops dead still, her eyes gazing outward.

               TOM is looking at the household goods piled around the yard, 
               to be taken to California. Casy is in the background. Then 
               Tom looks up and see Ma (out of the scene). His face softens. 
               He moves toward her.

</b>                         No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.

               With a sigh and a smile, and her eyes full of wonder, she 
               feels his arm. Her fingers touch his cheek, as if she were 
               blind. Swelling with emotion, Tom bites his lip to control 
               himself.

               CASY, with great politeness, turns his back to the scene and 
               keeps well away from it.

               TOM now looks around at the dusty furniture piled around the 
               yard.

               The children and Grampa scramble out first, followed hurriedly 
               but less rowdily by Uncle John and Noah. Granma, aware only 
               that there is some excitement, looks interestedly after them

               In the BACKYARD, the prodigal son, mother and father proudly 
               beside him, is having his hand wrung by Grampa, who vainly 
               tries to button various buttons of his shirt, as always. The

               As Tom chucks the two children under the chin, the rattling 
               roar of a jalopy causes all to turn to look.

               The roar increases. A home-built TRUCK comes around the corner 
               of the house. Once a Hudson sedan, the top has been cut in 
               two and a truck body constructed. It is driven now by Al, 
               and on the front seat with him are Rosasharn and Connie. The 
               arrival, as the truck moves into the yard, increases the 
               excitement, and the scene is a little incoherent with the 
               talking and shouting and the noise of the jalopy.

                         If this don't beat all!
                              (Chuckling)
                         Well, I see you been busy already!

                         You do not see either!--not yet!

               At the whoop of laughter that goes up from all, she turns in 
               a fine simulation of maidenly mortification, and throws 
               herself into Connie's arms, hiding her face against his chest. 
               After a moment of surprise, a slow, happy, fatuous grin begins 
               to broaden his face. He beams, whereupon their delight 
               increases, the men roaring and jeering and slapping their 
               legs, the women making modest efforts to suppress their 
               amusement.

                         like her face when Tom said it? Look 
                         around, Rosasharn! Let's see it again!

               An automobile horn sounds sharply. Their laughter halted as 
               though cut by a knife, they look off. A TOURING CAR has 
               stopped in the road by the house, the engine still running. 
               One man drives, the other talks.

</b>                         Hey, Joad! John Joad!

               In the BACKYARD the people are silent, their faces without 
               expression, as all gaze toward the touring car.

<b>                                     MAN

</b>                         I know. We be out. We be out by sunup.

               The touring car's engine is still heard after the men drive 
               off. The Joads watch the car, their heads turning, their 
               eyes following, expressionless.

               The scene dissolves to the BACKYARD just before dawn. Now 
               and then a rooster crows. A couple of lanterns light the 
               scene as the man load the truck. It is nearly done, the body 
               piled high but flat with boxes, and more tied on running 
               boards. Al has the hood open and is working on the motor.

               Noah, Casy, Uncle John, Connie, Pa, and Tom are at various 
               tasks. They talk as they work.

                              eye over the truck)

               INSIDE THE CABIN, Ma sits on a box in front of the stove. 
               The fire door is open and the light shines out. The room 
               itself has been pretty well stripped, with only trash and 
               discarded things left. In Ma's lap is a pasteboard shoebox 
               and she is going through the meager treasures stored in it, 
               to see what must go and what she can take with her. Her eyes 
               are soft and thoughtful as each item brings a memory, but 
               not sad. Occasionally she smiles faintly. She pulls out a 
               letter, looks at it, starts to throw it into the fire, then 
               puts it back in the box. Her hand pulls out a PICTURE 
               POSTCARD. We see it in Ma's hand. It is a picture of the 
               Statue Of Liberty. Over it: "Greetings from New York City." 
               She turns it over. It is addressed: "Mrs. Joad RFD 254 
               Oklahomy Territory." In the space for a message: "Hello honey. 
               Willy Mae."

               MA, after a moment of studying it, throws the card into the 
               fire. She lifts the letter again, puts it back. She pulls 
               out a worn NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. We see it in Ma's hand. The 
               headline is: "JOAD GETS SEVEN YEARS."

               MA drops the clipping into the fire. Rummaging around, she 
               pulls out a small CHINA DOG. We see it closely as before. On 
               it is printed: "Souvenir of Louisiana Purchase Exposition--
               St. Louis--1904."

               MA studies the dog, smiling, remembering something that it 
               meant in her life. Then she puts in in a pocket in her dress. 
               Next she pulls out some pieces of cheap jewelry; one cuff 
               link, a baby's signet ring, two earrings. She smiles at the 
               ring, then pockets it. The cuff link too. The earrings she 
               holds for a moment longer, then looks around to make sure 
               nobody sees, then holds them to her ears, not looking into 
               any kind of a mirror, just feeling them against the lobes of 
               her ears, as once perhaps she wore them. Her eyes are grave.

</b>                              (from the door)

<b>                                     MA
</b>                         I'm ready.

               Tom disappears. Ma looks at the earrings, and then at the 
               contents of the box. She lifts out the letter again and looks 
               at it. Then, without drama, she drops it into the fire. She 
               watches it burn. Her eyes are still on the flame as she calls.

<b>                                     MA

                         We're fixin' to leave.

               The flame dies down.

               In the BACKYARD it is grey dawn. There is a thrill of quiet 
               excitement as they all stand around the loaded truck, hats 
               on, putting on coats. The ones missing are Ma, Rosasharn, 
               the children, and Grampa. Pa is in charge.

                              the cabin)

                         he'p me!

               Tom easily lifts her up the step. The two children come 
               running out of the house, chanting.

               watching the springs flatten out.

               All turn. In a CORNER OF THE HOUSE Al is pulling Grampa gently 
               but firmly, the old man holding back, and furious. He flails 
               feebly at Al, who holds his head out of the way without 
               effort.

               Al permits Grampa to jerk loose and sit down on the doorstep. 
               The old man is miserable and frightened and angry, too old 
               to understand or accept such a violent change in his life.  
               Tom and Pa come up to him. The others watch solemnly from

               nothing. He takes another dram of the coffee.

               The scene dissolves to the TRUCK. It is just after dawn. Pa,

               As they all look back the deserted CABIN is seen from the 
               departing truck.

               Now we see the FAMILY IN THE TRUCK, as it snorts and rattles 
               toward the road--a study of facial expressions as the Joad 
               family look back for the last time at their home. Connie and 
               Rosasharn, whispering, giggling, and slappings, are oblivious 
               of the event. Ruthie and Winfield are trembling with 
               excitement. But Tom's and Pa's smiles have disappeared, and 
               all the men are gazing back thoughtfully and soberly, their 
               minds occupied with the solemnity of this great adventure.

               She continues to stare straight ahead. The TRUCK is lumbering 
               up onto a paved highway.

               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: Almost filling the screen 
               is the shield marker of the U.S. Highway 66. Superimposed on 
               it is a montage of jalopies, steaming and rattling and piled 
               high with goods and people, as they pull onto the highway, 
               to indicate as much as possible that this departure of the 
               Joad family is but part of a mass movement of jalopies and 
               families. The signs of towns on U.S. Highway 66 flash past--
<b>               CHECOTAH, OKLAHOMA CITY, BETHANY.
</b>
               This dissolves to a HIGHWAY. It is late afternoon. The Joad 
               truck pulls of the paved highway and stops. The men leap 
               down quickly from the truck, all but Pa, who lifts Grampa in 
               his arms and then lowers him slowly, gently into Tom's arms.

               In TOM'S arms Grampa is whimpering feebly.

                         pallet.

               With a quilt pulled from the truck Ma runs ahead as Tom 
               carries Grampa toward a clump of woods back off the highway. 
               The others get down soberly from the truck, all but Granma, 
               who is dozing. Cars pass-a fast car passing a jalopy. Tom is 
               letting the old man down gently as Ma adjusts the quilt on 
               the ground. Death is in Grampa's eyes as he looks up dimly 
               at them.

               The scene dissolves to an insert of a NOTE. It is written 
               awkwardly in pencil on the flyleaf of a Bible. Tom's voice 
               recites the words.

               lanterns, The Joad tribe stands reverently around an open 
               grave. Having read the note, Tom puts it in a small fruit 
               jar and kneels down and, reaching into the grave, places it

               The scene fades out.

               HIGHWAY 66, in daylight, fades in: an Oklahoma stretch, 
               revealing a number of jalopies rattling westward. The Joad 
               truck approaches.

               In the FRONT SEAT OF THE TRUCK Tom is now driving. Granma is 
               dozing again, and Ma is looking thoughtfully ahead.

               As the truck slows to a stop a motorcycle cop approaches

               He looks grimly at Ma.

               As Ma helps Granma out the other side, Tom and the cop 
               exchange a glance and snother shrug at the foibles of women 
               and then look studiedly into space.

               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: superimposed on the marker 
               of U.S. Highway 66 an assortment of roadside signs flashes 
               by: Bar-B-Q, Joe's Eats, Dr. Pepper, Gas, Coca Cola, This 
               Highway is Patrolled, End of 25 Mile Zone, Lucky Strikes, 
               Used Cars, Nutburger, Motel, Drive-Inn, Free Water, We Fix 
               Flats, etc.

               A HAND-PAINTED SIGN reads: "CAMP 50¢." It is night. We hear 
               the sound of guitar music. In the CAMP GROUND a small wooden 
               house dominates the scene. There are no facilities; the 
               migrants simply pitch makeshift tents and park their jalopies 
               wherever there is a space. It is after supper and a dozen or 
               more men sit on the steps of the house listening to Connie 
               play a road song on a borrowed guitar. The music softens the 
               tired, drawn faces of the men and drives away some of their 
               shyness. In the dark, outside the circle of light from the 
               gasoline lantern on the porch, some of the women and children 
               sit and enjoy the luxury of this relative gaiety. The 
               proprietor sits tipped back in a straight chair on the porch.

               We see the JOAD TENT. Behind their truck, a tarpaulin is 
               stretched over a rope from tree to tree. Granma lies asleep 
               on a quilt, stirring fitfully. Ma sits on the ground at her 
               head, fanning her with a piece of cardboard. Rosasharn lies 
               flat on her back, hands clasped under her head, looking up 
               at the stars. The music comes to them pleasantly.

               He looks around at the men, trying to control his emotions, 
               and then he walks away into the darkness. There is an uneasy

               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE: superimposed on the shield 
               marker of U.S. Highway 66 and the rattling Joad truck the 
               signs of towns flash by: AMARILLO, VEGA, GLENRIO.

               The TRUCK is seen on the HIGHWAY. It is now mountain country--
               New Mexico. Then it is seen at a GAS STATION. It is a cheap 
               two-pump station, hand-painted, dreary, dusty. Huddled next 
               to it is a hamburger stand. In front of the hamburger stand 
               is a truck labeled: NEW MEXICO VAN AND STORAGE COMPANY. The 
               Joads are piling out of their truck. Directed by Ma, Noah 
               lifts Granma out. The two children scamper around shrieking 
               because their legs have gone to sleep. Al is preparing to 
               put water in the radiator. Pa takes out a deep leather pouch, 
               unties the strings, and begins calculating his money as the 
               fat proprietor advances.

               Taking out his pouch, Pa digs into it, feels around with his 
               fingers for a dime, as he apologizes.

               But when he puts the dime down on the counter he has a penny 
               with it. He is about to drop this back in the pouch when his 
               eyes fall on the children staring at the candy. Slowly he

               breathing, their eyes on the candy.

               the sticks of candy out to the children. They look up at Pa.

               Rigid with embarrassment, they accept the candy, looking 
               neither at it nor at each other. Pa picks up the loaf of 
               bread and they scramble for the door. At the door Pa turns 
               back.

               As Mae watches them through the window, her eyes warm, Bert 
               walks around the counter to the three slot machines, a paper 
               with figures on it in his hand. The truck roars outside and 
               moves off. Mae looks down again at the coins.

               There is a rattle of coins as Bert hits the jackpot. In his 
               left hand on the machine is a paper with three columns of 
               figures on it. The third column is much the longest. He scoops 
               out the money.

               The scene fades out.

               The ARIZONA BORDER, in daylight, fades in. It is in a gap in 
               the mountains and beyond can be seen the Painted Desert. A 
               border guard halts the Joad truck. He is not as tough as his 
               words indicate, just curt and matter-of-fact.

               The truck rattles into movement.

               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE superimposed on the shield 
               marker of U.S. Highway 66 and the Joad truck. Signs flash 
               by: FLAGSTAFF, WATER 5¢ A GAL, WATER 10¢ A GAL, WATER 15¢ A 
               GAL, and finally, NEEDLES, CALIF.

               In the foreground, their backs turned, the Joads stand on 
               and about their truck looking in a long silence at what can 
               be seen of California from Needles. Their silence is eloquent. 
               The faces of the Joads are blank with dismay, for this is an 
               unattractive sight indeed.

               The Joads and the landscape are seen again. Then the scene 
               dissolves to the BANK OF A RIVER. The camp at Needles is on 
               the bank of the Colorado River, among some willows. We see 
               the man of the family sitting chest-deep in the shallow 
               waters, talking, occasionally ducking their heads under, 
               reveling in this relief. In the background are the towering 
               mountains.

               The scene dissolves to a GAS STATION, at night. The Joad 
               truck, loaded with goods and people, is last gas and servicing 
               before the desert. Two white uniformed boys handle the 
               station. A sign reads: "LAST CHANCE FOR GAS AND WATER." Al

               the gas.

               MA AND GRANMA are seen lying on a mattress in the TRUCK.

               The truck moves off.

               We see the GAS STATION again with the truck pulling away. 
               The First Boy, a lad who knows everything, stands looking

               NOAH is seen hiding behind a corner of the GAS STATION. 
               Peering out, he sees that the truck has gone. He turns to 
               walk away into the darkness.

               The scene dissolves to a RIVER BANK at night, and Noah is 
               once more seated in the shallow water, splashing, looking up 
               at the mountains, content.

               The TRUCK is rattling along U.S. Highway 66, across the 
               desert, in the night. In the DRIVER'S SEAT Tom is driving,

               MA AND GRANDMA are seen again. The old woman lies still, 
               breathing noisily. Ma continues to pat her.

               Then we see the TRUCK still churning along Highway 66 by

               MA AND GRANDMA lie side by side. Ma's hand is on Grandma's

               Ma does not answer immediately. Her head lifted, she is 
               staring at Granma's face. Then slowly she withdraws her hand 
               from Grandma's heart.

               The scene dissolves to an INSPECTION STATION, near Daggett, 
               California, at night. Obeying a sign that reads: "KEEP RIGHT 
               AND STOP," the Joad truck pulls up under a long shed as two 
               officers, yawning, come out to inspect it. One takes down 
               the license number and opens the hood. The people aboard the

               sun at the Joad's back. They have pulled off the side of the 
               road and stopped, just to drink in the sight. They are looking 
               almost reverently at the sight before them as they climb 
               stiffly out of the truck.

               One by one, they climb down.

               He starts back. MA is holding to the rear of the truck, her 
               face stiff and swollen, her eyes deep-sunk, her limbs weak 
               and shaky.

               The scene fades out.

               A TOWN STREET, by day, fades in. Down a town or small city 
               business street, with quite a bit of traffic, comes the Joad 
               truck being pushed by the Joad men. At the wheel, aiming at 
               a corner gas station, is Rosasharn, frightened and uncertain, 
               with Ma beside her on the front seat. In the back Ruthie and 
               Winfield are delighted with this new form of locomotion. 
               Crossing the street, a policeman falls into step with Tom.

               It is a two-pump station and one of the pumps has a car, 
               with the attendant servicing it. The Joad truck stops by the 
               other pump and Tom, wiping his face with his sleeve, grins 
               and address himself to the policeman. The others stand 
               listening solemnly in the background.

               He strolls away, the Joads looking concernedly after him, 
               just as the gas station attendant comes briskly to them after 
               disposing of the other car.

               The attendant regards him in disgust.

               The scene dissolves to HOOVERVILLE, by day. A large migrant 
               camp, a typical shanty town of ragged tents and tarpaper 
               shacks, jalopies and dirty children. A dozen or more children 
               pause to watch as the Joad truck lumbers down a dirt incline 
               from the road and stops at the edge of the camp in front of 
               one of the most miserable of the shacks. The Joads regard 
               the camp with dismay.

                         fix us up some stew.

               The truck moves into the camp through a lane of children.

               The scene dissolves to the JOAD TENT. In front of it, Ma is 
               on her knees feeding a small fire with broken sticks. On the 
               fire is a pot of stew. Ruthie and Winfield stand watching 
               the pot. About fifteen ragged, barefooted children in a half-
               circle are now around the fire, their solemn eyes on the pot 
               of stew. Occasionally they look at Ma, then back at the stew. 
               Presently one of the older girls speaks.

               She goes in the tent hurriedly to hide the fact that tears 
               have come into her eyes. The children pounce on the pot, 
               silently, too busy digging for the stew to speak.

               INSIDE THE TENT they have all finished their stew already.

               At the ROAD a new coupe drives off the highway and into the 
               camp and stops. It contains two men. One gets out.

               A GROUP OF MEN are squatting in a half-circle, the usual 
               pattern for conversation, but they are silent now as their 
               eyes fix on the man approaching. He is a labor agent.

               OUTSIDE THE JOAD TENT the men are looking in the direction 
               of the group. They start to walk toward it.

               AT THE GROUP OF MEN: The agent, wearing a flat-brimmed Stetson 
               and with his pockets filled with pencils and dog-eared 
               booklets, looks down at the silent men. All of the men in 
               the camp are approaching slowly, silently. The women give 
               their anxious attention in the background. Among the men who 
               walk up is FLOYD, a grimly disappointed young man.

               The squatting men have risen one by one. Their faces are 
               expressionless because they simply don't know when one of 
               these calls is genuine or when it isn't. Floyd addresses 
               them.

               The other man gets out of the COUPE. He wears riding breeches 
               and laced boots, carries a pistol and cartridge belt, and 
               there is a deputy sheriff's star on his brown shirt. He smiles 
               thinly and shifts his pistol holster as he starts toward the 
               group. THE MEN are watching the deputy approach.

               As the agent gets into the coupe FLOYD'S thumbs hook over 
               his belt and he looks off, away. TOM'S look away is an answer. 
               His thumbs also hook over his belt.

               He takes hold of Floyd's left arm. At the same time Floyd 
               swings, smacks him in the face. As the deputy staggers, Tom 
               sticks out a foot and trips him. Floyd is already running 
               through the camp. The deputy fires from the ground. There is 
               a scream. A WOMAN is looking down at her hand, the knuckles 
               shot away.

               The COUPE is seen as the agent steps on the gas to get away. 
               As Floyd gets in the clear, the DEPUTY, sitting on the ground, 
               aims his pistol again, slowly, carefully. Behind him Casy 
               steps up, gauges his distance, and then kicks him square in 
               the base of the skull. The deputy tumbles over unconscious. 
               Tom picks up the pistol.

               As Tom strides away there is the distant sound of a siren. 
               Casy empties the gun and throws cartridges and gun aside. 
               The men, aghast, have been standing back, worried and excited 
               and apprehensive. They wish nothing like this had happened. 
               The women have gathered around the wounded woman, who is 
               sobbing. Now at the sound of the siren everybody begins to 
               move uncomfortably toward his tent or shack. Al looks 
               admiringly from Casy to the unconscious deputy.

               Everybody has disappeared into his tent but Al and Casy. The

               Al heads for the Joad tent and Casy kneels down and lifts 
               the deputy. He wipes his face clean. The deputy begins to 
               come to. An open car curves off the highway, stops in the 
               clearing, and four men with rifles pile out. The deputy sits 
               rubbing his eyes and Casy stands.

                         him again.

               Two of the men have helped the deputy to his feet. He feels 
               the back of his neck gingerly.

               With a deputy on either side of him, Casy climbs in the back 
               seat. The sickish deputy is helped into the car. The other 
               man comes running back.

               The car starts. CASY and two deputies beside him are revealed 
               in the back seat. Casy sits proudly, head up, eyes front. On 
               his lips is a faint smile; on his face, a curious look of 
               conquest.

               Casy sits with eyes front. AT THE WILLOWS, screened by trees 
               or brush, Tom looks off at the car taking Casy away. Starting 
               at a sound, he withdraws into the brush as the scene 
               dissolves.

               IN FRONT OF THE JOAD TENT, at night, Ma stands facing Pa and 
               Al. Rosasharn lies on a pallet, her face in her arms, while

               At the EDGE OF HOOVERVILLE, Tom is heading for the Joad tent 
               warily, glancing around constantly, but not running, for 
               that would draw attention to him.

               The scene dissolves to HOOVERVILLE, at night. The jalopies 
               are lumbering up on the road, one after the other, as the 
               migrants scatter before the threatened invasion.

               IN THE JOAD TRUCK, Tom is helping Rosasharn into the front 
               seat, beside Ma. The others are aboard except Al. Tom hands 
               Al a wrench.

               As he slows down the truck, we see that half of the ROAD is 
               blocked with boards and red lanterns. a group of men swarm 
               around the Joad truck as it stops. A leader leans in Tom's

               In the FRONT SEAT of the truck Tom's hand reaches for the

               sobbing with anger as he maneuvers the truck around.

               The TRUCK is going back down the road as the scene fades 
               out.

               Then we see the JOAD TRUCK pulled up off the paved highway, 
               and jacked up while Tom and Al fix a puncture. Ma is seated 
               in the front seat with Rosasharn. Pa and Uncle John are

               A BUICK ROADMASTER which has been speeding toward them stops 
               suddenly. Driving it is a husky man, named Spencer, whose

               The scene dissolves to the ENTRANCE OF THE HOOPER RANCH in 
               daylight. A gravel road leads from the paved highway to the 
               big wire gates, which are enclosed. Along the side of the 
               paved highway are parked a dozen jalopies, the migrants 
               sitting soberly in them. Fifty or sixty other migrants line 
               the gravel road and the junction with the paved highway. 
               Five jalopies are in line waiting to enter the gates. And 
               the scene is overwhelmingly policed. There must be ten 
               motorcycle cops around. Six are dismounted and strolling to 
               keep order among the migrants along the road. Three, their 
               motorcycles roaring, flank the line of five jalopies. As the 
               Joad truck drives up, we see the FRONT SEAT. Tom, Al, and Ma

               The motorcycle escort forms around the line of six cars and 
               a deafening din is raised, of motorcycles, sirens, and an

               not continuous, as the six jalopies in line pass through the 
               gate into the Hooper ranch. Two men stand beside the gates 
               with shotguns. They keep calling.

</b>                         Go on, go on! Keep movin'!

               The Joad truck passes through the gates. IN THE HOOPER RANCH 
               the six jalopies are halted at the end of a camp street. The 
               houses are small, square blocks, set in line. One, a little 
               larger, is a grocery store. Casually about are men in pairs 
               with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands. 
               Two bookkeepers are already passing down the cars and jotting 
               down information.

               He moves to the next car. The Joad truck starts...

               AT HOUSE 63, as the Joad truck pulls up, two deputies 
               approach. They look closely into each face as the Joads pile 
               out. One of the deputies has a long list in his hand.

                         Now you look here. We don't want no 
                         trouble with you. Jes' do your work

                         be all right.
                              (The deputies walk 
                              away)

                         home all right.

               Ma and Rosasharn step inside the house. It is filthy. A rusty 
               tin stove resting on four bricks is all the one room contains. 
               Ma and Rosasharn stand looking around at it. Finally:

                         we get her washed out.

                         it rains.

               OUTSIDE, a clerk with glasses appears, pushing a cart loaded 
               with three-gallon buckets.

                         How many?

                         Six.
                              (To Tom)
                         All y'all go. Me an' Rosasharn'll 
                         unload.

               With their buckets they shuffle away toward the peach trees--
               Tom, Pa, Uncle John, Al, and the two children struggling 
               with the enormous containers.

               The scene dissolves to the INTERIOR OF HOUSE 63 at night, a 
               lantern lighting the scene. Sitting wherever they can, the 
               Joads have finished their supper of hamburgers. And grateful 
               they are too, for the meat.

                         Okay, Ma. Don't you worry.

               IN THE RANCH STREET. There is a faint moonlight, but not 
               much, and little sound from the other houses as Tom strolls 
               down the street.

               NEAR THE GATE: beyond, cars pass. As Tom approaches the gate 
               a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises 
               from a box.

<b>                                     GUARD

                         the other way.

                         back?--or you want me to whistle up 
                         some help and take you back?

</b>                         I'll walk back.

               The guard watches him as he walks back and then douses his 
               flashlight.

               At a SECTION OF WIRE FENCE, watching his chance, moving 
               silently, Tom drops on the ground, on his back, gets his 
               head under the bottom wire, and pushes himself under and 
               outside. Rising, he crosses the paved highway.

               AN EMBANKMENT across the road from the wire fence: Tom 
               clambers down it, moving quietly. He picks his way down the 
               shallow ravine.

               A TENT: there is a light inside and there are the shadows of 
               figures. In the background, beyond the tent, is the silhouette 
               of a small concrete bridge spanning a small stream. Following 
               a trail, Tom enters and approaches the tent. (The opening is 
               away from him.) IN FRONT OF THE TENT, a man sitting on a box 
               looks up suspiciously as Tom enters. His name is Joe.

</b>                         No. Jus' goin' pas', I tell you.

               A head sticks out of the tent. Until he speaks, Tom does not 
               recognize Casy.

<b>                                     CASY

                              (He pulls Tom into 
                              the tent.)

               INSIDE THE TENT, three other men sit on the ground as Casy 
               brings Tom in. One's name is Frank.

               Frank's head sticks in the door. His voice is an excited 
               whisper.

                         Down that way--under the bridge span.

               Casy leads the way softly. THE BRIDGE SPAN is seen from the 
               stream as Casy, Tom, and the other man wade carefully toward 
               it.

               UNDER THE BRIDGE it is almost black as they creep through 
               the culvert. Just as Casy and Tom step out from under the 
               bridge on the other side, a blinding flashlight hits them, 
               lighting them like day.

               Halted, uncertain, they stand as three men with stars on 
               their coats and pickhandles in their hands slide down the 
               EMBANKMENT. Two of them hold lighted flashlights.

<b>                                     DEPUTY

                         they are! We got 'em!

               There are faint responses from a distance. CASY AND TOM are 
               alone. The others have fled. The deputies approach, their 
               lights on Casy and Tom.

<b>                                     CASY

               He swings the pickhandle. Casy dodges but the stick cracks 
               his skull. He falls face down out of the light. The deputies 
               watch for a moment but Casy doesn't stir.

</b>                         Turn him over. Put the light on him.

               Bending over, their bodies hide Casy.

               TOM, seen close, is breathing hard, his eyes glistening.

<b>                                     DEPUTY'S VOICE
</b>                         Serves him right, too.

               As the deputies straighten up, Tom steps forward, grabs the 
               pickhandle from the man who felled Casy, and swings. The 
               blow strikes the deputy's arm, sending his flashlight flying, 
               and the scene is in semi-darkness as Tom swings again. There 
               is a grunt and a groan as the deputy goes down. Then all is 
               confusion. Backing away, swinging the pickhandle, Tom bolts, 
               splashes a few yards through the stream, turns and gains a 
               better start by throwing the pickhandle at his pursuers. 
               They duck, and Tom disappears into the night. The other men 
               rush through the scene in pursuit.

               THE SECOND DEPUTY is seen bending over the body of the man 
               Tom laid out.

               TOM is seen crashing through the bushes, his face bloody. 
               The scene fades out.

               THE EXTERIOR OF HOUSE 63 fades in. It is day. Ma comes down 
               the street with a bundle under her arm and enters the house.

               INSIDE HOUSE 63, Rosasharn sits by the window as Ma enters.

               Rosasharn takes her post at the door as Ma kneels on the 
               floor beside Tom, puts down the rag bundle, and gets a basin. 
               Tom, who is under a quilt, is with his back alone visible. 
               She speaks softly, guardedly, as she bathes his face.

               At night, the TRUCK is backed up to the door of House 63; it

               Quickly, Al is in the driver's seat, with Ma and Pa beside 
               him. The truck rattles into motion and moves down the street.

               AT THE GATES TO THE RANCH another guard flashes a light as 
               Al stops the car.

               He opens the gate and the truck goes through. It turns from 
               the gravel road onto the paved highway.

               The TRUCK is rattling along the highway.

               Next, it is day, and the TRUCK is still churning along.

               In the FRONT SEAT, Tom is driving, his cap pulled as far 
               down as possible over his wounded cheek. Rosasharn has taken 
               Pa's place and is leaning wearily against Ma's shoulder.

               The TRUCK keeps moving along.

               Then it is night, and the TRUCK is still making distance.

               On a COUNTRY ROAD, in grey dawn, with a deafening clank under 
               the hood, the Joad truck pulls to a stop off the side of the 
               road. Al is driving. Asleep in Tom's arm in the front seat, 
               Ma stirs awake as Al turns off the ignition and gets out. He 
               lifts the hood.

               He pulls out the pieces. Tom gets out and takes off the 
               radiator cap. There is a geyser of steam. In the back of the 
               truck the others stand looking on, sleepy-eyed.

               As Al starts the truck, the scene dissolves to a weather-
               beaten wooden sign: "PERMANENT CAMP NO. 9"  "DEPT. OF 
<b>               AGRICULTURE"
</b>
               We see the GATE TO THE GOVERNMENT CAMP, a wide gate in a 
               high wire fence, with a caretaker's shack to one side of the 
               gate. The caretaker stands beside his shack as the Joad truck 
               swings off the road, hits an unnoticed rut that bounces the 
               whole truck off the ground, and stops.

               In the FRONT SEAT Al leans angrily out of the driver's window. 
               Tom is keeping his face away from the caretaker's line of 
               vision.

               significance to either. The shack is bare but for a cot, a 
               table, a chair, and an electric light. The caretaker is seated 
               at the table, pen in hand, a soiled ledger open, when Tom

               As he exits we see the GOVERNMENT CAMP, with Tom coming out 
               of the shack, amazement still on his face. As he walks slowly 
               down the main camp street we share the revelation of the 
               place to him. It is nearly daylight. Roosters crow in the 
               distance. The street is neat and orderly in a military way, 
               its cleanliness in sharp contrast to anything he has known 
               before. Inside the tents people are stirring. In front of 
               one tent a woman is cooking breakfast. A baby is in her arms.

               As he walks on, Tom draws a breath of exultation. As he moves 
               on, looking around, we see the EXTERIOR OF SANITARY UNIT NO. 
               4, a cheap frame building the purpose of which is pretty 
               obvious. Ruthie, warily alert lest she be caught, is peering 
               in the door. She looks a long time and then she runs out of 
               the scene.

               WINFIELD is seen asleep in a quilt on the ground when Ruthie 
               enters and rousts him out.

               THE EXTERIOR OF SANITARY UNIT NO. 4. Ruthie is putting on a

               There is the sound of a toilet flushing. It is a cheap toilet 
               and it is a loud flush which eventually ends in a long 
               refilling of the tank just as loudly. There is a paralyzed

               He nods quickly. Then Ruthie begins to walk away with what 
               she fancies is an innocent, nonchalant stroll, yawning 
               casually. Sniffling a little, Winfield mimics her, a very 
               innocent walk and yawn indeed.

               The scene dissolves to a DITCH. Alongside the ditch are some 
               lengths of concrete pipe. Tom and the two Wallaces are in 
               the ditch, Tom and Tim picking, Wilkie shoveling.

               Mr. Thomas, the farmer, a stock man wearing a paper sun 
               helmet, enters. His face is worried as he squats down beside

               he is still uncertain and annoyed. The men stop work.

               The scene dissolves to the GATE TO THE CAMP, at night. It is 
               Saturday evening, the night of the dance. Glaring electric 
               lights hang over the open gate. Parked jalopies line the 
               highway as the invited guests, small farmers and migrants 
               from other camps and their families, arrive to be greeted 
               and checked by a committee of three men.

               There is an air of eager anticipation, of gay celebration, 
               and everyone is in his or her best--the men in clean washed 
               overalls, clean shirts, some with ties, their hair damp and 
               slicked down, the women in their nicest. Through the gate, 
               inside the camp, can be seen the outdoor dance floor, brightly 
               lighted, with the camp musicians already tuning up, and around 
               the dance floor scores of wide-eyed children.

               INSIDE THE GATE TO THE CAMP, we see Wilkie and a dark-
               complexioned man named Jule standing among a group inside 
               watching the arrivals. They watch sharply, eyeing everyone, 
               listening to every credential. As his employer, Thomas, comes 
               through the gate with his wife, Wilkie grins and greets him 
               with a handshake.

               We see the DANCE FLOOR, and after three pats of the foot, to 
               get the tempo, the home talent dance orchestra swings into 
               music.

               INSIDE THE JOAD TENT, Rosasharn dressed in her nicest, sits 
               gripping her hands together, the music seeming to bring her 
               to the verge of tears.

               Smiling mysteriously, Ma fishes in a pocket in her dress and 
               brings out the envelope of her treasures. From it she produces 
               the earrings and holds them up in front of Rosasharn's wide 
               eyes.

                              (Then as she puts

                         You'll look pretty in 'em tonight.

               They smile at each other, proud in the luxury of ornaments.

               Down the road from the GATE a touring car with six men pulls 
               of the pavement and stops. Three men get out. They are 
               bareheaded and dressed similar to the other migrants. They 
               stroll down the highway toward the gate. The other men, 
               deputies, sit watching them.

<b>               WITHIN THE GATE:

               The three men stroll past Wilkie and Jule, whose eyes follow

                         'em. I'll stay here.

               Wilkie moves after them.

               We see the DANCE FLOOR. The musicians are at it and the 
               fiddler is calling turns.

               Well in front, among the older folks and children who surround 
               the floor, are Ma and Rosasharn, clinging close. A young man 
               stops in front of them.

               As Rosasharn's eyes drop. Ma bends toward her, a shy smile 
               on her face.

                         your pa was as nice a dancer as I 
                         ever seen, when he was young.
                              (With a little sigh)
                         Kinda makes me think a ol' times.

               The three men stroll into sight and stand watching the 
               dancing. One glances at Ma and Rosasharn but does not speak. 
               Ma has smiled back at him.

               WILKIE AND JACKSON are seen; removed somewhat from the dance 
               floor they are peering in the direction of the three men.

                              away)

               We find ourselves INSIDE TIM WALLACE'S TENT.  The five members 
               of the central committee, Tim Wallace, chairman, look grave 
               as a 15-year-old boy reports.

               Wilkie makes a mocking military salute as he and Tom exit. 
               The committee men look worriedly after them.

                         nobody.

               In front of the JOAD TENT, dressed to kill, is Al, ready for 
               the festivities. He wears a tight-fitting wool suit, a tie 
               on his shirt, yellow shoes, and his hair is damp and slicked 
               down. He rubs his hands together in anticipation as he strolls 
               in the direction of the dance floor.

               At ANOTHER TENT, a blonde girl sits on a box as Al enters. 
               Casually he throws open his coat, revealing a vivid striped 
               shirt. This is designed to stun his quarry.

                         Not like me!

               A fat woman thrusts her head out of the tent.

                         an' her man's a-comin' for her.

               Shrugging, Al winks at the girl and moves on, stepping and 
               moving his shoulders and snapping his fingers in time to the 
               music, a very gay fellow indeed. The blonde girl's eyes follow 
               him. Then she turns and glances cautiously toward the tent.

               ON THE DANCE FLOOR, we see Ma and Rosasharn as Tom enters 
               and stands between them. This is during a pause between dances 
               and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for the 
               music to begin again. We also see the three men very casually 
               looking around--but no more casual looking than Wilkie, 
               standing just behind them, idly whistling.

                         Girl with a baby *always* gets 
                         prettier.

               The music starts again, once more the dancers move onto the 
               dance floor. The three men exchange a glance and step casually 
               to the edge of the dancing space, one in the lead. They survey 
               the scene, but for the moment make no further move. The 
               atmosphere is tense.

                              of the scene, toward

               AL, taking the blonde girl's hand, steps onto the dance floor. 
               Encircling her waist, they begin to dance. They are a smooth, 
               rhythmic couple who move as one being.

                         Now I can't breathe.

               At this moment the leader of the three men (the other two 
               directly behind him) enters the scene.

                         You an' who else?

               Behind the three men a solid wall of migrants are closing in 
               quietly, Tom and Wilkie in the middle.

<b>                                     LEADER

                              (A shrill whistle 
                              sounds in the distance)
                         --you little--

               His fist goes back, his left hand reaches for Al's collar. 
               At the same instant Tom grabs him, Wilkie claps his hand 
               over the leader's mouth, at least fifteen other men have 
               similarly collard the other two invaders, and they are all 
               lifted bodily. There is not a sound as the three men, held 
               in iron grips, are whisked from the dance floor and into the 
               crowd.

               Two touring cars have stopped in front of the closed GATE 
               and the deputies have drawn guns.

</b>                         Well, I don't know what you gonna do 
                         about it, because I don't hear no 
                         riot an' I don't see no riot, an' 
                         what's more I don't believe they 
                         *is* no riot.
                              (Waving toward the 
                              dance floor)
                         Look for yourself.

               As the deputies, puzzled and uncertain, look toward the DANCE 
               FLOOR, we see the music, the dancing, the gaiety continuing 
               as if nothing had happened.

               WITHIN THE JOAD TENT at night, several hours later: the tent 
               is black, Tom strikes a match. From a piece of wood on the 
               ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts 
               and lights it. While he is doing so, he lifts his head 
               suddenly, and listens.

               In the CAMP STREET we catch sight of legs walking, the ground 
               lighted from a flashlight. Two pairs of the legs wear state 
               policemen's leather leggings. The third pair are the 
               caretaker's. They stop behind a car. The flashlight plays on 
               the license plate. One of the state cops leans down to copy 
               the license number in a booklet. Then they move on.

               TOM has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle, enough to see 
               out by flattening his head on the floor. The LEGS are now 
               seen at the Joad jalopy. The light is on the license plate. 
               The cop leans over and copies the number. They move on.

               TOM, lowering the edge of the tent, sits up. Quietly he pushes 
               aside the piece of carpet that covers him. He is wearing his 
               clothes. We see the policeman's CAR at the caretaker's hut. 
               The two policemen get into the car.

<b>                                     CARETAKER
</b>                         You got no right to arrest anybody 
                         without a warrant, you know.

                         as we check with headquarters.

               The car drives off, leaving the caretaker looking somberly 
               after it.

               WITHIN THE JOAD TENT, his cap on, fully dressed for travel, 
               Tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle. 
               Rising, he slings it across his shoulder. As he tiptoes toward 
               the door:

<b>                                     MA

                         Tommy?

               For a moment he looks into the darkness in her direction.

               She has risen, pulling the quilt around her. He takes her by 
               the hand.

               They go out. Tom leads Ma around BEHIND THE TENT, to a SECTION 
               OF WIRE FENCE. There is a bench there. Tom leads Ma to it 
               and sits her down. He sits beside her.

<b>                                     MAN
</b>                              (from the other truck, 
                              gaily)
                         What y'all hurryin' so for? Tell me 
                         they got twenny days work.

<b>                                     PA
</b>                         Yes, sir, an' we aim to git in all 
                         twenny of 'em.

               Other jalopies in the background are being readied for leaving--
               an excited, hopeful exodus on a new report of work.

<b>                                     AL
</b>                         Ready, Ma?

<b>                                     MA
</b>                         I'll get Rosasharn.

<b>                                     PA
</b>                              (beaming)
                         All aboard, ever'body! All aboard 
                         for Fresno!

               Ma comes out of the tent supporting Rosasharn tenderly. For 
               the plumpness has gone from the girl and she is thin again, 
               her face drawn and unhappy, her eyes swollen with weeping 
               and suffering.

<b>                                     MA
</b>                              (softly)
                         Try to be strong, honey. Someday 
                         it'll be diff'rent--someday you'll 
                         have another one. You're still jus' 
                         a little girl, remember.

               Pa takes Rosasharn's other arm. He and Al and Uncle John 
               help Rosasharn onto the truck. She lies down on the mattress, 
               her face away from them.

<b>                                     AL
</b>                              (in the driver's seat)
                         Ready, Pa?

                              in the front seat)
                         Let 'er go, Gallagher!

               The truck wabbles into motion. Al races the engine. It nearly 
               crashes another wheezing jalopy at the corner. When it turns 
               the corner we see the GATE, and a line of loaded jalopies 
               that ride out to the highway. The caretaker waves and the 
               migrants wave back.

               The Joad truck turns onto the highway. In the FRONT SEAT Al 
               is driving, Ma in the middle, Pa on the outside.

                         No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no 
                         more.
                              (After a pause)
                         I was, though. For a while I thought 
                         we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked 
                         like we didn't have nothin' in the

                         frien'ly anymore. It made me feel 
                         bad an' scared too--like we was 
                         lost... an' nobody cared.

                         it. Seems like I spen' all my time

                         be--thinkin' of home--an' I ain't

                         lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody 
                         dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or 
                         loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a 
                         woman it's all one flow, like a 
                         stream, little eddies, little 
                         waterfalls, but the river it goes 
                         right on. Woman looks at it like

                         I know. Maybe that makes us tough. 
                         Rich fellas come up an' they die, 
                         an' their kids ain't no good, an' 
                         they die out. But we keep a-comin'. 
                         We're the people that live. Can't 
                         nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody 
                         lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. 
                         We're the people.
                              (She says this with a 
                              simple, unaffected 
                              conviction)

               The TRUCK, steaming and rattling and churning, passes the 
               Chevrolet and Al leans out of the window and waves a jeering 
               hand at it. As the Joad truck pulls in front, we see Ruthie 
               and Winfield laughing with excitement over the triumph. Even 
               Uncle John shares the general satisfaction. Grinning, he 
               waves. As the truck moves away along the road, all three and 
               beaming and waving. Further along the truck passes a sign on 
               the side of the road. It says NO HELP WANTED.

               The scene fades out.
