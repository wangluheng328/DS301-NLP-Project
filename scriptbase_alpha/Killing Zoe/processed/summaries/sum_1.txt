An American vault-cracker ( Zed ) meets up with an old friend ( Eric ) in Paris.
Eric and his gang have planned to raid the only bank in the city which is open on Bastille day.
Zed is trapped in a situation beyond his control when heroin abuse, poor planning and a call-girl named Zoe all conspire to turn the robbery into a very bloody seige.
