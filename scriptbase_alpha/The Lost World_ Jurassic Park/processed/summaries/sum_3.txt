The film picks up four years after the disaster at Jurassic Park.
On a nearby island, dinosaurs have secretly survived and been allowed to roam free but now there is a more ominous threat--a plan to capture and bring the dinosaurs to the mainland.
John Hammond, who has lost control of his InGen company, sees a chance to redeem himself for his past mistakes and sends an expedition led by Ian Malcolm to reach the island before the mercenary team gets there.
The two groups confront each other in the face of extreme danger and must team up for their own survival in a race against time.
