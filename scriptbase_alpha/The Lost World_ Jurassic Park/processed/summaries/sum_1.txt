Ian Malcolm is recruited by John Hammond to lead a research team to Isla Sorna, an island 87 miles to the south of Isla Nublar (the site of the original Jurassic Park).
Here, InGen Bioengineering had constructed the secret "Site B", where the dinosaurs were actually bred and then transported to the park.
Hammond's nephew, who has taken control of InGen, leads his own team to the island to capture the dinos and bring them back to the U.S. to become attractions at a "dino park" in San Diego.
The dinos cause havoc and have a field day with the movable "feast."
