A machine that looks human is sent back in time to the late 20th century.
His mission is to kill Sarah Connor and her unborn son, John Connor.
Doing so would result in having John's entire existence destroyed so he won't exist to help the humans fight a war against the machines.
Kyle Reese, one of the soldiers in this war, has been sent back in time to stop the Terminator.
