Dave Kovic looks so much like President Bill Mitchell that he's asked to stand in for him, while the Bill occupies his time elsewhere !.
When Bill falls into a coma, a secret and highly illegal plot is hatched by Bob Alexander to keep Dave on as the president.
Unknown to Dave, Bob is working on making himself president, but he doesn't count on Dave being so popular and keen to continue.
