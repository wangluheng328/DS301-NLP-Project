President Bill Mitchell is not exactly an ideal President.
He looks after those who helped get him into office than the people, and he is a philanderer.
One of the ways that he keeps his little dalliances a secret is to hire a lookalike to impersonate him and when he is at a function at a hotel, his double is the one the press and media see leaving the hotel, while he stays behind for his little rendezvous.
Now the man whom they have hired is Dave Kovic, a goodhearted man who likes to help people find jobs.
Normally after making his little exit that would be that but Mitchell suffers a stroke.
Now he is completely incapacitated, and by law the Vice President will assume his duties but Bob Alexander, Mitchell's Chief of Staff who is just as corrupt and ammoral as Mitchell maybe even more, fears that the Vice President who is boy scout, will probably not play ball with him or not keep him around, tells Dave that it's in the country's best interest that the Vice President not take over.
So he agrees to continue pretending to be the President.
But in reality Alexander is planning to smear the Vice President into resigning thus paving the way for him to be President.
But when Dave becomes infatuated with the First Lady, and when Bob acting in Mitchell's place, cuts off funding to one of her projects, she assumes that it was Dave as Mitchell, who did it.
And so to make it up to her, he restores the funding, which infuriates Alexander.
Which means that Dave and Alexander are headed for a clash.
