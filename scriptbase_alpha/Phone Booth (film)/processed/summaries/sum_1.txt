Stu Shepard is a fast talking and wise cracking New York City publicist who gets out of trouble and lies with his clever charm, connections, and charisma.
Stu's greatest lie is to his wife Kelly, who he is cheating on with his girlfriend, Pam.
Upon answering a call in a phone booth in belief it is Pam, Stu is on the line with a dangerous yet intelligent psychopath with a sniper rifle.
When realizing it is not a joke, Stu is placed in a powerful mind game of wits and corruption.
The New York City Police eventually arrive thereafter and demand Stu comes out of the phone booth- but how can he when if he hangs up or leaves the booth he will die?
