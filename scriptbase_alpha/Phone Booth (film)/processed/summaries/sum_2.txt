Stu Shepard is an arrogant publicist who thinks he has the whole world in his hands.
Every day he uses the same phone booth to call the woman he is cheating on his wife with.
But on the last day, before this particular phone booth is demolished, the phone rings.
Stu naturally answers the phone, only to find the caller on the end is an invisible sniper who knows everything on Stu, including his relationships.
The caller now has Stu as his hostage, who demands he comes clean with his wife.
