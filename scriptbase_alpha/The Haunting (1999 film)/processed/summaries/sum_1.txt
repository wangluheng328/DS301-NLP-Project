Eleanor Lance is called to meet at Hill House for Dr.
Marrow's sleeping disorder studies, along with three other people.
The owners of the house tell them that no one will be around and that they won't be able to hear them.
The first night they all sit around and talk.
Eleanor tells them that her sleeping disorder is different because she can sleep it is just that she wakes up because she thinks her dead mom is still living with her.
Well that isn't the case now because she is woken one night in the Hill House bedroom by talking childrens voices asking her for her help.
At first scared by the voice, she learns to avoid them.
Later, the group finds out that Dr.
Marrow is not using them for sleeping disorders but a test in fear.
The fear is first thought to be fake but eventually turns real when loud noises are heard and objects start to move.
Now they must try an escape the house before they are all killed.
