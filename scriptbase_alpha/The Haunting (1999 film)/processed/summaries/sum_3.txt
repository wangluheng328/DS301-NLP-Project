In "The Haunting," a group of insomniac volunteer research subjects travel to a massive old mansion to undergo testing for what they believe to be insomnia studies.
What they do not know is that the professor in charge is actually conducting experiments on human fear.
As the days and nights pass, the group slowly begins to learn the terrifying secret behind the house's former owner.
They soon realize that the house is pure evil, and they must battle a terrifying spirit to escape the house of nightmares.
