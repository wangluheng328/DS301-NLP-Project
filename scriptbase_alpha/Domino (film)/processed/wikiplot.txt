Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley), a bounty hunter, has been arrested by the FBI, which is investigating the theft of $10 million from an armored truck 36 hours prior.
Domino is interviewed by criminal psychologist Taryn Mills (Lucy Liu) and agrees to tell her everything she knows about the case.
In a more or less disoriented fashion, Domino explains about her profession and the events leading up to the theft with Mills occasionally prompting her to give more detail.

Domino, a former model living in Los Angeles becomes a bounty hunter when, after being kicked out of college, she notices a newspaper advertisement for a bounty hunter training seminar.
Her colleagues are Ed Moseby (Mickey Rourke), Choco (Edgar Ramirez) and their Afghan driver Alf (Riz Abbasi).
They are employed by Claremont Williams III (Delroy Lindo), a bail bondsman who also runs an armored car business.
Claremont's mistress, Lateesha Rodriguez (Mo'Nique), works for the California Department of Motor Vehicles.
Her granddaughter Mica is suffering from a blood disease and needs an operation urgently.
The operation Mica needs costs $300,000 which Lateesha does not have.
Claremont comes up with a plan to get the money by setting up the robbery of $10 million from Drake Bishop (Dabney Coleman), the billionaire owner of the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas and a client of Claremont's armored car business.
His bounty hunters would then return the stolen money and collect a $300,000 finder's fee from Bishop.
