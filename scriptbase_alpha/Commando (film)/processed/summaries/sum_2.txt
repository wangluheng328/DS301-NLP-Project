Colonel John Matrix is retired from the army, and he's living in the mountains of California with his 11-year-old daughter Jenny.
Jenny is kidnapped by Bennett, one of John's former soldiers.
Bennet's boss, exiled Latin American dictator Arius, demands that John assassinate the president of Arius's country so Arius can reinstate himself as dictator.
John is put on a southbound airplane with a guard, but before the airplane can take off, John snaps the guard's neck, jumps off of the airplane, and sets out to locate Jenny.
While John is tracking down Arius and Bennett, John enlists the help of a young woman named Cindy.
As John and Cindy close in on the island where Jenny is being held, they are confronted by hordes of men who work for Arius and Bennett.
But John is willing to do anything to rescue Jenny...even if he has to start a one man World War III.
