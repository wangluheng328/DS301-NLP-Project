ACT I


FADE IN:


Shot from across the street.  Shot of club entrance.  Neon sign 
reading "Dance Paradise".  Camera swarming in and from above.  
Music from the club.  Louder and louder each time doors open.  
Long line outside.  Few cars around mostly young people on foot.

Time and date stamp on screen.  It's Friday night.

CUT TO:

Interior of club.  Christmas theme in club.  DJ wearing a Santa 
suit
 
DJ
"Welcome to all our UofM students.  As you all know this is the 
last jam until next semester.  So let's get rowdy and do what we 
do best. P-A-R-T-Y."
 
CUT TO

Shot of guy and girl in line.

Lydia
Come on, I think its ridiculous that we're standing in line.  We 
should be in there and you and I both know that.

Guy lights cigarette and nods at the couple in front.  He turns 
left and reads the headline on the newspaper.  Body of 22 year old 
female missing from the morgue. Third body this month.

Lydia
Com'on, say something! (shoulder shove), say something damn it

Titus
Quit shoving me.

Lydia
(Shoving again).  Say something else.

Titus(Shoves back hard)
Quit man.  If you weren't so slow we would have been here with 
everyone else.
Lydia is upset and looks toward the wall, way from Titus.

CUT TO
Inside club
Titus and Lydia on dance floor.  They wave at another guy on the 
upper perimeter.

Randy(to girl hugging him from behind)
There go T and Lydia.

Nannette
What?  I can't hear you.

Randy
What did you say?  I can't hear you.

He signals her to the dance floor.  They make their way through 
the crowd to their friends.
 Suddenly, the music stops.  

DJ
"Hold it, Hold  it.  Dance P' would like to take this time to 
congratulate the UM crusaders under their senior co-captains Titus 
Von-Aldershmitt and Randy Bannerman, for successfully defending 
their soccer championship.  This one goes out to you guys.  
Congrats"

team acknowledges all through the club.  Spot light put on Titus 
and Randy.  

Pierre(holding a mic to Titus)
So what does it feel  like leading the crusaders to a second 
title?

Titus 
Great man!  Hey man can't this wait till later?  I mean we're 
trying to party here

Pierre
Just one quick question before they turn the music back on.

Titus
Go ask Randy.  We're co-capt'ns.

Pierre
He's hostile.  It's just for the story you know

Lydia(pulling Titus away with a kiss)
It's always about the story with you Pierre.

Pierre
It's only about the story.  Remember that.

Randy(coming up from behind Pierre)
If it ain't Ted couples himself.
Laughter
Randy
Hunting down the story of the year as usual hey?


Pierre
Never mind, I'm all done here, I got my story from the hero of the 
day

Randy
Really, were you at the game?

Pierre
I was covering the induction of the new school president

Titus 
So how do you know who the hero of the day was?

Pierre
Simple enough, you have a leader, and the following cast.  I went 
for the leader.

Randy
Kiss my A-S-S

Pierre
You wouldn't understand the craft involved in what I do.  
Furthermore, you wouldn't know what it means to finance your own 
way through college.  Not all of us have a free ride.

Randy
You're right, I wouldn't understand the crap involved in what you 
do.  Why don't you go cover the missing bodies story hun?

Pierre
How typical of you, the guest of honor.  Oh and by the way that 
story is as dead as it calls.  There are no headlines in it.

Randy(walking away from Pierre)
One day, you're going to make the headlines and it wouldn't be a 
story you'd have to chase, 'cause the story will be you.
  
One of the students rushes the DJ's booth.  

Girl
 Who wants these?(grabbing at her voluptuous breast)
Girl climbs DJ booth and stands overlooking the crowd.  The crowd 
goes wild.  She pulls her sweater over her head and swirls it 
around.  

Crowd( chanting)
"Take it off, take it off take it off."

 The music is back on the DJ is playing "Firestarter" by Prodigy. 
 The girl takes off her brassier.  Crowd is cheering her on.

CUT TO

Outside: Club security

Guard#1(on radio)
10-4 I copy that (signaling other guard).  Com'on we're wanted 
inside. 

Guard#2
Fuck not tonight.  What is it

Guard#1
I don't know something about a chick on the DJ booth showing some 
skin.  Nothing big

Guard#2 
Nothing big my ass, that's how it always starts

CUT TO

 One of the security guards reaches for the girl she evades his 
grip he urges her on to step down from the ledge of the DJ's 
booth.  He smiles and tells her to come down she looks at him and 
points to her ears as though to say that she cannot hear him.  

Guard#1
OK enough of this crap.

He reaches up for the girl and he violently brings her down.  

Crowd
"Boo, you jackass"
 
CUT TO

A guy makes his way from the bar back toward the DJ's booth.   
Along the way he picks up a bottle of stout from a table as he 
closes in on the security guard and the girl, he pours out the 
remaining content of the bottle of stout.  

CUT TO

Randy is in a corner hands deep in Nannette's thong.  The music 
seems to have gone up a notch.  Climax is taking over her face.  
Her eyes are glowing with excitement, her body is beginning to 
shudder.
Romuald
Randy, (taps on shoulder), Randy

Randy turns around totally furious at the same time, Nannette is 
scrambling to get herself together.
Romuald
Look out dude.  Keep your eyes peeled.  Hey 'nette!

He walks off
Randy
Hey, hey lookout for what?  Hey Romi, Romi
Randy looks at Nanette and shrugs his shoulders. She is in 
disbelief and stomps off. He tries to stop her but turns around to 
locate his friend's destination.

CUT TO

Romuald 
Hey, you want to let her go!

Guard#1
What?  gitattahere kid

Romuald(pulling guard by the shoulder)


Hey, I said get your hands off her you, dumb fuck, can't you see you're 
hurting her?
The guard turns around and slams the kid against the wall in retaliation.  
Romuald puts his index finger in the bottle and bashes it against the guard's 
head.  

FIGHT
Students and locals break out in a fight.  The club security converged towards 
the scene.  Romuald is the first person caught.  The security guards wrestled 
him to the ground. The guard that he had bashed on the head is bleeding.  He 
swings at Romuald.
Romi is out cold.
Guard#1(leaning over Romi with bottle)
You wanna be all bad don't you?  Well let me give you something to think about 
for Christmas, you bloody wanker
Before he can deliver the blow, he is tackled at the waist by another student, 
which sends them both into the décor.  The two are evenly matched in stature 
and brawling styles.  At the same time, Titus and Randy are in taking on 
another guard.  

Voice comes over the P.A system.
"Break it up everybody.  Now."

No one stops.  Music stops.  

Voice 
"Alright, you're all under arrest!"
"come on guys take 'em down.  They're all going down town tonight"
At the same time, the police walked in.  virtually everyone in the crowd 
started running in all directions.  Randy and Titus go for Romuald.  

Randy
Come on man let's get out of here.

They run towards the ladies bathroom. They pull the guy who was brawling with 
the security guard off the latter.  It is Solonzo, Romi's younger brother.  A 
six foot five inches 289 pound lacrosse defensive player.   

Randy(with caution)
Solonzo, Solonzo, chill out dude!! Come on dude we've got to get out of here.( 
pulling on arm) hey man lets get the fuck out of here now!

Pause, 
Solonzo
Yow let's brake man

  The trio dashed on to the ladies bathroom. They make their way to the last 
stall in which there was a vent leading to the back alley of the club.  They 
kick in  the screen.  The  window gives.  The three guys jump out of the 
window onto the back alley.

Cut to 

Club fight still going on.  The girls(Lydia and Nannette) standing alone in a 
corner.  Officer comes over and escorts them outside.

Officer
You OK?  You guys alone?

Lydia/Nannette
Yes/No

Officer
What?

Lydia
We're alone officer.  Now can we get a ride back to campus please.

Cut to

  From their location in the  back alley, the boys can see the police wagon 
loading people aboard.  They crouch and make their way back up to the street. 
 Three officers are wrestling to get Pierre in the police wagon.  

Randy
Hey, Titus, there's your boy.

Pause,
Randy
Titus, Titus,

Solonzo
Where'd he go?  Man he was right behind.

Romuald
I know, he was right behind me when we went into the chicks shitter.

Cut to

Flashback to the club.
Titus ditches his jacket.  Runs out the front doors with a massive crowd.
Officers give pursuit to the crowd.  
 
Cut to

Back to real time

Pierre
Let go you baboons!  That camera is worth more than your salary

Officer
Shut up and get in the wagon.  I'm not going to say it again.

Pierre
I'm a reporter and you're violating my rights.  I know my rights, both as a 
citizen and as a journalist.  Hey look at my pass badge, I'm the editor-in-
chief of the U of M Herald Tribune.  I'm here on assignment.

Officer
Yeah get your ass in there

Back in the alley.  Randy and the others are laughing at the whole thing with 
Pierre.
The officers hur him on board as though he had never even mentioned a word 
about his immunity.

Pierre
I would have your badge for this, believe me you are messing with 
international rights here.  I am a journalist and I must be granted permission 
to cover any event that I chose.

Randy
This what we're going to do, as soon as the wagon leaves we will head for 
Pierre's car.  You know that they're going to be all over the place so we 
can't take the hill road back to campus but campus security is not going to 
stop any vehicles especially not Pierre Günter's car as much as they hate to 
deal with him and his shit.

Solonzo
Well what about Pierre? I mean don't get me wrong but we can't just let them 
take him.  He's our friend.

Romuald
Well junior's got a point there.  

Solonzo
Don't call me that!  I hate that

Romuald
If we're going to make a run for it in his car, the least we could do is try 
to get him out of there.

Randy
Listen here guys I would love to get him out of there and for that matter I 
would like to get everyone out of the wagon the truth of the matter is we 
can't save everyone's ass so tough tit . So you wanna go with my plan or you 
want to get some signs and start picketing?

Solonzo
I'm game but how do we know if the keys are in the car?


Both Romuald and Randy turned and looked at Solonzo and back at the Renault 5 
parked across the street.  It was barely alive.  The door on the driver's side 
had some damage that looked like a series of little fender benders The windows 
were 

Solonzo
OK I get it but I still say we're wrong for doing this.

Suddenly, here comes the police impound truck backing up towards the Renault 
5. The truck begins to tow the Renault.
Randy and the rest are shocked, in their state of defeat, they noticed the 
driver door of the Renault open and they see someone leap out of the car.  It 
was none other than Titus.

Randy
That's where he's been all this while that little piece of shit.  How did he 
get in there?

Romuald 
He was trying to make a break for it alone.

Solonzo
Jackass

Titus meanwhile, was given his best impression of James Bond meets Austin 
Powers.  He tumbled left, rolled right takes a few steps and dives into the 
dumpster in the alley opposite his friends.  His friends watched him as he 
maneuvered about with the grace of a cat.  Suddenly they hear a thunderous 
sound of pain and rejection.  They all stand up at once looking in the 
direction of the poorly lit alley.

Randy
Titus, Titus,

Titus(jumping up to his feet)
I'm all right (stretching his arms outward as if to reassure everyone) I'm all 
right.

Titus pulls on his sweater and looks across the way at the now three distinct 
forms in the dark.  He recognizes Randy's voice but he still can't make them 
out clearly

Titus
Who's there? Hey what are you guys doing over there?

Romuald
Man it's us.  Stay there.

Titus nods his head and began looking for one of his contact lenses.  
The police wagon is ready to depart from the vicinity.

Solonzo
Hey Titus, they got Pierre, he's on the wagon.
Titus looks at the police wagon and suddenly starts looking around the 
dumpster, on the floor and in the dumpster itself.  He digs into his pocket 
and reaches  for his keys.  There's  a Swiss Army knife kit attached to his 
key ring.The three friends on the other side of the street were looking on 
totally confused, Titus  pulls out a devise. 

The police wagon begins moving.  A sense of urgency overtook Titus.  
As soon as the wagon goes pass him, he ran after the wagon, paces himself and 
at the very next shift in gear, he jumps onto the ledge.  All the people on 
board begin cheering him on. 

Randy
What the fuck is that boy doing?

Solonzo
Com'on, let's go

Romuald
Hey come back here you dumb ass.  Junior, junior.  Oh well fuck it

Randy
Romi! Hey.manhave you all lost your damned minds?.fuck

All three begin running after the wagon. Randy catches up with the other two.

Randy
Why are we running toward the fucking wagon

Romuald(laughing)
I don't know man but I tell you what, I'm having a lot of fun tonight

Meanwhile, Titus fidgets with the lock on the wagon.  Finally, the lock gives. 
 They doors of the wagon fly open and Titus, hanging on for dear life crashes 
against the side of the wagon.  

Driver
What was that?

Officer(passenger)
What

Crashing sound.  Cheering from the back of wagon.


Driver
That.

Officer(looking in side view mirror)
Oh shit, stop the truck (hits the dash) stop the fucking truck.

Driver(slamming on brakes)
What?  What is it

Officer
Their fucking breaking out.

The officer gets on his radio

Officer
Attention all units.  Loader 1 needs assistance.  I repeat, loader 1 needs 
assistance.  There's been a break out.

Radio response
10-4
Cut to

Officers on the road begin turning around, heading back for town.

Cut to

Randy
Titus!! Oh shit he's gonna fall.

Randy
Hold on man

They all speed up.  The wagon abruptly stops.

As soon as the wagon stops, everyone on board starts rushing out.  The crowd 
scatters in all directions.  You can hear the police sirens closing in on the 
scene.  Titus let go the gate, jumps down and takes off running back toward 
town. 

Officer(passenger)
Stop. Come back here 

Driver
You got him? I'mma go this way.  Backup is coming this way.

Officer(passenger)
Go, go I've got this one

  
He starts giving chase, for a moment it appeared as if he is gaining grounds 
on Titus.
Titus is running, grimacing and holding his arm.  He is in pain form slamming 
in the side of the wagon.
The officer begins stretching to grab at Titus' shirt, 
 
Officer
Gotcha

Titus evades his grab.  The captain of the University of Malta's soccer team 
showed why he was the fastest and most lethal striker on the team.  
Titus begins to successfully distance himself from the officer however great 
the gap is, he still can't shake the determined officer.  Titus looks back at 
the officer and then looked forward and realized that he is closing in on his 
friends who have stopped to look at the race, at that point a faint smile 
broke out of the corner of Titus' mouth.  He picked up the pace another notch 
and then abruptly begins slowing down.  .  Before the officer realizes what's 
happening, he is being side swiped by Randy.  

Randy
Get up?  Get up now!  What's up

The officer tries to get back up to his feet.  Romi and Solonzo join in the 
attack.
The situation quickly turned ugly.  The officer is being kicked on the ground. 
 The blue lights are coming up on the boys.  


Cut to

At that very moment, Pierre Günter, spots a cab and hails it

Pierre
UM campus.  Drive.

Cab driver
Hey what's going on here?  I'm off duty

Pierre
Well you're back on.  Here(throws 2 twenty dollar bills at the driver)

Cab Driver
OK


The cab drives right pass Titus and the others.  The guys spot Pierre in the 
cab and run toward the cab, pulling the doors open.

Cab Driver
What the hell do you think you're doing.(stops the cab)

Pierre
No drive, drive, don't stop

Cab Driver
Hey what are you doing

Titus
Hitching a ride(as he climbs aboard)

Cab Driver 
Hey are these friends of yours

Randy
Sure we are.

Pierre
No they're not

Titus
Really
 
Pierre
I mean yeah well he is 

Romuald
And we're not?

Pierre
No..you guys are as well I'm just sayingoh what the hell

Cab Driver
I can't

Titus
Why

Cab Driver
Too many of you.

Randy
Too many. Hey they're brothers and the two of us are roommates. 

Cab Driver 
What the fuck does that have to do with the fact that I could get in trouble 
.

Solonzo
From who the officers?  Can't you see they are busy doing other things.  

Titus
Hey let's get a move on shall we.  We'll pay you a hundred bucks..OK

Randy
What?

Titus
Do we have a deal?

Cab Driver
A hundred bucks.  And don't think for one minute that you can fuck with me got 
it?

Titus
Got it now you just fucking drive.

Cut to
  The first dorm in sight was that of Pierre Günter. 

Pierre
See that building over there?  That's my stop OK!

Randy
Man I had almost forgotten that you were in here.  It's different not hearing 
you yap all day long about some bullshit

Pierre(looking out the window)
Fuck you too Randy, F-U-C-K you too.

Solonzo
Hey we're spending the holydays in the city this year man.


Romuald
Prodigy is going to be in concert at the club Deca.  You know we're gonna be 
out there man for sure.

Titus
I don't know man we might go to the States, I'm not sure yet.  Depends on what 
the old man has planned.

Randy
I hope we do go man I'm about ready for a change of air.

Pierre(still looking out the window)
Why don't you just cut yourself a ticket?  Oh, oh I forgot why do that when 
you can free load

Randy
Bitch what?

Titus
Hey, hey every body keep cool.  OK

Randy
Who the fuck is that fucking pigmy talking too?

Pierre 
Here, stop, here's my stop.

Cab Driver
Alright where's my money

Pierre
What?  I gave you forty dollars for the ride.  That was our deal now you 
settle the rest with them.

The cab driver pulled over for Pierre to get out at that time, the Pacheco 
brothers (Romuald and Solonzo) also jumped out of the cab.

Randy
What the hell are you guys doing?

Solonzo
What?

Titus
He said what the hell are you guys doing?
Romuald shrugs his shoulders and mumbled some words under his breath.
They all huddle outside.
The cab driver steps out as well.

Cab Driver 
What the fuck do you guys think you're doing?

Titus
Easy my man, we're just trying to get your cheese for you.chill out man, go 
back in your ride turn on your music or something.

The driver doesn't budge.  Titus walks around offers him a cigarette.  He 
accepts reluctantly.  The cab driver and Titus walk off together.  They don't 
go to far however.

Randy
OK quit joking man cough up some grips.  Now man I ain't playing.

Solonzo 
What are you talking about?  Man I know you weren't planning on paying that 
guy. Anyway.  

Randy
What the fuck are you talking about?

Pierre
Look guys I don't know what you're up to but I've paid my part of the fare so, 
I'm off to my room.

Romuald
Yeah dude.  Com'on man we know what's up?

Randy 
Alright, alright let's just go with the flow.  You know the drill.

Romuald(raising his voice)
Alright man fuck here's your change dude.  You cheap bastard.  Com'on junior, 
let's break.

On the other side of the cab.

Titus
See man.  We're straight.  We've got your cheese.  Let's go.

Titus
We straight Randy?


Randy
Yeah dude!  We straight

Titus
Cool. 
Cut to
Titus is in the front seat of the cab calming the now very suspicious cab 
driver.

Cab Driver(looking in the rear view)
I knew you lads were trouble the moment I saw you.  You bloody well know this 
now, try anything fancy and I'll skin you dead.

Randy
Calm down you old goat, we ain't trying to pull a fast one on you.  We were 
just out there trying to get your money right.  So instead of threatening my 
friends and I, why don't you act like you appreciate this deal.

Cabby
Act what? You Americans. Aye, we should have hang the whole lot of your 
ancestors.

Titus frowns at the cab driver then,  he chuckles.

Titus
Shut up you toothless goat, if it hadn't been because of us Americans, you'd 
be a Nazi colony by now.  And what do you get being all mean to us for?  We're 
your customers here.

Randy
Man how much do we owe you for the two of us?

No answer.  Titus begins to laugh.  The driver is not amused.

Randy
Dude, I'm talking to yo monkey ass

Cab Driver
Who the fuck are you insulting lad? I'm a real bad man you know?

Randy
What?

Titus
Dude don't pay any attention to this old goat his drunk anyway


Cab Driver
I'm not drunk, I know just what I'm doing.  If I was drunk, would I be able to 
drive you here?

Titus
Man you make it sound like it is so hard to drive to the campus.  You've 
probably been driving  here since forever, so what are you talking about

Randy
Man, I'm for real, what do we owe you

Cabby
You owe me your share of the fare, you owe me a hundred bucks

Titus bursts out laughing

Randy
Alright dude now your just being rude (British accent)

Titus (laughing)
Hello, introducing Danger Powers

Randy
You know what you're just a mean old man.  Just take us to the spot and I'll 
pay you

Cab Driver
The spot?

Randy
Yeah the spot

Cab Driver
What spot?


Titus is laughing at the two.  
Randy
Make a right!!! Dude turn right over here man, damn 

Cab Driver
Who are you cursing at you arse.  What do you mean make a right?  There are no 
dorms that way




Randy
See, see you too smart for your own good.  You should have been a rocket 
scientist or something like that.  Just follow the damn directions man.  I 
never said that we were going to the dorms.  We don't live in the dorms.  Now 
is there anything else that you need,  you need to see the house keys or 
something? (pulls out keys and starts swinging  them at the driver)

Titus' laughter begins to fade.

Intersection: sign (pointing left) reads Masters flats,  other sign illegible 
pointing forward.

Randy 
Thank you.  Shit acting all paranoid and shit.

Cab driver does not respond, looks around uncertain.

Cab Driver
We going the right way right?

Randy 
Hell yeah man what..

Cab Driver
I'm not talking to you!  I'm asking you (pointing at Titus).  We going  the 
right way right?

No answer

Randy
Man tell the dude we heading home please.

No answer

Randy 
Man, I'm talking to you dude

Titus(snapping)
What dude?  Yeah we going  the right way.  Don't you know the directions home 
to your parents' pad?

Randy
Chill out dude, don't get your feelings hurt for nothing man.

The cab headed on.  
Passed another sign:  ACADEMIC SITE

Cab Driver
Where are we going?

Randy 
We're going to my parents place up there. At the end of the hill.  Pull up in 
front of the house.

Cab come to a halt in front of a gate.  The structure is dented and lacks in 
home appeal.

Cab Driver
Here?

Randy 
Yeah here.  Look this is the back of the crib.

Cab Driver
The what?

Randy
Never mind dude?  This is the back of the house.  Tell you the truth, we don't 
want to go in through the front door, it creeks.  You know what I'm saying?

Cab Driver
No

Titus
Man he means my mom might hear something

Cab Driver
Your mom?

Randy
Yeah his mom.  School's out she came to pick him up and take him home.

Cab Driver
You act so toughyou're really just babies.

Randy
Man..

Cab Driver(honks horn)
Matters less to me lads, just pay up you heathens

Randy and Titus looking around to see who's looking.  

Titus
What the hell is wrong with you?

Cab Driver
I'm so sorry, I mistakenly fell on the horn.  No harm intended.  Anyway, I've 
had enough of you two just settle your fare as arranged

Randy
Alright, alright man look, don't take this the wrong way but see we don't have 
all of your money right now.

Cab Driver 
What the bloody hell do you mean?  I knew you lads were up to some tricks with 
me (he starts walking out of the cab)

Titus(grabbing him by the arm)
No man chill.  I mean sir, look at me(pulls him around) look at me sir, look.

Cab Driver
You're not getting away with this

Titus
Look, easy man, I'm telling you man.  I have, here (digs in pocket while still 
holding him) I've got some change here.  Look, look that's a ten and some ones 
see.

Randy
Yeah, yeah see we ain't trying to get over on you

Cab Driver
What is he saying, that arse

Titus
RandyRandy

Randy
What?

Titus
Speak English will you

Randy
Fuck you man.


Titus(back to driver)
Listen, I just need to go in there and get your money for you that's all, OK. 
 

Cab Driver
No way let him go

Randy
You know what, you're pissing me off now.  I'll go alright but I'm taking my 
sweet time believe that and matter of fact, I don't give a shit what you do.  
Blow the fucking horn for all I care man.  I'll tell campus police that you 
overloaded, fixed priced and used a company vehicle while off duty.  Now what?

Titus
Look, look both of you chill out, listen here sir I'm just going to go in here 
and get your money for you.  Stay tight alright, stay tight both of you.  No 
more fighting.

Titus gets out of the cab and heads for the gate.  He reaches the top of the 
stairs and stars fiddling with the door handle.  Titus dips in his pocket and 
pulls out his keys.  The cad driver is keeping a close watch of  the entire 
event.  Titus turns around to see what the others are doing.  They are looking 
back at him.  He pushes the door and it gives.  Titus walks into a brightly 
lit room.  The door shuts behind him.

Cut to

Back in the cab

Randy
Dude what's up with my man.  Never thought I'd say this but damn.  Dude needs 
to hurry up.

Cab Driver
Yeah.yeah

Randy 
 Hey man no hard feelings right? (reaching over the driver's shoulder to shake 
his hand) Hey, we cool

Cab Driver 
Sure, everything is fine.  Where's your friend?  That's what I want to know.

Randy
I don't know man but knowing him he probably made so much noise, his mom 
probably caught him.


Cab Driver
What's that suppose to mean.

Randy
Man nothing..all I'm saying is that his mom is really long winded and we 
might be here a while.

Cab Driver
Right how great!

Randy 
Trust me I'm not ecstatic either. 

Cut to

Titus is walking through a long corridor. At the end of the corridor, Titus 
makes a right turn and opens a double door.  He's met with some bright lights, 
after his eyes adjust, he looks on at the street lights across from him.  
There's a high rise building at the corner of the street.  Titus sets his 
sight on the stair case before him and starts climbing them down.

Randy, looking at his watch.

Randy
Alright man, I'm tired of waiting here.  See he puts up with too much shit.  
I'm going to go in there and get your money.  Shit I'm tired anyway and if I 
sit here one more second I'm going  to go insane

Cab Driver 
Wow, wow, wait a minute there you're not

Randy
Listen here, man, I know I've been bursting your balls but work with me on 
this one OK.

The cab driver just looks at randy

Randy
Alright, this is the game plan, I go in and get your grips.. I mean your 
money, for you.  After that you can go your way.  Now if I'm not out in about 
five minutes, just come on in and ask for your money OK.  OK.
 
Randy opens the door, pats the driver on his shoulder and heads out the cab.  
He walks the same trail that Titus just walked.  As he approaches the door, he 
turns and gives the cab driver a thumbs up as he walks into the brightly lit 
room.

Cut to 

The cab driver stands outside his car looking on.  Suddenly, the doors open 
again and randy gives the driver a vigorous thumbs up again.  Before the 
driver can move, Randy signals him to wait where he is.
The cab driver settles back in his car and turns on the music as he lights a 
cigarette.

Cut To

Randy is dashing through the building and he makes the same turn Titus made.  
He walks out the same doors and onto the same street.  He pauses for a second 
looking around then shrugs his shoulders

Randy(Whispering at first)
Titus! Titus! that mother fucker left me man ain't that some shit.

Randy takes off running again.  This time toward the high rise tower.

Cut to

The cab driver is in his car, he starts the engine and revs it high, trying to 
draw the attention from the house.  Nothing.  He honks his horn mildly at 
first then loudly.  Still nothing.  The driver looks at his watch.  He 
hesitates a little and then gets out of the car and heads for the house.

Cut to

Randy opens a door and creeps into a house.  As he moves about lightly through 
the dark, he's startled when the lights come on.

Titus
That's fucked up man.  We're going to pay for this one day!  That's for sure

Randy
Whatever man.  Pierre had already given him forty bucks.  It ain't like he's 
going to turn us in.  he'll lose his damn job.  Shit.  Man I'm tired I'm going 
to bed.  

Cut to

Pierre in his dorm room.




Pierre(on phone)
Hey tell your brother to come get his keys man I don't know how I ended up 
with them

Romuald
I told that dumb ass I didn't have his keys.  Anyway, we'll be there in a 
minute.  He's in the shiter.

Cut to

The cab driver walks up to the door the first thing he notices is that there 
is no door bell.  He knocks on the door and listens for a response.  Nothing. 
 He knocks again.  This time he turns the door handle.  The latter gives.

Interior is a corridor lined stretchers on either side.  

Cab Driver
Fuck, those kids got me.  Shit.

Cab driver standing around undecided.  He's pacing around.  Heads back for the 
door.  Stops.  Sound of something dropping in the background.  He turns 
around.

Cab Driver
What was that?  

He heads down the same direction Randy and Titus went.  At the same 
intersection, he freezes unsure of which way to go.  Left or right?  He hears 
a sound coming from his right.  That's good enough for him.

Cab Driver(tip toeing in the direction of the noise)
Gotcha.  I told you not to try to fuck with me.. what the fuck is that 
smell.
Hu (covering his nose). 

Cab driver heads down the hall.  He reaches a door and spies into the room.  
There's a man in a white robe.  Like a doctor's gown.  He seems to be doing 
something but the cab driver is unable to see.
 He smells a foul stench as though some strong chemical had been used on the 
premise.  
He opens the door and approaches the man, his hand is stretched out toward the 
man.  
The latter is oblivious to what's going on.  He's consumed with his endeavor. 

Cab Driver
'scuse me Mr.

The man turns around.  


Cab Driver
Sorry Mr.  Didn't mean to.(he looks over the man's shoulder).. what the 
fu..

No audible dialogue.  Through scene

The cab driver collapses to his knees.  He looks down.  Grabs his side.  The 
man before him withdraws a surgical device out of the driver's side.  It's a 
long shining tube with a hollow tip, the look of confusion on the driver's 
face gives way to a look of pain and agony.  He tries to breath but his lungs 
are filled with blood, he coughs blood on the onlooker's medical robe.  He had 
been probed right under his left arm just beneath the third rib, directly 
puncturing his heart's left ventricle.  The man drops his weapon. The driver 
panics he tries to grab his attacker.  The latter steps back falling into a 
pan filled with medical apparatus.  The driver slips in his own blood.  He is 
chocking spitting blood.  He clutched his chest stretches out his right hand 
for help.  With one last effort he desperately lunges for his attacker.  They 
both hit the ground at the same time.  The driver grips at the white robe.  He 
tries to strangle his attacker, the latter responds in a calm manner, he 
reaches behind him and grabs a saw, he starts swinging the saw at the driver's 
throat.

More blood. 

 The driver still struggles with the man.  The attacker then strikes the 
driver across his face with the saw cracking the driver's temple.  He strikes 
again, again and again until he pulls out his hand and finds a chunk of matter 
on the saw's teeth.  The attacker then hoists the matter up to his face as if 
to examine it.  It was the driver's brain.  The driver has since given up in 
his struggle, falling forward into the laps his murderer.  The latter, now 
sitting in a pool of blood, looks at the chunk of brain matter on his weapon, 
draws his face closer and in a demented gesture, opens his mouth, sticks his 
tongue out and slid it across the weapon.  Tasting the blood and then 
collecting his bounty at the end.  He closes his eyes and begins chewing.

Knock on a door

Pierre
Who is it

Romuald
Is Romi man.  What's up?

Pierre
Comin' man

Solonzo
Hurry man, I got to use your bathroom.

Pierre opens the door and let's the brothers in.  Solonzo flies past him and 
heads for the rest room.

Pierre
Hey, hey get out of there.  Hey (turning to Romuald) what the hell does he 
think that he's doing in there?

Romuald
Dude I don't know but he's been using the shiter everywhere since the club.  

Sound from bathroom.

Pierre
Oh man..

Bathroom door opens.

Solonzo(straightening his pants)
Wheeww!  Dude I thought I was about to die

Pierre
Dude what's wrong with you.. (covers nose)dude what did you eat

Solonzo(holding stomach grimacing)
Man I don't know but I don't feel good.

Romuald(laughing)
Man get your keys and let's get out of here before Pierre kills you man.

Pierre
Not me.  You better get out of here before Lloyd gets here.

Romuald
Oh yeah I forgot.  That's your pimp there

Solonzo(British accent)
Bloody hell, you fellows lack in manner.

Romuald(laughing and putting on same accent)
This is intolerable.  Pierre, go in there and breath in all that funk and when 
you're done call me so I can use the restroom.

Solonzo(playing along)
Oh yes sir Mr.  Lloyd.  Anything you say sir Mr. Lloyd.

Pierre
Very funny. But seriously this the most of you guys I've seen in a long while 
and I must say, now I know why we don't hang out any longer.
     
Romuald(serious)
Com'on man we're just bursting your balls that's all.

Pierre
Yeah, yeah I love you too.  Now beat it 

Solonzo(still jocking)
Its cool dude your boss is in the laundry room anyway

Romuald(smacking Solonzo on the head)
That's enough junior.  Let's break.  We have to go pack anyway.

Solonzo
Ouch

Romuald
Thanks dude.  Anyway, we're out of here.  We catching the early flight 
tomorrow for Babylon.  You know the big concert.  That's where you need to be 
man that's how you get your big break.

Pierre
Thanks for the tip man but I'm staying on campus for the break.  I've got a 
gig with the "Dispatch", plus you know my situation.

Romuald
True, true.  Alright dude, you have a merry Christmas and all that good stuff. 
 Any word from Titus and Randy?

Pierre
No man.  I doubt if I want to know.

Romuald
Cool.

The brothers head out the room.  Lloyd is walking in the room.  

Solonzo(pointing to the initials on the shirt)
What's up L.C


Lloyd
The name is Cambridge, Lloyd Cambridge.

Solonzo
Oh my bad.  What's up.  C..L.C

Lloyd
How interesting, it has the ability to be sarcastic too.  Marvelous.  Now you 
can tackle and be funny at the same time.  Good for you

Solonzo(stepping up on Lloyd)
What?  Hey fuck you man

Romuald(grabbing him)
Com'on junior, don't sweat it

Lloyd
Yeah junior don't sweat it.

Romuald(smiling)
You bored tonight?

Lloyd
I don't know, do you have something in mind

Pierre(standing between the two parties)
OK, OK, everybody keep your pants on.  Guys, I'll talk to you tomorrow.  
Alright?  Take it light fellows, its been a long night.

Romuald
Yeah, you're right.  It has been a long night.

The brothers walk out











ACT II

The boys are in their room.  Just waking up.  Titus' mom is in the kitchen 
cooking.

Titus
Man, I'm hungry as hell.  What's up?

Randy 
Man, I smell the eats dude.  Your mom's whipping up something ugly dude.  
Com'on 

Titus
Shit I got to take a shower first dude.  

Randy
What?

Titus
I said I've got to take a shower first dude don't look at me like that you 
know I ain't going to sit in front of the old bird and have her go off about 
smelling like smokes again.

Randy
True, true I forgot about that.  Well hurry up so I can get in there too.  I'm 
hungry as shit.

Mrs.v(calling from living room)
Boys!  Boys!

Titus
Did you forget to lock the door?

Randy
Man hell no.  I locked everything 

Mrs.V
Boys!

Titus&Randy
Yes ma/ ma'am

Mrs.V
Come here boys

Titus
Coming.  (turning to Randy). What?

Randy(shrugs his shoulders)
Shit if I know.

They head for the living room.  Going past the kitchen. When they walk in, 
they find Mrs. V riveted to the screen.  
On TV screen at the bottom.  Name:  Dr. Herman Von - Aldershmitt, dept. head 
for the School Of Science.  Standing across from him is  the Inspector general 
of Maltese Police.

Titus
Turn the TV up, dad's on TV

Mrs. V
If you were a little less noisy and a little more attentive young man you 
would be able to  hear much better.

Titus
Mom would you please turn the TV up?

She turns the TV up

Titus
Thank you.

He turns to look at his friend. The latter is eating some bacon.

Cut to
Live scene.  Police barriers, reporters, etc

A reporter
Dr. Von - Aldershmitt, is this an accident?

Noran Stamp/ I.G.P(rudely interrupting)
We have reason to believe that the man found on the premises of the morgue was 
murdered.

Reporter(jockeying for position)
Chief inspector, chief inspector can you tell us the identity of the victim?

Stamp
As of this very moment, we have reason to believe that this man was a taxi 
driver for Black Jack Cabs.  We found a taxi parked in the rear of the morgue. 
 Apparently, the cab driver may have been an innocent victim in a deal gone 
wrong.  A case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.


Reporter 2
What prompts your conclusion 

Stamper pauses then answers

Stamp
The victim's taxi was found this morning with the door ajar and the keys still 
in the ignition.  The first detectives at the site noticed that the grass 
behind the vehicle was burned as a result they deduced that the driver had 
gone into the morgue for short period of time and had not intended to stay 
there for along time.

Without any further examination Stamper continued his reports stump button 
edged that from a the victim states the victim had walked in on and startled 
the perpetrator.



Cut to

Back at the residence Titus and Randy were trying to make sense of the entire 
event Titus seemed more perplexed than Randy
Randy
We need to talk dude

Titus
yeah dude c'mon

They head to the back room as the phone starts to ring, its one of Mrs. V's 
friends.  

Mrs.V(she turn and sees the boys heading for the back room)
Hey GloriaI know isn't that awful I hope that doesn't affect our annual gala 
plans.  I have this fabulous dress.(Voice fades)

Meanwhile in the boys room, an argument is heating up.  The music is on to 
serve as a distraction.

Titus
So how are we gonna tell them that we had nothing to do with the murder?

Randy
Well, I was thinking that we kinda didn't have to

Titus
We kinda didn't have to what?  What the hell are you talking about, there's a 
dead body out there and we're the last people to have seen him alive.

Randy
Alright chill out dude no need to get all hysterical man

Titus
Hysterical, hysterical man what is wrong with you?

Randy
Alright man fuck it do whatever you feel like.  After all I ain't the one with 
the high profile parents, my family's image will not be tarnished in any way.

Titus paused and looks at Randy in a pensive way.  His cunning friend might 
actually have a point.  

Randy
I mean think about it dude, what about your scholarship, your chance to go pro

Titus shrugged his shoulders.

Randy
Well even if you could careless about going pro, think about your career.  Do 
you want this to hang over you for ever?  I mean we don't even know if we're 
going to have to go to jail man

Titus is walking around the room waving his finger no.

Titus
Man you know what, you might be the one who needs to chill out.  No one is 
going to jail.

Randy looks confused.  

Titus
And you know why no one is going to jail?   Its because we ain't done shit.  
How about that?  You see we took a cab just like any other person would.  It 
just so happened that the cab we took ended up dead

Randy
Just like any other person right.
How many people you know take cabs and the drivers end up dead?  Tell me that?

Titus
Dude there is no time for your petty sarcasm, I'm being for real here.  
We're.

Randy looked at his friend shaking his head vigorously.

Titus
Well I am going to tell the chief Inspector what happened and our names will 
be cleared.  They can go catch their killer and we can go on with our lives as 
planned.

Randy
And how are you going to explain beating up an officer?  Hun?  I suppose 
you'll explain that as well and be on your way again.  Living your life as 
planned right.

Titus realized that there was a lot more involved with his confession plans 
than he realized.

Randy (back in control)
So do you know how much time people do in jail for assaulting an officer?  You 
see by keeping your big mouth shut, you stay out of trouble you know why? 
(Randy is pacing around with his hands behind his back and his head down)  
Because the cop we jumped is a rookie and he ain't going to say a word to his 
counterparts because he doesn't want to be embarrassed.  Plus, (he brandishes 
his right index finger) he really doesn't know who attacked him and he only 
saw you from behind for most parts but he definitely recognized the type of 
cab that we got into.  So by you going on your goody two shoes crusade, you 
give the rookie a chance to win his purple heart because then all he would 
have to do is reformat the story to his credit whereby he would identify the 
whole lot of us as the people who attacked him, kidnapped a cab and murdered 
the driver for all his cash.  Now then Rich boy (he walks right up to Titus, 
staring him down) you sure about the part where everyone goes back to living 
their lives as planned?

Titus stunned, crushed, defeated and frightened.  
There is a knock on the door, it was Mrs. V., she extends the phone to Titus. 
 

Mrs.V
You boys are OK?

Randy
Yes ma'am.

Mrs.V
Well come on and eat.  Food's getting cold.

Randy(putting on a smile)
Be right out.

Mrs.V(walking out)
And turn that music down a little.

Randy(following her to shut the door)
Yes ma'am

Mrs.V heads out.  Titus answers the phone.  Phone conversation.  Back and 
forth screen


Titus(hesitating)
Hello

Romuald
What the hell happened man.

Titus
Nothing dude.  We don't know what the hell happened.  Ok, we

Randy snatched the phone from his friend.

Randy
Yeah man we rode the cab to the flats, paid the fucker and that was it.  All 
this is news to us as well

Romuald
What happened to Titus?

Randy
What?

Romuald
What happened to Titus?  I want the real story so put him back on the phone

Randy (as he stretched the phone over)
That's what happened man.  And I don't appreciate you calling me a liar 
either.

Titus
Dude, we pulled the cab up to the morgue right, and we pulled the freshman 
stunt but that's it.  We didn't even know what was going on this morning till 
my mom said something.

Romuald
So what's up, you're going to tell the officers what you know right?

Titus didn't comment.

Romuald
Dude, you're going to tell the officers right?

Titus remained speechless again

Romuald
Man, don't listen to that fool dude.  You have to tell the officers before 
someone comes up with some stupid story.  Plus you know that dude Günter 
man..

Titus
Awshit

Romuald
Who knows man he might be interviewing himself as we speak

Titus
Dude let me call you back and I'll tell you what's up later

Randy is standing in the corner looking on.  .  Titus clicks off the phone. 

Randy
Dude, what's going on?

Titus
Look Rome (Romuald), Doesn't know where Pierre is.  They called his room and 
he wasn't there

Randy
Awfuck

Titus (pointing at the door)
Shhhhhhh.

Randy
Man I swear I'll kill that bastard myself if he says a word.  I'm tired of 
fucking with him.  Man I'm telling you, that's your boy and you better tell 
him to stay out of this and keep our names clear of the news or else

Titus
Or else what?  You're going to kill him?  You're already a murder suspect..

Randy
Well so are you..

Titus
At least I'm not giving anyone any reason to believe that I could actually be 
a murderer, or am I?

Randy
Man, what are you saying ?

Titus
I'm saying..

Right at that there was a knock on the door.  It was Mrs. V calling the boys. 
 There had been a breakthrough in the story and it was on the news.  The boys 
dashed pass Mrs. V toward the living room.

Cut to; Live scene

Reporter
We are here at the scene of the most gruesome murder this city has witnessed 
since the days of mass genocide against witches and soothsayers.  Yes just as 
the town was readying itself for some peace and quiet during the Christmas 
break.  More bodies went missing from the morgue and now this.  Fear not, 
there is hope..


The three figures stood quiet and at the same time impatient.  They kept 
staring at the screen occasionally looking at each other.  
The reporter was the anchor man for channel 11.  Rumor around town had it that 
he was loosing his mind.   He always opposed the University and all it stood 
for.

Reporter turns to call someone
  
A skinny, shabbily dressed man comes forward.  He's very poorly groomed in his 
late fifties, he speaks with a raspy voice.  Camera zooms on his forearm, he 
has a tattoo of a buxom lady wrapped around an anchor.  

Reporter
Yes ladies and gentlemen, justice will prevail.  Here is the hero of the hour. 
 This is the person that is going to crack this whole case open.

A look of confusion on Titus and Randy's face

Mrs.V
What the hell is he babbling about this time.  Oops, scuse my French.  That 
guy is an idiot to say the least.  He's on this apocalyptic crusade and I 
don't even know why he's still on the air anyway.  

Titus
Mom shuss

Cut to: the scene


Reporter
"Here is the only eye witness to the murder.  Yes folks he saw the murder, yes 
he saw the gruesome murder unfold.  He saw all the members of the cult who 
took part in the macabre murder and even though he is afraid for his life, he 
has decided that he could not and would not stand by and let the foreigners 
violate the security of this peaceful town.  Come forward and tell them for 
yourself.


The reporter sticks the microphone in the face of the  non expecting witness. 
 The latter seemed at a loss of words.  He is confused.
Witness
Ah. My name is Liam, Liam O'Toole, the night watch at the morgue.  I saw them 
when they pulled up and

At that very moment the chief of police appeared on screen.  He snatched the 
microphone from the witness.  He turned and faced the reporter.

Stamp
This is a crime scene and you have no right to make this interview.  There is 
no legitimacy in this interview.  Any new witness in this case must be 
interrogated by the police department prior to any public interview if any at 
all.  You have jeopardized the life of this witness and in the process botched 
an ongoing investigation.

Reporter
Wait just a minute here, I have journalistic rights also and I know that you 
do not under any circumstance interfere with the people's right to know and 
the people want to know.  The people want to know what danger lurks out there 
at night.  The people want to kno..

Stamp(pointing at the camera man)
Get that thing out of my face.  That's it you're going down to the station

Reporter(beginning to fight off the officers)
Wait a minute here under what charges am I being arrested?  I have committed 
absolutely no crime.  A crime is being committed against me and the people of 
Malta

Stamp(knocking the camera down)
Take them away.  You're under arrest for withholding evidence in a criminal 
investigation.  And you (pointing at the witness), you must report at then 
police station for questioning you can either come on your own accord or you 
may the city's finest escort your to the best hotel in town, get it?

O'Toole
Yes sir I'll be there sir, no need for your escort service sir, I have my own 
transportation and it'll do just fine.  I'll be there this evening before my

Come on T.

Mrs.V
I don't care much for what you do outside this house but if you think for one 
second that you're going to bring in here whatever goes on out there, you're 
sadly mistaking.

Randy
Sorry 'bout that Mrs.V., .  He's trip'n that's all

Mrs.V
Maybe you need some fresh air then.

Listen here man.  This ain't the time to fold dude.  What we need to do is try

So we can find out what he actually saw.

Titus

Its Pierre standing in front of the elevator.  He sees them.

Pierre
Hey guys, I was just on my way to your place did you see the news?

Randy(looking at the other people in the lobby)
What?  What about the news?  What's on the fucking news?

Pierre
Woof, Woof, someone put a leash on that one.  Man, what's your problem dude?  
You seem a bit jumpy there, you all right?

Randy
"Jumpy?  Jumpy?  Man do you know that I don't like you?  Jumpy who you calling 
jumpy?"

All right ladies lets keep our wigs on OK.  Now what's so important on the 
news, you won student writer of the year?

Pierre
No dude, the cab we took last night was found dead in the ..

Both Titus and Randy rushed him before he could finish, they lifted him up by 
each armpit into the garage.

 Wow, wow, wow, what are you trying to say? What do you mean we were the last 
to ride with him?

Pierre
What?  I never said a word about you guys being the last to ride.. man would 
you paranoid baboons let me go.  What the heck is wrong with you two.

Titus and Randy realized that they were overacting and they also realized that 
Pierre didn't really know what was going on.  They dropped him and decided to 
leave things as they were.

Titus(putting on a fake smile and patting Pierre on the head)
My man P, well I guess we gotcha again, man we were only messing with you but 
yeah dude we've got to run and we'll be at the diner late on tonight so meet 
us there.  We can talk about all this crap before Rome and Solonzo leave for 
the holidays OK?  We'll see you then.

Pierre 
Hey they're

They started running off never waiting for Pierre's answer.  He tried to stop 
them but they just kept on running.  
 Pierre turns and heads back for the elevator.  something isn't right.  He 
presses the number six.  This was the floor on which Titus and his family 
lived.  The elevator opens and Pierre heads for number seventy-six.  

Door bell rings

Pierre
Good afternoon Mrs.  V, I was looking for the boys.  We were suppose to meet 
at the dinner this afternoon but they didn't show so I decided to check on 
them.

Mrs.  V
Well Pierre, I have no idea where those boys are.  We were all watching the 
news about the murder and the eyewitness guy came on and there was this whole 
fiasco and they took off running.  Where?  I don't know.

Pierre
I didn't know that there was an eyewitness?

Mrs.  V
Sure, Pierre my boy are you losing your touch? (Pierre smiles.  She turns to 
fix herself a drink)  Well it's the night watchman at the morgue.  To tell you 
the truth, he gives me the creep.  I don't know if he did it himself.  I 
wouldn't be surprised you know?

She turns around and there is no one there to speak to.  Pierre is gone.  Mrs.

I don't know!  This watchman guy has thrown an entirely new spin on this thing 
and if he saw us, he definitely saw the murderer and I want to know who that 
person is because it's definitely not me.

Randy
It ain't me either!

Darkness is falling on the little town.
The boys make it to their friends dorm room.  
The Pacheco brothers are on their out to the airport.  The shuttle is leaving.

Randy(running after the shuttle) 
Wait, hey wait, you can't leave

Titus
Man they're out man.

Randy
Fuck

Titus
Easy dude, easy let's head on to the morgue.  We still have time.

Randy
Man, let's call that dude before he leaves.

Titus
What?  What for?

Randy
Have you forgotten that he's suppose to speak with the chief inspector this 
evening?

Titus
I just said that.  What do we want to call him for?

Randy(pulling change out of his pocket)
We're calling him to make sure that he knows that some reporters are on their 
way to talk to him.


Randy heads toward the phone booth and starts dialing.  


Randy
Is this the switchboard?  OK, I need the morgue please.  Yes, yes, this is MBC 
on channel 11.  thank you.


Titus is looking on baffled.

Titus
What the fuck are you doing?  You know the number to the morgue.  You're pre-
med remember


Randy pushes his friend away from the booth, then pulls a handkerchief out of 
his pocket and covers his mouth with the handkerchief.

Randy
Mr.  O'toole, please.

Voice at the other end of line
O'toole, is late as usual.  Who's this?  He doesn't come in for another hour 
and half.  

Randy
May you ask who's speaking?  This is the Inspector general of police, chief 
inspector Stamp.  Now I must speak to Mr. Liam O'Toole at once.  He was 
suppose to come down to the precinct for an interview.  However, for security 
reasons, I want him to stay put at the morgue.  I will be there to speak to 
him in person.  Now, have I satisfied your inquiry Mr.?

Voice at the other end of line
Loki, loki's what they call me around here sir.  And I would make it a point 
to inform Mr.  Liam of your instructions sir.

Randy
Well do so and remember, your country is counting on you.  Tell me Mr.  Loki, 
are you a patriot?

Loki(sticking his chest out and saluting)
Yes sir,  I am.  Sir I fought in the second world war and.

Randy(laughing)
And you will do what it takes to keep danger away from your country's shores 
at all cost so do as you've been told and everything will  be well.  I'm on my 
way.

Randy hang up the telephone.  Titus was not amused 

Titus
You know what your problem is?  You play too much.

Titus walks off.  Randy stands there for a while then follows

Cut to

Pierre(tearing through his things in his room)
Where the hell is that body mike?

Lloyd(lying down with his headphones on and a packed suitcase at his feet)
What are you doing?

Pierre(still looking)
Just looking for this mike.

Lloyd(pulling one ear off)
Still hunting that Pulitzer story I presume

Pierre(grabs a string and starts pulling)
Ah, ha.  I don't know about Pulitzer but I know that this could mean going 
home for Christmas instead of staying in this dump.

Lloyd
Struck it rich Mr.  Günter? 

Pierre(heading out)
You can say so.  The watchman at the morgue saw the murderer.  He was on the 
news.  Its my story.

Cut to

The guys arrive at the morgue.
Titus
Mr.  O'Toole, Mr.  Liam O'toole, Mr.  O'Toole, we're here to speak to you 
about the incident last night.

Liam(coming up from behind them holding a riffle)
What do you devils want?  I know you, you're the guys from yesterday.  You're 
with that guy and you're trying to kill me.  Its like Loki said, the chief 
inspector was right.  You're all trying to kill me.

Liam is very agitated. He pokes Randy in the back. 

Titus(turning around with his hands up)
Wow, Easy dude.  We're here to talk to you.  That's all.

Liam
Take one more step and you'll feel right at home.

Randy(calm but shaky voice)
Sir. Please put that weapon down.  You're drunk and I can smell it.  We could 
have a serious accident on our hands here.  You don't want to make a silly 
mistake now do you?

Liam(jerking gun into Randy's back)
Shut up.  You walk toward the back.  You think I don't know what's going on!

The boys walk.  Titus is ahead followed by Randy and Liam is behind them.
 The hall way is poorly lit, the fluorescent tube light keeps flashing on and 
off  making O'Toole even more agitated.  They approach the back room.  Titus 
turns left to enter the room.  

Liam
Don't go trying anything funny in there sonny jim or it's your friend's arse.

Gun fight

As O'Toole speaks, he leans forward.  When Randy feels the increasing pressure 
in his back, he spins sharply to the left, into the back room entry way, 
causing O'Toole to fall forward.  As the latter does so, Randy quickly grabs 
the nose of the riffle and jerks it upright.  O'Toole is taken by surprise.  
The last thing he expected was this entire situation to go wrong.  His body 
instinctively followed the direction of the riffle.  Titus is still in the 
back room with his hands over his head.  He is oblivious to the on going 
battle in the hall way.  Then suddenly a gun shot.  In the mist of their 
struggle, the riffle goes off.  Titus panics.
Titus heads for the door.
Another shot goes off.  
Titus freezes in his tracks.
He resumes running toward the door, the hall way light is flashing and all he 
can see are glimpses of people's figures.  One of which is on the ground, and 
the other standing over him.

Liam
I knew you were trying to kill me, you bastard.  I'm not scared of you!

Randy
What the hell are you talking about?  No one is trying to kill you.  We came 
to talk to you

Liam
Talk to me?  Talk to me?  I don't hear you talking

Titus walks out of the room with his hands up

Titus
Don't shoot!  Don't shoot, I can explain everything, it was

Titus is surprised as his eyes adjusted to the flashing light.  The gunman is 
not O'toole, it is Randy.

Titus
Randy, alright dude let's get out of here man.

Randy
Non dude, this jerk tried to kill me and I want to know why?

Liam
I tried to kill you?  You are the one's that are wanted not me.  I saw you 
that night, (Randy lowered the riffle) yeah.. you're surprised han?  You 
didn't think anyone had seen you that night well, I saw you.

Titus
Man, you got it all wrong, we were there that night but we didn't kill anyone.

Randy(nervously pointing the riffle at the other two)
Why the fuck are you trying to pin this on us?  We ain't do nothing

Liam
I know what I saw and I saw you and you,(pointing at Randy and Titus), running 
out of the morgue that night.

Randy(pointing the riffle at O'toole)
You didn't see shit

Titus grabs at the barrel of the riffle and pulled it up from O'toole.  The 
riffle went off again.

Randy
What the hell are you doing man?

Titus
I thought you were going to do something stupid!

While the two friends are arguing, O'Toole ceases the opportunity to run into 
the back office.  The boys realize and give chase but the old man has already 
turned the lock on the door.  They try to force the door open but it is to no 
avail.

Titus
Open the door, we're not gonna hurt you!

The boys try to catch their breath, and sound assuring but no one answers on 
the other side of the door.

Titus
O'Toole, open the door, please.  I promise we're not going to hurt you.

Randy(he shoves his shoulder into the door)
Open the fucking door 

There is no response from O'Toole.

Randy 
Open this door or I'll shout it open..

Titus
Shhhhhhh

Randy
Now what?

Titus
Listen fuck, he's on the phone with the officers. 

Liam(on the other side)
Help, they're trying to kill me.  Help please help me.  Its them.  Its two of 
them.. I don't know where the other one is

Titus
Let's Break

The boys take to their heels.  They frantically ran out of the building 
dashing across the street to the campus diner.  Theybarge into the diner and 
sit at the corner table looking back at the morgue. 

Waitress
May take your order?

Randy (still looking out the window)
Non! We're straight

Waitress
You sure?  Looks to me like you've worked up quite a thirst there, you're 
really sweating you know?

Titus
And?

Waitress
Hey don't get foul with me young man, here, it's simple.  You order or you 
leave.  So, what's it going to be?

Randy
Man com' on, let's get out of here, let's go to '12/7'.  This place sucks 
anyway.  Plus, it's almost time to go pick up Lydia

The boys walk out of the café and headed to the north end of the campus.  
There is another café at that end of the campus.  This one was notoriously 
known for its student clientele and it's extremely provocative waitresses.  
One of which was Randy's girlfriend Nanette.  
They arrive at the café.

Cut to 

Pierre is going up the stairs of the morgue.  The door is opened wide.  He 
walks in everything is in disarray.  

Pierre
Hello!  Is anybody here?  Hello, I'm with the campus press and I need to speak 
to the night watchman..  hello.  Hello.


He walks up to the security booth.  The two way radio is behind the booth but 
no one is in there.  Pierre keeps calling out to anyone without ever getting a 
response.  He make a right turn onto the hall way that lead to the back room. 
   As he walks he noticed the lights flashing on and off.  He keeps walking in 
the dark.  Suddenly he steps on a piece of glass.  The glass brakes under his 
foot.  He maneuvers around that piece of glass only to step onto another 
piece.  Pierre looks down at the ground and realized that there are piece of 
shattered glass all over the ground.  His feet were barely coming off the 
ground.  He is closing in on the brake room, it was on his left.  Pierre puts 
his hand up against the wall and feels his way up to the door as his hand is 
running smoothly against the wall.  Suddenly he feels a hole in the wall.  He 
makes it to the back room.  No one is there.  There is one last room to check 
on this wing and that is the security guards' lounge.  As Pierre approached 
the last door, he noticed footprint marked on the door.  He grabs the door 
handle, turns it.  Pierre opens the door and wedges his face through the 
slight opening, no sign of danger.  

Pierre 
Hello.. is anybody here.

No one answers.  Pierre walks into the room the phone is off the hook.  He 
wonders what is going on?  There is a draft coming in from the back of the 
room.  He looks in the direction of the draft.  It's from a window cracked 
open.  Pierre walks toward the window to shut it.  He reaches forward with his 
left arm contouring a coat rack.  Pierre grabs the edge of the window and 
begins pushing down.  The window does not budge he pushes down harder, still 
no progress.  Pierre tries to move the coat rack in order to use both arms.  
The window still doesn't budge.  He is determined to shut the window down.  
Pierre reaches around the rack with his right arm to push down.  He touches 
something soft and before he can assess what he is touching he feels sharp 
teeth come down on his right index finger.  Pierre pulls back, loses his 
balance and hits the deck all at once.  At the same time, a black cat jumps 
down from the window ledge into the room.  It lands on Pierre's chest then 
pounced off out of the room.  

Pierre(rubbing on his chest)
Oh shit, shit, shit, shit

Pierre sits up and tried desperately to gather his thoughts.  He reached for 
the coat rack, pulls himself up to his feet and turns around only to be met by 
the fixed stare of an onlooker sitting in the corner.  Pierre's jaw drops, he 
freezes in his stance immobilized by the sight before him.  It's a corpse.  
White female mid forties.  Pierre begins feeling nauseous and scrambles for 
his inhaler.  Pierre pumps once, twice finally he breathes.  Pierre takes off 
running out of the room.   He struggles out of the room and back into the 
poorly lit hallway, he bumps into a cart, causing an arm to fall out and grab 
him around his left thigh.  Pierre spins away from the body only to fall onto 
another cart.  There's no body on this cart but the wheels at the base of the 
cart are not locked in and this causes the cart to spin off forward sending 
Pierre to the ground once again.  He stretches out his hands to break his 
fall.  Upon contact, he feels a sharp pain surge through his body his hand 
lands on a piece of glass.  Pierre immediately rolls to his side to alleviate 
the pain from his palm.  He pulls the piece of glass out of his palm and wraps 
his hand with a handkerchief, gets up and walks toward the lab at the other 
end of the corridor.  He sees some motion through the opaque glass.  This is 
it, this is what he's here for  a story- Pierre pulls out his camera, turns 
on the flash and approaches the lab door.  There's some music playing in the 
lab.  Pierre opens the lab door and sees an attendant in a robe.  He walks up 
on the person.  This person is standing over a body,  it appeared as if he is 
 draining blood from the corpse a little saw is sitting to his right.  Besides 
the corpse is a sink linked to various chemicals.  

Pierre
Excuse me!  Hey excuse me I'm looking for the night watch.

No response.  Pierre keeps on walking toward the attendant.  He approaches the 
man, taps him on the shoulder and as the man turns he noticed that the latter 
is removing an implant from the corpse's breast.  

Pierre 
I'm sorry didn't mean to startle you

Man/ w face mask(drops implant)
Oh my I didn't hear you come in.

Pierre(looking at the implant)
I'm sorry to disturb you but I'm looking for the night watchman

Man(bending over to pick up implant)
Why?  I mean I'm sorry.the night watchman you say, I haven't seen him.

The man is unable to pick up the rather slippery implant so he resorts to 
stabbing the implant with a prong and picking it up.

Man(dropping implant in a sink)
Sorry about that.  Can I help you with anything?

Pierre gives no answer instead he looks into the man's eyes.  

Man( looking perturbed and disoriented)
What the hell are you doing here?  Who the hell are you?  Looking for the 
night watchman hey?

Pierre(stepping backward)
Hey calm down Mr., and could you not point that thing at me? (referring to the 
surgical blade)  I heard someone in here and I wanted to come in and ask a few 
questions.

Liam(waving the weapon at Pierre)
I asked who the hell you were? 

Pierre
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.  My name is Günter, Pierre.  I am with the tribune and I 
am covering the story about the murder that took place in this morgue.  You 
know what I'm referring to right?
man changed his composure.  

Pierre
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name!

Man
That's because I never told you my name.  And by the way I'm the one asking 
the questions around here got it?  Now this tribune thing of yours, how much 
is it paying?

Pierre
It depends.  What do you know?  Are you pre-med?  (looking and pointing at the 
blade )

Man(hesitating slightly)
Yeah, I'm doing some work uh, on my own.  You know how it is try to get ahead 
of class and stuff(acting ever so friendly)

Pierre
Yeah, yeah I know just what you're talking about, you have to work hard to get 
ahead of the competition.  You know what I mean(referring to himself, Pierre 
points at his camera and positions it for a snap shot), by the way, what year 
are you?

Man(becoming apprehensive again)
Oh, I'm just a first year student!

Pierre
And you're aloud to work in the lab already?

Man(frustrated/takes mask off.  Its Liam )
Look here Mr., something tells me that you're not here for the murder story 
after all.  What do you want here?  Who are you looking for?  Did you come out 
here to investigate me hun?  You with that damned Stamp right?

Pierre(looking confused and scared at Lim's aggressive behavior)
Stamp, who is Stamp?  Hey Mr.  Maybe we have a misunderstanding, I'll just go 
now.  I really do not know what you're talking about.  I just came here to 
cover the story on you and to see what happened with Titus and Randy.(Liam 
stop following Pierre.  He began to wonder how Pierre knew who he was)  Seems 
to me you're a little paranoid about your little project back there
Liam(dashing toward a switch on the wall and depressing it)
And seems to me as if you know a lot more than you're letting on lad?(Pierre 
tries to unlock the door behind him but it wouldn't move).  You're with those 
other two(Liam is walking back toward the middle of the aisle.  He picks up a 
hatchet looking device.  Pierre sees him).  You're here to try to kill me two. 
 Well not today lad.

Pierre
Hey there, no one is here to kill anyone

Pierre turns around and struggles with the door again.  It doesn't budge.  By 
the time he turns around, Liam is charging toward him in an instant, Pierre 
dives behind one of the beds.  He is quickly back up to his feet.  Liam is 
giving chase.  As Liam make the turn, Pierre who is under the table retracts 
his steps and rolls back underneath the first table and across the floor over 
to the opposite aisle and underneath another table.  His breathing is frantic 
but he's trying to keep it down the best he can.  Meanwhile Liam is on the 
other side babbling incoherently.

Liam
Yeah, see, everything was just fine that night.  I came in to get the bodies 
like he told me to, I knew it when it all went down last night.  I told him 
I'd bring it to him but no, here come the other two last night.  That's when I 
left.  See I knew they'd try to get me like that poor fellow last night.  
Everything was suppose to go according to plan.  Then come that loud mouth 
reporter guy see.  I figured that's how I'd get my money since he didn't want 
to pay up, I told him I'd tell the officers the whole thing.  But no, that guy 
had to throw a wrench in my fucking program.

Pierre reaches into his pocket and pulls out a recorder and starts taping.  As 
he looks for a place to hide the recorder, he notices the source of all the 
electrical cables in the lab.  Pierre decides to retrace his steps to the 
source and turn off the power.  

Liam
What you do that for?  Fat boy!  You buying yer'self some time here?  Come on 
out and old Liam and you talk it over, hun, what do you say?

No answer.  Liam starts throwing the beds around.

Liam
Oh well fuck it. See I have it all figured out now.  After your dead, I'll go 
call the officers.  Oops, I already did that.  Ha all I have to do is tell 
them that you and your friends attacked me and in self defense I killed you 
but the others got away.  They'll get arrested, and I'll walk.  Now,  how's 
that for a plan?

Liam flipped the last table on that side.  There's nothing there.
Liam is surprised.  He heads for the other aisle.  In a big rage, Liam dashed 
toward the opposite aisle and rammed the beds together in no particular 
format.  Pierre realized that Liam is approaching.  
Liam rams the tables.
 Pierre scoots over to the corner, pins himself against the wall and looks up. 
 
Above him is a panel of switches.  He jumps up and starts turning the switches 
in all the opposite directions.  Liam sees him and dashes toward him with his 
weapon brandished high in the air.  Pierre hit the first switch nothing 
happens.  
Liam is closing in on Pierre.  
Pierre hits a succession of switches in any direction.  Several things come on 
and off .  
The lab's mainframe goes off, the air suction tank comes on whistling 
everywhere.  Liam is five feet away from Pierre.  
Pierre grabs his rosary cross and just stands there petrified.  Just at that 
moment, the hose to which the air tank is connected, swings violently lashing 
Liam O'Toole in the face.  

Liam(grabbing his face/blood)
Ah, your dead, your fucking dead I'm telling you

The air hose leaves a deep gash across his face.  Pierre hits the last switch. 

Lab is totally dark except for light from the hallway.

Liam crying out loud.  Liam palmed his face screaming obscenities.  

Pierre runs back across the aisle.  .  Liam follows.  He stumbles across the 
aisle, falls into a pan of surgical tools.  He grabs at the first thing.  
Pierre is in the dark.   Pierre tries to stand up to see where Liam is.  He 
slips in the spilled silicone solution, causing him to drop to the floor. 
 Liam hears the fall.  He swings a fork like instrument and hits the wall, 
Pierre reaches for his camera and points it toward Liam O'Toole and snaps 
three consecutive shots of the assailant.  Liam is blinded.  Pierre jumps up. 
 The two men start to wrestle.  Pierre tries to tackle O'Toole at the waist 
but he slips.  O'Toole capitalizes on this error.  He landed an elbow flush 
into Pierre's back.  Pierre let go his grip.  O'Toole spins him around and 
tries to reach for yet another weapon. 

Hissing sound of the air hose in background.

The two men battled each other out.  One driven by anger and the other driven 
by fear.  The hose keeps swinging around, and all of a sudden, it strikes 
Pierre in the back.  This drives him forward into O'Toole.  Pierre falls on 
the ground,  O'Toole stumbles back, as Pierre looks up at the man who is about 
to take his life.  O'Toole's kicks him across his face turning his face into 
one of the bed posts.  

Then, nothing.  

Pierre slowly turns around to see what O'Toole is waiting for to finish him 
off.  As he looks out of the corner of his eye, he notices O'Toole's feet 
dangling off the edge of the table.  Pierre slowly rises to his feet.  He only 
then notices a sound from O'Toole.  This was the sound of a meat cleaver.    
Pierre slowly rises to his feet and looks up only to see Liam O'Toole lying on 
his back gutted out from his throat down to his naval.  There's a rotary 
cutter protruding from his chest.  The cutter seems jammed.  Pierre comes 
closer and the machine begins spinning again causing O'Toole to spin his body 
upward ripping through his chest.  As the devise spin backward, it pulls 
O'Toole's body backward.  A tear drop runs out of the corner of O'Toole's 
agonizing face.  

Liam(gargling blood)
Please. Make it ..stop.   Please.  Please

Pierre(approaching)
I. I .I'm sorry.

Pierre heads for the switch panel and turns a series of switches on and off.  

The lights come on, the air tank goes out and so does the cutter.  Pierre 
turns in shock.  There is blood all over the walls.  O'Toole is lying there 
with his intestines exposed and mangled in the blade.  Pierre reaches for his 
inhaler but he can not find it.  He starts running out of the lab.  He crushes 
into the doors but they are still shut.  There's a red switch right next to 
O'Toole's still body Pierre makes his way back to the body, reaches over 
O'Toole and presses the switch.  Suddenly, he feels a grab on his wrist, it's 
O'Toole in his death grip.  


Pierre(in panic)
Oh, Oh shit.(he pulls away)  let go.. (he falls and finally brakes the 
grip)

As suddenly as it happened, it was over.  Pierre watches O'Toole's arm slump 
to the side.  
O'Toole's hand opens, Pierre sees his rosary in the man's hand.  Pierre 
reaches and pulls the latter out of the dead man's hand.   Pierre backs out of 
the lab stumbling on beds and stepping over corpses.  He makes it into the 
hallway.

He hears the distinct sound of sirens coming toward him.  

Cut to;  approaching police cars.  Sirens and lights.

Stamp(in one car/passenger)
Com'on, step on it.  I can't believe you

Officer(driving)
I didn't take the call sir.  I can assure you I would have relayed it to you

Stamp
How do you get a 911 and think it's a prank call?  Tell me?  I'm waiting.

 

Cut to; back to Pierre

Pierre stalls for a minute looks through the front doors and grabs the door 
handle.  He can see the police vehicles approaching.  
He stops.  Steps back.  Pierre backtracks his steps and runs out of the 
building through the loading entry.  Pierre clutches his chest he's having an 
asthma attack.  He digs his hand into his pocket to grab his inhaler.  It's 
not there.  

Cut to; camera shot of inhaler in the on the ground in the lab.

Cut to; back to Pierre.

Pierre
f-u-c-k, 

Pierre freezes in his tracks, looking back at the morgue.  Pierre heard the 
police officers approach the rear of the building.  Pierre runs through the 
woods that separate the dorms from the rest of the school.  
He heads for his dorm.  He sees it in the distance. 
Officers walk outside the back door.  Noise from the bushes.

Officer(with flash light)
Who's there?  You hear something.

Officer2(pulling out flashlight)
What?  I don't hear a thing.


Cut to back inside the morgue

Stamp and the forensic team are at work.

Guy(taking pictures)
Wow!  What the fuck happened here?  Damn did you see that?

Stamp(putting on gloves)
What do you think happened?  Another murder.

Officer(from across the room)
Found something!  

Stamp walks over to the officer.

Stamp
Looks like an inhaler.  Get some prints on that, will you

Guy(taking pictures)
Hey boss, check this out.

He opens the corpse's hand.  There is an imprint in his palm.  The man takes 
pictures of the palm.

Stamp
What's that?

Guy
I don't know boss but he must have been holding on to something really badly.

Stamp squats and looks on the floor.  He's holding a pen and brushing it on 
the floor.

Officer(walking in)
Got the positive ID on the body.  Its Liam O'Toole.

Stamp
Who?  

Officer
The witness?

Stamp
I know who the corpse is you idiot, I told you to get me some lab work on that 
inhaler.

Officer
Got that too.

Cut to

On the other side of the campus, Randy and Titus just walk into 12/7.  Nanette 
is waiting on one of the last customers in the restaurant.  She suddenly jumps 
from her bending stance.  She feels Randy's hand  grabbing at her ass.  She 
turned with a frown on her face but that gives way to a smile.  
The two guys head to the back of the room and sit at the corner table.  
The manager knows them.  He waves.  Randy waves back.  Titus keeps looking at 
his watch nervously.  Randy signals Nannette pointing at his watch nervously. 
 Nanette looks in the boys direction shrugging her shoulders.  Randy signals 
Nanette to tell the customer that the café is closed.  She points to the neon 
sign outside the window and it read, 
"12/7, we serve till the very last customer".

Store manager(throwing on his coat)
Nanette, I'm gone so close up.  OK!

Nanette looks at the tall lanky man as he threw on his overcoat.

Store manager(half way out of the door)
And by the way randy, that thing over there(pointing at the counter) is used 
to serve coffee  and food for our customers. Not for other activities, if you 
know what I mean?

Randy smiles looking at Nanette

Randy starts getting loud as soon as the manager is gone.

Customer
I'll have a cup of coffee please

Nannette
Anything else?

Customer( looking through menu)
Hmmmm. No nothing.  Thanks

The customer drops some coins on the table, grabs his hat and walks out.  As 
Nanette turned off the open sign and switched on the closed one, Randy walks 
up behind her and started groping at her.  

Nanette(looking at Titus in the corner)
What's the matter Titus?

Titus stares straight out the window toward the morgue.  He can see some 
police lights in the distance as well as hear the faint sound of sirens.  
Titus keeps  staring.  Suddenly he turns.  Nanette is sitting directly across 
from him.

Nanette
So, you want to tell me what the, matter is?

Titus
Oh, believe me you don't want to know.

Nanette
Try me for size

Randy
Hey, hey that's my job and I thing you fit just fine.

Nanette
Well I'd be the judge of that!

Titus chuckles at Randy.  Randy is not amusing.

Nanette
 No, I'm just kidding, that's my baby though(hugging Randy as she spoke) but 
for real though, what's wrong with you T?

Police wagon blows past the café.  Randy ducks on to her lap.  Titus takes a 
sip from an empty cup.  
Nanette.(pointing at both guys.)
What are you doing?

Titus
You want to know what's going on?  Well you'll find out, don't worry you'll 
definitely find out and it'll be all too soon

Nanette(lifting Randy's head up from her lap)
Boy what's going on

Randy
What do you mean what is going on?  I don't know.  You weren't talking to me 
ask him.  Shit

Titus
Man don't start with me again.  If it wasn't for you, we will not be in this 
mess in the first place.

Randy
Dude I know you ain't just say that to me for real.

Nanette
Is any one going to tell me what the hell is going on in here? (the boys are 
mute)  Does Lydia know anything about this?  Or is she in the dark like me?

Titus jumps up.

Titus(pointing to his watch)
Oh crap, I almost forgot it's past time to pick her up.  Man I have to go.

Nanette
 No, no T, wait, let me close up and we'll go with you.  Ain't that right 
baby.

Randy gives a thumbs up.

Titus (directing his comments to Randy)
I'm sure you guys have better things to do so that's ok, I'll be alright.  
I'll talk to you guys later.

Nanette (turning off the lights in the café.)
And you, call girls petty!  Come on guys get over it.  You know you're gonna 
be talking to each other before long anyway so why don't you act as if it were 
now?

Titus doesn't say a word instead he glances at Randy, smiles and walks out the 
front door.  Nanette stands up and points Randy to the door.

Randy
What?

As Randy walks pass Nanette she smacks him in the back of the head, Randy 
turns
Nanette grabs him by the balls, firmly at first then She softly caressed them. 
 Randy slams her into the wall and kisses her hard.  

Cut to

Pierre(bursting into the room)
Hey Lloyd!  What you doing here?

Lloyd
Well, well if it isn't the Pulitzer prize winner, Mr.  Günter.  What's the 
matter with you now?

Pierre 
None of your business

Lloyd 
Well pardon my intrusion in your exiting life.  Oh by the way, this happens to 
be my room.. at least for a few more hours.

Pierre(feeling apologetic)
I'm sorry Lloyd, I lost it, it's just that I have so much on my mind and I 
shouldn't have done that

Lloyd reaches into the liquor cabinet under the study desk and pulls out a 
bottle of Chivas-Regal.  He ignores Pierre.  Pierre in the mean time is 
scrambling for his clothes, gathering them in no particular manner.  Lloyd 
sits on Pierre's bed interrupting the latter from packing up his belongings.

Lloyd
So, what's the big rush?  Why the last ferry to Paris is leaving the dock?

Pierre(in a very aggressive manner)
You know what, I'm not in the mood, OK.  Today just ain't the day for this 
shit so why don't you just back up?

Lloyd 
How rude Mr.  Günter, I see you've been wallowing about with those hooligan 
friends of yours again.  Well I do hope that this is but a phase of rebellion 
in your ever so pathetic life.

Pierre turns around points his finger at Lloyd, Lloyd stands up, grabs Pierre 
by the hand and bites down on his finger.  Pierre strikes Lloyd on the head 
with his other hand.  He's in pain from his cut his hand starts bleeding 
again.  Lloyd lets go of Pierre's finger and reaches for Pierre's poorly 
bandaged hand.  Lloyd twists Pierre's arm backward causing his palm to face 
up.  He notices the deep gash on Pierre's palm.

Lloyd
Bloody hell!  What on earth happened to you?

Pierre(going limp)
Let go off me now Lloyd

There is absolutely no resistance from Pierre.  Lloyd loosens his grip on 
Pierre and watches the latter walk off toward a mirror.  Pierre rubs his hand 
as he looks through the mirror back at Lloyd.  

Lloyd
What happened to your hand Pierre?

Pierre(still looking in the mirror and rubbing his palm)
Nothing much, I got in a fight.

Lloyd 
You, Mr.  Do right, got in a fight?  What or who on earth could have made you 
so upset as to get in a fight?

Pierre
What do you care?

Lloyd(gulping a chunk of ice from his glass of Chivas Regal)
Well you're absolutely right I do not care about your well being however I 
find it most entertaining to find out whom you fought with.

Pierre turns around and stares Lloyd in the eyes the latter begins crushing 
the ice with his teeth and stirs his drink pausing to look at Pierre.  

Lloyd(holding glass up)
A toast.  The tame have grown some fangs.

Pierre
Go fuck yourself man.

Lloyd
You've been hanging around those illiterates haven't you?

Pierre does not answer.  The silent in the room is broken when the sirens 
sound off on campus.  Pierre rushes back to his bag, stuffs the rest of his 
belongings in.  he hurry's for the door. 

Voice in the hallway
Fuck the police.

 Lloyd follows him around with his arms crossed still holding his drink and 
without saying a word, steps in front of the door.

Lloyd
OK first I was kidding but em. Where are you going.  Is the police escort for 
you?

Pierre tries to move Lloyd but the latter is standing his ground.  Pierre 
swings his bag at Lloyd

Pierre
Get the fuck out of the way damn it.

Taken by surprise, Lloyd spills his drink on himself.  Lloyd has a burst upper 
lip.  Lloyd drops his drink, and stumbles for a couple of steps.  By the time 
he gathers himself up, Pierre's exiting the room.  Lloyd dashes for the door 
after Pierre and runs smack into the door.  He pauses for a second, pulls his 
lower lip out and realized that he's cut again.

Lloyd(holding his lip)
Bloody hell. You are one dead chap.


Lloyd turns the door handle he's bulldozed by Pierre again.  Lloyd's on the 
ground again.  Pierre goes for the light switch, and turns off the lights in 
the room.  Lloyd gets back up.  A knock comes on the door.  

Voice
Mr.  Günter?  Mr.  Pierre Günter?  This is officer Bryant of the metro police! 
 I need to speak to you Mr.  Günter.

Lloyd looks at Pierre not knowing exactly what to expect from him.  Pierre 
doesn't answer the door, Lloyd reaches for the door knob.  Pierre leaps from 
his crouched position around the bed, steps on the bed and stops Lloyd from 
opening the door.  Lloyd tries to open the door.

Lloyd(whispering)
You've got something to say to me?  (knocking persists on door) You better 
make it quick

Officer Bryant
Mr.  Günter!  Mr.  Günter, is everything OK?  Sir, I just need to ask you a 
few questions about the morgue.

Lloyd grabbed Pierre by the collar 

Lloyd(whispering)
You're going to tell me what in bloody hell is going on or else I'll turn you 
in.

Pierre(whispering)
There is absolutely nothing going on.  Now tell him I'm not here and I'll 
explain everything to you.

Officer Bryant
Sir, now, you're only wanted for questioning that's it.

Lloyd opens the door as the officer is speaking.  The officer steps back and 
reaches for his side arm.  Stretching his free arm forward in caution toward 
Lloyd.  Pierre in the mean time is behind the door, begging Lloyd not to say 
anything.

Lloyd(licking his own blood)
So what are you planning to do with that?(pointing at the Billie club on the 
officer's side)  You intent on using that?

Officer 
Stand back sir.  I'm here for Mr.  Günter. What are you doing here?

Lloyd(still advancing)
 Why don't you do me a favor and tell me what is going on.  What happened at 
the morgue? Do you know who I am?

Officer(backed up to the wall)
Sir, this is police business.  This has nothing to do with you so please back 
up.  I'm not going to say it again.

The officer removes his club.  Lloyd walks right up on him giving him little 
room to maneuver.  The officer brandishes his club, Lloyd, who towers over the 
latter grabs his wrist and pulls it over the officer's head.  The officer 
reaches for his whistle and starts blowing.  Soon, the entire floor was filled 
with officers.  
Students fill the hallway.  They are cheering and throwing things at the 
officers.
Lloyd keeps his distant demeanor.

Stamp(only hear his voice)
Everybody back in your rooms now.. now I said less you want to take a ride 
downs town

Students
Boo/asshole/your mother's a bearded goat

Stamp walks through the crowd.  

Stamp
Ah, if it isn't British Royalty at its best behavior!  Listen here kiddo, how 
about letting go my officer's club?

Lloyd 
The name is Cambridge, Sir Lloyd Cambridge the IV, to the likes of yourself.  
And since you ask so kindly, I guess I will oblige you. 

Stamp
Listen here kid, where's your buddy, Mr. .?  What's his name?

Officer
Günter

Stamp
Yeah the fat kid.

Lloyd 
I do not associate myself with the likes of that whom you have just described. 
 And if you are referring to my roommate, I have not seen him today.  Now then 
if you and your less academically inclined fellows are done exhibiting their 
testosterone overflow, I will return to my quarters now and ponder whether or 
not I would like to prosecute.

Stamp
Prosecute me?  For what?  What could you possibly have to prosecute the 
department on?

Lloyd
You're the cop, figure it out.  By the way do you have a warrant? 

Stamp( walking off with Lloyd and grabbing him around his neck.  Insinuating 
to be friends)
Listen kiddo I believe this royalty crap is gone to your head but I would like 
to make you abundantly aware of the fact that I don't like your ass.  And if 
your name is in anyway shape or form linked to these murders, you better 
believe me, it'll take more than the queen to get your ass out of jail.  I've 
got your buddy's prints all over the place too.  Remember that.

Lloyd(speaking through his teeth to muffle the pain in his voice)
Well I'm glad that we made our feelings about each other abundantly clear but 
I'm afraid that ..how do you people say it?  Oh yeah {in an American Accent} 
'you're barking up the wrong treepatna'

Stamp looks at Lloyd, smiles and begins walking away.  The officers part to 
let him through.  He stopped in his tracks, turned.

Stamp
I have a feeling that I'll be seeing you sooner than you think.  Have a nice 
day kiddo.

Lloyd watched as all the law enforcers walked away.  
     
Cut to

Titus, Randy and Nanette jump out of their car at the airport.  

Sign above read: Employees Only.  

They walk across the street into the airport lounge area.  Titus looks up onto 
the second level. (the duty free shops and café ).  He waves up.  

Lydia(waving frantically)
Hey guys! what's up?  Common up here.

Nanette.(rubbing her stomach)
Throw me one of those chocolate bars you guys make or something, I'm hungry 
and I can't climb the stairs without some food.

Randy.(he leads off up the escalator)
Com'on we don't have time for all this chocolate talk.

Nanette and Titus follow.  Nanette shakes her head as she goes up the 
escalator.  The duty free café is closed for a few hours.  One of the 
employees is mopping the floor.  
 Lydia's cleaning out the counter.  Randy jumps over the chain linked fence.
 
Guy mopping
Hey chap, you can't do that

Randy(walking  toward Lydia)
Do what?

At that very moment, Nanette jumps over the little fence.

Guy Mopping
Ma'am!(Titus followed Nanette), Sir, you people can't do that!

Randy
We just did so, whatcha gon do 'bout it?

Lydia
Leave him alone Randy, he's only doing his job

Nanette
Yeah back up sugar, pick on someone your own size.(she's laughing and pointing 
at Titus)

Randy
What?  Pretty boy don't want none

Titus(oblivious)
Hey love!  how's it going today?

Lydia(leaning over the counter and forming a fist at Randy)
Oh my baby doesn't fell good.  What's the matter love?  The yaper's getting to 
you.

 Randy
See, see that yeah that's what I'm talking about right there, you're equally 
full of shit .

Nanette
A-n-y-w-a-y, baby you know you talk much shit.  Go on somewhere with all that 
stuff.

Randy(turning on the bar stool following Nanette)
Who you talking too?  I see I'm gonna have to handle you too!(he hoists his 
arms up)

Lydia
Boy!  you know you couldn't handle a door knob, so please and thank you

Randy stands back and looks at his friends the ladies are laughing at him.  
Titus is chuckling.

Lydia
Seriously guys, what's the matter with my baby today?

Nanette
I don't know what's the matter with either of them but they've been on edge 
all evening long.

Lydia
Ok, love you know I get worried when you act like this!  So, what on earth is 
going on?

Nanette pissed off.  Titus doesn't speak instead he turns to look at Randy 
leaving the latter to explain the story.  

Cut to   

The four students are in the car heading back to the campus.  

Randy
Look, it ain't like we wanted the shit to go down like that.  Men I just had 
to have my main man's back.  That's all!  I mean you all are looking at us as 
if we did something so wrong.  Well this is just some shit that happens all 
the time.

Nanette(lashing out furiously)
What the hell is wrong with you? (she hits him)  Why can't you act mature at 
least once in your life?  You're always shifting the blame on someone else, 
how about owning up to the fact that you're just wrong.you're wrong Randy 
Bannerman and you have jeopardized everyone around you.  And please speak like 
you know how.


Randy( holding his palms up)
So I'm to blame for this shit now?  'Cause I decided to help a friend out, I'm 
the bad guy.  Well I'm sorry if my cadet training.

The three other passengers all sigh in deject.

Lydia (turning her head while driving)
Here we go again with the cadet school stuff.  Dude you were in high school 
and besides, you cadet honor has nothing to do with duping a cab driver.  So, 
won't you do us all a favor and drop the cadet thing.  This has nothing to do 
with being a cadet this has to do with you being irresponsible.  (She turns to 
Titus)  and you too.  How could you I thought you had a mind of your own!

Titus never looks back at her he remains staring out of the window.  

Lydia
You hear me talking, while you guys spend so much time making fun of Pierre 
Günter you could learn from him.  See instead of dodging officers he's on his 
way home with that weirdo Lloyd, Lord, Lard or what ever his name is.

  Titus turns his head for the first time.  He looks at Lydia as though she 
was insane.  She turns around. 

Lydia
Yes sir?

Titus turns back to the window he begins to mumble under his breath.

Titus
He's gone home OK! If you're going to spend your evening bashing us about what 
happened then at least get your facts straight.

Lydia
What are y-o-u talking about?  I have my facts straight.  I know whom I saw it 
was Pierre and that fag Lloyd.  Now where ever they went is none of my 
business.

Randy
You're damn right

Lydia(looking back through the rear view mirror)
Like I said I saw both of them in the airport and I saw both of them get in 
Lloyd's jet.(she pauses a little)As a matter of fact, I should have known 
when I saw him all bruised up that he was involved in something with you guys. 
 

Replay scene in black and white as Pierre tries to avoid eye contact with 
Lydia at the airport

Nanette
I thought that guy was gay?  

Randy
 Pierre's cool.  Shit you all talk so much crap man I don't know what you over 
there talking about Pierre being all bruised up and shit matter fact, pull up 
by the dorm let me go holler at French boy one time.

Lydia ignores him.  He keeps on insisting.  She eventually gives in and pulls 
over in front of the dorm.  Randy jumps out and heads up the stairs to the 
entrance of the dorm leaping over flights of stairs at once.  Titus opens the 
door and steps out.  

Lydia
Titus! Titus!  Where you going baby?

Titus(mumbling)
No where damn it.

He pulls out a cigarette she calls on him through the passenger window.  

Nanette
He is really bugging out!  You better get your boy before he flips out.

Lydia walks out of the car after Titus.  She walks up behind him and hugs him 
resting her head in his back.  He lifts his head blows out some smoke. 

Lydia
Baby it will be ok.  All we have to do is go to the police an explain what 
happened.  They will understand.  Ok?  I know what you're dad is going to say 
about the whole thing but eventually he'll understand that it was just an 
accident.  These things happen.  What we have to focus on now is how to 
explain the whole thing.

Titus (puts out the cigarette clasps her hands)
You don't know what my dad will say.  And on top of that you don't have to 
lose your scholarship and everything that

Randy comes out running yelling something.  Nanette slouched in the back seat. 
 She's doing her nails.  She pries herself up on her elbows to see what the 
ruckus's about.  
Randy running toward the car.  Nanette, returns to her nail care.  
Lydia and Titus walk Randy.  


Titus
Men what?

Randy
Dude Pierre is gone

Lydia
And?  I told you that.  What's your point?

Randy
Look, I'm for real he's gone

Titus
Lydia told us already

Randy(Turning to Lydia)
Well did you know that he was wanted by the officers?

reaction:  shock from everyone.

Cut to

Lloyd (showing Pierre his room)
You're really going to like it here.

Pierre(looking in amazement)
Wow, thanks Lloyd.  I still don't know why you did that for me Lloyd?  I know 
that I have not exactly been the best roommate to you

Lloyd (holding his hand over his lips)
Not to worry sir I just believe that you did what you had to do.  So without 
any further ado, change clothes and come with me.  I will introduce you to the 
family

Pierre(still confused)
Like I said, I really don't understand why you're doing this for me but, I 
thank you for what you did and  for what you're still doing.

Lloyd
Well think of it this way, I was bored and I needed some company and since you 
seemed to show more fortitude in one night than I have ever seen you show in 
an entire year, I deem it fit to be around you.  Plus I never liked that 
constable Stamp..

Pierre
You mean Chief Inspector right?

Lloyd
No, I mean constable and a foreign one add that.

Pierre simply stands there looking at Lloyd still amazed at the magnificence 
of the room.




Lloyd
The issue is not the fact that he is a foreigner.  I obviously don't have a 
problem with them but he is an American.  And that is different.  You of all 
people know that I have absolutely no problems with foreigners.  
But..(licking his split lower lip) I owe you a rematch anyway.

Lloyd walks over to the door, opens it and signals Pierre to follow him.  
Pierre is disoriented.  Lloyd realizes it.

Lloyd
We came in another way.

Pierre only answers with a nod.  He is captivated by the series of paintings 
on the walls.  Both sides of the corridor are adorned with portraits of 
gentleman and ladies who appear to be Lloyd's ancestors.  Lloyd, stops and 
lets him catch up with him.

Lloyd
It is the family and its long tradition.  I'm afraid that one day I will have 
to assume responsibility of the entire estates of the family.  Ah what a 
chore.  Nothing that you'll ever have to worry about.

Lloyd chuckles and turns back around to lead the way.  In the distance at the 
end of the hallway is a portrait of one of Lloyd's male ancestors.  Unlike the 
other portraits, this one has a menacing stare and an aura permeated from his 
stature.  
Pierre 
That's one mean looking dude

Lloyd
That my dear is Baron Cambridge.  Right this way sir.

Lloyd ushers Pierre

Pierre
Wow! Does this place ever end?  How much more?

He finds himself at the top of a steep stairway adorned with expensive 
tapestry and golden ledges on either sides, at the very bottom of the stairs 
are two monstrous bronze felines each mounted with two sets of dragon heads.  
Pierre stands at the top of the stairs and marvels at the shear size of his 
surrounding.
 Lloyd dabbed him in the back urging him to progress down the stairs.  
Half way down the stairs, Pierre turns around only to see Lloyd standing at 
the top, his arms opened wide.

Lloyd
Welcome to my humble abode.  May this be a most memorable stay for you Mr.  
Günter.
 

Cut to; back on campus.


Titus
Are you serious?  Pierre couldn't 

Randy
Yup, I knew it that guy was the real weirdo but no!!!  (in a feminine voice)  
Randy just can't stand Pierre 'cause he's sweet and has a real French accent. 
 Well fuck a damn accent, I'm telling you he got that Nazi in him and you 
can't change that bottom line.  Now you can say all you want about me but you 
all

Nanette 
Shut up baby, you're full of it and you know it too.  You know that is not 
like him. 

Randy(mumbling)
I don't know shit

Nanette(rolling her eyes and raising her voice)
.so don't even start with your Nazi shit talk.

Lydia
Maybe that's why he was with Lloyd

Titus
Why?

Lydia
Well because they were together and unless Pierre is gay, I find no reason for 
them being together

Titus
What. So if two guys are together it means their gay?

Randy(mumbling)
I ain't gay man

Nanette
Shut up baby

Randy(mumbling)
Matter of fact I like all the puss I can get.

Nanette(stressing)
PLEASE shut up

Randy(mumbling)
Big puss, small puss, tight puss, loose puss, black puss, white puss, hairy 
puss, shaved puss, prissy puss, stank puss, nasty puss, virgin puss, etc. 

Lydia(while Randy is mumbling)
No Love, I'm not just saying that because they were together, I know this for 
a fact.  Lloyd is gay.

Titus
How do you know this for a fact?  I mean what do you mean by for a fact?  What 
you tried to throw it at him and he said no?  I mean what?

Lydia
Ok enough of this, you're not going to keep talking to me like this you 
understand.
Titus tries to interrupt her but he is met with strong rebuff.

Lydia
Understand?  Now, I did not try (waving her hands in an exaggerated manner) to 
date Lloyd.  She, (pointing at Nanette) dated him for a while.  And she told 
me that he was gay.  Happy now?

Randy stopped mumbling, turned to face Nanette.

Randy
What the fuck is she talking about?

Nanette
It was a long time ago, and like she said nothing ever happened.  The guy is 
gay

Randy is not amused by the whole thing.

Randy
When did this happen?

Nanette
What difference does it make? We're together

Randy
Together yeah, right, like I said when did this happen?

Nanette
And then what?

Randy(raising his voice as he speaks) 
And then I'll fucking decide.  Now I asked when did this happen.  This ain't 
fucking twenty questions I asked a simple question and I want a simple answer 
so are you going to answer yes or no?

Nanette(becoming defensive)
Yeah we dated for a while but he was into playing crazy stuff and he was only 
interested in one form of sex.

Randy
You get reamed, what's your problem?  That should be right up your alley 
literally.  Well, well what do you know after all this flack I've been getting 
about looking at chicks and stuff like that not knowing all this time I was 
the good guy.  Well how about that?

Lydia
Come on Randy cut it out.  Its not what you think.

Randy
You know what I'm about sick of you.  Its never what I think and I'm forever 
jealous of some shit.  Well fuck every body

Titus(shaking his head)
Wow, wow easy now my man

Randy 
Man don't even try that cause you know I wouldn't come at your chick like that 
if she hadn't come at me wrong first.

Titus(nodding his head in approval)
I told you to stay out of this whole thing didn't I?




Randy
You know what I'm not even going to worry about you I don't really care for 
Pierre but one thing I can say about him is that he's never lied to me.  Come 
on Titus.  We need to find out what's going on with Pierre.  He might be in 
trouble.

The four friends got back in the car Titus drove, Randy was in the passenger 
seat looking out the window.  In the back seat were the two girls.  Nanette 
was looking out the window crying Lydia stretched over to comfort her friend 
but the latter shrugged her shoulder away from her friend.

Lydia
"I'm sorry 'nette I didn't mean to."

Nanette
"Just leave me alone, please"


Lydia
"I'm so sorry"


Cut to

Enter:  Aristide & Lady Van-Hess

The room is comfortably lit there are three massive chandeliers one center 
piece and two smaller chandeliers on either side of the center piece.  
In the background  Vivaldi's 'The four Seasons' is playing.  Utter silence at 
the table.  Pierre stretches over and sees his reflection though the shine of 
the cherry maple table.  Pierre picks up his silverware and notices an 
engraving in gold at the bottom of the sterling silver fork.  The letters read 
CcY.  
Right then, the double doors of the dining room fly open.  In comes a tall and 
lanky framed bald gentleman pushing a passenger in a wheelchair.  The 
squeaking sound of the wheel chair echoes painfully in the otherwise empty 
room. Closely follows the uneven sound of footsteps.   Pierre looks at the 
approaching figures completely unaware of whom they might be.  
The two characters appear, they suddenly stop.  The wheel chair stops just shy 
of the light cast by the chandelier.  You can see the frail hands clad with 
enormous diamond rings on each ring finger.  The hands lay flat atop a quilt 
that covered the lower and mid section of the person in the seat.  The 
gentleman pushing the wheelchair seems more like an extension of the chair 
than a human being.  He stands there lifeless emitting a cold aura.  

Heavy breathing coming from the character in the wheelchair.  

Lloyd
Ah, how rude of mine.  Mr. Günter, meet Lady Van-Hess.  My mother.

Pierre(shooting out of his seat)
I'm sorry,  I did not mean to be ill-mannered ma'am, I honored to meet you.

Pierre paces himself toward the lady in the wheelchair extending his arm to 
greet her.  Out of the dark lunges a long arm with tentacle like fingers.  The 
tentacles  wrap around Pierre's wrist.  He tries to break lose from the firm 
grip to no avail .  The shadowy character is breathing heavily.  

Lloyd(realizing what's happening)
Easy, easy everyone.  My apologies, I should have informed you.  This is 
Aristide Meyer, the family's trusty confidant.  See,  Mr. Aristide has been 
with the family for as long as I can remember.  As you have noticed by now, he 
is very protective of the family.  He only thought that you were somewhat 
aggressing my mother.



Pierre
Really?  I wonder why given the fact that I was only being polite and he was 
the assailant! (Pierre is rubbing his bruised wrist never once taking his 
stare away from the dark figure)

Lloyd
Really, Pierre, Aristide meant you absolutely no harm.  If he did you would 
have no disillusions about it.



Pierre (showing signs of intimidation)
Well I still haven't heard an apology from him!

Lloyd
Well save yourself the anticipation for you will never hear any such thing 
come out of him.  Actually you will not hear anything from Aristide.(Pierre 
directs a questioning and angered glance at Lloyd).you see my dear, Aristide 
lost his tongue.

Pierre
What do you mean lost his tongue, you don't just lose a tongue, so what 
happened?  

Lloyd
 since you insist and since I hear no opposition from Aristide, I will tell  
you.  He cut off his own tongue during a robbery in order not to reveal the 
location of the family jewels.

Pierre stands still floored in amazement at the devotion of the figure behind 
the wheel chair.  All this while, Lady Van-Hess is still slumped in her seat 
oblivious to the entire ruckus going on around her.  Lloyd taps Pierre on the 
shoulder and leads the latter out of the room.  The two walk down another 
hallway and out into a maze.  The air is heavy, the fog's set low.  He watches 
Lloyd walk ahead of him with his arms behind his back.

Lloyd
Well Pierre my good man, what do you think?

Pierre
What?

Lloyd
I said, what do you think of me and my milieu? Obliviously you have some 
questions on your mind, so, I would like to answer them the best I can.

Pierre
For starters, you could tell me why you brought me here?  Why did you tell 
Stamper that I was not in the room?

Lloyd
Because you told me to

Pierre
I never said a word

Lloyd
Oh you did sir..  You specifically signaled me not to say a word and I 
obliged.  Are you denying that now?  If you are accusing me of lying to the 
police then I am guilty but if you are for one minute insinuating that  you 
never advised me to tell the officers what I told them then my good friend I 
believe that you are going to cause me to be extremely vexed and I don't think 
that it would be in any of us' best interest to see me vexed.

Lloyd backtracks his steps to Pierre and stares down at him.  Pierre, takes a 
step back and starts heading toward his room.  As he looks up he notices a 
figure in the window of his bedroom but as quickly as he sees the body, the 
latter disappears.  

Pierre(turning to Lloyd)
Did you see that?

Lloyd is no longer standing in the vicinity.  Pierre's baffled he calls out 
for Lloyd to no avail.  
Sound from deeper in the maze.
It almost sounded like the sound of an infant crying. 
 Pierre turns with his back to the manor looking at the entrance of the maze 
the sound of the infant is drawing closer and closer.  
Pierre feels a presence over his shoulder. 
 He spins around in panic.  No one was there.  
He turns back toward the maze the sound had stopped.  
Pierre's confused.  He begins double stepping back to the manor.  
He hears the sound of dogs running out of the maze toward him.  
Pierre hastens his pace, changing into full strides.  The dogs sound closer.  
Pierre sees the dimly lit stairs leading to the manor in the near distance.  
Just as he takes another step, he's almost knocked off balance.  He narrowly 
escapes a bite from one of the dogs.  
Pierre regroups himself, the stairs are at hand.  He leaps over as many of 
them as he can at once.  Finally the top of the stairs.  Pierre runs right 
into the massive doors they seem locked.  The dogs are almost upon him but the 
wet marble steps cause the dogs to slip and fall buying Pierre just enough 
time to try the door again.  

Pierre(banging on door)
Open this fucking door now.  Open the damn door.

The door gives.  
Pierre falls into the foyer.  
He kicks the door shut.  
Everyone's standing over him looking down at him.  
Above him, stands Lloyd, Aristide and in the wheel chair Lady Van-Hess.  
Pierre's looking at them upside down.  He scrambles back to the door wedging 
his back against the wall.  Pierre looks at the three people standing before 
him.

Pierre
What the hell is going on here?

no answer

Pierre
Where did you go?

Lloyd
Who?

Pierre
What the hell do you mean who?  You, damn it.  What the fuck happened back 
there?

Lloyd
What?

Pierre
The dogs, the fucking dogs?



Lloyd(reaching out to Pierre who backs away) 
I think you  need to rest Pierre  you are not feeling well.  You're delirious. 
 Come on let's get you to your room, you need to rest.  It's been a long 
couple of days.

Pierre
What are  you fucking talking about?  Can't you hear the dogs?

Lloyd (raising his voice)
I was trying to help you hear but you're not giving me much to work with.  
What are you talking about?  There are no dogs on the grounds.

Pierre
Can't you fucking hear

Lloyd (interrupting)
Hear what? There is nothing to hear why don't you listen for a while, you're 
the only one causing the commotion.

Pierre decides to quiet down.  
There's no noise outside.  Pierre is confused.  
Lloyd walks past him and opens the door.  

Pierre(scrambling to his feet)
Don't!  don't open that door, there are dogs out there?

Lloyd does just that and to Pierre's surprise, the only sound outside is that 
of the strong wind crashing against the manor and causing the old abode to 
rattle.  

Lloyd(stretching his hand at Pierre)
Please, come, come see for yourself.

Pierre stretches his hand back at Lloyd who pulls him up to his feet.  Pierre 
looks out of the door where he is met with a heavy mist. 

Pierre
I'm telling you.  I'm not crazy.. I know
 To his surprise, there is nothing before him.  There is nothing in the 
distance either.  
He takes a shaky step forward looking out toward the entrance of the maze.   
Where did the dogs go? He looks down toward the maze as if expecting something 
to come out toward him.  
Pierre snaps out of his trance when Lloyd puts a hand on his shoulder.  He 
turns and looks at Lloyd.  
Lloyd's lips are moving but Pierre hears absolutely nothing.

Pierre
It bit me! ( he bends over reaching for his pants leg) see, see how did this 
happen?  I told you there were dogs, if not how did this happen? Where did the 
marks come from?

As Pierre was pleading his case, Aristide pushes the wheelchair outside Pierre 
becomes erratic in his behavior.  He begins laughing and pointing at his pants 
he's baking up toward the stairs.  Lloyd approaches him slowly saying nothing. 
 Pierre warns Lloyd not to take another step.  Lloyd keeps approaching 
suddenly, Lloyd stoops.  This brisk motion causes Pierre to take rapid steps 
back.  As Lloyd stands up, he brandishes something toward Pierre.  Pierre 
jerks back, stumbles backward on the steps.  The last thing Pierre  sees 
before he passes out is Lloyd holding a twig with a piece of cloth attached to 
it.  It's the missing part of Pierre's pants.  Pierre passes out soon after.

Cut to

Randy's on the phone.  Lydia and Titus are in the distance pacing around.  
Nanette's on the other side of the street standing alone.  Randy's off the 
phone and runs toward the couple.

Randy
Stamper has agreed to meet us on the football field in an hour.  He promised 
he'll be alone.

Titus
And  you trust him to show up alone, right?

Randy
I never said I did but suddenly I couldn't care less what happened to me.  All 
I know is I have a true friend missing and I'm going to do all I can to try to 
find him before anything bad happens

Lydia
That is if nothing has happened yet

Randy

Nothing, has happened yet.
So you want to stand here and deliberate on what to do or you want to come on? 
If you don't come I'll understand.  Obviously you're all to important to be 
bothered with a guy like Pierre.








Lydia(pissed)
Hey that's enough, that was just mean.  You think you can be mean to a guy all 
year long and suddenly because your feelings are hurt and because you feel you 
can't trust anyone around you, you become his best friend.  Well news flash 
Mr., that's not quite how it works so if you think trashing the three of  us 
is going to make you feel better, think again.  The fact is you need us as 
much as we need you to find Pierre.  So, either we work together as a team or 
we go our separate ways and I guarantee you that if we do go our separate 
ways, we ruin a better chance at not finding Pierre.  That way, everybody 
loses.  And I guess you can stay on your hate crusade forever.

The four just stand around Titus and Lydia together, Nannette by herself by 
the car, and Randy sitting on the floor of the phone booth.

Titus(walking toward Randy)
Look, there's no point in fighting right now, you're both right, let's just 
get going for now.

Cut to:  the soccer field

The kids arrive, they walk onto the field, its pitch dark.  
Lydia is holding on to Titus as tightly as she can.  Randy is walking ahead of 
the pack forging through the mist that has dropped to about ten feet above 
their heads.  Nanette is closely following him never actually touching him.  
Suddenly a loud sound of metal churning erupts from the bleachers to the 
right.  
Everyone stops dead in their tracks and turn to face the origin of the sound.

Randy
who's there?

No answer

Randy
I said who's there?

They begin walking toward the bleachers Randy in front, closely followed by 
Nannette, Lydia and Titus at the rear.  

Titus
Shit man I can't see  damn thing!

Randy
Shuut

Lydia
Hold me close

Titus reaches for her ass.  She gives him a look.  

Titus
What?  

The closer they get, the more distinctly appear the staircase to the 
bleachers. They hear a constant grind in the distance.

Randy
Stamper? Stamper? Is that you out there?

Titus
This isn't funny man?  If you're trying to scare us, it's working.  Now can 
you cut it out we think we know what happened a friend of ours is missing.

Randy
Yeah Pierre.  You know the news kid!

they approach the stairs and the sound gets louder and louder.  A cat jumps 
off the bleachers onto Randy.  Randy falls back onto Nannette.  She throws him 
off herself and takes off running.  Everyone is yelling. 

Randy(gathering himself)
It's cool, it's cool, it was a cat?  Are you sure it was a cat

Lydia(frantic and still alarmed)
What the hell do you mean it was a cat?  Are you sure it was a cat?




Randy
Yeah, look, I said it was a fucking cat ok!  Now everyone just fucking chill, 
we're acting like a bunch of freaking kids man.  Fuck.

Nannette
Randy

Randy 
I said it was a cat OK

Nannette
Randy

Randy
What??

Nannette
You're bleeding from you're head.

Randy sits back and rubs his palm against his head he realizes that he has a 
small gash on his forehead.  All four of them are sitting on the floor trying 
to gather their thoughts.  Titus is lying flat on his back with his hands 
under his head.  He starts laughing uncontrollably.  Lydia is on her knees not 
too far from him.  

Lydia 
Are you laughing?  Is he laughing

Randy takes of his shirt and starts nursing his wound.

Nannette(still in shock)
What the hell are you laughing at dude?

Titus(still laughing)
You should have seen the expression on your face as you tried to move Randy 
from on top of you.  Man that was some funny shit.  I mean I thought she was 
going to lift you right off herself man

Nannette
Fuck you man that's not funny dude plus it ain't quite like you were standing 
strong MR..

Titus(still laughing)
Man I never thought I would see that.  She straight picked you up and shit.  
Man that was some funny shit for real!


Randy holding his hand over his head begins laughing slowly.  Then he bursts 
into an equally loud laugh.  Lydia looks at Titus then at Randy and finally at 
Nannette, she joins in the laughter.  Very soon all four of them are laughing 
Titus keeps on laughing rolling side to side clasping his stomach.  He rolls 
right, rolls left, rolls right again and there crouched over him is Noran 
Stamp.

Titus
Oh fuck

Stamp
having a good time here?
Lydia let's out a high pitch yell.  Titus rolls back and sprawls to his hands 
and feet backing up from stamp.

Titus
I didn't hear you

Stamp
Kinda like how the cabby didn't hear his murderer either hun?

Randy
What?  You think we whacked the cabby?  What are you saying man?

Stamp
Chief inspector!

Randy
What?

Stamp
Chief inspector, that's what you call me.  Chief inspector.  Not man.

Titus
So why do you think we wanted too meet with you if indeed we did it? 

Stamp
The fact that you wanted to meet doesn't really mean anything.  Actually the 
fact that you're done hiding behind your dad might help us shed some light on 
the situation.

Titus(furious)
You've got something to say to me you better say it loud and clear!




Stamp
Easy young man, I don't take kindly to threats.  My advice to you is that 
you'd better take some of that hostility out of your voice before I begin to 
take offense to your idle threats.

Titus
Idle?  Threats?  What the fuck is he talking about?

Randy
Easy everyone, let's take it easy remember we're trying to find out about 
Pierre.  So let's all keep a cool head ok?

Stamp looks at the group then turns to Randy.

Stamp
So, what do you guys know about the night the cab driver died?

Randy looks at Titus and then at the girls and begins to tell the story to 
stamp.

Cut to

The four friends are on their way to the police precinct with the chief 
inspector.  

Titus(whispering to Randy)
I don't know about this man

Stamp(looking in the rear view)
Easy kid, I'm just trying to get this deposition on paper.  You know, for the 
record.  So, don't go wetting your pants, you're not under arrest OK?

Titus
Who's he man

Randy
It's cool dude.  We're straight.  Just chill man.  Plus this sets us straight 
with your old dude?

Titus
Oh shit

Stamp
Easy on the vocab back there

Titus
Men, today is the gala.  My peops are going to be looking for us man.

Randy
Hey,  chef,  how long is this whole thing going to take?

Stamp
As soon as you put the whole thing in writing, you can go.  By the way, its 
hey, chief.  Got that?

Randy
What ever you say chef!


They arrive at the precinct, standing on the other side of the counter is 
officer Bryant the rookie from the night club.  He recognizes Titus.  

Officer Bryant(to other officer)
There he goes, the one on the left. 

Other officer
You sure?

Bryant just looks at him.

Other officer
OK, what do you want to do?

Officer Bryant
I think it's time for some payback

Titus(whispering)
Yo, I think dude made me

Randy(normal tone)
Who

Titus
Shuu the cop!  The club?

Randy
Oh yeah.for real?  You sure?

Titus
Look for yourself?

Randy(looking over)
Ah man this ain't good man dude!


Officer Bryant waves at them.

Randy
Man he's waving at you dude?

Titus
Hell no he ain't


Randy
Men that's your boy, wave at him man.

Titus waves back.

Lydia
You know him babe

Titus
Yeah. I guess.

Officer(walking over to stamp)
Chief, we've been trying to get in contact with you?

Stamp(checking his radio, its off)
Crap. OK what do you have for me?

Officer
Its confirmed he left for the main land with the rich kid

Stamp
I know that much!

Officer
Well get this, the prints from the lab match those of the Lloyd kid?

Stamp
What?

Officer
Now I checked the register for the week and he was scheduled to work in the 
lab that day?

Titus(interrupting)
No he wasn't, he was scheduled for that night but he said he wasn't feeling 
well so he worked the night before.  

Stamp 
And how do you know this?

Randy
His dad's is the head honcho remember?

Stamp(walking away)
Get main land on the radio.  Tell them we're on our way. 

Randy
Com'on guys let's go

Stamp
Going where?  Oh no, you've got some paper work to do?  Once you're done, it's 
time to go home.

Randy
Hey wait a minute, we're in on this one..

Titus
Without us you'd have no idea were to start

Stamp
Hey, enough of this, like I said, you've got some paperwork to do.  Now once 
you're done with that, we have to get your parents in here to pick you up.  
And that's that?

Titus(as Stamp walks off)
Hey, hey.. I'm talking to you damn it.  We ain't no kids

Stamp never turns.  Instead he walks out of the small precinct and heads for 
the awaiting squad car. 

Cut to:  the von-Aldershmitt residence

Dr.V(putting on a tie facing the mirror)
Where in goodness' name are those boys?

Mrs.V(jockeying for position before the mirror)
Do you think my outfit is too risqué?  

Dr.V
What?

Mrs.V
I said do you think my outfit is too risqué?

Dr.V
What does it matter, you're going to wear it anyway.

Mrs. V
Does that mean you don't like it?

No answer: the phone's ringing in they don't answer.

Cut to: Titus on the phone in the precinct.  

Titus
No one's answering!

Lydia
They must be gone.  You already know your mom, she wouldn't be late for a gala 
even if it meant giving up her legs.

Randy(laughing)
Yeah man you know that's for real.


Titus gets ready to start dialing a second time.

Officer
Hey what' you think you're doing?

Titus
Using the phone what' you think?

Officer(walking over)
Listen here kid, you get one call and that's it.  Got it?

Titus(Starting to dial)
What?

Officer(slaps phone out of his hand)
Wait a minute, what do we have here?

Titus(pushing officer)
Hey what the hell's wrong with you?

Officer(raising Billie club)
You stupid son of a bitch

Randy(grabs officer)
Hey, easy there?  What's going on here?

Officer
Get your hand off me now.

Randy(let's go.  Raises his hands up)
Cool dude.  All I'm saying is there's no need for all this.  My man was just 
trying to use the phone that's it.

Officer(pointing at sign)
And I said you get one call.  He's used up his one call

Randy
What?  He never spoke to anyone.

Titus
Hey officer jackass.  Can you read?  The sign says "the detained get one call"

Officer
And

Randy(laughing)
And! We ain't behind bars man.  So we get to use the phone as much as we want.

Officer
Who said you're not being detained?

The officer turns and signals officer Bryant from behind the counter.

Officer
Last time I checked, you guys were wanted.  Matter of fact what are you doing 
in here?  Just hanging out?

Lydia(coming from the side)
We came with the chief

Officer Bryant(pushing her back)
Shut up sweet heart, no one's talking to you

Titus(walking up on Bryant)
What the hell do you think you're doing?

Bryant
Did you just threaten me?

Titus
What?


Bryant
I said, did you just threaten me?  Hey fellow (turning back to the other 
officers).  We've got one of those "fuck the police guys"

The other officers start to converge on Titus and Lydia.  Randy walks in 
between Bryant and Titus.

Randy(whispering to Bryant)
OK, OK, I know what this is all about men.  Let's just forget about the whole 
thing OK!

Bryant(stepping back)
Hey guys and this one's trying to bribe his way out of here.

Randy
What?  Bitch you crazy man.  I just said.

Officer(whacks randy in the ribs)
Watch your language

Nannette(out of her seat)
Hey what fuck you do that for

Officer
Alright, I've had enough of this all of you behind bars.  Now

Titus
Behind bars?  For what?

Officer
For what?  For what?  Where do you want me to start.  Let's see how about, 
disturbing the peace

Randy
What peace?

Officer(turning to Randy)
Bribing an officer.

Randy
You've got to be joking man

Titus
These fools can't do a thing dude, they're just trying to shake us.  That's it

Officer(walking behind Titus)
How about, assaulting an officer?  

Titus
Hey..

Officer Bryant punches him.  Randy steps up to help his friend.  The other 
officers join in and drag the boys down stairs.  They're thrown in a cell.  

Randy(behind bars)
Hey you know it doesn't have to go down like this!  Guys, guys, come back here 
you fucks

Titus(sitting on the floor)
I knew it man, I fucking new it. Hey (yelling) let us out of here

No answer.

Titus
Alright, randy, any more bright ideas?

randy doesn't answer.

Titus
Let's just meet with the chief inspector, nothing will happen!

Randy
Shut the fuck up dude, the only reason we're behind bars is because that 
rookie pointed you out so don't give me any of that it's your fault shit and 
beside I'm sick of your mouth.  I ain't your bitch so if you're gonna do 
something quit talking and just bring it?

Randy
Don't fucking start with me, I truly ain't got time for this!

Titus
Alright badass what's up with the tough shit talk?  You seem to forget that 
we're here is because the cabby is dead and you seem to forget that the cabby 
wouldn't have been dead if we'd paid him.  You get my drift?  So before you go 
off accusing people, check yourself out.

Officer Bryant
So don't feel so tough anymore hun?  You like to go around busting up officers 
hun?  Well you've got all night to think it over.  You and I are going to have 
a lot of time to get a handicapped rematch in a little while


Titus(realizing who's talking)
you sound all big and bad now, didn't sound so tough last night.  By the way 
how are your ribs?

Officer Bryant(now standing right in front of the bars)
Still bruised but I'll live

Titus(grabbing at the bars)
yeah, well that's good 'cause I held back when I heard you squeal

Randy breaks out laughing.  Officer Bryant walks toward him.  Right then, 
Titus begins laughing as well.  Bryant  turns to look in his direction.  He 
becomes furious.  In a flash, he swings his club at Titus' hands.  The blow is 
so violent that it sends Titus crumbling to his feet in a shattering yell.

Randy
Hey! What the fuck..

Officer Bryant blows the whistle on his neck and before long, the rest of the 
precinct is in the small cell area.
Officer #1
What the hell is going on In here?

Officer Bryant
I came to check on them, and before I knew it, he was trying to choke me 
through the bars.

Randy
He's a fucking liar man!  He just came here and started fucking with T..

Officer Bryant
That's a lie he tried to help too

Officer#2
I say we teach them a lesson

Officer Bryant
Sounds like a plan to me, what do you say guys?

The officers begin converging on the cell Randy steps back and flips one of 
the mattresses over his friend and himself.  A wave of blue suites swarm the 
little cell they are temporarily slowed down as Randy wildly swings his belt 
at them buckle leading on.  

Randy
Com'on motherfuckers, its you and I.  I'm swinging at y'all and I'm 'bout to 
fuck somebody up.  Come on, come on 

This only wards off the mob for a short while very soon, they begin 
approaching him from the week side.


Titus(getting back up on his feet)
Randy look out behind you

He turns around just in time to duck the down swing of the assailing officer. 
 Scoops up and under, leads with his left foot and sends a devastating right 
hook that floors the cop.  Unfortunately, that is not enough to stop the on 
coming mob.  
Very soon Randy disappears under the pressure of the mob.  Titus tries to put 
up some resistance but its in vain.  

Officer(coming from upstairs)
Stamp's back! Stamp's in the parking lot

The officers straighten up and drag the boys back upstairs.  The girls are in 
shock looking at their battered and bruised boyfriends.

Lydia(catching Titus)
What did you do to him?  

No answer.  Stamp walks in.

Stamp(looking at the boys)
What happened here?

No answer.  The mob of officers simply go back to what they were doing as if 
nothing happened.


Cut to

Pierre(abruptly waking up)
What?  It bit m.

Pierre looks around him and realizes that he's back in the guest room.  
He tries to stand up, he clutches his head.  Its wrapped in bandage.  He 
touches the back of his head.  That's where the pain is from.  

Pierre
What the hell happened?

There's a mirror straight ahead.  Pierre tries to rise to his feet and make it 
to the mirror.  He almost falls.  His left foot seems unable to support him.  
He looks down and realizes that his foot is bandaged as well.  

Pierre
My foot. the dogs.no it was a stick, Lloyd was trying to show it to him when 
I fell..no it was the dogs.I knows for sure . the maze.  

He limps across the room grabs his jacket, he looks under the bed for his 
shoes.  They're not there.  He then decides to look in the closet and there, 
as he expected, are his shoes.  He slips on the right shoe, then tries the 
left shoe on.  It does not fit.  
As he sits on the bed and starts taking the bandage off, he hears in the 
distance steps coming up the stairs.  Pierre begins to rush he doesn't want 
whoever is coming up the stairs to meet him in the room.  Pierre is pulling 
off the bandage, he pulls too hard and causes his injury to reopen.

Pierre
shit, that hurt

he grabs his ankle for a little while and then stops taking off the remaining 
bandage and forces his shoe on.  He's grimacing.  He is hurting.  The steps 
are drawing closer and Pierre looks at the window.  He limps over, opens the 
window, there are shrubs that have escalated the length of the wall.  
It's night time and Pierre feels that he can make a go for it.  He leans over 
the balcony railing, he's leading his climb down with his right foot trying 
his best to put the least pressure on his injured foot.  Very soon, his whole 
body is over the railing.  He starts to climb down, leaning his entire weight 
on his right foot then, he extends his left foot, Pierre tries to put the 
least pressure on his injured leg.  He starts applying little pressure at 
first and as he increases the amount of pressure his left foot begins to shake 
uncontrollably.  
Pierre steadies himself he appears to achieve his goal.  Pierre looks down and 
realizes that he is half way down the wall.  He looks up.  He reaches over his 
forehead with his arm to wipe the sweat of his face and at that moment, he 
feels a grasp.  Pierre looks up and it is the long tentacle like arm of 
Aristide trying to pull him up.

Pierre(almost losing his balance)
Ah! Let go off me.. 

Pierre tries to fight Aristide off but the latter has a firm grip on Pierre's 
jacket.  Pierre begins to gyrate violently, the whole structure is shaking

Pierre
Let go mother fucker

Lloyd(leaning over the railing)
give me your hand!  What do you think you're doing?


Pierre
Fuck you, and fuck him too, let go off me you weird fuck

Aristide is still pulling on the jacket his face, however, remains 
expressionless.  Suddenly, the sleeve of the jacket begins to rip and Pierre 
finds himself falling backward to the ground.  Aristide is still holding on to 
the sleeve looking down at Pierre, still expressionless.  Pierre falls about 
ten feet knocking the wind out off him.  He lies on the ground immobile.  
Lloyd slaps Aristide on the shoulder, signaling him to come on.  As the two 
bodies retreat from the balcony, Aristide still holding the sleeve in his 
hand, Pierre quickly jumps to his feet as if he'd never fallen at all.  He's 
trying to make it to the gate in the near distance.  He can see trucks driving 
by.  They all seem to slow down as they reach the sharp curve in front of the 
property.  Pierre picks up the pace of his limping run.  He is almost at the 
gate Lloyd walks out hastily into the courtyard.  He looks left and right, 
then spots Pierre at the gate.  Lloyd starts running full speed trying to get 
to Pierre before he shuts the gate behind himself.

Lloyd(swinging his arms haphazardly)
Pierre, Günter, stop, Pierre Günter stop now, what do you think you're doing?

Pierre doesn't respond.  He buys some time by shutting the massive gate behind 
himself.  He pushes the gate but it's heavier than he thought.  Now he sees 
Aristide coming up behind Lloyd.  He seems to be running in slow motion.  
Aristide's giraffe like motion makes him look like he is moving ever so slowly 
but he is actually gaining ground on Lloyd.  Pierre's in the distance still 
pushing the massive gate.  The gate is almost shut behind him.  He sees lights 
in the distance,  they draw closer.  It's a truck.  

Pierre(running into the street)
Hey, stop please stop

He waves the truck down, the driver seems to be oblivious to Pierre.  

Driver(in truck, barely missing Pierre)
What the hell.

He swerves around Pierre.  Lloyd is at the gate he is trying to open up the 
massive gates.  Pierre watches as the truck blows past him and screeches to a 
halt.  There's a sharp bend ahead and the driver  who almost lost control of 
his vehicle has to stop the truck to prevent it from flying off road.  Pierre 
looks back at the gate.   He backtracks to the gate running pass Lloyd and 
Aristide.  He's running toward the truck. 
Lloyd is still unable to open the massive gate fast enough.
Aristide with one arm begins pulling the massive gate open as though it were a 
mere wooden door.
Pierre's closer to the truck.  
The trucks engine begins to turn once more.  
The truck rolls back a little.  The brake lights come on.  
The front driver side wheel is stuck in mud.  The wheel spins.  The truck is 
still stuck.
The engine revs as the wheel spins once more.  This time, the tire is 
dislodged.  
The truck starts moving forward.  Pierre sets his gaze on the truck, in the 
distance, Aristide and Lloyd's press on to open the gate. 
The truck begins to make it out of the tight corner. 
It will take the big rig a little caution before it makes it out of the curve.
A few seconds later, the  rig picks up enough momentum to be back at full 
stride again.  Pierre's gaining ground on the big rig and the latter is 
beginning to gain momentum.  At the same moment, Aristide pulls the huge gate 
open.  He appeared to be exhausted from his effort but Lloyd is not.  He gives 
chase.  Pierre keeps on running at full stride into the back of the truck.   
His body slams against the cargo door of the truck he feels the truck jolt 
forward.  There's no time Lloyd is closing in faster than the rig is climbing 
the hill.  

Lloyd(running)
Where do you think you're going?

Pierre prepares to up.  
He paces his steps and lunges forwards grabbing on to the chain latch on the 
rear gate of the rig. He hoists himself up onto the little ledge.  
Lloyd's right upon the truck.  
He tries to reach for Pierre's injured foot but barely missed him.  This 
caused Lloyd to loose his balance and tumble forward onto the ground.  

Pierre(latched on to the truck) 
what the hell do you want from me?

No answer.  Aristide catches up with Lloyd to help him back up to his feet.  
Lloyd wants no help.
The two men stand watching as the truck heads down hill.  Pierre looks back at 
the two men.
The rig is now in full stride.  
As Lloyd gathered himself back up to his feet, he watches as the light of the 
rig fade away.  

Lloyd(walking back toward the manor)
Get the car

Aristide
But sire?

Lloyd
Don't worry, he's going no where.  Inform the others, everything is still as 
planned.

Aristide
Yes sir.

Cut to:  the precinct



Stamp
What the fuck happened here?

No one answers.  
He turns to the girls.  
They look back at him and then without actually saying a word, direct their 
glance at officer Bryant.  
Stamp(walking up on Bryant)
 What happened?  

Before he can respond, Titus speaks up barely able to stand on his own feet.

Titus
Nothing happened man!  Just a little fight between my man here and I.

Stamp (still looking directly at the rookie)
What do I look like?  You want to tell me you did that to each other?  You can 
barely stand on your own two and you want to tell me that you beat the crap 
out of each other?

Titus
That's what I fucking said OK!  That's what happened.  We fought!  Now, what 
are you going to do about it?

Stamp
Obviously, you haven't lost you tongue.  Good for you, you're going to need 
it. 

Titus looks at Bryant and smiles.

Titus
I'll see you soon!

Bryant (walking up to Titus)
Is that a threat?  Because it sounds like one to me.

They all walk out into the parking lot.
Stamp approaches the group, they walk away from him instead.

Stamp
Surely you don't think that I'm behind this now do you?


Lydia
Where the fuck were you hu?




Stamp(as Titus tried to hold Lydia back)
Hey you know what?  You stupid asses are really starting to get on my fucking 
nerves here.  I have the mayor on my ass asking me for answers on two murders 
in a span of 24 hours and all you fucking have to tell me is I got those 
officers to rough you up!

Titus tries to get a word in to no avail

Stamp
Do you have any idea when the last murder was committed in this town?  Do you 
have any fucking idea?  No none of you have a fucking idea what's going on 
here.  So shut the fuck up.  On top of that I have a missing or possibly 
kidnapped student.  Now do have something to share with me or not?

The crew stops to deliberate, Pierre was still their primary focus.

Titus
We're going to hit the main land and get Pierre.

Stamp
That sounds like a great plan and everything but how do you hope to do that?

Lydia(looking at Titus in question of his decision)
Yeah how exactly are WE going to get Pierre?

Stamp
Well the police ferry is departing in half and hour for the mainland!

Nannette
and?

Titus
And we're catching it with 'em

Nannette
Wait a minute!! What the hell is wrong with you?  You think you can throw your 
wait around and just decide whatever you want for the whole lot of us?

after a lot more arguing among each other, the crew decides to join Stamp and 
a few of the other offers with him and head out to the mainland. They all get 
on the ferry and head out to the mainland.



Act III

Cut to:  Mainland Cambridge Manor  

Stamp and co. touch down at Lloyd's manor.  
Police cars driving into the compound.  Sirens are blaring and lights.

Stamp(knocking)
Police, open up.  

The curtain of one of the windows slightly opens up.  Aristide is looking back 
at the group of people at the door steps.  He draws the curtain shut.
The door opens

Aristide
Good evening

Stamp
We're looking for two young men.  Lloyd Cambridge and Pierre Günter.

Aristide(standing in the door way)
I'm afraid I do not know whom you're referring to.

Stamp
You don't know whom I'm referring to?

Aristide
No, I do know master Cambridge.  This is, after all, the Cambridge residence. 
 Whom I'm unaware of is the other gentleman you mentioned.  

Stamp
Günter?

Aristide
Right, Gunter

 Stamp (showing a picture)
Actually its Günter, not Gunter.  Anyhow, you say you don't know him 

Aristide(looking at Stamp instead of the picture)
No sir, I'm afraid I cannot recall that face.

Stamp 
Can we speak to Lloyd?

Aristide (begins closing the door)
Master Cambridge is not able to attend to you right now.  He is a little under 
the weather.  Was there anything further?


Cut to
The kids are standing in the distance watching the whole thing unfold.  Randy 
is walking toward the maze.  The ground is disturbed.

Lydia(looking at Aristide)
That's him.  That's the guy from the airport'

Nannette
What?

Lydia(pointing at Aristide)
The guy with Pierre and Lloyd at the airport, that's him right there

Titus
Are you sure?

Lydia(walking off toward Stamp)
Yes.that's the guy.

Titus(to Lydia)
Wait up.. Randy com'on man.

Randy(back tracking)
Yeah.. coming up.

Cut to
Stamp (pushing the door)
Just a minute there, this is police business..





Aristide(opens the door and stands in the way)
Yes, but of course and I am certain that once you have a warrant to search the 
premises, you will be in the position to summon Master Cambridge from his ill 
bed.  Until then, gentlemen, please clear the premises and have a good night.
 
Stamp(reaching for his radio)
Alright boys let's clear this place.  Move out.

Lydia(running up)
That's the guy, that's the guy.  Don't let him go

An officer stops her.

Lydia
Let me go you asshole.  That's the guy from the airport.

Stamp(walking toward the officer and Lydia)
What the hell is going on now?

Officer(restraining Lydia)
She's going on about the butler

Nannette(running up and shoving the officer)
The guy she saw at the airport

Stamp
Hey cut it out officer, let her go.

Lydia
I saw him at the airport with Pierre and Lloyd.

Stamp
He says he's never seen Pierre Günter.  

Titus
And you believe him?

Stamp 
No but we don't have a search warrant so, until we get one, we cannot search 
the premises

Lydia
So that's it, Pierre's in there and no one knows what's going on in there.


Stamp(radio comes on)
Well there's not much we can do about that.

Titus 
What?

Randy(walking up on the discussion)
What's going on?

Stamp walks off to take the call.

Titus
Can you believe this,  Lydia saw that guy at the airport with Pierre and Lloyd 
but we can't search the fucking premises

Randy
How much you willing to bet that Pierre's not here.

Titus and the girls just look at him.

Randy
Did you see those tire tracks when we came in? Well, get this, I saw some foot 
prints by the maze back there?

Titus
What's your point?

Randy
There were two sets of prints!

Stamp(walking back toward the kids)
 Let's get out of here someone has a possible ID on your friends downtown.  
Around some club.
 
The police cars clear out of the property just as they came in.  a huge 
fanfare of noise and lights.
As they drive off, there's a dark shadow behind the study door, looking out of 
the window.  Its not Aristide.  Stamp looks out of his side view mirror and 
spots the figure.  
Aristide walks into the library.  He walks over to the cabinet and fixes 
himself a drink.  There's someone in the room.  He can tell for there's a 
wheezing sound behind the door.

Aristide(looking through the smoked mirror on the wall)
They're gone but I must reach the others before they uncover us.

Lady Van-Ess comes out of the dark and nods her head.




Cut to: on the road

Officer Bryant is riding with Titus and Stamp.  Randy is riding with the 
girls.  He hasn't said much since they got out of the precinct.  Lydia speaks 
to him but he doesn't seem to understand a word of what she's saying.  He 
keeps going back to the scene at the manor and picturing Aristide.  A sudden 
jolt from a bump in the road and Randy snaps back to reality.

Randy
Hun,

Lydia
What?

Randy
I though you said something!

Lydia doesn't answer, she just shakes her head no.  They are closing in on the 
city.
The traffic begins to stagnate.  They're on the bridge.  Cars pass them filled 
with young people.  They are drunk and loud.
Once they cross the bridge, they realizes that it is going to be virtually 
impossible to make it to the other end of the boulevard.  There is a club on 
the corner and there is a massive crowd in front of the club.  The noise level 
is off the chart.  Traffic is going in all directions.  The officers turn on 
their sirens.  The crowd is oblivious to the sirens.  After stalling for what 
seems like an eternity, Randy steps out of the second car.

Officer
hey get back here!  Where are you going? Hey! Hey!

Randy just keeps walking away.  He's trying to make it to the club across the 
street.  It's club DecaDance aka "Double D" , the single largest club in town, 
the place is packed with celebrities.  Someone bumps into Randy.  He clenches 
his side a quick reminder of his still bruised ribs.  The rest of the kids 
decide to get out of the police vehicles as well.

Cut to

Pierre is walking in from the end of the alley.  He sees the crowd as well 
unaware of what is going on.  As he approaches the main street, he notices a 
couple of officers.  Pierre rushes toward them.  As Pierre approaches, he 
realizes that the officers are holding some posters in their hands. As one of 
the officers makes a hand gesture, Pierre catches a glimpse of the poster.  He 
vaguely reads the words wanted.  A couple of teenagers bump into the officer 
as Pierre stands right up on the officers.  



Officer(dropping the posters)
Hey watch were you're going kid. and slow down

Kid(taking off running)
You watch were you're going asshole.

The poster is on the ground.  Pierre takes one look at it  and to his dismay 
his picture is the one on the poster.  The officer turns toward the teenagers. 
 Pierre ceases the opportunity to turn toward the main street.  The other 
officer grabs the kid before he's able to flee.  The argument escalates 
between the youngsters and the officers.  This causes more officers to 
converge on the scene.  Pierre sees a phone booth across the way he heads for 
the booth.  He crosses the street weaving through cars.  He's on the other 
side.  He walks into the phone.  Across the street one of the officers follows 
Pierre's movement.  He starts heading across the street as well.

Officer
hey, hey stop! Hey guys isn't that the dude

No one is listening.  The officers are more concerned with controlling the 
kids and in the mix of things, they fail to hear the other officer.  From the 
booth Pierre sees the persistent officer.  He's making his way across the 
street.  Suddenly, the officer intercepts a colleague in from him pointing at 
the poster and pointing over to the booth.

Pierre
Fuck 
Pierre walks out of the booth.  He heads up to higher grounds streaming 
through the crowd and still dodging the officers.  The officers are in pursuit 
and they are closing in.  Pierre maneuvers through the crowd and finds himself 
down another dark alley.  He hides behind a dumpster and waits for the 
officers to flash their lights.  They flash their lights and hit the dumpster. 
 

Officer#1
Let me go check it out

Right at that time they hear the crowd go wild another celebrity has arrived. 

Dispatch(voice over radio)
"All the officers report to the front of the club."

The two officers leave.  Pierre gets up from his hiding place.  He walks 
toward the side entrance of the club.


Bouncer
And where the fuck do you think you're going Mr.?

Pierre
Hey I was already in.  I just came out to take a leak you know long line in 
there.

Bouncer(pulling out a black light)
Let me see your hand

Pierre
What

Bouncer(grabbing Pierre's arm)
I said let me see your arm.

The bouncer scans Pierre's arms.

Bouncer
Wouldn't you do us both a favor and get outta here before I brake your face.

Pierre
But.. listen

Bouncer(pushing Pierre)
Get the fuck out of here.. now.  Don't make me wrinkle my shirt on you.

 Pierre walks off but he sees a reporter's van parked at the end of the alley. 
 Pierre manages to sneak into the van.  Inside he finds some media VIP passes. 
 Pierre  dons the neck pass.

Pierre(looking at his reflection)
Yeah that's what I'm cut out for. 

Pierre hears some foot steps outside the van and before he can do anything, 
the van door swings open and before him stand three guys all looking back at 
him.

Guy#1
What thewho you?

Pierre walks out of the shadows

Guy#2
Oh chill out dude, he's one of the reporters.  Hey man!  No big deal man they 
told us to come get some of the stuff out of the van.

Guy#1
Yeah!  I .. we didn't know that one of you guys was going to be out here and 
all..

The crowd noise from inside the club.



Guy#2
Com'on let's hurry up and get all that stuff in before she starts  tripping 
again.

The three guys start rushing to unload the rest of the material.  

Pierre
You guys need a hand?

Guy#2
Yeah sure. Don't mind if you do.

Pierre carries a tripod stand over his shoulder and walks into the club.  
He realizes that he is at the back stage.  Everything is going fast loud and 
crazy.  Pierre drops the equipment and wonders off.  He makes his way around a 
dividing stage curtain.  Once around it he peaks only to see a frantic crowd 
going wild and chanting for their idol.  

Pierre
Well, well what do we have here? 
Pierre stays backstage waiting for things to settle down. 
Pierre slumps down on the wall.
Hand lands on his shoulder.
Pierre spins around, fist clenched, only to face a short fat man with arched 
eye brows and frizzed hair that shields his receding hair line.

Short guy
What the hell are you doing?  What the hell are you doing?  You think I paid 
for you assholes so that you sit around and do nothing?  (Pierre tries to get 
a word in, to no avail) get up off you're ass and get to work.

Pierre starts walking in the direction of the other employees.  
Pierre sees two officers walking around the back stage he panics and reaches 
for some cable that's been laid on the ground.  





Short guy(stepping on the cable)
What the hell are you doing?

Pierre(yanking the cable from underneath his foot)
Get off the damn cable man.

Short guy
Do you know who you're talking to?
I'm Fabrice Fabien, promoter exceptionnelle to the stars.

Pierre 
That's great dude back off before you get hurt OK.  
Instead of slowing down, Pierre picks up his pace and heads into a crevice.  
Fabrice runs after Pierre.  Pierre barely gets out of sight before the 
officers make it to his former location. They patrol the area for a short 
while and head back to the front stage area.
The performer is up on stage.  The crowd roars.  The officers are all around 
the stage for the soul purpose of crowd control.  

Back stage;
Pierre's getting a face full from Fabrice.

Fabrice
I'm talking to you Mr.  Who brought you in?  which team are you with?  Are you 
tech support?

Fabrice keeps on rambling.  Pierre ignores him.  Instead, Pierre is looking 
around.  He dumps the cable on the floor.  Fabrice reaches up and smacks 
Pierre across the face.

Pierre(slams Fabrice into the ply wood wall)
What the hell is wrong with you?

Before the latter could say a word, Pierre had slaps him twice exposing his 
hair piece.  

Fabrice
Help, help me someone please help me!

No one can hear him due to the noise from the crowd.  
Suddenly, the music stops between songs.  The cries for help reach the 
officers on the others side of the stage curtain.

Officer#1
Did you hear that




Officer#2(on radio)
Disturbance at back stage locationen route to check.  Secure all exits and 
alert chief.

  They head to the back stage.  Pierre sees the officers approaching.

Officer#2(pointing at Pierre)
Stop

Pierre runs onto the front of the stage.  He walks onto the set.  The band is 
playing.  The crowd is going wild.   The officers follow him.

Officer#1
Come back here.  We just want to talk to you.  Don't do anything stupid

Pierre(backing up to the edge of the stage)
You've got the wrong guy.  I didn't do anything.  It was in self defense

Officer#1
Just come closer, get away from the edge.  

 Pierre looks back he's at the edge of the stage.

Singer
Jumpjumpjump

The crowd below him put their arms up.  Pierre looks back at the officers, 
then at the crowd.  He dives into the crowd.  The crowd cheers loudly  
carrying Pierre for a while before they drop him.  Pierre mingles through the 
crowd and makes his exit to the rest rooms.

Cut to: Outside the club

Stamp(on the Radio)
Where?  Repeat that!let's go people, someone spot your friend in the club.

Titus 
Com'on let's go get him.

Stamp walks up to the bouncer.

Stamp(flashing badge)
Clear the way police business

 


The bouncer, towering over Stamp, refuses to budge.  

Yet another celebrity arrives and this time it is Randy's turn to sneak in 
with the celebrity's entourage.  He is successfully in the club.  Lydia is the 
first to notice that Randy is in the club.  By the time she can point toward 
him, he disappears into the club.

Stamp(answering a call)
Did you hear what I said?  Get out of the way before I decide to shut down 
this whole club.
(he gets back on radio) Stamp. He what?  How does a person disappear from. 
What! 

Stamp turns off his radio and turns to the bouncer.  

Stamp
Listen junior you have three seconds before I slap these cuffs on you..

Bouncer(stepping up on Stamp, poking him in chest)
How exactly do you plan on doing that old timer?


 In one deft move, Stamp grabs the bouncer's finger, rotates inwardly causing 
the bouncer to lose his balance.  Stamp spins in the opposite direction.  This 
jerks the bouncer's body violently back toward Stamp.  Stamp strikes him on 
the bridge of the nose.  The bouncer is floored.

Stamp(straightening his overcoat)
Cuff him I've got your old timer right here.

Titus
Not bad old timer!

Cut to: The restroom

Pierre,  makes his way to the men's room.  As he forges ahead, he can see the 
top of the officer's hat in the distance.  They know where he's heading and 
worst of all, they're following suit.  Pierre enters the restroom.  

Pierre(pushing through)
Excuse me, excuse me

He walks into one of the stalls.  The crowded bathroom quickly empties out as 
the familiar voice of Fred Durst and Method Man echo through the entire club. 
 Pierre opens the stall's door and walks out.  He opens the bathroom door but 
he spots the two officers standing in front of the bathroom.  He looks around 
and sees the exit sign pointing to at the rear of the club.  He heads for the 
exit door.  Pierre forces the door open.  It wouldn't budge.   On the other 
side of the door, a couple of guys are leaning against the door.

Pierre(pushing the door)
Hey move from the door.

Guy on other side
Yo man move is some dude coming through

Guy leaning on door
Oh my bad

The door opens and Pierre exits at the same moment that the officers walk into 
the rest room. They hear the exit door shut.  They head toward the exit.  
Pierre's on the other side of the door.  This is the same hallway that leads 
to the rest room except for the fact that it was at the end of the club and 
there was an exit door leading to a street alley.  Pierre tries to open the 
door to no avail.  
Guy leaning on door
What the fuck you doing man?  Go through the front man that door is locked!

Pierre doesn't answer. He keeps pulling on the latch to open the door.  To his 
left is a steel black frame with a half table stuck to it.

Guy leaning on door(feels a bump)
Hey who the fuck is that?

Officers
Move from that door.  Police

Guy on the other side
Fuck you

Guy leaning o door
Yeah fuck you.  Let's block these mother fuckers in.

Pierre(back to steel door)
Block'em in

Guy leaning on door(reaching for something in his pocket)
Come on dude

Pierre follows.  The guy slides a peg of some sort in a grove on the table.  
The structure shifts.  It opens into a room.  The guy pushes Pierre in.  
there's nothing in this room except for the another massive door directly 
ahead of him.  



Pierre
Hello! Hello!

Pierre  looks around him.  the walls are covered with velour.  It's bright 
red.  The room is sound proof.  He turns toward the door that led into the 
room.  The door's no longer there.  Instead, it was an infinite stretch of  
the same red velour wall.  
There are no door handles, no door frames, no nothing.  

Cut to: The other side of the door.

The guys let the door open.  

Officer#1
You think that's funny?  This is police business do you understand that?

Guy leaning on wall
Hey man we didn't know who you were that's all.

Officer#2(flashing picture)
You seen this guy back here

Guy leaning on wall(grab picture)
No sir never seen him.

Cut to

Pierre banging on the same door that he had previously rushed into.  Nothing. 
 Pierre hesitantly walks toward the door ahead.   

Pierre(knocking on door)
Is anyone here?

 He hears a sound.  Pierre looks up.  There's a camera perched up on top of 
the door.  Pierre looks up into the camera as it focused its lenses on him.  
Door clicks softly and the massive door shift slightly.  Pierre steps back and 
listens to some soft music and muffled sounds in the distance.  He walks into 
toward the door.  Pierre extends his arm to the door.  The door opens 
inwardly.  On the other side of the door is an exotic beauty barely dressed in 
an Arabian outfit freely exposing her breast.  She reaches out to Pierre 
asking him for his hand.  Pierre does not extend his hand back at her.  She 
smiles.  He looks around  and reluctantly extends his hand back.  the lady 
takes his hand and starts to lead him.

Pierre(pulling back)
Just a minute there!  Where are we going?  Where's this place?  What the fuck 
is going on here?



She doesn't speak.  She keeps smiling and extends her hand to him again.  
Pierre doesn't budge.  She walks off into a better lit room.  Pierre follows 
cautiously.  In the room are more scantily clad women all looking more 
gorgeous than the other.  

Lady
Please, sit.

He obliges her.  A spectacle is unfolding in front of him, across the table in 
the booth, a figure is looking back at him.

Voice in the corner
Welcome,  Pierre Günter!
 
Pierre sits up.  Before he can move, the dark figure moves toward the poor 
light.  It is Lloyd.

Cut to: the club

Randy(walking up to one officer)
Where did you say you saw Pierre?

The officers look at him as though he's insane.

Officer
What?  Who are you?

Randy tries to identify himself but before he can say a word, the officers get 
a call and are asked to converge to the entrance of the club.  They leave 
Randy where he stands.  Stamp and the rest finally make it in the club.  

Stamp
So where is he?

Officer
I.we don't know, we followed him into the rest room and he came out through 
the back exit and..

Stamp
What.. what the hell is he talking about? (turning to the other officer)

Officer2
Well see the crowdand ..




Stamp walks toward Randy and stares at.  Randy looks at him and shrugs his 
shoulders pointing at the officers.

Cut to: The red room

Pierre is petrified looking at Lloyd.

Lloyd
OK, I think we got off on the wrong foot here Mr.  Günter.  I don't know what 
exactly happened to you back at the manor but never mind, it gives me the 
creeps also. And I grew up there.

Pierre still doesn't say a word.  He's looking around.  
Lloyd continues his monologue.  Pierre is oblivious to what he says until a 
girl slides across the booth bench and in one snakelike fluid motion.  Slides 
under the table.  She disappears, Lloyd slowly lets his head back.  The lady 
is now bopping her head up and down between Lloyd's laps.  Pierre now tunes 
back into the conversation.

Lloyd
So  is that a yes?  Good

Pierre(shocked)
What?..
A lady slide over to his side.  She's holding a drink.  The lady extends the 
drink over to Pierre.  

Pierre
No thanks ma'am.  Now what were you saying?

Another lady slips in  behind the first girl and spreads her legs diving face 
first between her legs.  Lloyd jolts from the chain reaction.  Pierre suddenly 
realizes that he is in the middle of some sort of orgy and Lloyd seems to be 
the ring leader of the group.  Pierre notices weird inscriptions on the walls. 
 The girl next to him extends her arms over his neck and subsequently makes 
contact with Pierre's face with her breast.  The temperature in the room drops 
slightly, Pierre sees her nipples constrict.  She rises in her seat.  She 
grabs Pierre's drink, stirs her finger into his drink but he doesn't notice.  
The lady leans back and pours the drink down her chest.  The drink spills onto 
Pierre's face Pierre is guzzling the drink and sucking on the hard nipple.  

Lloyd
Feeling it yet? Mr.  Günter?

Pierre
What, what's going on

Lloyd
Nothing you don't want to happen my friend.  See my dear Pierre.  I have a few 
things to show you and I need you to be open minded in order to understand 
what we are doing here.  Come with me Mr.  Günter,  please

Lloyd extends his hand to Pierre.  The latter looks around confused there is a 
slight glaze over his eyes.  Pierre follows Lloyd but he is being let by the 
sultry lady that was with him.  As they walk, the lady hands a chain over to 
Pierre.  He grabs on to the chain with a questioning look on his face.  Pierre 
tugs on the chain only to find out that it is attached to the neck of the very 
lady that gave it to him.  Pierre lets go of the chain.  

Lloyd(placing the chain back in Pierre's hand)
You hold on to that.  Don't, let go

They exit the booth and start walking down a corridor.  At the end of the 
corridor, stand two men.  Giants in stature.  Both men are holding tall 
staffed axes crossed to prevent anyone from entering.  As Lloyd approached the 
menacing looking men he extends both hands outwardly giving a sign to part the 
axes.  With that simple gesture, the two monsters draw their axes back.  
Lloyd, Pierre and the rest of their female entourage walk in.  the sight is 
ungodly.  Two steps lead down and in an area which seems like a furnished 
pool, what seems like a ton of people are part taking in an orgy.  Men, women, 
drugs, sex everywhere.  Pierre looks on confused.  Lloyd leads him down the 
stairs into the mêlée.  Pierre is immediately met with female hands reaching 
for him.  He slows down and turns to a woman seemingly needing some attention. 
 Pierre stops and looks back at the lady with whom he is.  She approves of his 
interaction with the needy lady.  Pierre drops to his knees and starts kissing 
this total stranger passionately.  

Lloyd(pulling Pierre up)
Let's not waste our time here.  Come

Pierre(resisting/slurred speech)
No, I want to stay here.

Lloyd
I have something better in stock for you.  Something I know that you would 
like.  Trust me, I know your style

Pierre(following reluctantly)
My style what the hell is my style? 


Lloyd(winking at Pierre.)
Trust me!!

 Pierre reluctantly picks up and follows Lloyd.  They keep on forging ahead 
through the orgy crowd until they reach another set of stairs leading back up 
and out of the pool.  
At the top of these stairs are two more guards identical to the first two 
guards.  Lloyd makes the same hand gesture and the two guards part their 
staffed axes as did the first two.  
Lloyd leads the rest through this area, they walk into another corridor.  In 
this corridor however, there are curtains on either side of the hallway.  

Noises coming from behind the curtains.  

Lloyd(to Pierre)
Easy there Mr.

Pierre(stops)
What the hell is going on in here?

Lloyd draws one of the curtains back.
A man bent over on his knees.  He appears to be in pain.  Behind him stands a 
lady clad in a tight leather corsage and a steel studded collar.  The man is 
in tears and he looks back to the Amazon lady.  She stands well over six foot 
five inches and is built like an athlete.  
Pierre follows her long legs and at the end of that leg that seem to go on for 
ever is a six inch stiletto ankle high boot.  Her other leg is perched on the 
back of the man on his knees.  The man is in pain because of the heel, 

Lloyd(pointing at the foot of the Amazon)
Look!

Pierre realizes that the heel is not digging into the back of the man, it's 
deep in his rectum, the pain only intensifies as the Amazon dominatrix churns 
her foot deeper into the man's hind side.  

Amazon
How would you like to see yourself cry?

Pierre looks back at Lloyd.  Lloyd only smiles and walks off.


Pierre
Hey, you going to help that guy or what?

Lloyd
Tell me Mr.  Günter, did you see any shackles on that gentleman?  What makes 
you think that he wanted to be rescued as you so well put it?
Pierre(looking back)
But

Lloyd
But.. but what?  No one could enjoy that?  Well you make a point there my good 
man see I'm not one for all that pain either but you see one man's poison is 
another man pleasure.

Lloyd reaches over to the lady following him and tugs on a chain between her 
legs.

Lloyd
Isn't that right dear?

The lady does not respond

Lloyd(pulling harder)
Isn't that right?

A muffled cry comes out of the woman.  She's in pain but she likes it.

Pierre
OK I get it that's enough.. hey, cut it out man.

Lloyd(getting loud)
How do you know when it's too much?  What makes you think that you understand 
pain and sacrifice?  Tell me Mr. Günter. 

Lloyd reaches up and grabs her nipple rings and pulls them as well.  She 
suddenly begins to shake and shudder uncontrollably right before Pierre.  

Pierre(rushing to her side)
Something's wrong

Lloyd(letting her fall)
No, nothing is wrong.  Everything is bliss 

Pierre crouches next to her.  She smiles back at him, beads of sweat on her 
forehead.  Pierre realizes what's happening.    Lloyd never stops walking 
away.

Pierre
Hey, we can't just leave her here!

Lloyd
Why not?  And besides, she's in good hands.  She is where she wants to be.  

Pierre turns around and sees hands reach from underneath one of the curtains 
and pull the lady's limp body into the booth.  

Lloyd
Don't worry Mr.  Günter, we are almost at our destination.

Cut to

Stamp
I want you to seal the perimeter.  I don't want anyone leaving this club till 
I say it's OK.

Officer
Sir.. there are celebrities .. tonight.  What do we do? 

Stamp
I don't give a cripple crap who's here just seal the damned place.. Now get 
to work

Randy
Hey, he's still in here somewhere.  He couldn't have walked out of here 
without your people seeing him.  All we have to do now is dig him out.

Titus
So,  where do we start?

Voice(in crowd)
Hey T, Randy, tell'em we're peops

Officer(chasing)
Come back here.  This is police business.

Voice(still running)
Hey, Titus!  Hey man tell him to get off me

It's Romuald.

Randy(hugging)
Hey Romi. What's up guy?  What you doing up here?  Where's Solonzo

Romuald
Man I told you we were going to be at Deca.  Forgot?  Man I don't know where 
that kid is dude?

Titus(coming from behind)
You seen Pierre?

Romuald
Who Günter?  What?  Günter's here? 

Stamp(barging in)
Who's this?

Romuald
Who you?

Randy
Easy, easy that's the chief inspector!

Titus
He's one of our friends

Stamp
Get him out of here

Titus
Wow, hold on just one minute. He was with us the night of the thing.  He rode 
with us

Stamp
Is that true son

Romuald 
Yeah that's true what's he talking about?

Randy
Never mind dude.  Pierre might be in trouble

Romuald
Yeah what's new?

Randy
No this serious dude somebody might be trying to kill him.

Romuald(turning to Stamp)
So where is he?

Stamp
I don't know.  You're his friends, you should have a pretty good idea.

Randy(looking backstage)
You make a good point.  I know just where to start from.  Com'on

Stamp
Backstage

Randy
That's where the media hangs out.  


Cut to

Lloyd and Pierre and the remaining two girls have reached the end of the 
corridor.  At the end of this corridor however, is a massive bronze double 
gate.  Lloyd walks up to them and knocks on the doors a window similar to the 
one that was at the main entrance opens 

Lloyd(walking up to window)
"Cambridge"

The doors open.  Lloyd unhooks the chain on his companions neck.  Pierre 
mimics his gesture and frees his companion as well.  Lloyd then leads the way 
for Pierre who hesitantly follows.  As they walk in Pierre takes a while to 
adjust his eyes to the scene given the fact that there are no actual lights in 
this room save a ton of candles.  Pierre adjusts his sight to the poor light. 
 There's a woman laid out on an inverted flat bed with an Indian collar around 
her neck.  The heat from the room slowly but surely causes the collar to 
shrink further and further causing the woman to suffocate, in the mean time 
behind her stands a man with an unusual tool which he is churning.  
There's a faint cry from the bound lady.  It is muffled by the chocker on her 
neck.  

Pierre
What the fuck?

 The man is winding a lever connected to a massive phallus.   This phallus has 
the lady spread eagle and at the brink of tearing.  Pierre looked to Lloyd for 
an explanation.  The more the man churns the more pronounced her moaning is.  
A crowd slowly begins gathering around the table.  She's turning pale.  Her 
eyes, blood shot red, are almost gouging out of their sockets.  

Pierre(whispering)
Hey do something!  She's gonna die!  Do something damn it!

 He  tries to intervene but Lloyd restrains him.
Lloyd(holding Pierre)
Just stay put my friend.. watch like the others.  Trust me!

Pierre looks around the room.  It seemed as if everyone else is in a trance 
thoroughly enjoying the scene.  
The man has almost reached a stop in his grinding motion.  
The victim lies there immobile.  
Her tongue sticking out.  
The crowd begins to converge upon her.  
The crowd is rubbing her body.
A lady leans over and locks her lips on one nipple.  
Lloyd move over to the head of the lady and feeds her opened mouth his penis. 
 
He reaches for a blade and starts moving toward her neck.

Pierre
No!  don't

Lloyd cuts the leather chocker.  The crowd cheers.  
The lady who was kneading the victim's breast is herself being ravaged by a 
midget, his face buried deep in her ass.  And then just as it slowly began, it 
all comes to an abrupt end.  Lloyd tenses up and ejaculates.  Lloyd staggers 
back and falls in a chair.
Pierre approaches the body slowly.  
There is a little bit of blood on the lady's nipple.  

Pierre(rushing Lloyd)
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

Lloyd(still in a daze)
What do you mean Mr. Guunter?

Pierre(walks up to him)
She's dead! And you're going down for that(turns to face the crowd) .. 
you're all going down..you hear me.

Lloyd(rising out of his seat)
Going down for what?  Having sex?  Please look around you, we're all 
consenting adults here.  Besides, there's no law against this.. or is there 
Mrs.  Chief justice.(he points to the body)

Pierre turns.  The lady is sitting up.  He moves along the body and places two 
fingers on the lady's neck to see if there is a pulse just at that moment, she 
bites his finger.  

Pierre(falling back)
What the fuck.

The crowd starts clapping.  

Mrs. Chief Justice(rubbing her neck)
You're quite right Cambridge.  I've always  told you that you'd make a better 
lawyer than doctor.


Lloyd(walking up to Pierre)
Meet Mr.  Guunter.

Mrs.C.J(wiping her mouth)
Is he one of us?

Lloyd
He is one to be.  

Pierre (walking up in shock)
You knew what was going on?  What the fuck is wrong with you people.  Are you 
all fucking insane? (he starts to back up as he speaks raising his voice 
hysterically).  What fuck?"

The crowd begins to converge on him.

Mrs.C.J(to Lloyd)
Are you sure he can be one of us?

Pierre
One of who?  Who the hell is Us?

Lloyd
I never said that he was one of us.

Pierre
One of what?

Lloyd
I said that he had the potential.

Mrs.C.J
I fail to see how

Pierre
What potential?  Will one of you start talking?

Lloyd
I've seen him in action and I know what he has done we are safe with him.  
Mother didn't think that he could be one of us either, but I know he can.
Mrs.C.J
How? 


Lloyd
Trust me.

Pierre 
What are you talking about?  I want some answers now.  (Lloyd signals him to 
calm down but this is to no avail)  get the hell off me.  I said I want 
answers now.  Fuck that as a matter of fact, I'm out of here.

He turns and meets a bat to the face.  He's out.

Cut to: The club

Stamp
Anything?

Titus
Nothing Here!

The officers shrug their shoulders.  Nothing there either.

Solonzo(hugging Titus)
Yo my man what's happening?  The whole crew's here

Titus
What's up junior?

Solonzo
Don't call me that

Titus
Anyway, Pierre is missing, and we're looking for Lloyd.

Solonzo
What?

Titus
Never mind. I'll explain later but right now we're looking for Randy

Stamp(pointing in an empty space)
Where did he go?

Officer
Who?

Titus
Randy, he's talking about Randy man.  Where did he go?  He was here a minute 
ago.

Nannette
I don't know but isn't that the guy from Lloyd's crib?

Lydia
Where?

Everyone's looking around.  Suddenly, Titus bellows out.

Titus
There,(he points to the back of the stage) that's the guy form Lloyd's crib.

Stamp looks toward the stage and spots Aristide.  He fades behind the stage.  
Stamp(chasing)
Hey! You on stage come out! Now

Aristide's gone.  Stamp tries to make it through the raucous crowd but the 
crowd is not moving.  

Titus(signaling)
Take the corridor.

Randy(from balcony)
I'm on him

Titus gets through the crowd.  He's backstage.  Aristide is in the distance.  
He can see Titus. Aristide sees officers ahead.

Aristide(staging panick)
The guy you're looking for is after me please help, I think he's dangerous.

Officer(to other officer)
Call for back up let's get this guy!

The officers head in the opposite direction.  Aristide takes another exit.  
They run into Titus.  

Titus(running toward them)
You seen him?

Officer(reaching for mace)
Stop right where you are pal.


Titus(back stepping)
What?  You're letting him get away.  What the fuck are you doing?

Officer2(on radio)
Officers requesting back up.. we're got the suspect

Titus(trying to run past them)
He's getting away

The officers  wrestle Titus down to the ground.  He tries to toss one officer 
off himself but to no avail.  Titus reaches for the officer's night stick and 
brandishes the weapon.  The officer  starts spraying.  

Titus(swinging the night stick)
Ahhh! What the..

The officer wobbles off barely conscious. 

Officer2(reaching for something)
You're fucking dead.

Stamp steps in just in time to prevent the officer from attacking.  Other 
officers arrive at the scene.

Stamp
Stop, every body stop.  What the hell is going on?  Where is the butler?  
Where did he go?

Officer
Who?

Lydia(kneeling by Titus)
The fucking butler you asshole.  The guy you were suppose to catch back stage

Stamp (reaching for Lydia)
Easy, easy everyone, we all on the same team here.  Now what happened to the 
butler?

Officer2
You mean the tall guy back stage? He told us that someone was after him so we 
headed back this way to stop the kid
 
Titus(finally getting back up to his feet)
You fucking moron, you couldn't catch a cold if it was handed to you


Officer
You want to shut your trap.  I've just about had enough of you

Stamp(slamming the officer against the wall)
OK enough!  I said ENOUGH.  Now you two go back there and try to locate the 
butler.  The rest of you (Pointing at the other officers)  seal all exits.  
Nothing leaves this building not till I say so.

Cut to: the dance floor

Stamp(walking on stage/ takes the mic)
Cut the musicI said cut the music.  This is Chief inspector Stamp. With the 
MPD.  Please remain calm.  The festivities are going to have to come to an end 
for tonight there an eminent potential danger in the club.  Please remain 
calm.
 

The crowd is mute.  

Voice out of the crowd
FUCK YOU

A bottle comes flying onto the stage.  The crowd goes wild and starts tossing 
tables and chairs.
They start fighting the officers.
The rest of the police force converges on the crowd trying to hold them back. 
 
Stamp's tackled to the ground.  
It's Titus pulling him out of harms way.  A chair flew right past Stamp's 
head.

Titus(on Stamp)
Come on, let's all go backstage before we get hurt.
Cut to

Randy's following Aristide, over looking him from the top of the club.  Randy 
watches Aristide's every move through the crowd.  
Aristide moves toward the back exit.  As soon as he makes it there, he reaches 
for the mirror on the wall.  

Officer Bryant(coming around the corner)
Hey you there!  Turn around slowly!

Aristide quickens his movement.  Randy is watching the whole thing from the 
top.  

Officer Bryant(reaching for side arm)
I said turn around slowly with your hands up.


Aristide(turning)
Easy there young lad, the guy you're looking for is back there, at the 
backstage area.

Officer Bryant
You just step away from that mirror and keep your hands where I can see them.


Aristide(moving closer)
I'm telling you, you're making a sad mistake.

Officer Bryant(stepping back)
OK, that's close enough.  I said that's close enough

Aristide(lowering his arms)
Why don't you put down your weapon?  I'm not whom you're really after and you 
know it.

Officer Bryant(on radio)
Officer requesting backup..

Radio
10/4 what's your location?

Aristide points over officer Bryant's shoulder.  

Officer Bryant
What?  You expect me to turn?

Randy(from top)
Look out!!!!!

Officer Bryant backs up into someone.  He turns around.  Three men face him.  
They holding weapons.  They start clobbering the officer.  

Randy
No!!!

Aristide(pointing at Randy)
Get him

Aristide turns and heads back toward the mirror.  One of the assailants starts 
escalating the massive drapery heading for the balcony.  Randy steps back in 
the balcony booth.  The others are beating down the officer.


Randy(leaping from the balcony)
Stop!!!

Radio
"Officer, what is your location? Come in officer! Officer come in!"

the radio is lying on the ground a splash of blood falls on it.  Aristide 
turns around and draws a sword from the cane that he's carrying.  Randy falls 
on the two thugs.  They all hit the deck one is knocked out on impact. The 
other is slowly getting back up to his feet.  Randy, clutching his side, 
stands between the thug and the officer.  He's facing the assailant.

Randy(back to Aristide)
Come onyou and me.

The officer is in the background coughing up blood.  The thug steps on the 
radio with a bloody boot smashing the device.  Randy capitalizes on his 
distraction and kicks him.  Randy fails to see Aristide approaching from 
behind with his sword drawn.  The other thug is back on the ground.   Randy 
turns to face him.  At the same moment he catches officer Bryant who collapses 
in his arms.  The latter eyes are rolled back he clings onto Randy.  Randy 
looks over him and sees Aristide drawing his sword out of officer Bryant.  

Randy
NO!

The other thug blind sides Randy.  Aristide runs back toward the mirror.  
Before randy can gather himself, the thug brandishes a vase over his head 
readying to smash it over Randy's head.

Stamp's voice
Drop it!!

Two shots are fires.  The thug stands balancing himself for a little while.  
One more shot is fired.  He falls back.  Stamp and the rest of the crew 
converge over Randy and officer Bryant.  From the ground, Randy can see 
through all the feet shuffling before him.  He sees the entry way shut.

Cut to: The shrine

Pierre awakes.  Pierre's eyes can barely focus.  He feels a strain on his 
shoulders.  Pierre is barely coming around.  He begins to make out various 
sounds.  His vision is slowly coming back into focus.  Pierre opens his eyes 
to the crowd before him. Before him is a banquet table adorned with food Lloyd 
is sitting at the head.  Everything vividly flashes back to Pierre.  He  
realizes that he's looking back at Lloyd from an elevated position.  Pierre 
turns and looks up.  His arms are strapped stretched wide apart as are his 
feet which are resting on individual ledges.  Pierre is on a crucifix.  
Furthermore, he's only wearing a loin cloth.  

Lloyd
Mr.  Günter, how reverend of you to join us.

Lloyd
Mr.  Günter, we are gathered here in your honor!  You see, we belong to a 
special community of affluent personalities, as you can tell but our, how can 
I say this, sexual orientation is apparently not acceptable in the eyes of 
society.  Actually, our kind is not acceptable in society.  (Lloyd's  voice 
gets louder and louder)  and do you have any idea why?  Can you tell me why?  
Every one wants to be aloud to do as well as they please.  Freedom of choice 
is what they call it.  Why can't we do what we want?  Tell me why?

Lloyd drives his fist onto the banquet table.  Pierre tries to speak but he's 
bound by a mouth piece.  Making it impossible for him to speak.  He muffled 
some words out.

Lloyd
Were you trying to tell me something?  Someone please take off his gag.  
Please, after all, he is our guest of honor.  Besides, no one could possibly 
hear him

Lloyd snaps his fingers and one of the guards releases Pierre's gag.

Pierre
What the fuck are you doing?  What do you want from me? What have I done to 
you?


Lloyd
See, I thought you were one of us at first.  At least I thought you had what 
it took be one of us.  You see the fact of the matter is I knew about the 
incident in the morgue.  If you recall, that night when you came back to the 
room, you were making fun of me because I was doing my laundry thing which you 
found totally unusual especially giving the time of night that it was.

Pierre
I recall now, the first time I made it to the room, you were not there.  I 
called Romuald to come get his keys.  You walked in with that laundry basket.

Lloyd
Ah yes the laundry basket, that was where my bloody clothes were.  You see I 
had an unexpected interruption while I was busy attending to one of the ladies 
in the morgue.  And you see that was when that cab driver walked in on me.  He 
had to die.

Pierre shocked/ entire murder scene reenacted without colour except for blood

Lloyd
You seem in shock, and I wonder why, after all, you kill someone as 
wellremember?

Pierre
I .I..

Lloyd
You what?  You did kill O'Toole didn't you?  But don't feel so bad my dear,  
the truth is I was on my way to the morgue to take him out but by the time I 
got there, the old gizzard was starting to deviate from the plan and I was 
getting worried.  He was going to talk to the police and so I was going to 
take care of him myself.you remember those mysterious corpses disappearing 
from the campus morgue don't you?  Well Liam was our inside man.  See he was 
behind all those disappearances. Anyway, long story short, I was going to 
rectify our problemBut there you were.actually I thought your friends were 
going to take care of him but then they lacked the finishing ability that you 
have

Pierre
It was an accident?  What do you want from me?  I never meant to kill him.  
What do you want with me?

Lloyd
Ah the burning question.  Well, at one point I thought that you might want to 
join us but I believe you saw too much in too little time at the manor.

Pierre
I wasn't dreaming?  Was I?  I did see the dogs in the maze, didn't I?  What 
was that?  Who are you?  Who are all you people

Aristide's voice(from behind Pierre)
What are we, would be a more deserving question to which's answer I would say, 
 we are the darkness from whence one came.

Pierre (trying to turn his head the best he could)
Show yourself!

Aristide walks around from the back of the room wearing a cloak like the rest 
but unlike the rest, his cloak is red in color and on his chest is a brand of 
some sort.

Aristide
Identify myself?  I am the high priest and these are my loyal subjects.  And 
you are our sacrificial lamb prepare to give your life for a worthy cause.

With those words resounding, the others began dancing as though they were in a 
trance.  The music gets louder.  The orgy resumes.  With one arm gesture, 
Aristide signaled and the banquet table split open emitting a foul stench.  
Bodies are popping out of the apparent tomb.  Aristide reaches into the pool 
of corpses and grabs an arm and pulls, the arm dislodged itself from the rest 
of the corpse.  Aristide raised the arm and passed it over a flame for a while 
and takes a bite out of the limb.  Pierre's nauseous from the scene.  He 
throws up spewing his vomit over the bed of corpses the subjects, seeing him 
do this, scramble into the pool and begin scooping up Pierre's vomit.  The 
entire scene is unreal.  Aristide raises his arm to speak.

Cut to: The mirror

Randy crawls his way to the table where Aristide was last seen.  At the same 
time the three thugs are subdued.  Stamp comes over to Randy.

Stamp
What are you doing?

Randy doesn't answer.  He just goes on tracing around the table fixture on the 
wall.  He tries to jerk it forward.  No result.  The table doesn't budge.

Titus
Hey man we got to go dude!  What are you doing?

Solonzo
Listen Bannerman, we need to move

Randy signals him to be quiet.  Titus approaches his friend.  Randy runs his 
hand at the bottom of the door.

Randy
Where did the butler go?  Did anyone see him disappear in the course of the 
fight?

Stamp(looking around)
"OK.  Surely you're not suggesting..The table?"

Randy
There's something weird about this table.  See, (he runs his hand on the 
floor), there is a gap here.  Its like there's a door right here.

They all converge on the opening and start tracing out a door frame.

Nannette
OK, there's a door so, what now?  How do you open it?

Randy doesn't answer, he keeps feeling around the table but his effort fail to 
yield results.  Stamp grows impatient.

Stamp
Is there a way to get in there or not?

Randy
I don't know?  I'm trying to find a way in.

Romuald
Is Pierre in there?

Randy
I don't know but do know that the butler went behind the door and if we can 
get to him, we can find out where Pierre is.

Lydia
Well let's open this thing then!

Stamp
Get me a ram now! Time is of the essence and I don't have much time to spare 
so let's knock this thing down and get on with it.

The officers radio for a battery ram.  Few minutes later, the ram was at the 
door site.

Officer
Step back we going to knock this thing down.

Cut to: The shrine

Lloyd stopped dead in his tracks.  He signaled the rest to be quiet.  They 
eventually start catching on.

Lloyd
Quiet, quiet do you hear that.

Aristide spins around with a look of disgust on his face.  You can hear a 
thumping sound coming from the main entrance.
Aristide
We must hurry my dear friends, for the non believers are at our door.  We must 
cleanse our selves before long.  Let's prepare the sacrificial lamb.

With that, the crucifix is cast over the pool of corpses.  Then a sudden turn 
away from the pool.  The massive bodyguards snap his restraints leaving his 
body to drop to the floor.  Pierre's free from his bounds.  The two guards 
pull Pierre up to his feet.  He's unable to stand on his own.

Aristide
Look at me lamb, the time is here and now.  Lay him on the altar.

Pierre tries to struggle free from the guards but they clearly over power him 
and lay him down on an altar table.  Pierre's body falls into a grove carved 
in the shape of a man.  The thumping on the door becomes louder.  Pierre's 
body is strapped securely onto the altar.  He can hear a faint sound.  Pierre 
turns helplessly only to see an infant in a crib lying on the floor. Mrs. 
Chief Justice approaches the infant.  She picks up the crib in which the child 
is and walks up to the altar.  Once there, she lays the baby underneath the 
altar.

Pierre
What's going on?  What are you doing?


Lady
The future leader of our order must be reborn in blood.  He must be reborn as 
the lamb's life passes, the new lord life begins.

Pierre
Why use me?  I'm no body.  I have nothing to do with you guys.  Please let me 
go.

Lady
All the contrary my dear friend, you are as integral to this as none other.

Pierre
Why?  How? 

At that very moment, the thump on the door echoed one more time.

Cut to: Charge in

Stamp(standing at the smashed down door  brandishing his weapon and waving the 
other in)
Let's go, go, go , go

Officers dash in,  running in all directions.  The noise suddenly stops 
everyone is looking around.  The room is empty safe a massive black metal 
door.  A couple of officers head over to the door and start banging on it.  
Their efforts are without reward.  The door does not budge.  They summon the 
battery ram.  But this is no task for the ram.  They bring in the explosives 
and after they clear the room, a detonation sends the metal door flying.  The 
assault resumes and the officers storm through the same areas that Pierre had 
been taken to.  They barge in on all sorts erotic activities.  As they search 
for Pierre, Stamp orders the arrest of the people involved in the elicit 
interactions.

Titus(leading the pack)
Pierre, Pierre, any signs of him yet?

Titus gets no answer from his query.  Randy still grabbing his ribs, forges on 
as if he knew that his counterpart would not be where the others were looking.

Cut to:  The shrine

Guard(running to Aristide)
They are in the first chamber, we must leave at once!

Aristide
Hold them back, we must complete the ritual at all cost.


Lloyd
We cannot take that risk! Do you realize who's out there?  The..

Aristide(running up the altar)
"Yes, I do realize who is out there.  Those are your counterparts whom you 
failed to eliminate and who traced you back to the manor.  Lady Van Ess is 
preparing at the manor for our arrival.  I don't suggest we delay any 
further..for your own well being that is.

With those words, Lloyd follows Aristide up the stairs they stand over Pierre, 
Aristide frantically started spreading some sort of oil on Pierre's forehead. 
 Pierre battles with Aristide all through the ritualistic preparation.  Pierre 
hears the noise from the other chambers approaching his location.  At the same 
time Lloyd starts writing some inscriptions on Pierre's chest.  Aristide seems 
to be losing his grasp of the situation.  He drops the brush that he's using 
to write the inscriptions on Pierre.  Aristide bends down to pick up the brush 
at that very moment, Pierre begins crying out loud for help.  Both Lloyd and 
Aristide scramble back to the altar, in an attempt to silence Pierre.  Lloyd 
covers Pierre's mouth with his hand.  The latter bites him and resumes his cry 
for help.  Aristide strikes Pierre on the face rattling the latter's jaw.  
This temporarily silences Pierre.

Cut to: The charge

Randy(with his finger over his mouth)
quiet, do you hear that?

No one responds.  They all stand still quiet trying to make out what Randy's 
talking about.  Suddenly, a muffled but distinct sound comes from the chamber 
ahead.  Randy starts running in the direction of the sound.  Titus and the 
girls follow him.

Stamp
Wait what are you doing?  Wait for back up.

The crew never  slows down.  Stamp rallies the officers to his location.


Cut to:  The shrine

Aristide
This could have been a noble act on your behalf but I realize that you are not 
willing to participate so, I don't have a choice except to do what I have to.

Lloyd is on his way over to assist Aristide.  He stops.  There's a crashing 
sound from the outside door.  Lloyd, Aristide and the others turn and face the 
door.  

Aristide(to guards)
Block the entry.  Do not let them in.

No sooner do they make it to the door does the latter come crashing down and 
in rush Randy and the others.  Panic spreads across the room.  The guards 
tackle some of the officers but the boys in blue outmatch the guards.  Very 
soon their resistance is brought down.  In the mean time, Pierre's lying on 
the altar table.  Standing over him is Aristide holding an ancient weapon.  
Pierre is still screaming for help.  

Officer(aiming at Aristide)
Stop, drop your weapon

Aristide does not respond.  Gun shot.  Aristide drops to the ground.  The 
officer is holding his hand gun with smoke coming out of the barrel.  Randy 
dashes to the altar, picks up the weapon from the floor.  He starts cutting 
the restraints from Pierre.  

Randy
Hey, you alright? 


Pierre(shocked& laughing)
Bannerman?  Never thought I'd say this, good to see you

Titus comes running to help Randy stand their friend.  

Titus(pointing at the pool)
What the fuck is that smell?  What the fuck is that?

They stand of either sides of Pierre and carry him of the table.  Pierre is 
trying to walk the best he can.  

Pierre(jerks his body up and violently falls back.)
Ahh

He's been slashed across the back by Mrs. C.J.  His blood splashes across the 
altar and the walls.  Randy turns around.  He barely dodges the blade of the 
boomerang shaped knife.  Mrs. C.J is swinging the knife violently at Randy, he 
backs up and runs into Titus.  

Mrs. C.J
Die you unbelievers.  Die.

She jumps on Randy he tries to hold her up but he loses his balance in the 
process.  Randy falls back on Titus.  She's on top of him.  All three of them 
hit the ground hard.  Randy prevents the blade from driving into his eye.  
Mrs. C.J bares down her weight on the weapon.  She's screaming they both 
struggle.  Randy tilts his head to the right and dodges the plunging knife in 
the nick of time.  He tosses her off himself.  Randy gets up and squares up 
against her.  She charges on.  Out of no where, a close line that almost 
decapitates her.  Its Nannette, she's holding one of the guard's staffs.  She 
drops the staff and rushes to Randy's aid.  No sooner is Nannette next to 
Randy does Mrs. C.J jump back to her feet and resume her attack.  Nannette 
spins around, reaches for the staff, wedges it in the corner projecting it 
toward the assailant.  Mrs. C.J takes flight.  She falls on the staff impaling 
herself.  She gyrates violently, with her blood spilling over Nannette and 
Randy.  She swings her weapon one last time before dropping it to the ground. 
 

Nannette(holding staff)
Oh no no

The assailant stares back at her lifelessly.  


Randy(scrambling to his feet)
Are you OK?  Nette, are you OK?

Nannette(expressionless)
Yesyes

Randy(pulling the staff out of her hands)
Its OK.  Its OK.(yelling to others)..somebody help.  Stay here, I'm going to 
go check on Pierre..Pierre!  Pierre! 

Randy looks in Titus's direction but the latter is out.  He  looks back at the 
altar.  Aristide is on the ground crawling toward Pierre's body.  Randy crawls 
on the ground toward the altar as well.  He makes it up the first step.  
Aristide is closing in on Pierre.  Randy makes it up the second stair, 
Aristide is now lying next to Pierre, he reaches in his pocket for a knife.  
Randy can see what's going on but he's still one stair away from doing 
anything.  He looks back at Nannette but she's frozen stiff still in shock 
from what happened.  Randy quickly turns to Titus.  The latter seems to be 
finally coming around but not soon enough.  In a desperate effort, Randy leaps 
up to stop Aristide.  Aristide on the other hand is getting ready to slash 
Pierre from ear to ear.


Randy
Stop

Randy stretches and grabs Aristide's hand before Aristide is able to slash his 
friends throat.  Pierre is cut, again, this time on the neck and he's 
bleeding.  Randy and Aristide are wrestling on the ground.  
A cry from Nannette.  
Randy turns and sees Lloyd holding Nannette by her hair with a knife to her 
throat.

Lloyd
Get off of him.  Or its her neck.

Randy
Don't do it man let her go!

Lloyd pulls her hair further exposing Nannette's neck.  Randy is still holing 
on to Aristide's arm.  Randy looks back at Lloyd and Nannette, he looks over 
Lloyd's shoulder, one of the officers is coming up on Lloyd from behind.  
Randy winks an eye at Nannette and turns to Aristide.  Lloyd gets ready to 
plunge the knife into Nannette's chest.  As soon as he lifts his arm, Nannette 
strikes him in the stomach, he's slightly disoriented the officer jumps on 
Lloyd from behind.  Lloyd swerves the officer.  Nannette tries to run off.  
Randy is still wrestling with Aristide.  Titus doesn't know who to assist, 
Randy or Nannette and the officer.  Aristide over powers Randy and gets on top 
of him.  Randy wedges his feet under Aristide and pushes as hard as he can 
sending Aristide falling backward down the stair.  As Aristide's tumbling body 
comes to a stop at the bottom of the stairs.  He's lifeless.  Titus comes over 
and turns the limp body.  Aristide broke his neck on the stairs.  Lloyd is 
still battling the officer.  He breaks away from the officer and starts 
heading fro Nannette.  He picks up a club and tries to strike her with the 
weapon.  Titus steps in.  He covers Nannette.  Titus turns around only to meet 
another strike to the face this time.  He is shaken.  

Stamp's voice
Drop it

Lloyd stops with his hands above his head still holding on to the club.  He 
pauses and turns slowly to see Stamp and a few other officers holding their 
weapons pointing at him,  Lloyd turns back around and violently strikes Titus 
one more time before being brought down by the thundering sound of several gun 
shots.  Lloyd hits the ground with a smile on his face falling into Titus' 
laps.

Cut to: Epilogue

There are ambulances every where, some paramedics are working on Pierre.  He's 
going to make it.  Randy is banged up and he's leaning on Nannette just as 
Titus is leaning on Lydia.  The friends all follow the stretcher carrying 
Pierre.  They all get aboard the ambulance watching as the other members of 
the cult are being hauled onto the police wagon.  
Three stretchers are brought out with body bags on them.  The three bodies are 
Lloyd,  Mrs. C.J and officer Bryant.  Pierre starts to speak, his voice is 
faint.  The paramedic urges him to relax and sleep but Pierre is insistent 
pointing at his friends.

Romuald
Hey I think you nailed your story this time kid.  Try to rest.

Solonzo
I can see the headlines on campus..hero saves the day with a pen..

Romuald
What?

Solonzo
You know a pen. You know like a pen is mightier than a sword. You know like 
he's a writer so..ah never mind.

Pierre is still trying to speak, he takes off his oxygen mask.

Lydia
Hey, let him speak!

Nannette
What is it?

Pierre(Signaling her closer as he spoke)
The baby.

Nannette
What?  What are you saying?

Titus(moving in closer)
Move.  What is it Pierre?

Pierre
The baby!

Titus
Did you say the baby?

Titus(turning to the others)
I think he's delirious, he said something about a baby!


Stamp
What?  What baby?..(to officers)find that baby!

While they're trying to figure out what Pierre's talking about.  The ambulance 
starts moving toward the hospital.  All the officers are looking around trying 
to locate the so called baby.  There was no sign of this baby.

Cut to: The Manor
The manor's as quiet as ever,  Lady Van Ess is standing by the fireplace. 
She's motionless looking into the fire.  In the distance, the distinct sound 
of some foot steps draw nearer and nearer to the sitting room in which Lady 
Van Ess is awaiting by the fireplace.  As the steps draw closer, she
spin her wheelchair around and in the door way stands Aristide and he's 
holding an infant in his arms.  A smile comes across Lady Van Ess' face.

The END

FADE OUT
