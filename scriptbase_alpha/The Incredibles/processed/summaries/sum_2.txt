Fifteen years ago, superheroes walked the streets of Metroville, performing acts of great heroism and inspiring many to follow their example.
But a string of lawsuits by disgruntled people they'd helped lead to political and public outcry, and the Supers were forced into retirement and government-funded anonymity.
Bob Parr used to be Mr.
Incredible, one of the greatest and strongest Supers; now, he lives a mundane life as a suburban insurance agent.
Although his wife Helen (formerly Elastigirl) has moved on and is more concerned with raising their children Dashiell (who is super-fast and super-confident), Violet (who can turn invisible - and is super-shy) and baby Jack-Jack than battling evil, Bob still yearns for the good old days - and his chance comes when he is approached by a shadowy government organization and asked to join their numbers.
But all is not as it seems, and Bob will find himself trapped by Syndrome, an embittered enemy who in his youth once idolized Mr.
Incredible - and only his family will be able to save him now...
