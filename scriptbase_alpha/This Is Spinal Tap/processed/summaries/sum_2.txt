Marty DeBergi is a film-maker who decides to make a documentary, a rockumentary actually, about the world's loudest band, the British heavy metal group Spinal Tap.
The movie is in fact a biting satire and spoof of the whole rock and roll scene that passes itself off as a real documentary of a real band.
Hilarious behind-the-scenes footage is combined with faux-concert clips to breathe life into the imaginary group.
