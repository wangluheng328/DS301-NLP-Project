The galactically feared, universally despised Ivan Ooze is released from a hyperlock chamber after six millennia.
The first thing on his agenda - conquer Earth.
A plan which involves revenge on his imprisoner, and mentor of the Rangers, Zordon!
The Rangers, stripped of their powers, must journey to a distant planet and seek the fabled Great Power - the only thing capable of saving Zordon and restoring their lost powers.
It's a race against time as the rangers, using the power of Ninjetti, struggle to restore their powers, save Zordon and defeat Ivan.
