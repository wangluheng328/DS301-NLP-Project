</b><b>                   REVISIONS BY ARNE OLSEN
</b><b>                   DIRECTED BY BRYAN SPICER
</b><b>                 REVISED DRAFT OCTOBER 31 1994
</b>
<b>  FADE IN:
</b>
<b>  BLACK SCREEN
</b>
  Words SCRAWL UP ON SCREEN and we hear a RESOUNDING VOICE.

<b>                              VOICE
</b>               In a time of great strife, a
               legendary interdimensional being
               known as Zordon, came to the city
               of Angel Grove to establish a
               vanguard in the never ending
               struggle against evil.  with the
               aid of his trusted assistant,
               Alpha 5, the noble master sought
               out six extraordinary teenagers
               and gave them the power to
               transform into an unstoppable
               fighting force.  In time of great
               need, the young heroes could now
               call upon colossal assault
               vehicles known as "Zords".  while
               the identity of the six remained
               a guarded secret, their
               courageous exploits soon became
               the stuff of Legend, earning them
               the title...  The Mighty Morphin
               Power Rangers.

We hear PUMPING ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC as the POWER RANGER'S LOGO
BURST'S ONTO THE SCREEN.  Now the logo EXPLODES, revealing


<b>1   EXT.  PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY                             1
</b>
A prop plane whisking across the deep blue sky.

<b>                              ROCKY
</b>               YeeeoowwWWWWW!!!


<b>2   INT.  PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY                             2
</b>
The six Power Rangers, TOMMY, KIMBERLY, BILLY, AISHA, ADAM and
ROCKY sport sleek sky diving suits, parachute packs and 
helmets.  Tommy is strapped into a high-tech airboard.

<b>                              ROCKY
</b>               We're OUTTA here!!

<b>                              KIMBERLY
</b>               Easy, Rock.        

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               Once we hit the target zone we've
               got fifteen seconds to make the
               drop.

<b>                              BULK  (0 . S .)
</b>               Step aside, pinheads.

BULK and SKULL push their way through the Rangers, decked
in bizarre skydiving regalia, topped off by World War II
leather caps and aviator goggles.
<b>     
</b><b>                              BULK
</b>               The Stealth Eagle is about to
               fly.

<b>                              SKULL
</b>               Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.

The Rangers exchange amused looks.  Aisha gestures to them

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               Lead on, flyboys.

Bulk and Skull swagger to the door and open it - the ground
is a dizzying distance below.  They swallow hard.

<b>                              SKULL
</b>               Bulk... where'd the earth go?
<b>               
</b><b>                              BILLY
</b>               Five seconds to the target zone!

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               Aisha  you' re  on !

Bulk and Skull step aside, Aisha LAUNCHES herself.

The others follow through the opening with flair.

<b>                             ROCKY
</b>               Stylin!

<b>                             ADAM
</b>               On your tail!
<b>              
</b><b>                             BILLY
</b>               All systems

Tommy and Kimberly share an infectious glance, Kimberly
a hand, indicating Tommy should go first.

<b>                             TOMMY
</b>               Surf's up!

He's gone.  Kimberly stands backwards in the doorway.

<b>                             KIMBERLY
</b>               Catch you on the flipside.

Bulk and Skull watch wide-eyed as she BACK-FLIPS
out of the plane.


<b>3   EXT. SKY  -  DAY
</b>
ROCK AND ROLL fills the track as the Rangers plunge towards
earth, executing a series of MIND-BOGGLING MANEUVERS: SPINS,
FISHTAILS, POWER DIVES, BACK FLIPS, you name it.

<b>4   INT. PROP PLANE  -  DAY                          4
</b>
Bulk and Skull psyche themselves up.

<b>                              BULK
</b>               Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.

<b>                              SKULL
</b>               Be the swallow.  Be the
               swallow...

They take deep breaths then CHARGE THE DOOR.

<b>                              BULK AND SKULL
</b>               Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!

Naturally, they get STUCK, wedged shoulder to shoulder.
THE PILOT glances back, CHUCKLES and BANKS THE PLANE.


<b>5   EXT. PROP PLANE - BARREL-ROLLING - DAY
</b>
Bulk and Skull rotate into frame.  Now, facing straight down --
they FALL INTO CAMERA, CLINGING TO EACH OTHER DESPERATELY

<b>                              BULK AND SKULL
</b><b>               YEAAAAAAHHHHHH!!
</b>
<b>6   EXT.  SKY  -  DAY
</b>
The Rangers pull off more SPECTACULAR MANEUVERS
then swoop TOGETHER, interlocking hands and forming a
<b>PERFECT CIRCLE
</b>
They look to one another and a moment of pure magic passes
between them.  It's not  usual the exhilaration of flight they're
sharing, it s the exhilaration of togetherness, of being part
of a team.

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               Let's BREAK!!

They disperse and yank their rip-cords.  The sky BURSTS TO LIFE
WITH SIX BLOSSOMING PARACHUTES -- white, pink, blue, yellow ,
red and black in color.

<b>7   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK  -  DAY                               7
</b>
FAMILIES eat hot dogs and cotton candy at a huge fundraiser .
A large banner proclaims "SAVE THE OBSERVATORY."  We see
diving teams with labeled uniforms -- the BOWLING TEAM, ANGEL
GROVE P.D.  and the FIRE DEPARTMENT.  There s a large white
"BULLSEYE" spray-painted on the grass.  The city's
spectacular large skyline rises out of the b.g.

A SPUNKY MR. KELMAN stands at a podium, speaking into a mic.

<b>                              MR. KELMAN
</b>               Okay, so the firemen landed four
               out of six inside the target --

A BOWLER shouts out playfully.

<b>                              BOWLER
</b>               How `bout a show tune?!

Mr. Kelman feigns seriousness.

<b>                              MR. KELMAN
</b>               Somebody wanna keep chose bowlers
               in line.

A hip thirteen year old, FRED KELMAN, yells out as he points
to the sky.

<b>                              FRED
</b>               Hey dad, get with the program!

<b>                              MR. KELMAN
</b>               Ladies and gentlemen, it's Angel
               Grove High

ANGEL ON TARGET - AS AISHA touches down flawlessly.
<b>                       
</b><b>                              MR. KELMAN
</b>               And that's one!  A perfect
               landing!

Aisha clears, then Billy and Adam land toqether.

<b>                              MR. KELMAN
</b>               Three for three.  Look at `em go!
<b> 
</b>Billy and Adam clear and now Rocky and Kimberly come in.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MR. KELMAN
</b>               That's five perfect landings!
               Now it's all up to Tommy Oliver.

Everybody watches with dumbfounded expressions as Tommy SAILS
IN ON HIS AIR BOARD AND SLIDES INTO DEAD CENTER.  He spreads
his arms wide.

<b>                             TOMMY
</b>               Touch down.

The families CHEER and APPLAUD as they surge forward to
congratulate the Rangers.

Mr. Kelman and Fred approach Tommy -  Fred and Tommy exchange
stylish hand slaps.

<b>                              FRED
</b>               Looking good up there.

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               Thanks, man.

<b>                              MR. KELMAN
</b>               Congratulations - the
               Observatory's got a new lease on
               life.

<b>                              FRED
</b>               Awesome!   Ryan's Comet is passing
               over in two days!

The other Rangers approach.

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               Who's up for lunch?

<b>                              ROCKY

<b>8   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK  -  DAY                              8

We hear a VOCIFEROUS SISSING SOUND, but we can't see where  it's
coming from. - Suddenly the six Rangers come SCREAMING AROUND A
CORNER ON STATE-OF-THE-ART ROLLERBLADES.  These kids are FLYING!!
<b> 
</b>We hear FULL-THROTTLED MUSIC as the kids WEAVE, DUCK and SWERVE
like blading virtuosos.  Tommy LEAPS in the air, does a 180 and

The Rangers GLIDE around another corner -- there's buildings on
one side of them and a construction site on the other.

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               Let's take the shortcut!

Tommy leads them up a plywood ramp -- they LAUNCH TEN FEET
<b>THROUGH THE AIR, PULLING OFF HAIR-RAISING FREE STYLE MOVES THEN
</b>MAKE SPECTACULAR LANDINGS on the construction site parking
structure.

As they shoot across the concrete, the CAMERA PUSHES IN on:

10   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTtZUCTION SITE - DAY                   10

... WORKERS operating heavy machinery -- cranes, bulldozer ,
etc., Construction Worker  jackhammers solid rock.  Drill
makes a CLANGING SOUND as it HITS METAL!  A baffled look comes
over him as he stops the jackhammer, brushes away debris..
uncovering an ANCIENT IRON PLATE.  He gapes at it, too stunned
to speak.

<b>11   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER                  11

A large hook has been fastened to the iron plate -- a crane
ENGINE ROARS as it HOISTS THE PLATE UP, revealing a CAVERNOUS
<b>OPENING.
</b><b>    
</b>TWO MORE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS have joined the first, all of
them look on in amazement.

something really amazing happens.   ..

A menacing STONE CLAW RISES UP, CRADLING A HUGE STONE

The Rangers are at a table -- Tommy is teaching Fred martial arts
moves.

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               It's one smooth move and then

Tommy executes a wicked JUMPING ROUNDHOUSE KICK.  Fred is
wowed.  He drops into position.

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               Nice and easy.

The jovial proprietor, ERNIE, approaches the Rangers' table
with a loaded tray.  Fred pulls off a dazzling JUMPING
ROUNDHOUSE KICK and almost knocks Ernie's tray over.

<b>                              ERNIE

Ernie moves off after Bulk and Skull.  Tommy's wrist

private area.

INTO SIX IRIDESCENT COLUMNS OF COLOR.  The columns SHOOT UP
THROUGH a giant oak tree, KNOCKING LEAVES LOOSE.

</b>Barricades and police tape surround the egg.  A  SECURITY GUARD
passes his sleeping CO-WORKER, drops into a chair, sips his
coffee.                   

BZZWAPP -- ZEDD, RITA, GOLDAR and a short, fat, furry creature
named MORDANT appear.

               warned me this would happen!
               Rita, she said, after 89
               marriages you might wanna think
               about throwing in the towel.  Why
               didn't I listen to her?!

Zedd grumbles to himself.

<b>                              ZEDD
</b>               That's a good question.

The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy.

<b>                              FIRST SECURITY GUARD
</b>               Uh... Kurt...  you might wanna

Kurt looks up groggily.

<b>                              ZEDD
</b>               No need to wake him.  In fact,
               why don't you take a little nap
               yourself.

Zedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are
knocked out.

Goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or
Mordant's foot.  Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg.

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!

Goldar is oblivious.  Zedd, stands reverently before the
glowing egg shape.

<b>                              ZEDD

               times removed on my mother's
               side.  He`s just visiting for the
               summer.

<b>                              RITA
</b>               Well put a muzzle on him!

Mordant GRUMBLES under his breath.  Meanwhile, Zedd aims  is
staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy.  The egg
opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air.  webs of
ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE.

When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT
OOZE.  The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in  o
the sticky substance.

<b>                              RITA

               years looking for this tub of
<b>               SNOT!
</b>
As if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS.  Zedd and Rita
are too busy arguing to notice this.

<b>                              ZEDD
</b>               Don't you ever have anything nice

</b>               Well, if I did I certainly
               wouldn't say it to you!

We hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP
AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE.  Mordant tugs at Zedd.

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               Boss.

Zedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips
apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of
<b>GLISTENING SILVER.
</b>
He stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts
his hands on his head, CRACKS it.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Ahhhhhhhh.

Now he SMACKS his lips together, opens his arms theatrically
and gives his trademark stance.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE

<b>                              ZEDD
</b>               I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of

               is a supreme honor to finally
               meet you.

Ivan gives a slight bow.

<b>                              IVAN

</b>               Do you recall the name...  Zordon
               of Eltare?

Ivan's face goes dark, THUNDER RUMBLES and the site LIGHTS UP
WITH A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  Mordant turns to Goldar.

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               Seems to ring a bell.

                              IVAN (hissing)
               I will not only destroy him, I
               will OBLITERATE his entire being.

<b>18   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT                             
</b>
On cue, the Power Rangers TELEPORT into the construction site.

They're surrounded by rock piles, pools of water and a plethora
of building supplies.  Billy looks down at the mud puddle he's
standing in.

<b>                              BILLY
</b>               Remind me to have a word with
               Alpha about his teleporting
               calculations.

They survey the construction site for a moment.

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               Anybody see anything?

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               ... Let's take a look over there.

They advance up a slope -- the egg comes into view.

                              ROCKY (alarmed)
               It looks like it's been opened!

The kids get close to the egg, looking it over with
fascination.  Suddenly a hand falls on Aisha.

<b>                              SECURITY GUARD (O.S.}
</b>               Hey!

They all whirl around and see the first Security Guard.  He
half smiles, shaking his head.

<b>                              SECURITY GUARD
</b>               You had me scared there.

<b>                              AISHA

</b>               You haven't by any chance seen
               a ... morphological being lurking
               around?

<b>                              SECURITY GUARD

               And you know... if there's one
               thing in the world I reeeeally

               Not much has changed in six

Ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Ooooh, where's my autoqraph

He looks them over reproachfully.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is
               still using a bunch of rug-rats
               to do his dirty work.  And
               speaking of rats...

Ivan raises both hands -- ELECTRICITY SHOOTS OUT HIS FINGERS
and the kids DIVE CLEAR as the bolt ZAPS A THRONG OF RATS.

Now, incredibly, the RATS GROWN INTO GRUNTING, SNARLING MAN
<b>SIZED RAT-BEASTS.

The RATS ATTACK!

Tommy gets off a stellar CROSS-HOCK TAKEDOWN, Kimberly delivers
a world class HEEL STOMP, Billy executes a lethal REVERSE
HANDSWORD.  Despite their valiant efforts, the Rangers ar
being overwhelmed by the fierce combatants.

<b>19   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

SMOKE POURS from various circuit boards, numerous control

There's a BLEET, BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near
the entrance.  Alpha watches, forlorn, as OOZE SEEPS through
the hairline cracks in the door.

<b>                              ALPHA 5
</b>               Well...  ALMOST nobody.

The ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR, once again
IVAN RISES UP.  He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings.

<b>                              IVAN

               well over SIXTY centuries you can
               buy something pretty nice.

Alpha drops into a Karate stance, makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES
then LUNGES.

<b>                              ALPHA 5

Ivan holds his arm out, ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge
Alpha starts spinning.

Ivan slowly circles Zordan's column of light, Zordon turns
with him.

<b>                              IVAN

               like to be cooped up in a rotten
               egg for six thousand years?  It's
               BORING!  Not to mention I've had
               a Charlie horse since the

</b>IVAN raises his hands - he  is holding  a flute and he PLAYS A FEW

</b>               ... it's time to pay the PIPER!

He uses the flute like a lightning rod --  A BOLT OF LIGHTNING
<b>BLASTS A PANEL TO SMITHEREENS.
</b>
<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Oh, the things that I have
               missed.  The BLACK PLAGUE!

He blows up another PANEL.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>
               The SPANISH INQUISITION!

<b>             
</b>               The  70's!

HE BLOWS UP ANOTHER PANEL.  Ivan CASTS ANOTHER LIGHTNING BOLT,
<b>DEMOLISHING AN ENERGY PILLAR.
</b>
<b>                              IVAN
</b>               And now, finally, I have the

Now Ivan begins to THROW LIGHTNING EVERYWHERE, LAYING
<b>THE  COMMAND CENTER TO WASTE.

Ivan laughs in the b.g.  as Alpha continues to spin,
moving  his arms in and out.

</b>Two rats charge Aisha and she LEAPS UPWARD - the pair SMASH
into each other.

Rocky picks up a two-by-four and starts SPARRING with another
rat.

Billy SHOVES A HUGE WOODEN-SPOOL down a slope and it
<b>ROLLS INTO A COUPLE OF RATS, BOWLING THEM OVER.
</b>
One rat CRACKS IT'S TAIL like a whip, KNOCKING Adam to
the ground.

Another rat gets Kimberly in a bear hug and she makes a
face.

<b>                              KIMBERLY

She grabs a handful of his whiskers.

</b>               Somebody needs a shave.

She YANKS THEM OUT, the rat SQUEALS and releases her.  The
fight well, but the rats start to get the upperhand.

They come to a stop.

AN AUTO-PHONIC RECEIVER POPS OUT of the side of Billy's
helmet.  As he turns his head, the receivers ROTATE.

SOUND EFFECT:  We hear silence and then... a RASPY
BREATHING, followed by a GUTTURAL SNARL.

corner.  Aisha's light PANS THROUGH THE GLOOM.

KICKS, SUCKER PUNCHES, SPINBACK-ROUNDHOUSES, you name it.

One of the beasts TACKLES Tommy and the pair go TUMBLING 
OWN A TWENTY FOOT ROCK PILE.  Aisha picks up a handful of dirt

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               My mistake.

She follows through with an OVER SHOULDER THROW --
the beast CRASHES INTO A JOHNNY-ON-THE-SPOT.

Rocky fights another beast and the creature SWINGS
UP THROUGH SCAFFOLDING with phenomenal dexterity.  Rocky goes
after him.

<b>                              TOMMY

Saba sees the rats.

We hear a PRIMITIVE CRY as a beast SLAMS INTO ADAM,
SENDS HIM CATAPULTING.  Adam rises, speaks in a low growl.

The STEGA-STINGER appears in Adam`s hand.  He aims
it toward an overhang, FIRES.  A thin wire SHOOTS OUT -- the
Stinger at the end PIERCES the overhang.

<b>                              ADAM

Adam leaps off a platform, SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR like Tarzan,
SLAMS into the rat and sends him CATAPULTING.

A contraption APPEARS in Kimberly's hand and she throws her arm
out -- a LONG RIBBON SWIRLS out and tangles itself around the
rat.

<b>                              KIMBERLY

She yanks the ribbon pulling the rat into an opening -- he
<b>DISAPPEARS.
</b>
<b>                              KIMBERLY
</b>               Now you don't.

Billy takes a hit, ROLLS across the ground.  He stops inches
away from a twenty foot drop-off.

The beast CHARGES HIM, he ducks and the beast GOES FLYING
<b>THROUGH THE AIR AND SPLASHES DOWN IN ONE OF THE MUDDY POOLS
</b><b>OF WATER.
</b>
<b>                              BILLY
</b>               Not the brightest of beasts.

Rocky is now up in the scaffolding.  He DROPS TEN FEET through
the air, LANDS ON ONE END OF A BOARD.

There's a beast at the other end and he goes FLIPPING THROUGH
<b>THE AIR.
</b>
Tommy throws Saba Saber and the knife SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR
and zings around the beasts as they try to knock him down.

<b>                              SABA
</b>               Na na na na na!

The rats chase after Saba as he heads into a water-slicked
area.  There's a large power cable running across it.  Once 
all the rats are in the water, Saba kamikaze dives into the
cable, SLICING IT OPEN WITH AN ERUPTION OF SPARKS.  The water
SIZZLES WITH ELECTRICITY and the rats GO UP IN A PUFF OF SMOKE.

We see the six original small rats scurry away, SQUEAKING.

Suddenly, there's an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY and the
Rangers watch, stunned, as their COSTUMES DE-MATERIALIZE and
they appear back in civilian clothes.

Billy tries his wrist communicator.

There's no response.

They all hit their communicators and nothing happens.

               Something's wrong!

The Rangers climb a mountain path, all of them looking alarmed.
Up ahead, there's a PILLAR OF BLACK SMOKE rising from the
Command Center.


<b>22   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT                          22

The place is trashed -- there's SMOKING debris, ravaged  panels,
exposed wires and mechanisms.  The kids move through the
wreckage in numb silence.

                              TOMMY (barely audible)
               ... what happened here?...

Adam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble.

<b>                              ADAM

The kids quickly uncover the battered robot.

               Oh, no...

Everybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions
coming over them.

Laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon.  He is still a
SHIMMERING SPECTRAL being, only now he s aged a good fifty
years.

The kids stand over him, forlorn.

<b>                              AISHA

Zordon opens his eyes.

<b>                              ZORDON

The kids drop down beside him.

               The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers
               are no more.

The kids are stunned.  Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand.

<b>                              KIMBERLY

               has the strength to see his
               scheme through.

Zordon closes his eyes.  Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's
shoulder.  The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly
despondent.  Billy turns to Alpha.

<b>                              BILLY

               I do not like them, Sam-I-am!

Billy opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment.
Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze.

<b>                              ALPHA 5

Rocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area.

Aisha turns to Alpha.

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               Alpha.  Is there any way we can

</b>               ... Perhaps there is a way... I
               have heard tales of another

</b>               What?!

<b>                             ALPHA 5
</b>               ... They say that somewhere
               beyond the Hyperion Constellation
               there exists a mythological power

<b>                             TOMMY

<b>                             ALPHA 5    
</b>               As the legend goes, the power is
               impossible to obtain.

<b>                             ROCKY
</b>               We have to try, Alpha.  It's our

Alpha shakes his head.

<b>                             ALPHA 5
</b>               It's far too dangerous.  Zordon
               would never allow it.

<b>                             AISHA
</b>               If we don't try, Zordon won't
               survive!

Alpha heaves a sigh.

               The legend speaks of a Master
               Warrior who lives on the planet
               Phaedos... This is the only
               person who knows the secrets of
               the power.

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               How can we reach Phaedos?

Alpha heaves a SIGH.

<b>                              ALPHA 5
</b>               Zordon's going to have my
               orbicular spheroids when he hears
               out about this!

The kids exchange curious looks as Alpha opens a compartment
and removes a vile filled with RADIOLUMINESCENT ENERGY.

<b>                              ALPHA 5
</b>               This is an emergency reserve of

He approaches a damaged panel, loads in the vile.

<b>                              ALPHA 5
</b>               There is one problem.  I only
               have enough reserve to send you
               Phaedos...  I can't bring you
               back.

<b>                              ADAM
</b>               So how do we get back?

Alpha gives them a grim look.

<b>                              ALPHA 5
</b>               ... You'll have to pray that the

Alpha keys in coordinates.

</b>               You're sure you want to do this?!
               The Rangers share purposeful looks.

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               It's our only hope.

Alpha shakes his head, punches in the final codes.

<b>                              ALPHA

He pulls a lever.

We see the SIX COLORED STREAKS BLAST away from earth and SHOOT
PAST the moon.

The CAMERA MOVES IN on Zedd's ominous palace which rises up out
of the tortured landscape.  Zedd, Rita, Mordant and Goldar are
standing on the balcony.

Zedd, Rita and their minions are inside Zedd's dark palace
Goldar looks through Rita's telescope as Rita rants.

               How could he let them slip

Goldar looks up from the telescope.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               My turn.


He ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE.

Mordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling    
open.  Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!!

Rita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE.

<b>                              RITA

Mordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan.

Goldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him.

                              GOLDAR (apologetic)
               He's just visiting for the

<b>                              GOLDAR

Ivan shakes his head.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               No need.   I'm going to use the

GOLDAR digs for buried treasure deep in his nose.

</b>               No offense, boss, but they might

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Yes, well, I suppose you'd know

                              (beat)
               Not to worry.  I'll ever so
               gently lure them in and mold them
               into an army of devils!  And what
               better way to entice them ...
               than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!

Ivan approaches an enormous vat, turns a tap -- it BURPS and
GLOPS as PURPLE OOZE pours out.

<b>                              GOLDAR

               And then I'll put them to work
               rebuilding my empire.

Bulk and Skull enter waving a "help wanted" flier.  Both
them are wearing their garish blazers and dark sunglasses.

Bulk does a G.Q. stance.

</b>               Well put your mind to rest `cause

Ivan doesn't look too pleased.

<b>                              IVAN

Ivan steps forward.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               And I'm Little-Bo-Peep.

Ivan.  Both of them swallow hard.

Kimberly, who seems to be lost in thought.

The others nod in agreement.

               SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the
               SEWER he crawled out of.

Tommy's words sink in.  He stops suddenly, sensing something.

ANGLE ON - MORDANT hiding behind a tree, watching the Ranger's
pass.

There's a HORRIFIC SCREECH -- the kids look up as the TENGU
<b>WARRIORS COME SWEEPING OUT OF THE SKY

<b>                              ROCKY

It's too late.  The Tengu attack with unbelievable ferocity
They SLASH with their claws, STAB with their beaks and BATTER
with their wings.

Rocky is hurtled into some bushes, Aisha is knocked against a
tree, Adam splashes down in a small creek.  Mordant watches
of this from the sidelines.  He gets so excited that he starts
throwing punches and kicks.

<b>                              MORDANT
</b><b>               WHAM!  KAPOW!  BOOM!

<b>                              TOMMY
</b><b>               HANG ON, KIMBERLY.
</b>
Tommy rushes to help her and another Tengu trips him -- he
TUMBLES HEAD OVER HEELS DOWN A SLOPE.  We hear an OTHERWORDLY
CRY as a small, hunched figure wearing a tattered robe SWINGS
<b>IN ON A VINE.
</b>
He proceeds to pull off what is nothing short of a miracle.
<b>       
</b>He uses the STICKS for weapons as he executes a ROUNDHOUSE
KICK, a SCISSOR-KICK TAKEDOWN, a SITTING SIDE KICK, a
ROUNDHOUSE DROP SPIN BACK KICK, a PARALLEL BLOCK FROM THE
OUTSIDE, a REVERSE HANDSWORD and so on.

The creature punctuates the hits with an exotic variation of
<b>BRUCE LEE NOISES.
</b>
<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               What's the matter with you

The Tengu SQUAWK and SQUEAL as the little dynamo WAILS ON THEM.

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               The Tengu Warriors my butt!  The
               Tengu TURKEYS is more like it!

Finally the Tengu retreat, WINGING UP THROUGH THE TREES.

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               Hey, aren't you bird-brains
               forgetting something?!

One of the Tengu SWOOPS IN AND SNATCHES Mordant up.

<b>                              MORDANT

<b>                              FIGURE
</b>               Zordon?

Now the most amazing thing happens.  The figure RISES TO FULL
HEIGHT OF SIX FEET, while simultaneously shedding it's robe.

Underneath is a SCANTILY CLAD, STUNNING AMAZONIAN WOMAN.  We're
talking B-U-I-L-T.  Meet the Master warrior, DULCEA.

The Rangers stand there with stunned expressions.  Dulcea looks
to Tommy.

<b>                              DULCEA

Tommy just gapes.  Kimberly gives him a cold glance and THUNKS
him one with her elbow.

<b>                              KIMBERLY
</b>               The lady asked you a question.

<b>                              TOMMY

</b>               He was attacked by this horrific

</b>               Ivan Ooze is free?!  We are all

other.

DOZENS OF KIDS Ranging in age from eight to seventeen, are swarming
Bulk and Skull, who have set up a booth with a large banner
that reads:      "FREE OOZE!"

As Rocky is talking, a flubbery looking SNOUT works it's way
over Kimberly's shoulder.  She hasn't noticed it yet.

He pushes Kimberly toward it making a "Na na na na na" sound
through his snout.  He then hurries inside and SLAMS the door.

The kids approach the dying fire, all of them limping a little.

<b>                              BILLY

               life.

They drop around the fire, a few of them GROANING.  They stare
into the orange coals for a long moment, all of them looking
disillusioned.

<b>                              BILLY
</b>               Do you guys really think we can
               pull this off?

It takes a moment to get a response.

<b>                              ADAM
</b>               Maybe if we had more time.

<b>                              TOMMY  
</b>               ... I wonder... We've been
               relying on our Morphin Powers for
               so long... maybe we've forgotten
               how to rely on ourselves.

There's a somber silence.

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               We should get some rest.

They all settle in for the night.

<b>55B   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE  -  NIGHT  (OLD SC 47) 55B

A PURPLE HAZE OF SMOKE has settled on the construction site.
Suddenly, mysteriously, SWARMS OF ZOMBIFIED PARENTS emerge from
the vapors - We see Mr. Kelman amongst them.

Ivan steps forward, followed by Goldar.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Ladies and gentlemen, Simon

All the parents stop.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Simon says... stand on one foot!

All the parents stand on one foot.  Ivan seems to be taking a
perverse glee in all this.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Simon says...

<b>                              GOLDAR
</b>               Quack like a'duck!

All the parents start QUACKING LIKE DUCKS.   Ivan slowly turns
to Goldar, gives him an icy stare.

<b>                              GOLDAR
</b>               It just slipped out.

Ivan turns back to the QUACKING parents.
<b>     
</b><b>                              IVAN
</b><b>               SHUT UP!!

<b>                              GOLDAR

The zombie parents have already started going to work.  Ivan
shakes his head in exasperation.

<b>55C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - NIGHT             55C
</b>
The Rangers are fast asleep.  A night wind WHISTLES through the
trees, causing the branches to shiver.

After a moment, there's movement in the bushes.  Suddenly,
amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the

moonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE.

He surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy.  He
stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze.
Billy stirs slightly.

The embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face      
A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame.

There's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and
lands on a rock directly above Tommy.  The bird fixes on Tommy
with its piercing eyes.

We hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS:

Now a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from
Adam.  The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING

Now we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES.  Aisha fidgets in
her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER.

Now, all at once, the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE
<b>SPIRITS OF THE NIGHT.
</b>
<b>55D    EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT  (PART OLD SC 55B)     55D

Ivan and Goldar patrol the parents who are busy digging.

<b>                              IVAN

               four hours the ooze is gonna hit

Goldar suddenly point to the sky.

<b>                              GOLDAR
</b>               Hey, boss!

<b>THE TENGU DROPS INTO THE SCENE, SQUEALING

<b>                              IVAN

Mordant waves Ivan off.

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               Oh, it couldn't've gone better.
               The Power Rangers didn't know
               what hit them .

The Tengu appear, one of them SQUAWKS and makes grand gestures.

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               That's right.  And then we threw
               one of them off a mountain and
               another one into a raqing river!

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               So they've been destroyed?

The Tengu SQUAWKS some more.

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               "Basically".

<b>                              IVAN

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               Well... we were about to finish

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge.
               But you should've seen the size
               of his STICKS

A pensive look comes over Ivan...

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               Did these sticks make a whistling
               sound?

<b>                              MORDANT
</b>               How'd you know?

<b>                              IVAN

               That miserable, manipulating
               loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!

To help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               How could you let them get away?!
               If Dulcea leads them to the Great
               Power, everything will be ruined!
               They must be OBLITERATED!

One of the Tengu SCREECHES again.

</b>               What're you talking about?!  It

Ivan looks up to the sky.

<b>                              IVAN
</b>               I call upon the Powers of

</b>
<b>                              IVAN
</b>               And now the coup de grace, to

               battle!

He shoots a BOLT OF ENERGY AND CREATES THE OUEEN TENGU!  She is
a different color than the rest and her eyes GLOW RED.  Mordant
shakes his head in wonder.

All the Rangers spring awake.  As they get out from under their

Ninjetti costumes with animal symbols on their chest.

<b>HARD DRIVING MUSIC KICKS IN.

1.  We see Aisha standing on a rock, her whole body flowing in
    a martial art exercise.

2.  Billy and Dulcea continue to fight with whistling sticks.
    Billy is starting to get the hang of it.  He hits Dulcea a few
    times, then she CLOBBERS him.

3.  Kimberly balances along the bamboo log again.  She does a
    FLIP and lands it, however one foot slips off and she struggles
    to maintain her balance.

4.  Tommy stands on the protruding rock again, spreads high
    like a falcon, SOARS THROUGH THE AIR.  He gets about ten feet
    then DROPS INTO THE WATER.

5.  Rocky climbs up the oriental pole -- this time he makes it
    up about FIFTEEN FEET before he slips.  He only drops five
    feet.

6.  Adam stands amidst overhanging trees and goes into his frog
    animal stance, his entire being focused on his actions.

7.  Billy stands off alone practicing with the whistling
    sticks.  The weapons are now a BLURR in his hands.

8.  Kimberly balances along the log, executes a FLIP, lands it
    perfectly, throws her arms up triumphantly.

9.  Adam stands on the lakeshore, cncentrating on a buzzing
    insect.  He strikes out at it, but  just misses it.

10.  Aisha also does something appropriate.

They jump around, breaking stuff, sparring with each other
It's total pandemonium.

Suddenly, an ERUPTION OF SMOKE -- and Ivan, disguised as the

               Zordon was widely regarded as the

               He was a true Legend... If it

ANGLE ON FRED as he darts through the construction site, taking
care not to be seen.  He hunkers down behind a stack of
two-by-fours, searches the area.  He spots his dad, speaks under
his breath.

<b>                              FRED
</b>               Dad...?!

He glances around to make sure the coast is clear, then sprints
off to where his dad is digging, grabs his hand.

<b>                              FRED

Mordant is getting pummeled.  The last kick sends him FLYING

The parents have finished assembling the STEEL TOWER -- thick
cables run from the base to the skeletal heads of Hornitor and    
Scorpitron.

We see a group of parents fastening clear plastic pipes to the
skeletal feet -- the pipes are attached to the vat of ooze.

Mordant videotapes Ivan as he struts past a giant mechanical
foot.

The Rangers crest a hill and Adam, who's in the lead, suddenly
drops down - the others following suit.

They peer over the ridge -- their eyes wide.

Before them, a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing.
The ocean RAGES BELOW.

On top of the island is the Nathadian Monolith.  It's a  mind-
boggling wonder from another time and place.

Between the Rangers and the bridge, the Tengu Warriors are on
patrol.

The Tengu are on full alert.  One of them hears something,
snaps around, there's nothing there.

Another Tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg.  He
SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot, missing the     
creature by inches.

We hear a CAW and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon
circling in the sky above.  The Queen is perched on top of a 20
foot rock face. She looks around hesitantly.

Now the Rangers ATTACK, some of them LUNGING OFF ROCKS, others
BURSTING out of crevices, others coming over the walls.

Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times, then
starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts.

The Queen SHOOTS A LASER BLAST from her eyes -- it EXPLODES
before Tommy.

Kimberly battles another Tengu and the creature forces her back
on to the rickety bridge.

The Queen FIRES ANOTHER BLAST.

<b>                              ROCKY

Rocky DIVES, knocking Aisha away from the bolt.

Adam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily.

</b>               The frog silently assesses its
               target, then strikes out...

Suddenly the Tengu is HURTLED BACKWARD TEN FEET THROUGH THE
AIR.  We didn't even see Adam move.

<b>                              ADAM
</b>               ... in the blink of an eye.

Tommy steps up behind a Tengu.

<b>                              TOMMY
</b>               Yo, Tweety!

The Tengu turns around and Tommy WHALLOPS HIM WITH A SPINNING-
HEEL KICK.  A Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear
stance.

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               The bear is sturdy as a towering
               tree.  Nothing can uproot it.

The Tengu CHARGES LIKE A BULL, SLAMS INTO AISHA.  She holds
fast and the bird EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS.

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               Bye, bye birdy.

Kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she
EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe.

She finally drops into a crane stance... then just like Dulcea
she LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR, EXECUTES A BRUTAL SPINNING HELL KICK
and sends the birdman TUMBLING OFF THE BRIDGE.

In a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly
back on the swinging bridge.

<b>                              KIMBERLY

Tommy reaches the top of a rack.  He sees a Tengu making a
<b>KAMIKAZE DIVE TOWARD KIMBERLY.  TOMMY DIVES, SOARING THIRTY
</b><b>FEET THROUGH THE AIR -- HE INTERCEPTS THE TENGU AND THEY SPIN
</b>TOWARD EARTH TOGETHER.  They HIT the ground and EXCHANGE BLOWS

Rocky SLAMS another Tengu in the beak, KABLAM  -- the creature
is OBLITERATED.

Tommy LEAPS INTO THE AIR, NAILS two Tengu in the beaks.  They
<b>BOTH BURST IN AN EXPLOSION OF FEATHERS.

The Queen shoots another BOLT OF ENERGY --  a rock EXPLODES,
SHOWERING THE KIDS WITH SHRAPNEL.  Aisha turns to Rocky.

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               It's up to you.

Rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position.
Incredibly he SCALES THE WALL IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT UP THE
POLE.  HE FLIPS OVER THE TOP and lands right before the Queen
Tengu.  He looks her dead in the eye.

<b>                              ROCKY

</b><b>               ALL RIGHT, ROCKY!

Instantly, the remaining Tengu retreat, SQUAWKING and CAWWING  in

adjustments to his contraption.

</b>
The kids climb up on top of the rock bluff -- before them is a
huge black Monolith.  There's all sorts of charred bones and
skeletons strewn around it, some of them human, some of them
alien.

They approach the massive block, stand before it in awe struck
silence.  In the middle of the Monolith there's a large circle
with the six animals of the Ninjetti carved into it.

<b>                              ROCKY
</b>               ... The Nathadian Monolith...

Kimberly looks at all the bones -- instinctively puts her hand
on her animal symbol.

<b>                              KIMBERLY
</b>               I guess these guys weren't so
               lucky.

A few of the kids walk around the Monolith, examining it more
closely.

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               We've come all this way for a

<b>                              BILLY
</b>               There should be a way to open it.

Billy &amp;;Tommy latch their hands over the block, searching for
an opening.

<b>                              BILLY
</b>               ... Nothing.

<b>                              ROCKY
</b>               Release the power with the power.

Rocky steps back, THROWS HIS SHOULDER into the Monolith with a
THUMP, winces in pain.

<b>                              AISHA
</b>               Not that kind of power.

The kids exchange discouraged looks.

<b>                              BILLY
</b>               ... There has to be something
               we're missing.

The kids look crestfallen.

<b>                              ROCKY
</b>               It can't end like this...

Suddenly a SIZZLE OF ELECTRICITY forms in front of them.

<b>                              KIMBERLY
</b>               What NOW!

The kids mouth's fall open as... a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF
ZORDON'S WITHERED FACE APPEARS.  He speaks in a barely
audible voice.

<b>                              ZORDON
</b>               Rangers... Ivan has invaded the
               city... time is running out...

Zordon's image FLICKERS a few times then STABILIZES again.

<b>                              ZORDON
</b>               Each of you are now in possession

               when the six become one will you
               have the strength to harness the
               Great Power.

<b>                              ROCKY
</b>               Strength in numbers!!

They silently assemble in a line, all of them interlock:
hands.  They face the Monolith with fire in their eyes.

<b>                              BILLY

The kids BURST THROUGH A WALL OF LIGHT and come down together
inside a vast cavern.  There's a pyramid shaped steel object in
the center of the room, a RADIANT LIGHT SHINING FROM IT.

Adam notices their symbols are glowing.

<b>                              BILLY
</b>               Our SYMBOLS.

The kids ogle the radiant emblems.  Kimberly takes hold of hers
and it COMES OFF in her hand -- there's a mirror on the other
side.

<b>                              ROCKY

</b>We hear a RUMBLING SOUND as the earth starts to SHAKE.  The

Then everything falls still and silent... and then a miracle
happens.

We hear a HARMONIOUS, OTHERWORLDLY CHORUS as the pyramid OPENS

</b>
The kids shield their eyes from the brilliance, all of them
wearing wonder-struck expressions.

</b>               You gotta believe me -- he's
<b>               EVIL!

The crowd gets angrier.  They move closer... Fred gulps with
fear... glancing around for help, he notices a HOSE.  He lunges
for it, cranks on the water, and TURNS IT ON THE CROWD!
SPLASH!  They get SPRAYED DOWN!

Suddenly -- they stop in their tracks, slowly blinking,
confused.  The spell is broken.  We hear: "What's going on ?!"
"What am I doing here?!", etc.

<b>                              FRED

He hurries off.  A few follow him, then a few more... until
pretty soon everybody joins him.  Bulk and Skull share a look.

Hornitor shoots a BLAST from it's stinger, the Crane Zord
