A newscaster for the Channel 7 Eyewitness News complains about how God has only made his life a total waste.
Well, Bruce Nolan, played by Jim Carrey, gets that chance after he freaks out on live TV, is fired and is offered a new job by an unknown place.
He meets God and is given all the powers of God.
At first he loves it.
He can do anything but when he discovers others in Buffalo who are praying, he learns that maybe this job of being God isn't really that easy.
