Jeff Donavan was never a good boy.
He was always bad and was always fascinated in the story of the Blair Witch, just like victim Heather Donahue of Blair Witch 1.
After the success of the movie, Jeff opens up a Blair Witch tour of Black Hills for his way to cash in on the movie hoopla.
But when four people take the tour and decide to rest at Rustin Parr's house (Rustin was the person who murdered seven children under the Blair Witch's command), the four lose five hours of their memories.
But after they return to find Jeff while trying to understand the bizarre symbols on their bodies, all five people will finally know that some fiction isn't really fiction and that when they left the Black Hills, they left with something... or someone.
