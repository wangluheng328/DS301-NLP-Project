An old man meanders around a circus late at night: he's missed his ride to a rest home.
He tells the circus manager about his time in 1931 with the doomed Bandini Circus.
He's Jake: when his parents die before he finishes veterinary studies, he hobos his way toward Albany, falling in with a circus.
He diagnoses a lame horse, and August, the mercurial owner, hires him as a vet.
August is in debt, throwing employees from the train in the dead of night.
To sell tickets, he buys an elephant, tells Jake to train it and his young wife Marlena to ride it.
While August's temper threatens the elephant, Marlena and Jake find a mutual attraction.
And the doomed circus?
