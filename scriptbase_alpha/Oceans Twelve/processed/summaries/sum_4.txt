Three years after ripping off casino owner Terry Benedict in Las Vegas, Danny Ocean and his gang have settled down.
Until the revenge-seeking Benedict contacts them all one-by-one with this: pay back what you stole from me, with interest, or else.
They have two weeks to come up with $190 million dollars.
In addition to the swiftly approaching deadline, they have to dodge tenacious Europol agent Isabel Lehiri and out-maneuver another thief known only as "The Night Fox."
It all culminates in Ocean's 12 taking on the biggest heist ever...and also the biggest con!
