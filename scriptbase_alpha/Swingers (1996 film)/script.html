                                   by

                               Jon Favreau





















                                                        Dec. 13, 1994

                                                        Third draft









<b>   1    EXT.  HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT                                          1
</b>
        The soundtrack opens with Frank Sinatra's "Fly Me to the
        Moon".

        A HELICOPTER SHOT OF THE L.A. basin.

        The pool of golden light disintegrates into the thousands of
        points which constitute it as we rapidly draw closer to the
        city.

        We are just above the tops of the highest buildings as we
        approach Hollywood Boulevard.  Below is neon and the icy
        thrust of search lights rotating on the corner of Hollywood
        and Vine.

        We continue west, then quickly north.

        There is the momentary appearance of the moonlit HOLLYWOOD
        sign as we pass the blinking red beacon of the Capital
        Records building and drop into Franklin avenue and over the
<b>        101.
</b>
        Architectural remnants of Hollywood's past whip up.  We are
        heading east at treetop level.  A warm glow in the distance
        quickly grows into a modest commercial strip which includes
        cafes, bookstores, and a theater.

        We drop to eye level as we spy through the plate glass
        showcase window of the "Bourgeois Pig" coffeehouse, which
        holds the translucent reflection of the full moon.

        A cigarette wedged between knuckles smoulders.  MIKE takes
        the last drag with great effort, then crushes it out.  He
        sits in the window sprawled across a red velvet couch that
        once perfectly complemented a faux spanish foyer.

<b>   2    EXT.  "BOURGEOIS PIG" COFFEEHOUSE - COUCHES AND TABLE IN FRONT   2
</b><b>        WINDOW - NIGHT
</b>
        ROB sits down next to Mike, pouring himself some tea.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   And what if I don't want to give up on
                   her?

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   You don't call.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   But you said I shouldn't call if I
                   <b>wanted</b> to give up on her.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Right.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   So I don't call either way.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Right.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   So what's the difference?

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   The only difference between giving up and
                   not giving up is if you take her back
                   when she wants to come back.  See, you
                   can't do anything to make her want to
                   come back.  You can only do things to
                   make her not want to come back.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   So the only difference is if I forget
                   about her or pretend to forget about her.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Right.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Well that sucks.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   It sucks.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   So it's almost a retroactive decision.
                   So I could, like, let's say, forget about
                   her and when she comes back make like I
                   just pretended to forget about her.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Right...or more likely the opposite.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Right...  Wait, what do you mean?

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   I mean first you'll pretend not to care,
                   not call - whatever, and then,
                   eventually, you really won't care.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Unless she comes back first.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Ah, see, that's the thing.  Somehow they
                   don't come back until you really don't
                   care anymore.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   There's the rub.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   There's the rub.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Thanks, man.  Sorry we always talk about
                   the same thing all the time...

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Hey man, don't sweat it.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   ...It's just that you've been there.
                   Your advice really helps.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   No problem.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Rob, I just want you to know, you're the
                   only one I can talk to about her.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Thanks.  Thanks, man.

        He's trying to look at ease as he straightens his cuff links.
        He approaches Trent who suavely leans against his worn down
        ride.  He's a tall, slim, good-looking cat.  His sharkskin
        suit hangs well on his lanky frame as it tapers to his
        ankles.  Sinatra's "Come Fly With Me" on the tape deck adds
        an elegance to the scene.  They exchange an impish grin and
        depart without saying a word.  Maybe this isn't such a bad
        idea.

        cobalt and ruby lasers emanating from a source masked by

        Mike has either had enough sleep or so little that it no

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   This is fuckin' post-pubescent
                   Disneyland.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   You gotta love the pirates, baby.  The
                   pirates are <b>money</b>.

        The corridor empties into the equally kitch CASINO.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   This place is dead.  I thought this was
                   the city that never sleeps.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   That's New York, baby.  You should know
                   that.  Look at the waitresses.  I'm gonna
                   get me a peg-leg baby.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   They're all skanks.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Baby, there are beautiful babies here.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Tee, the beautiful babies don't work
                   Wednesdays midnight to six.  This is the
                   skank shift.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   What are you talking about?  Look at all
                   the honeys.

        Trent contorts his face at a cute WAITRESS passing by with a
        tray of drinks.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Arrrrg!

        The waitress cracks a smile as she crosses away.  Mike is
        visibly embarrassed.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Cut that shit out.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   She smiled baby.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   That's not cool.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Did she, or did she not smile?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   It doesn't matter...

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   I'm telling you, they love that shit.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   You're gonna screw up our plan.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   We're gonna get laid, baby.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   First let's see what happens if we play
                   it cool.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   What?  You think she's gonna tell her
                   pit-boss on us?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Don't make fun, I think we can get some
                   free shit if we don't fuck around.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Who's fucking around? I'm not making fun.
                   Let's do it, baby.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   The trick is to look like you don't need
                   it, then they give you shit for free.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Well, you look <b>money</b>, baby.  We both
                   look <b>money</b>.

        Mike points to a semi-curtained, semi-roped-off area near the
        baccarat tables.  The clientele is classier, but they're
        still obviously overdressed.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (pointing)
                   That's where we make our scene.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   You think they're watching?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Oh, they're watching all right.  They're
                   watching.

<b>                                                               CUT TO:
</b>
<b>   13   INT.  TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - THE CLASSY SECTION - NIGHT        13
</b>
        Mike is at a blackjack table with Trent at his side.  The
        game has paused to observe the newcomers as Mike draws a
        billfold out of his breast pocket.  They're pulling it off
        with only slightly noticeable effort.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I don't know, I guess I'll start with
                   three hundred in, uh, blacks.

        Mike tries to hand the DEALER a handful of twenties after
        counting them twice.

<b>                             DEALER
</b>                   On the table.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Sorry?

<b>                             DEALER
</b>                   You have to lay it on the table.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Uh, I don't want to bet it all.

        The other players grow impatient.

<b>                             DEALER
</b>                   You're not allowed to hand me money, sir.
                   You'll have to lay it on the table if you
                   want me to change it.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (hastily laying down the bills)
                   Oh... right.

        The dealer lays out the bills such that the amount is visible
        to the camera encased in the black glass globe overhead.
        Trent and Mike look up at it open-mouthed like turkeys in the
        rain.

<b>                             DEALER
</b>                   Blacks?

        Mike's attention is recaptured by the dealer, but Trent
        continues trying to peer through the smoked glass.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Huh?

<b>                             DEALER
</b>                   You want this in black chips.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Sure, that'll be fine.

        The dealer chirps out an unintelligible formality and the PIT
        BOSS chirps the response.  Trent's focus whips away from the
        camera as both he and Mike stare at the pit boss ten feet
        away.

        The dealer plunks down the measly THREE CHIPS which represent
        Mike's entire cash reserve.  Not quite the effect he had
        hoped for.

        The swingers stare at the chips.  The players stare at the
        swingers.  The dealer stares at the pit boss.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Do you have anything smaller?

<b>                             DEALER
</b>                   Yes, but I'm afraid this table has a
                   hundred-dollar-minimum bet.  Perhaps
                   you'd be more comfortable at one of our
                   lower stakes tables.

        The dealer indicates a FIVE-DOLLAR TABLE across the room
        where an Hispanic woman deals to a BLUEHAIR, a BIKER, and a
        COUPLE in matching Siegfried and Roy T-shirts.

        The swingers look back to the dealer who is now flanked by
        the pit boss.

        The tense silence is broken by...

<b>                             WAITRESS
</b>                   Drinks?
                        (then to Trent)
                   How about you, <b>Cap'n</b>?

        Trent looks over to see that it's the same WAITRESS who
        flashed him a smile earlier.  At first he begins to smile,
        then, remembering that he is locked in a high stakes battle
        of wills, subtly shakes her off.  She smirks and starts to
        leave until she is interrupted by Mike holding up a finger.
        It's a balsy move, but everyone's watching.  The kid's going
        for broke.
<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (to the waitress, but never
                        breaking eye contact with the
                        dealer)
                   I'll have a vodka martini, straight up,
                   shaken not stirred, very dry.

        Smooth.  Trent is impressed, but masks his pride.

<b>                             WAITRESS
</b>                        (under her breath cynically as
                        she writes it down)
                   One "James Bond".

        Ow.  She exits.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (regaining composure)
                   No.  Blacks will be fine.

        Mike throws a chip in the circle.  Trent is shocked.  That's
        a hundred bucks.  Mike and Trent share a look.  The dealer
        and the pit boss exchange glances.  Bets are all down and the
        cards are meticulously dealt.

        The dealer has a two showing.  Mike has been dealt a five and
        a six- <b>eleven</b>.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                        (hushed tones)
                   Double down.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (even husheder)
                   What?!?

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Double down, baby.  You gotta double down
                   on an eleven.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I know, but...

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   You gotta do it.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   ...but that's <b>two hundred dollars</b>.
                   This is <b>blood money</b>...

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   If we don't look like we know what we're
                   doing, then we may as well...

        Everyone's waiting for them.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I know.

        The dealer, the pit boss, and all the players look on as Mike
        drops ANOTHER BLACK CHIP in the circle with a barely audible,
        yet deafening, thud.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (with all the nonchalance he
                        can muster)
                   Double down.

        A bead of sweat.

        The sharp snap of a dealt card.

        It's a seven.  <b>Eighteen</b>.

        Disappointment twists their faces.

        Finally the dealer flips over his card.

        It's a king!  <b>Twelve</b>.  Here comes the bust...

        Flick - four.  <b>Sixteen</b>!  Here comes the bust...

        Flick - five.  <b>Twenty one</b>.  Groans all around, except for the
        swingers who watch their chips slide away in silence.

        Mike breaks the spell with a plucky smile from the pit of his
        stomach.
<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (to the pit boss)
                   Sure could use some dinner about now.

<b>                                                         SMASH CUT TO:
</b>
        Trent and Mike are wedged between the BLUEHAIR and the BIKER
        At the FIVE DOLLAR TABLE.  They share a pile of red chips.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   I'm telling you, baby, you <b>always</b> double
                   down on an eleven.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Yeah?  Well obviously not <b>always</b>!

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   <b>Always</b>, baby.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I'm just saying, not in this particular
                   case.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Always.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   But I lost!  How can you say <b>always</b>?!?

        In the meantime, the Bluehair has been dealt an eleven.
        This captures the swinger's attention.

<b>                             BLUEHAIR
</b>                   Hit.

        Four.  <b>Fifteen</b> all together.

<b>                             BLUEHAIR
</b>                   Oh...  I don't know...  Hit.

        Two.  <b>Seventeen</b>.  Dealer has a seven showing.

<b>                             BLUEHAIR
</b>                   What the hell- hit.

        Four!  <b>Twenty one</b>.

<b>                             DEALER
</b>                        (with a warm smile)
                   Twenty one.

        Polite applause from around the table which the Bluehair
        humbly waves off.  Mike looks at Trent.  Daggers.  Trent
        shrugs.

        A different PIT BOSS approaches.

<b>                             PIT BOSS

                   Thank you, though.

<b>                             MIKE

<b>   14   INT.  TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - CASHIER'S WINDOW - NIGHT          14
</b>
        Mike is presented a stack of twenties by the CASHIER, who
        counts them out.  Trent looks on.

<b>                             CASHIER
</b>                   ...eighty...  one hundred...  one hundred

                   back on the high seas soon.
                        (polite smile)

        Mike throws her a disgusted look, then turns to go.  Trent
        struggles to cheer him up.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   What's that?  One twenty?  You're up
                   twenty bucks, baby.

        Mike throws him a disgusted glare.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   ... Well, you know, not counting the

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Thanks for clarifying that.

<b>                             TRENT

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Don't give me that shit.  You know

</b>                        (lifting Mike's reluctant hand

</b>                   Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the
                   big winner.

        The same WAITRESS from before approaches the swingers as they
        are about to leave.

<b>                             WAITRESS
</b>                   There you two are.  I walked around for

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Sorry.  We got knocked out pretty

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   No thanks.  Why ruin a perfect night.

        The waitress smiles in spite of herself, shakes her head, and
        walks away.

<b>                             MIKE

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Let's go.  I'm not paying for a room, and

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I'm too tired for this.  Let's just go.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Baby, this is what we came for.  We met
                   a beautiful baby and she likes you.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   She likes <b>you</b>.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Whatever.  We'll see.  Daddy's gonna get
                   her to bring a friend.  We'll both get
                   one.  I don't care if I'm with her or one
                   of her beautiful baby friends.

<b>                             MIKE

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   You gotta get that girl out of your head.
                   It's time to move on.  You're a stylish,
                   successful, good looking cat.  The ladies
                   want to love you, you just gotta let
                   them.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   That's bullshit.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   It's not.  You're <b>money</b>.  Any of these
                   ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like
                   you.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   It's just that I've been out of the game
                   so long.  Trent, I was with her for <b>six
                   years</b>.  That's before AIDS.  I'm scared.
                   I don't know how to talk to them, I don't
                   know...

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   You can't think like that, baby.  It's
                   hard, I know.  I've been there.  Not for
                   six years, but I know.  You just gotta
                   get back out there.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   It's just tough, after sleeping with
                   someone you love for so long, to be with
                   someone new... who doesn't know what I
                   like... and you <b>gotta</b> wear a jimmy...

</b>                   ... and then I'm struggling to impress
                   some chick who's not half as classy as my
                   girlfriend, who I'm not even really
                   attracted to...

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Oh <b>fuck</b> that.  You don't have to try and
                   impress anyone.  You think I give a shit?
                   You think I sweat that skanky whore
                   waitress...

        Tee is interrupted by the WAITRESS who, thank God, barely
        missed his comment.

                   not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.

        Mike can't believe it.  Tee is just making it happen.

<b>                             TRENT

<b>   15   INT.  TREASURE ISLAND CASINO - COFFEE SHOP - SAME NIGHT          15

        Trent and Mike are looking at menus.  They're smoking at the
        table because the can.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   That was so fuckin' <b>money</b>.  It was like

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   That's what I'm telling you, baby.  The
                   babies love that stuff.  They don't want
                   all that sensitive shit.  You start
                   talking to them about puppy dogs and ice
                   cream.  They <b>know</b> what you <b>want</b>.  What do

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   They know what you want, believe me.
                   Pretending is just a waste of time.
                   You're gonna take them there eventually
                   anyway.  Don't apologize for it.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Respect, my ass.  They respect honesty.
                   You see how they dress when they go out?
                   They want to be noticed.  You're just
                   showing them it's working.  You gotta get
                   off this respect kick, baby.  There aint
                   nothing wrong with letting them now that
                   you're money and that you want to party.

        The COFFEE SHOP WAITRESS approaches the table.  She's cute,
        but not nearly as hot as Christy.

<b>                             WAITRESS

                        (points to Trent, who nods)
                   Two coffees.  It says "Breakfast Any
                   Time", right?

<b>                             WAITRESS
</b>                   That's right.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I'll have "pancakes in the Age of

                   philosophical reference.  How demeaning.

        Christy is at the bar wearing acid-washed jeans with a
        matching denim top.  She's sexy in a pathetic mid-eighties
        sort of way.  She's sitting next to a pretty brunette, LISA,
        dressed in a similar fashion.

        There is something bizarre about her appearance.  Her hair is
        tied into long pig-tails with powder blue ribbons.  Her
        makeup job is almost theatrical, with bright pink/red lips.
        She can't be <b>that</b> out of it, or can she?

        The girls have already been flanked by a herd of potential
<b>        COURTIERS.
</b>
        The SWINGERS saunter up to the girls in a smooth, SLOW-MOTION
<b>        SHOT.
</b>
        The girls notice them.

        The courtiers sense their rejection and part like the Red Sea
        for the swingers in perfect slow-motion choreography.

        The foursome, now somewhat more intimate, sit huddled around
        the fold-out table.

        They've been drinking whiskey and long-neck Buds, judging by
        the recyclables.

        The pairings seems to be Trent/Christy, Mike/Lisa.

        The cramped compartment is filled with secondary smoke and
        laughter.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   No... no... The worst was when I went in
                   for this After-School special and I'm
                   sitting in the waiting room with all
                   these little kids.  I see they're all
                   signed in for the same role as me...

<b>                             CHRISTY

</b>                   Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the

                   to be.  I call my agent... She says they
                   asked for me specifically...

                   Whatever.  After-School bullshit.  The

                   Whatever.  So, I start to read, and,
                   Mikey, I was money.  I prepared for a
                   week.  It's a starring role.  I'm
                   crying... The casting director, she
                   starts crying...

                   up my finger like "Wait a second".  They
                   sit in silence for, like, at least five
                   minutes.  I look up and they all start
                   <b>clapping</b>, and now they're <b>all</b> crying.

                   Then he says it's just that I'm a <b>little
                   old</b>.  I'm like "How old is the
                   Brother?".  He's like, he says this with
                   a straight face, I swear to God, he says
                   "<b>Eleven</b>."
<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   So, what'd you say to him?  "<b>Double
                   down</b>."?

        They all crack up even more.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   It's like, you looked at my tape.  You

        The room dies down.  The girls settle into the arms of their
        men.  There's a lot of body language and pheromones, but not
        a lot of words.

        She gets up and leads Trent into the sleeping compartment to
        the rear.  The door slaps shut.

        Mike and Lisa, in all her made-up glory, look into each

</b>                   The only reason I mentioned her at all is
                   to say that I'm not going to talk about
                   her anymore.  I thought you'd appreciate
                   that.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   I do.  Good for you, man.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I've decided to get out there.
                        (re: the ball)
                   Go ahead.  Play it out.

        Rob putts the "gimme".  He misses by an inch.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I'm not making any more excuses for
                   myself.

        Rob taps it in.  He tends the pin or Mike, who misses.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Good to hear, Mikey.

        Mike putts again, and misses.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   You want to hit the town tonight?

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   What do you have?  A Pluto call back?

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Sure.  Kick me when I'm down.

        Mike plunks it in.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Count 'em up.

        The two of them count and recount as they revisualize each
        shot in their head.  Throughout the process they count under
        their breath and point to different parts of the fairway and
        green.

        The two of them revolve, point, and mumble for an absurdly
        long amount of time until finally...

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   How many strokes?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I don't know.  Eight or Nine.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   I'll give you an eight.
                        (writes score)

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   What'd you get?

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   An eight.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Looks like we're in a dead heat after one
                   hole.  This is turning into quite a
                   rivalry.

        Rob points to the far-off crowd of a dozen IRATE GOLFERS
        Waiting to tee off.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   You better replace the pin, Chi-Chi.  The
                   natives look restless.

<b>                                                               CUT TO:
</b>
<b>   30   INT.  SUE'S APARTMENT - HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EVENING            30
</b>
        First of all, SUE is a <b>guy</b>, and a tough guy at that.  He is
        wearing an L.A. Kings home jersey.  His sweater bears the
        sacred number "99".  Sue is lounging in front of the TV in
        army surplus khaki cutoffs and untied Doc Martin boots.

        Sue brushes back a shock of straight, greasy, dirty blonde
        hair as not to obscure his view of the screen.  His face
        glows with the reflection of the SEGA HOCKEY game on the set.
        Sue and TRENT are locked in a heavily contested battle of
        motor reflexes.  Nothing moves but their eyes, thumbs, and
        mouths...

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   Bitch... You little bitch!

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Chelios to Roenick...!

        MIKE looks on.  He is more captivated with the simulated
        sporting event than the Clippers game on the TV across the
        room.

        Electric guitars blaze over the stereo.

        The room, like the guys, could use a spring cleaning.  Pizza
        boxes, beer bottles, and full, full ashtrays.  You can taste
        the smoke.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   You little bitch!

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Hey Sue.  Gretsky's on his ass again.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Because he's a bitch.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   That's so bullshit.  This is so bullshit.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   You should play another team.  The Kings
                   are bitches in this game.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   Hey, man.  I took the Kings to the <b>Cup</b>.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   ... against the <b>computer</b>.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   They're a finesse team...

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   They're a bitch team... <b>SCORE</b>!
                   <b>Roenick</b>!

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   <b>Fuck</b>!!!  That is so <b>bullshit</b>!

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Give it up, Sue.

        The PHONE RINGS.  Sue picks it up and balances it on his
        shoulder as he plays.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   Hello?
                        (re: game)
                   <b>Shit</b>!
                        (back to phone)
                   Yeah.  The elevator doesn't work.
                        (he lets the phone drop.  Then
                        to Mike)
                   It's Pink Dot.  Buzz him in - hit nine.

        Mike picks up the phone off the matted shag carpet.  He
        pushes "9", listens, then hangs up.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   I wish the game still had fights so I
                   could bitch-slap Wayne.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   This version doesn't have fighting?

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   No.  Doesn't that suck?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   What?  That was the best part of the old
                   game.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   I don't know.  I guess kids were hitting
                   each other or something.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   You could make their heads bleed, though.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   Yeah... If you hit them hard their heads
                   bleed all over the ice and their legs
                   convulse.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   No.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Yeah.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   It's kinda money, actually.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Make someone bleed.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   No, man, we're in the play-offs.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   I'll make Gretsky bleed, the little
                   bitch.

        The DELIVERY MAN knocks on the door.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   Pause it.
                        (Trent pauses the game)

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Give me the money.  I'll get it.

        While Sue gives Mike the money, Trent UNPAUSES the game and
        checks Gretsky into the boards, leaving him writhing in a
        pool of red pixels.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   You <b>bitch</b>!

        Sue dives onto Trent.  They wrestle a little too
        rambunctiously for indoors.  Trent pulls the hockey sweater
        over Sue's head and starts wailing on his back.

        Mike crosses.  The CAMERA follows him down a shallow hallway
        to the door.  He unlocks it.

        A delivery man of eastern-hemispheric decent is out of breath
        from four flights of stairs.  He hands Mike a twelve-pack of
        Bud cans and three packs of Marlboro reds.

        He can HEAR, but NOT SEE, the chaos ensuing in the living
        room.

<b>                                                               CUT TO:
</b>
<b>   31   INT.  SUE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             31
</b>
        Trent and Sue are flushed.  They pause long enough to torment
        Mike.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                        (feigning homosexuality)
                   Is he <b>cute</b>?  Ask him if he wants to stay
                   for a cocktail!

<b>                             SUE
</b>                        (following suit)
                   ... Is he <b>brown</b>?

<b>                                                              BACK TO:

<b>   32   INT.  SUE'S DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS                                 32
</b>
        Mike forces an apologetic smile.  He is embarrassed.  The
        delivery man doesn't seem to understand any of this.

        Mike, out of guilt, hands him a four dollar tip.  This he
        seems to understand.  He smiles and leaves.

        Mike crosses back to the main room.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   You guys are such assholes.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                        (continuing the gag)
                   Aww... He got away?

<b>                             SUE
</b>                        (untangling himself from
                        Trent)
                   Gimme my reds.  I've been jonesing for an
                   hour.

        Mike throws him a pack of smokes, which he unravels with
        surgical precision.

        Cans of beer are tossed around and cracked.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   What time's this party tonight?

<b>                             TRENT

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   ... which means no one will get there
                   'til ten.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   So, what?  Eleven?

<b>                             TRENT &amp; SUE
</b>                   Midnight.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I'm gonna bring and old friend who just
                   moved out here.

<b>                             TRENT

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Yeah.  You met him once.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                        (approvingly)

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   ... How novel.

</b>
<b>   33   EXT.  DARK ALLEY - OFF OF HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - SEEDY - NIGHT        33
</b>
        MIKE and ROB walk down the dirty deserted alleyway.  Mike is
        wearing baggy slacks, Doc Martin shoes, and an oversized
        Eisenhower-cut jacket with a vertical stripe inset.  The
        collar is large and pointy, but definitely not seventies.
        His ensemble has more of an early sixties vibe.

        Rob hasn't been at it quite as long.  He's wearing worn-in
        Levies over worn-in boots and, the nineties standby, an
        untucked flannel.

        Mike walks with purpose.  He intermittently tries to pull
        open locked steel doors along the alley.  Rob looks confused.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   So, if the party starts at eight, why are
                   we first going to a bar at ten?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   To get a drink before we meet the guys
                   for a bite at eleven.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Oh.
                        (beat)
                   Where is this place?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (pulling handle)
                   It's one of these.  For some reason, cool
                   bars in L.A. have to be very hard to find
                   and have no signs out front.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   That doesn't sound too good for business.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (pull)
                   It's kinda like a speakeasy kind of
                   thing.  It's kinda cool.  It's like
                   you're in on some kind of secret.  You
                   tell a chick you've been some place, it's
                   like bragging that you know how to find
                   it.  The only way you could know where a
                   place is is if someone who knows brought
                   you there.  You have to have someone come
                   before.  There is a direct line
                   connecting you back to the original,
                   unequivocally cool, club patrons.  It's
                   kinda like Judaism...

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Sounds more like Aids...

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   ... That's probably a more appropriate
                   analogy.

        At this point they come upon an unmarked BLACK METAL DOOR,
        which Mike successfully pulls open to reveal...

<b>   34   INT.  "THE ROOM" - HOLLYWOOD BAR - SAME                          34
</b>
        A smoke-filled, windowless, black-walled room.  There are
        several round padded booths lining the walls.  The place is
        packed, and the funk standard "Brick House" throbs over the
<b>        P.A..
</b>
        A HANDHELD SHOT as the two guys serpentine to the mirrored
        bar at the far end of the room.  Enshrined in its center is
        a framed photograph of SINATRA smiling in approval as he

        Mike turns to see CHARLES.  A young black man with a tight
        Dolomite fro.  He wears a black leather blazer over a black
        turtleneck.  Just look up "cool" in the dictionary.

        A handshake turns into a hug.

        MIKE, TRENT, SUE, CHARLES, and ROB sit around the round
        scotch-plaid corner booth of the retro-hip coffee shop.  All
        of our boys, with the exception of Rob, are classily dressed.
        They wear a lot of black, brown, and gray with a splash of
        gold and maroon.

        The CAMERA REVOLVES around the table in a repeating

        into circles of conversation and sipping cocktails.

        EVERYTHING STOPS when they enter.  The music, the
        conversations, all movement, everything.

        Everyone in the room STARES at them standing in the doorway.

        Beat.

        The music starts back up and everyone returns to their

        Mike spots a pair of beautiful BLONDES in black.  They're
        wearing stretch bell-bottoms and tops that expose their mid-
        drifts.  The seventies never looked so good.

        Trent is having a sensitive one-on-one with the girl in the
        hat.

<b>                             GIRL IN HAT

                   went to...

        Under Trent's affirmative response we hear the first haunting

        The group's P.O.V. of the conversation.

        The JAWS THEME reaches its violent crescendo as the girl
        looks into her purse.

        Trent winks to the boys.  Smooth.

        She comes up with a pen and writes our her phone number.

        Trent crosses back as the music dies away.

        Using his body as a shield so the girl can't see, but so his
        boys can, he rips up and drops the number as he approaches
        them.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Was I money?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   I don't know.  It was kind of a dick move
                   if you ask me.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Why, baby?  What'd I do wrong?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   You asked her for her number, and then
                   you tore it up.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   She didn't see.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   That doesn't matter.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   What was cold about it?

        The door opens.  The party PAUSES to look, then RESUMES.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   She offered me her number.  What should
                   I have said?  "No"?  <b>That</b> would've hurt
                   her feelings.  This way she feels like
                   the winner.

        Trent smiles and waves to her across the room.  She coyly
        waves back and makes a "phone sign" with her hand.  Trent
        nods and smiles.

<b>                             TRENT

        lounge act, perform a jazz fusion cover of "Staying Alive" on
        synth and upright bass.  The seventies are alive and well
        here, but they're starting to yellow around the edges...

        The room is busy, but not packed.

        The swingers have all had a few.

<b>                             CHARLES

        Trent and Sue are involved in a different conversation.  They
        are observing two HOT GIRLS at another cocktail table.

        The girls are wearing short plaid skirts with black stockings
        pulled up to midthigh.  It's the "catholic-school-girl-gone-
        bad" look.

        The girls are a little too touchy-feely with each other,
        suggesting a certain sexual open-mindedness.

        Mike's P.O.V.

        The girls seem at first cold, the receptive.  Trent and Sue
        join their table and share some laughs.

        Mike half-heartedly looks on.  He is obviously not happy with
        where he stands on the bell-curve of masculinity.

        Mike, looking for any kind of escape, crosses to the bar.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (trying to bluff, not an ounce
                        of sarcasm)
                   Well, you know, it's tough.  A lot of
                   traveling.  A lot of hotels... but, you
                   know, it's a dream... and the money's
                   really good.  I think I might buy another
                   really expensive imported car after my
                   next gig in Vegas...

<b>                             BLONDE
</b>                        (politely interrupting)
                   I know!  Starbucks!  I served you an
                   espresso at Starbucks.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Are you sure?  Maybe...

<b>                             BLONDE
</b>                   Yes!  Remember?  You asked me for an
                   application?  I introduced you to the
                   manager?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (trying to pull out of the
                        dive)
                   Oh, yeah...  Boy, that must've been a
                   while ago.
<b>                             BLONDE
</b>                   I'd say about two weeks.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Probably a little longer than that, but,
                   whatever.

<b>                             BLONDE
</b>                        (smiling at him)
                   You better pay the man.

        Mike notices the bartender, who has been waiting patiently
        with the drink.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (fumbling with the money)
                   Oh...  Sorry.

        She chuckles.  He pays and throws down a two-dollar tip
        apologetically.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (tactical retreat)
                   Well, thank you...?

<b>                             BLONDE
</b>                   Nikki.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Thank you, Nikki.

        He walks away kicking himself.  He is interrupted by Trent
        and Sue, who both hold up cocktail napkins with scribbles.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   We got the digits, baby.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   What a surprise.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   What's wrong?  I saw you talking to that
                   beautiful blonde baby.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   She was cute.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   She didn't like me... I made a fool of
                   myself...

<b>                             TRENT

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   That's what I keep trying to tell him.
                        (to Mike)
                   You're so money, you don't even know...

<b>                             MIKE

<b>                             TRENT

                   around... and the rabbit's all scared...

<b>                             SUE

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   ... and fangs... and you're like "I don't
                   know what to do.  How do I kill this

<b>                             SUE

        Beat.  Mike smiles.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   You're not just, like, fucking with me?

</b>                   No, baby!

<b>                             SUE

<b>                             TRENT

<b>                             SUE

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Now go over there and get those digits.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   You're money.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                        (pulling him aside, dead
                        serious)
                   Now when you talk to her, I don't want
                   you to be the guy in the PG-13 movie that
                   everyone's pulling for.  I want you to be
                   the guy in the rated R movie who you're
                   not sure if you like.

        Mike nods and, energized by the bombardment, crosses back to
        the bar and right into the fray.

        Trent and Sue rejoin the other swingers.

        Swinger's P.O.V. of Mike decisively engaging her in
        conversation.

        She laughs.

        Out comes the pen and the cocktail napkin.  Bingo.

        Mike crosses back to the swingers' table and, using his body
        to shield Nikki's view, pretends to rip the napkin.  This
        breaks the guys up.

        Mike sits down and, after admiring the blotchy numerals,
        delicately folds the napkin and pockets it.

<b>                             TRENT

</b>                   How long do I wait to call?

<b>                             TRENT

<b>                             MIKE

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Yeah.  I guess you could call it that.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   Definitely.  Two days.  That's the

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                        (to Sue. shop talk)
                   ... I used to wait two days.  Now
                   everyone waits two days.  Three days is

<b>                             SUE

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Yeah, but three days is kinda the

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (interrupting sarcastically)
                   Why don't I just wait three weeks and
                   tell her I was cleaning out my wallet and
                   found her number...

<b>                             CHARLES
</b>                   ... then ask where you met her...

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and
                   then I'll ask what she looks like.
                        (pause)
                   Then I'll ask if we fucked.  How's that,
                   Tee?  Is that "the money"?

        The guys laugh.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   Laugh all you want, but if you call to

<b>                             SUE

<b>                             MIKE

</b>
<b>   51   EXT.  THE DRESDEN - PARKING LOT - OUT BACK - NIGHT               51
</b>
        The swingers are leaving through the back door.  The doorway
        is congested with another group of guys who are entering.

        A BALD GUY with a goatee brushes by Sue.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   Watch where you're going, asshole.

<b>                             BALD GUY
</b>                   What'd you say, bitch?

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   I said watch where you're going, bitch!

        That's it.  Now they're squaring off in the empty parking
        lot.

        All the bald guy's boys fall in behind him.  All the swingers
        fall in behind Sue.  The swingers are not happy with Sue at
        all.

        The two cliques contrast each other in every way.

        The bald guys all have facial hair and multiple pierced
        extremities with the odd neck-tattoo thrown in for good
        measure.

        Baggy denim and boots.  Pot leaves and Pumas.  Long, heavy
        key chains.  Vintage 1994 whiteboy faux-gansta.  They do,
        however, look big and mean next to our boys.

        The early sixties style sweater jackets and blazers over
        button down shirts and tapered slacks don't quite have the
        same fear factor, but the boys do look classy.

        The word "bitch" is growled out by the two of them a half
        dozen more times until...

        Sue pulls a PISTOL out of his belt.

        Everyone is SCARED.  Especially the swingers.

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   Now what, bitch?  Now who's the bitch,
                   bitch?

        The bald guys HOLD UP THEIR HANDS and slowly back up to their
        ride.

<b>                             BALD GUY
</b>                   Hey, man.  I'm the bitch.  I'm <b>your</b>
                   bitch, okay?  We're just gonna leave.
                   Okay?  I'm the bitch.  I'm such a bitch,
                   I can't even begin to tell you...

        They jump in the car and SPEED AWAY.

        Sue belts the gun and stands tall like Clint.

<b>                             TRENT
</b>                   What the fuck..?

<b>                             SUE
</b>                   What'd you want me to do?  Back down?  He
                   called me a bitch.  We kept our rep.

<b>                             CHARLES

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Yeah, I gotta be up early tomorrow.

        Rob leaves, shaken up.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   You asshole.  Why are you carrying a gun?

                   day.  Nobody's mugging you on no subway.
                   In New York the trouble finds you.  Out

        furnished single.

        He drops his keys on the table and makes a bee line to the

        He pushes the button.

        He pulls out the COCKTAIL NAPKIN.  He stares at the number.

        Mike shakes his head again.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   You haven't been drinking, have you?

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   No.  Just O.J.

        Rob cuts into the pepperoni with his Swiss army knife.  Mike
        drinks his juice.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Sorry about what happened at the Dresden.
                   I had no idea...

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Don't sweat it.  Now I got an L.A. gun
                   story.  You should hear the way I tell to
                   the guys back home.  He had an Uzi.

        Mike half-smiles.

        Beat.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   You want to talk about it?

</b>                   They went for someone with more theme
                   park experience.  I woulda killed for
                   that job.

        Mike lets it sink in.

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   See, it's all how you look at it.  If
                   your life sucks, then mine is God awful.
                   I mean, I moved out here partially
                   because I saw how well you were doing.
                   You got in the union, you got an agent.
                   I thought if you could make it, maybe I
                   could too...

<b>                             MIKE

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   That's your problem, man.  You can't see
                   what you've got, only what you've lost.
                   Those guys are right.  You are "money".

        Mike smiles, then...

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                        (starting to cry)

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Because you left, man.  She's got her own
                   world to deal with in New York.  She was
                   a sweet girl but fuck her.  You gotta
                   move on.  You gotta let go of the past.
                   The future is so beautiful.  Every day is
                   so sunny out here.  It's like Manifest
                   Destiny man.  I mean, we made it.  What's
                   past is prologue.  That which does not
                   kill us makes us stronger.  All that
                   shit.  You'll get over it.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   How did you get over it?  I mean how long
                   'til it stopped hurting?

<b>                             ROB
</b>                   Sometimes is still hurts.  You know how
                   it is, man.  I mean, each day you think
                   about it less and less.  And then one day
                   you wake up and you don't think of it at
                   all, and you almost miss that feeling.
                   It's kinda weird.  You miss the pain
                   because it was part of your life for so
                   long.  And the, boom, something reminds
                   you of her, and you just smile that
                   bittersweet smile.

        We see that Mike has been GNAWING AWAY at Rob's pepperoni and
        semolina as he listens intently.

<b>                             MIKE

                   You lived with it so long.

<b>                             MIKE

                   put on some weight.

        for trouble.  His face lights up.

        hockey against the BALD GUY from the Dresden.

</b>                   Bitch!  You bitch!

        The room is filled with the BALD GUY'S CREW.  They greet Mike
        as they take hits off their forty ouncers.

        They do a high-speed "controller handoff."

        Sue crosses to Mike.

        a Scorsese-style STEADICAM SHOT which continues up the stairs

        They enter the domed decco lounge and the full house parts
        for them and greets them in perfect Scorsese choreography.

        They pass the billiard table and the circular brass rail bar.

        The six piece swing band decked out in zoot suits wail on
        stage as the crowded dance floor whirls.

        The swingers eventually settle into a dark curtained-off
        onstage booth.

        The parquet floor is packed with swinging hepsters dressed in
        Hollywood's take on forties threads.  The dancing is full-
        blown overcrowded slam swing.  The floor is full, and
        everyone is damn good.  This definitely aint amateur night.

        Mike steps up to the bar to refill his drink.  He sees a
        BRUNETTE sitting at the bar.

        She's cute.

        Real cute.

        She glows.

        There's something fresh about her.  She's dressed nice, but
        different.  She definitely is not a regular.

        She throws Mike a half-smile, then looks away.

        He looks away.

        Should he?

        He shakes his head to himself.  No.

        Beat.

        He looks over at her again.

        Mike's P.O.V. of a WHITE BUNNY sitting on the bar stool.

        He smiles, shrugs, and CROSSES TO HER.

                   he doesn't like to dance.  Maybe all he

                   drink and smoke and look cool with his

<b>                             BRUNETTE

                   what he's afraid of.

                   she shouldn't be such a smug little shit
                   because she'd be surprised at what a good
                   dancer he really is, but it's been a long
                   time and he doesn't know if he's ready

        She's in great shape,  and look how classy her vintage dress
        looks.  A vision from the forties.  She's too good for this
        place.  She belongs on the nose of a B-52.  What can he say,

        He awkwardly leads her to the unusually empty dance floor.
        They START TO DANCE.  It's a slow song and they boringly rock
        back and forth.  Mike is self-conscious, but her touch.  Oh
        her touch.

        The couple's dance is cut short as there were only a few bars
        left of the slow ballad.  Mike smiles politely in relief and
        begins to lead Lorraine off the floor.

        She pulls him back.  He's not getting off that easy.  She
        wants a whole song.  He politely holds her, poised for
        another slow number.  They're alone on the floor.

        Much to Mike's dismay, the song begins with a DRIVING TOM TOM
        SOLO.  This cues every hep cat in the Derby that the big
        one's coming.  They all flood the floor for the last dance of
        the night.

        Mike pleadingly shakes his head at Lorraine.  It's too fast.
        Her eyes narrow as her grip tightens.  No sympathy here.

        The band breaks into the full-tilt swing number and the dance
        floor writhes around them.

        They stand motionless for what seems like an eternity.

        Gut check.  Fuck it.  Sink or swim.

        Mike grabs her like a man grabs a woman.  It's just a simple
        six-count swing step, but they're in perfect harmony.

        Mike and Lorraine look into each others eyes.  It's on, baby.

        As Mike's courage grows, the moves start to flow.  A spin at
        first.  Then a double twirl.  It's not long before he's
        throwing her through combinations that stand out even among
        the pros.

        Mike is whipping her smoothly through violent-looking
        combinations without a trace of hesitation, and, boy, can she
        follow.

        The set ends with a flourishing crescendo.  They're frozen in
        a final dip, panting through a glaze of clean sweat.

        Mike and Lorraine smile and look into each other's eyes.  The
        smile slowly disappears.  Will they kiss?

        They're close.

        Really close.

        Lips almost touching.

        Mike tries to muster-up the courage, but it's been so long.

        He can't do it.  He lets her up.

        The floor clears.  Exhausted dancers push past them.  Forget
        it.  The moment's gone.

        What the hell.  They had a great time.  What's the hurry?

        Trent and sue pretend to cry and hug each other.

        Mike looks at them in the rear view mirror.

        He smirks and shakes his head.

        Mike is standing in the middle of the room looking at
        LORRAINE'S NUMBER on the back of the BUSINESS CARD.

        He looks at the clock.

<b>        2:45 A.M.
</b>
        He looks back at the NUMBER.

        Beat.

        He thinks better of it.  He wedges it into a crack in the
        answering machine and unbuttons his shirt for bed...

        He walks to the phone and pulls the CARD out of the crack.

        He looks at the clock.

        He sticks it back in the crack.

        He makes an "x" on a day of his calendar.

        Mike brushes his teeth.

        He looks at the card clipped into the frame of the bathroom
        mirror.

        He turns the faucet, allowing exactly ONE DROP of his
        precious Los Angeles water supply to drip onto his
        toothbrush.

        He resumes brushing.

        Mike is playing solitaire with the CARD laying above all the
        playing cards.

        The PHONE RINGS.

        Mike rushes to get it, then forces himself to wait another
        ring and a half exactly.

</b>                   That's okay.  I wanted to talk to you.

        Mike holds his palm over the receiver and looks at the
        answering machine.

        Beat.

                   You're money, baby.

        Mike smiles.

        Back to Lorraine.

        MEDIUM SHOT of Mike through his window as he looks down onto
        Franklin avenue and talks on the phone.

<b>                             MIKE
</b>                   Hi, Lorraine.  Thanks for holding on.

<b>                             LORRAINE
</b>                   Listen, Mike.  You really didn't have to
                   get off the line.  I just wanted to ask
                   you one thing.  I know I shouldn't have
                   called, I mean, my friends said I should
                   wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound
                   like such a schoolgirl... It's just that
                   it's tonight only... I mean, it's
                   Sinatra's birthday and they have this
                   thing every year at "The Room".  Do you
                   know where that is?  It's impossible to
                   find if you've never been there.  I don't
                   understand why none of the clubs in
                   Hollywood have signs.  Anyway, I'm so bad
                   at this, if you're not busy I thought you
                   might...

        Mike smiles as the CAMERA PULLS BACK from the window and
        backwards down Franklin Avenue in a reverse of the first shot
        of the movie.  The soundtrack kicks in with Sinatra's "Here's
        To The Losers"....

                   hears that wedding bell...

                   Those torches you carry...
                   Must be drowned in champagne...

        ... Up and over Hollywood Boulevard.  High above the city...

<b>                             FRANK
</b>                   Here's the last toast of the evening...

                   All the losers will be winners...
                   All the givers shall receive...
                   Here's to trouble-free tomorrows...
                   May your sorrows all be small...
                   Here's to the losers... Bless them all.
