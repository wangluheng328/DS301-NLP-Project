In a small Florida town, the weather is hot.
And for Ned Racine, a seedy lawyer with an overactive sex drive, things are about to get hotter.
He makes a play for the intoxicating blonde he spots at an outdoor concert.
He seems to be making progress, but she disappears; yet not before he learns enough about her to find her again.
He finds her in a bar.
She invites him to her place to look at her wind chimes.
He sees them; she sends him away.
But he knows she really wants him, and he's right.
He looks inside.
She's waiting for him.
There's only one thing left for a self-respecting lecher to do: throw a chair through the window.
Their torrid affair has begun, and everything seems to be his idea: even when the idea is to murder her husband.
