<pre>
<b>					GRIFTERS
</b>				by Donald E. Westlake

			   Based on the novel by Jim Thompson. 

							Second Draft. 	
							March 1989
<b>-----------------------------------------------------------------------
</b>
<b>	FADE IN:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE establishing the race track, Ruidoso Downs
	(pronounced Ree-oh-do-so), set among the beautiful mountains
	of New Mexico's Lincoln National Forest, as a white Chrysler
	turns in with a stream of cars moving toward the parking
	area.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE through the open driver-side window of the Chrysler
	at LILLY DILLON, 39 but looking younger, beautiful but cold
	and watchful.
<b>	
</b>	WIDE SHOT, track in b.g. as Lilly parks the Chrysler, gets
	out, locks the car. As she walks toward the track, WIPE
	RIGHT, as SCENE TWO WIPES IN from the left. SCENE ONE CAMERA
	FOLLOWS Lilly as she walks across the large parking area.
<b>	SPLIT SCREEN.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	SCENE TWO:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Downtown Los Angeles, near the courts and the business
	section. ROY DILLON, 25, handsome and charming but self
	indulgent, parks his orange Honda convertible, gets out,
	picks up a large ledger book from the back seat, goes around
	to open the trunk.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the trunk, establishing the tools of the
	salesman's trade: catalogs, samples, ledgers full of manuals
	and product sheets. Roy adds the ledger from the back seat,
	shuts the trunk, walks away.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. 6TH STREET - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy walks around the corner near a bar/restaurant. As he
	approaches it, WIPE LEFT, the two half-width scenes
	contracting to one-third each as SCENE THREE WIPES IN from
	the right.
<b>	
</b>	SCENE ONE: Lilly approaches the track's entrance doors.
<b>	
</b>	SCENE TWO: Roy approaches the bar.
<b>	
</b><b>	SCENE THREE:
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT. SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A baby blue Cadillac parks in front of a jeweler.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the driver's door as MYRA LANGTRY, 36, beautiful
	in an impersonal calculating way, gets out, carrying a small
	jewelry care, and locks the car. At first glance, Myra looks
	rather like Lilly. (Myra always wears large dangly earrings,
	and usually wears big-lensed dark sunglasses.)
<b>	
</b><b>	SIMULTANEOUSLY:
</b><b>	
</b>	SCENE ONE: Lilly enters the track.
<b>	
</b>	SCENE TWO: Roy enters the bar.
<b>	
</b>	SCENE THREE: Myra enters the jeweler's.
<b>	
</b>	WIPE RIGHT AND LEFT, as SCENE TWO takes FULL SCREEN.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BAR - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on a hurried bartender in a full bar, crowded with a
	NOISY lunchtime crowd. In b.g., Roy slithers his way to the
	bar, waving a bill in the air to attract the bartender's
	attention.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Roy as the bartender comes to him. Roy puts the
	bill on the bar, holding it down with one finger, as he
	SHOUTS his order. The bartender looks down.
<b>	
</b>	BARTENDER'S POV: Roy's finger holds down a twenty dollar
	bill.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE steep over Roy's shoulder, the twenty visible, as
	the bartender hurries away to get the drink. Roy's hand makes
	a fist, swallowing the twenty, opens, pushing a ten out onto
	the bar, holding it there with one finger.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the bartender returning with a draft beer,
	nodding to other ORDERS shouted to him along the way, putting
	the beer down, grabbing the bill without looking at it,
	hurrying away.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Roy, content, smiling, sipping his beer.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the bartender, hurrying by, slapping Roy's change
	down, moving on, Roy nodding acknowledgement, reaching out.
<b>	
</b>	CU, the change, a ten dollar bill on top. Roy's hand closes
	over it.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	WIDE SHOT, the tote board at the track, showing the shifting
	odds on the horses for the next race, the amounts bet.
<b>	
</b>	CLOSE SHOT, number 3. Not much bet, odds 70-1.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Lilly, frowning at the tote board. She carries a
	large heavy shoulder-bag, which she opens, looking in it as
	though it were a file drawer.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the contents of her bag, the track
	beyond her, the mountains visible out beyond the track wall.
	Lilly moves.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on a high-dollar betting window, as Lilly
	approaches, taking bank-banded wads of bills from her bag.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A change of numbers sweeps across the board.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Lilly moves away from the betting window, tucking betting
	tickets into her bag.
<b>	
</b>	ECU, Lilly's bag, compartmented, with stacks of money, small
	envelopes and notes on notepaper in each compartment. Lilly
	carefully files the betting slips.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Lilly looking out at the tote board.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	CU, number 3. Odds 32-1.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Lilly, not satisfied. She turns and goes back.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE at the betting window as Lilly arrives and makes
	more bets.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. TOTE BOARD - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	CU, number 3. Odds 32-1. CROWD NOISE INCREASES. The numbers
	shift: odds 26-1.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    CALLER (O.S.)
</b>	          And they're off!
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Very quiet, stately; abrupt contrast with the track. A slow
	ticking clock.
	Myra sits in the client's chair, while at the desk sits the
	JEWELER, a pleasant but overweight man of 40, who studies a
	jeweled bracelet through a loupe. He sighs, drops the loupe,
	shakes his head regretfully.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	          Mrs. Langtry, I'm sorry.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          Why? What's wrong?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	              (personal emotion mixed
	               in)
	          You are a valued customer, as you
	          know.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          But what's wrong?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	          I can't understand a thing like
	          this. It's something you almost
	          never see.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          What is?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	              (holding up bracelet)
	          This is some of the finest
	          filigreed platinum I've ever seen.
	          But the stones, no. They're not
	          diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          But they must be! They cut glass!
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	              (wry)
	          Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry.
	          Do you know where it was purchased?
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	An expensive hotel room, with a sunstruck day beyond the
	windows. Myra, naked, a few years younger, sits cross-legged
	on the bed and laughs at COLE "FARMER" LANGLEY, 55, stringy
	bodied, who stands naked, his back to us, hands on hips,
	presenting himself to Myra. She reaches forward, hand hidden
	by his body as she lifts something that was hanging on
	something at the front of him. She brings back the bracelet,
	looks at it, is delighted, puts it on, and then leans forward
	again toward the unmoving Cole, her head hidden by his body.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          It was a gift. It isn't worth
	          anything at all?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	              (warm, encouraging)
	          Why, of course it is. I can offer
	          you -- well, five hundred dollars.
<b>	
</b>	Myra expected -- and needed -- a lot more. She's worried,
	tense, but stuck. She nods.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          All right.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	              (rising)
	          I'll get you a check.
<b>	
</b>	He leaves the room. Myra grimaces, in almost physical pain.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. SECOND BAR - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Another crowded lunchtime bar. A big beefy BARTENDER moves
	quickly, carrying a draft beer.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Roy, in position, finger holding bill down, as
	the bartender arrives, puts down the beer, reaches for the
	bill, stops, stares at the bill.
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, the bartender and Roy, as the bartender gives Roy a
	very cold look. He knows, and Roy knows he knows. Roy tries
	an innocent smile, which doesn't work. Roy moves.
<b>	
</b>	CU, the ten dollar bill, as Roy grabs it, but the bartender
	simultaneously grabs Roy's wrist.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Roy and the bartender as Roy tries to pull away
	and the bartender holds him with his left hand while reaching
	under the bar with his right. He comes up with a sawed-off
	baseball bat. Roy, seeing it, throws his free arm up to
	protect his head, but the bartender pushes the blunt end of
	the bat straight across the bar at a downward angle and hard
	into Roy's solar plexus, driving the air out of him and
	propelling him back away from the bar, leaving the ten. The
	nearest CUSTOMERS on both sides become aware that something
	happened, but nothing follows and they're already involved in
	conversations. The bartender scoops up the ten as he puts the
	bat away under the bar.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Roy, arms folded across his torso, staring in
	shock toward the bar, where the space he filled has already
	been closed in by other bodies. Nearly retching, he stumbles
	toward the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on four PEOPLE at a table, CHEERING a race,
	switching to disgust and despair when they lose, moving away
	from the table, leaving their betting tickets behind. Lilly
	passes by, smoothly and casually scoops up the tickets, moves
	on along a row of tables, and there finding more tickets.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. JEWELER'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra sits as before. The jeweler enters with a check, which
	he hands her. She looks up at him, making no move to leave.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	          I hope you're not too badly
	          disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          It's not your fault.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	          You'll give us an opportunity to
	          serve you again, I hope. If there's
	          anything you think we might be
	          interested in...
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          I have only one thing now. Are you
	          interested?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	          Well, I'd have to see it, of
	          course.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          You are seeing it. You're looking
	          right at it.
<b>	
</b>	The jeweler is puzzled, then startled.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	          I see.
<b>	
</b>	He turns away, goes behind his desk, sits down, looks at
	Myra.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    JEWELER
</b>	          You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A
	          bracelet like that very rarely
	          happens. A fine setting and
	          workmanship usually mean precious
	          stones. It always hurts me when I
	          find they're not. I always hope -- 
	              (faint sad friendly smile)
	          -- I'm mistaken.
<b>	
</b>	Myra likes him better now, even though he hasn't solved her
	problem. She rises.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          Thank you. For everything you felt
	          you could do.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. STREET - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy has been throwing up but is finished now. He's sprawled
	like a shot deer across the hood of his Honda, still
	clutching his stomach. A police car stops, the passenger COP
	gets out. He's suspicious at first.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COP
</b>	          Sir? Everything all right?
<b>	
</b>	The sight of the uniform forces Roy into gear. He
	straightens, smiling through his pain.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Getting better. A bad shrimp, I
	          think.
<b>	
</b>	The con's suspicion changes to concern.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COP
</b>	          Want us to take you to a doctor?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          No no, I'm fine now, thanks,

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Oh, I will.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. RUIDOSO DOWNS - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Late afternoon. AN ANGLE on the parking area, where almost
	all the cars are gone and the few remaining are widely
	separated. The white Chrysler is one of these. Lilly walks to
	it from the track entrance.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the Chrysler as Lilly opens the trunk, puts her
	bag inside.
<b>	
</b>	CLOSE UP, Lilly and the trunk. She takes betting tickets from
	her bag, sorts them, files them in envelopes in different
	compartments, puts some to one side, then sorts through these
	separated tickets, throwing some away, keeping some. She
	takes money from the bag, puts tickets in, closes the bag
	with the money on the trunk floor. Reaching farther in, she
	lifts the pad deep inside the trunk, lifts the metal floor
	panel, and reveals a cache mostly filled with money. She adds
	today's skim, puts everything away, puts the bag back on her
	shoulder, closes the trunk.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A shabby apartment hotel on Wilshire. An exterior hall
	balcony on each floor has the entrance doors to the front
	apartments. Roy's Honda makes the turn and enters the
	basement garage.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MADERO LOBBY - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Modest but clean. The owner, SIMMS, a sloppy garrulous old
	bore, talks with a potential RENTER.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	          Put it this way, now. Say I rent to
	          a woman, well, she has to have a
	          room with a bath. I insist on it,
	          because otherwise she's got the
	          hall bath tied up all the time,
	          washing her goddamn hair and her
	          clothes and everything she can
	          think of.
<b>	
</b>	In b.g., Roy, still in pain, comes out of the elevator, waves
	to Simms, who waves back without pausing in his monologue,
	and crosses to the mailboxes.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	          Now, your minimum for a room with
	          bath is three hundred a month, just
	          for a place to sleep and no cooking
	          allowed.
	          And just how many of these tootsies
	          make that kind of money and have to
	          eat in restaurants and buy clothes
	          and --
<b>	
</b>	Roy, carrying his junk mail and pretending not to be in pain,
	crosses to Simms.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Mr. Simms.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	              (fawning)
	          Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here's a
	          potential new neighbor, looking at--
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (uninterested)
	          Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.
<b>	
</b>	Simms doesn't like Mrs. Langtry, but can't say so.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	          I'll send her right up.
<b>	
</b>	Roy goes back to the elevator. Simms continues his monologue.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	          I had my first hotel thirty-seven
	          years ago in Wichita Falls, Texas,
	          and that's where I began to learn
	          about women. They just don't make
	          the money, you see, not regular
	          they don't, and there's only one
	          way they can get it.
<b>	
</b>	Roy enters the elevator.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	          Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that's
	          the fine type of person I have in
	          mind for here. Like yourself, I
	          have no doubt. He's a salesman,
	          regular as clockwork, has a suite
	          here. Fine man. Now, about these
	          women. At first, you know, they
	          just go out and do it now and then,
	          just enough to make ends meet. But
	          pretty soon they got that bank open
	          twenty-four hours a day, and then
	          you've got trouble. Hookers and
	          hotellin' just don't mix.
	          You'd think the cops'd be too busy
	          catching real criminals, not
	          snooping around after working
	          girls, but that's the way the gravy
	          stains, as the saying is, and I
	          don't fight it. An ounce of
	          prevention is my motto.
<b>	
</b>	Myra enters from the front, looks across at Simms, points
	upward. Simms calls to her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	          Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he's up
	          there, he's expecting you.
<b>	
</b>	Myra crosses to the elevator. Simms speaks more softly.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	          If you keep out the women in the
	          first place, see, you keep out the
	          hookers, and then you keep out the
	          cops, and that's how you have a
	          clean place.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. ROY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE along the balcony, with Roy's apartment door in f.g.
	and Los Angeles in b.g. Myra crosses to the door, opens it
	with her key, enters.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A small crowded old-fashioned bathroom. Roy, shirt open and
	trousers pushed down almost to his crotch, looks in the
	mirror at purplish greenish bruises on his stomach. He
	touches his stomach, winces.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (O.S.)
</b>	          Roy?
<b>	
</b>	He looks at the door, then grins at his reflection.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Your medicine is here.
<b>	
</b>	He leaves the bathroom.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Hotel furniture, shabby and anonymous. On the walls,
	contrasting with everything else, are two crying-clown
	pictures on black velvet, mounted in big boxy frames. Myra
	stands in the middle of the room, and Roy enters, shirt and
	trousers still disarranged.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	              (amused by clothing)
	          Well, well. In a real hurry, are
	          we?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Always, for you, baby.
<b>	
</b>	He reaches for her, but she playfully holds him off.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          You aren't taking me for granted,
	          are you?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Taking you for granite?
<b>	
</b>	He grins, as his fingertip prods her breast.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          That isn't granite. If that fell on
	          me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	              (playing along)
	          Are you sure?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (pulling her close)
	          Let's find out.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. HIGHWAY PHONE BOOTH - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Lilly's white Chrysler is parked next to an open-air phone.
	Traffic whizzes by. Lilly talks on the phone, with pen and
	notebook at the ready. The racetrack is visible in the b.g.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          I'm done here. Do I come back to
	          Baltimore?
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	It could be an expensive, if gaudy, lawyer's office.
	Baltimore harbor is visible past the windows. IRV, the
	accountant, sits at a desk covered -- but neatly covered --
	with ledgers, computer printouts, etc. He speaks on the
	phone.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    IRV
</b>	          Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
<b>	
</b><b>	INTERCUT PHONE BOOTH AND OFFICE
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Delmar? I never go out to
	          California. That's a thousand miles
	          from here.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    IRV
</b>	          Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody
	          to handle playback this time. Come
	          on, Lilly, you don't argue with
	          Bobo.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (fatalistic)

</b>	          Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang
	          gleez on the way.
<b>	
</b>	This is Lilly making the best of the situation. She listens a
	bit more, GRUNTS a farewell, hangs up, moves to her car.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Again, anonymous hotel furniture. Roy and Myra naked in bed,
	he on his back, she straddling him, both moving gently. He's
	half feeling pleasure, half unconscious.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          Roy?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Mm?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          Look at me.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          All? It ain't bad.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          No more than this? 
<b>	
</b>	He tries to concentrate on her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          What are you talking abut, Myra?
	          Marriage?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          I didn't say that. You aren't
	          marriage material.
<b>	
</b>	He keeps watching her, ironic, hips moving. Looking for a
	distraction, she notices the bruise on his stomach.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          What's that?
<b>	
</b>	She touches it; he flinches back, in real pain.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do,
	          throw me off my game?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	              (laughing)
	          No, baby. Come to Mama.
<b>	
</b>	She folds forward onto him. He puts his arms around her. They
	rock together slowly.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. MOTEL - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The same mountains in b.g. as at the track. Lilly carries two
	small bags from her motel room, puts them on the back seat of
	the Cadillac, gets behind the wheel, drives away.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra, dressed, primps at the mirror, surveys herself
	critically, is reasonably satisfied, leaves.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy lies supine on the bed, semi-conscious, half-covered by a
	sheet. Myra, casual, not noticing his condition, leans her
	head in through the doorway.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          Wore you out, did I? It's a good
	          woman you can't keep down, baby.
<b>	
</b>	He moves fitfully, CROAKS an attempt at speech.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          Have a good sleep, baby. Call you
	          tomorrow. 
<b>	
</b>	He sits up, trying to grin and be easy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Wait'll next year.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE across Roy's profile, with open bedroom door beyond
	him. Through it, the living room and outer door can be seen.
	Myra crosses the living room, opens the door. Bright sunlight
	pours in, emphasizing the sweat on his face. She closes the
	door, and he gives up trying to smile. Gingerly, he touches
	his bruised stomach, winces.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Damn that guy.
<b>	
</b>	He's going to get out of bed, but movement creates pain. He
	sits back against the headboard, looks around, reaches
	painfully to the bedside table drawer, takes a quarter from
	it, studies the quarter, feels it with fingertips, places it
	on the back of his left hand, slowly moves the soft pads of
	his right palm over it, then turns the quarter over and
	repeats. Then he takes the quarter in his right hand, flips
	it, slaps it down onto the back of his left hand, SPEAKS
	simultaneously with the hands coming together.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Smack.
<b>	
</b>	He looks away, right hand moving minimally on left hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Heads.
<b>	
</b>	He lifts the right hand, nods, then flips the coin again,
	looks away, moves the right hand slightly.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Heads.
<b>	
</b>	Again he's right. Again he repeats.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Tails.
<b>	
</b>	He's about to repeat when a wave of weakness comes over him.
	He sits back, gasping, but won't acknowledge the problem.
	He forces himself to flip the coin, misses catching it, finds
	it on the blanket, flips it again, slaps it onto the back of
	the other hand, looks away.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Tails.
<b>	
</b>	Right again. He prepares to flip the coin, but then his hand
	sags onto the covers, his chin drops, his eyes glaze.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (whispered)
	          How much can I bet?
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The train runs through a forest, tree shadows making a light
	and-dark pattern. Roy, four or five years younger, sits with
	a three-core-monte gang, consisting of a DEALER, a spectacled
	SHILL beside him, Roy facing the dealer, a ROPER next to Roy.
	On a briefcase on the dealer's lap are three cards, face up:
	An ace and two deuces. Across the aisle, alone in the seats,
	sits MINTZ, a conman in his fifties, pretending not to watch,
	but watching with amusement.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    DEALER
</b>	          That's between you two. I got
	          nothing at stake here, I'm just
	          dealing.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SHILL
</b>	          What if we both guess wrong? You
	          aren't gonna take...
<b>	
</b>	The dealer turns aside, allowing himself to be distracted. He
	and the shill ARGUE nonsensically. The roper nudges Roy, then
	reaches out and crimps the ace. Roy's doing a wide-eyed
	bumpkin kid; he stares at the roper in delight and amazement.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the shill, arguing with the dealer but looking
	toward Roy and the roper, then increasing the force of his
	argument.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE across the amused Mintz at the roper whispering to
	Roy.
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, Roy and the roper.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROPER
</b>	          We got him now! Put down that big
	          bill you got.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (whispered)
	          The fifty or the hundred?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROPER
</b>	          The hundred! Hurry!
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (doubtful)
	          The ace is what I want?
<b>	
</b>	The roper's having trouble keeping his patience.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROPER
</b>	          Sure it is!
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, the dealer and the shill, fake-squabbling, Roy and
	the roper seen in b.g. between their faces, Roy finally
	bringing out his wallet, withdrawing a bill. Relieved, the
	dealer and the shill cut the crap.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the group as Roy puts his hundred dollar bill on
	the briefcase.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Is that okay?
<b>	
</b>	The shill pulls a messy wad of bills from his inner pocket,
	uses most of it to cover the bet.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SHILL
</b>	          You're damn right that's okay.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    DEALER
</b>	              (picks up the cards)
	          Whoever finds the ace, wins.
<b>	
</b>	ECU, the dealer's hands, shuffling the cards at lightning
	speed. He deals the cards out face down.

</b>	CU, Roy's sweat-covered face, eyelids fluttering.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

	          Dark in here.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the group. Roy squints at the cards, light and
	dark playing on his face.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Too dark. I just can't see.
<b>	
</b>	Casually, but too quickly to be stopped, he reaches across
	and plucks the shill's glasses off.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Let me borrow these, will you?
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE across Mintz, surprised and amused, at the group in
	b.g., in consternation as Roy puts on the glasses and looks
	down at the cards.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Now, that's better.
<b>	
</b>	ROY'S POV: The glasses are 'readers.' Through them, a large
	gray 'A' can be seen on the back of one of the non-crimped
	cards. Roy's hand reaches out and flips it over. It's the ace
	of spades.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE across Roy toward the doorway. Roy, eyes closed,
	smiles in triumph, then winces in pain. Mintz partially
	appears, hovering beside the bed, grinning at Roy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MINTZ
</b>	          I didn't teach you that.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (whispered)
	          You taught me a lot. Then I
	          invented.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. AIRPORT DEPARTURE LOUNGE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Weary bored people sit around waiting. Roy, 17, lugging a big
	suitcase, walks through, takes a seat near Mintz, who's doing
	card tricks for his own pleasure. Roy watches, then moves
	closer.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Let me see how you did that one.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MINTZ
</b>	          Scram. Go home.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          I can't. I just left home.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MINTZ
</b>	          You're too young. You should be in
	          school.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          I am in school.
<b>	
</b>	Mintz peers at him, taking an interest. Then he holds up the
	five of spades, shows it to Roy, puts it back in the deck,
	shuffles, shows Roy the deck.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MINTZ
</b>	          Where's the five?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          In your other hand.
<b>	
</b>	Mintz grins slowly, turns his hand over with the palmed card
	showing.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BEDROOM NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy slumps, eyes closed, half-smiling, with the fever Mintz
	hovering. Roy's smile fades, his fluttering eyelids grow
	still, his face slack. The fever Mintz fades and disappears.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on a large sign indicating "Los Angeles" straight
	ahead. CAMERA PANS DOWN and around 180 degrees to face the
	several lanes of heavy Los Angeles-bound traffic. LONG BEAT.
	Hundreds of cars rush by. CAMERA PANS with Lilly's white
	Chrysler as it comes along in the stream.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE through the Chrysler's left side window at Lilly,
	driving, concentrating, biting her left thumbnail. She
	becomes aware that's what she's doing, shakes her head in
	irritation: She's trying to break herself of this habit.
	Ostentatiously she tucks the thumb into her fist, rests the
	fist on top of the steering wheel, where she can keep an eye
	on it.
<b>	
</b>	HIGH ANGLE on the westbound lanes. The Chrysler passes. Soon
	it's out of sight among all the other cars. LONG BEAT.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE across the unmoving unconscious Roy toward the
	doorway. The apartment door beyond the living room opens,
	throwing light on Roy, who doesn't react. Lilly enters, in
	silhouette, closes the door, crosses toward the bedroom.
	(Until she speaks, we can't be quite sure who this is. With
	the similarity between herself and Myra, this could be Myra.)
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (hesitant)
	          Roy?

</b>	No reaction. Lilly, getting worried, moves closer, through
	the bedroom doorway.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Roy? You asleep?
<b>	
</b>	His head moves slightly. He barely has strength to speak.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Myra?
<b>	
</b>	She moves forward to the side of the bed, only her torso IN

<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (startled)
	          My God!
<b>	
</b>	She turns, hurries back to the living room, looks around for
	the phone, crosses to it, dials, SPEAKS. Roy's eyes open, he
	frowns.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Lilly?
<b>

	          Don't worry, he knows who Bobo is.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE down toward Roy, from above, he's weak but troubled.
	Eyes closed, frowning, whispering.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Go away, Lilly. Go away.
<b>	
</b>	Roy's eyes close. He looks dead. SLOW FADE.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The DOCTOR, a nervous heavyset man in his fifties, a drinker
	from the look of him, is on the phone in b.g., while Lilly
	prowls the room, looking at everything with distaste, then
	stopping to frown at the box-framed clown pictures. She
	doesn't get it. She touches one of the pictures, trying to
	understand. The doctor hangs up, turns to Lilly.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    DOCTOR

</b>	The doctor stares at her in astonishment, then in belief.
	SOUND of ambulance siren. To break the moment, he crosses to
	the door, opens it. Light bathes Lilly. The doctor steps back
	across the threshold, waiting for the ambulance. He looks
	back at Lilly, who stares at him.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. AMBULANCE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	ECU, Roy, skin pallid, eyes closed and sunken, lips white.
	SOUND of siren LOUDER. SOUND SEGUES to CHILD CRYING. CRYING
<b>	FADES.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A clumsy slum hotel fifteen years ago, with a tiny lobby, the
	DESK CLERK at a half-door in one wall. Lilly, at 24, enters
	from the street. This is a definite hooker, with bright
	maroon hair and a black-and-white miniskirt. She stops
	wordlessly at the desk for her key.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    CLERK
</b>	              (handing key)

</b><b>	                    LILLY

<b>	
</b><b>	                    CLERK
</b>	              (sympathetic to Roy)
	          The kids beat him up, because his
	          home life is, uh, different.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (ironic)
	          I like you, too.
<b>	
</b>	The clerk shrugs. He doesn't like this tough broad. He turns
	and calls back into his office.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    CLERK
</b>	          Roy, your mother's here.
<b>	
</b>	Roy, 10, comes reluctantly out to Lilly, sniffling and
	rubbing his arm.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY

</b><b>	                    ROY

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          You always say that!
<b>	
</b>	Lilly won't take him seriously, but she relents enough to
	stop teasing him, and to pat his head, ignoring how he
	flinches away.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Come on, kid, let's see if there's

	          Hah.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly gives him a jaundiced look, walks Roy to the stairs and
	up. The clerk, scornful but sexually interested, watches her
	go.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	ECU, Roy in a hospital bed, with more color in his face,
	breathing more normally. He begins to react to the sound of
	people speaking.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (O.S.)

<b>	
</b>	Roy's eyes open, he looks toward the voices.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (O.S.)
</b>	          I'm Roy's friend.
<b>	
</b>	WIDE SHOT, Lilly and Myra facing one another across the foot
	of Roy's bed, in a two-bed hospital room. (The OLD MAN in the
	other bed sleeps through the scene.) Neither woman is yet
	aware that Roy's awake. Lilly looks Myra up and down, with
	obvious contempt.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Yes. I imagine you're lots of

</b>	          Oh, of course, now that I see you

<b>	
</b>	The women, startled, both move toward Roy, one on each side
	of the bed.
<b>	
</b>	THREE SHOT, Myra and Lilly both leaning over to look down at
	Roy's sleepy face.

<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY

</b><b>	                    LILLY

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          I was kind of... inconvenient...

<b>	
</b>	Lilly has nothing but contempt for Myra. To be humiliated in
	front of Myra -- and by her son -- is the worst thing that

	can.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY

<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

	Long doorbell RING. Exasperated, she slaps the tweezers down,

<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Another furnished apartment, this one with Myra's clothing

	She crosses to the door, pulls it open. The APARTMENT MANAGER
	enters; a sullen, nervous, heavyset man.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

</b><b>	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy, very comfortable in pajamas and robe, sits in a

	          Bring me the towel.
<b>	
</b>	Fumbling slightly, she folds the towel edges together to make
	a bag, then stands, brings the towel to Bobo. He makes a
	production out of getting his grip on the edges just right.
	She stands as limp as she can, just wanting to get through
	this. He looks at her without expression, rears back with the
	towel, swings it forward, lets it drop open. Oranges roll on
	the floor. Lilly stares, wide-eyed, recognizing reprieve.
	Bobo tosses the towel behind him onto the sofa, then gestures
	contemptuously for her to pick up the oranges again.
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, closer, as Lilly turns, bending toward the oranges,
	and Bobo picks up his cigar, then lifts a foot and kicks her
	flatfooted, hard, in the back. She sprawls on the floor. He
	follows and drops to his knees on her back.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE close on Lilly on the floor, Bobo's knees grinding
	back and forth into her back.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Bobo, grimacing as he bears down, pressing his
	weight onto her back. He leans forward, left hand bracing
	himself on the floor beside her head as he reaches down with
	the cigar held in his right hand and presses the ember
	against the back of her splayed-out right hand.
<b>	
</b>	ECU, Lilly, clenching her teeth, tears squeezing from her
	eyes, simply bearing it.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Bobo, catching a bad smell, looking back down
	behind himself at Lilly's body. This is the result he wanted,
	but it disgusts him. He straightens up, still kneeling on
	her, puts the cigar in his mouth, doesn't like its taste,
	removes it, braces his left hand against her back while he
	lifts off her, getting back up onto his feet.
<b>	
</b>	WIDE SHOT, Bobo stepping over her, expression repulsed.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    BOBO (CONT'D)
</b>	          Go clean yourself up.
<b>

	her burnt hand. Not looking toward Bobo, hobbling with knees
	together, she starts from the room.

</b><b>	INT. KAGGS' OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Small, crowded, efficient, with interior windows showing the
	aisles of bins. Kaggs leads Roy in, shuts the door, gestures
	at the second chair as he goes behind the desk.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          Take a seat.
<b>	
</b>	They both sit, Roy amused and observant.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          When I said you being the best
	          salesman here didn't say much, I
	          meant for us. I know your record
	          with Sarber and Webb, and I'd say
	          you're a top-flight man, but you've
	          had no incentive. No one walking on
	          your heels. Just a lot of half
	          asses, so the tendency's been not
	          to stretch yourself. I'm bouncing
	          the slobs, incidentally.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	              (dry)
	          So I heard.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          Makes no difference to me if
	          they're only on commission. If they
	          don't make good money, they're not
	          giving us good representation, and
	          we can't afford to have them
	          around. Ever supervise salesmen?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Just myself.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          That's right, you've had to
	          supervise yourself. This place
	          needs a sales manager. Somebody
	          who's proved he's a salesman and
	          can handle other salesmen. He'd
	          have a lot of deadwood to clear
	          out, new men to hire. What do you
	          think?
<b>	
</b>	Roy doesn't yet know he's being offered the job.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Sounds like a good Idea.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS
</b>	          I don't know offhand what your best
	          year's been, we can look it up. The
	          idea is, we'll top it by fifteen
	          percent.
<b>	
</b>	Now Roy gets it. He's startled, almost scared, thinks
	automatically of escape.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          What? Me?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          That's just the first year. If you
	          aren't worth a lot more than that
	          the second year, I'll kick you out.
	          What do you say?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Well, uh... No.

	          No?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          I can't take that job! I mean, I
	          mean, I can't take it right away.
	          I'm still recuperating, I just
	          dropped in to say hello, see
	          everybody --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look
	          a little pale. How soon will you be
	          ready? A week?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          But you need a man right now. It
	          wouldn't be fair to you to --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          I take care of the being-fair-to-me
	          department. Things've gone to hell
	          this long, they can go a little
	          longer.

</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (trapped)
	          Well...

</b>	Kaggs gets to his feet, terminating the meeting.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (rising)
	          Oh, sure. Fine.

</b>	Kaggs sticks his hand out for another shake. Roy obliges.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm

<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy's place. Roy enters from the bedroom, carrying a
	suitcase, which he drops on the sofa. He goes to one of the
	box-framed clown pictures, takes it off the wall, puts it
	face down on the coffee table, removes two wing nuts holding
	the back, lifts off the back, and reveals stacks of money
	hidden inside. He takes two wads of money out, counting them,
	putting them on the coffee table, then fits the back in
	place, reattaches the wing nuts, and hangs the picture on the
	wall. Stuffing the wads of money into the suitcase, he
	leaves.

</b><b>	EXT. UNION STATION - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A cab pulls up to discharge passengers. Roy and the DRIVER
	get out. Roy pays the driver, who opens the trunk to take out
	several pieces of luggage. Myra leans hesitantly out, as
	though afraid it's raining out there.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          This really is it. Union Station.
<b>	
</b>	Myra comes out of the cab. She's feeling testy. Roy's in a
	good mood and ignores her bad temper.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          I don't see why we have to take the

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE from outside the passenger car through the window at
	Myra, mulish, watching the scenery go by. Beyond her Roy's
	easy, content. He moves to get up.
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, within the train. Myra looks questioningly at Roy
	as he stands.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

	the window again.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Four young SOLDIERS sit at a table in a rudimentary bar car.
	They're drinking bloody Marys out of plastic glasses and
	having a good time together. In b.g., several customers are
	clustered at the small service bar, waiting for drinks.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Roy, at the service bar, looking back past other
	people at the soldiers. He gets his mixed drink, in a plastic
	glass, and turns away.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the soldiers as Roy starts by. The train lurches,
	and Roy falls heavily against their table, slopping their
	drinks and spilling some of his own on the table.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Oh! Ow, I'm sorry! Oh, look, I

<b>	
</b><b>	                    SOLDIER 3

<b>	
</b>	Roy firmly places his own glass on their table.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          What are those, bloody Marys? Watch

<b>	
</b>	He leaves, while the soldiers are still PROTESTING.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. TRAIN - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra applies makeup, watching herself in her compact mirror.
	She becomes aware of eyes, and looks around.
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, Myra and a BUSINESSMAN, sitting across the way,
	grinning at her. Myra registers him.
<b>	
</b>	CU, Myra, considering the possibilities. Then she shrugs,
	shakes her head at the businessman almost reluctantly, and
	goes back to applying makeup.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BAR CAR - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy now sits with the soldiers, eagerly listening to them
	talk. There are plastic glasses enough on the table for three
	rounds of drinks.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SOLDIER 3

<b>	
</b>	They watch as he bends, picks up one die from the floor,
	holds it where they can all see it, his manner open,
	guileless.

<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE close on Roy, his eyes glittering, his fist with the
	die shaking beside his head.
<b>	
</b>	WIDE SHOT. Roy throws. They all look at the die. Roy spreads
	his hands; the good sport.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

<b>	
</b>	Myra's POV: Roy and the soldiers rolling the die for money.
<b>	
</b>	ECU, Myra, absorbed, watching.
<b>	
</b>	Myra's POV: MOS through the glass. ECU, Roy's hand with the

</b>	ECU, Myra, smiling, pleased.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. DINER - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A brightly lit Hopperish place. Lilly sits alone in a booth
	eating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside
	the bowl. A DRUNK with a great deal of faith in his own charm
	sits with a male FRIEND at the counter, drinking coffee. The
	drunk keeps looking toward Lilly, grinning, COMMENTING
	playfully to his friend, who's bored by it all. Lilly doesn't
	seem to be aware of him.
<b>	
</b>	The drunk rises from his stool, turning toward Lilly,
	staggering slightly. His friend makes a small move to stop
	him, then shrugs and lets him go. The drunk makes his way to
	Lilly's table, leans on it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    DRUNK 
</b>	          Pretty woman like you shouldn't eat

</b>	Lilly gives him a flat look.

</b>	          We could have coffee together. My
	          name's Kenny.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly looks over at the drunk's friend, who pointedly ignores
	the situation.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Your pal wants you.
<b>	
</b>	The drunk could turn mean; his gesture brushing away the idea
	of his friend is stronger than necessary.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    DRUNK
</b>	          Let him find his own pretty woman.
<b>	
</b>	The waitress arrives, with the coffee pot and a mug. She puts

<b>	
</b><b>	                    DRUNK
</b>	          I'll sit here. Move over.
<b>	
</b>	The drunk wants to sit beside Lilly, who looks to the
	waitress to solve the problem, but the waitress stands there
	with the coffee pot, looking helpless. The drunk bends to
	slide onto the seat. Lilly, exasperated, rabbit punches him
	in the throat.
<b>	
</b>	The drunk, astounded and in pain (and not breathing),
	staggers back, flailing, hitting the waitress's arm so that
	she slops coffee on him as his feet tangle and he falls
	heavily onto the floor.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly, suddenly concerned, slides out of the booth.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Oh! Are you all right?
<b>	
</b>	She goes to one knee beside the drunk, who clutches his own
	throat with both hands, retching as he tries to inhale. Lilly
	looks up at the astonished waitress.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY (CONT'D)
</b>	          I shouldn't have hit him that hard.
	          I guess I don't know my own
	          strength.
<b>	
</b>	The drunk's friend arrives and helps Lilly get the drunk to
	his feet. The drunk is breathing now, but shaken. He looks at
	Lilly with reproachful eyes. His friend transfers his
	annoyance at the drunk to Lilly.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    FRIEND 
</b>	          You didn't have to do that.

	          I thought I did. You should take
	          better care of your friend.

<b>	
</b>	The drunk and his friend head for the exit, as Lilly turns to
	the waitress.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          I'm sorry a lady can't eat in here
	          without being bothered.
<b>	
</b>	The waitress is apologetic, and also in awe of Lilly.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    WAITRESS 
</b>	          It won't happen again, Ma'am, I
	          promise. Dinner's on the house.
	          More chili? Dessert? We have lovely
	          pecan pie, my husband makes it
	          himself.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          That sounds nice. Pecan pie. Thank
	          you.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly sits down as the waitress goes back behind the counter.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the waitress, as she puts down the coffee pot,
	brings out the pecan pie, prepares to slice it, pauses, looks
	with wonder toward Lilly.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	The setting is a wide porch or lanai pretending to be a 19th
	century locale; a mix of western and antebellum south; the
	usual tourist confusion of histories. The effect is both
	romantic and false. Roy and Myra linger over wine, near the
	end of their meal. Roy's relaxed, happy, expansive. Myra's

</b>	She mimes rolling the die, slowly, showing how it will roll
	out of her hand just so, then speaks to him as though to a
	bright child.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

	mind.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. DESERTED DOWNTOWN - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	New skyscrapers are separated by blank fields or small older
	buildings. Almost no traffic. A white limo drives alone down
	the street.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (V.O.) 
</b>	          All over the southwest, you've got
	          these businessmen, they were making
	          money when everybody was making
	          money, they think that means
	          they're smart.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIMO - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra, dressed expensively and fashionably, sits with
	GLOUCESTER HEBBING, a stocky businessman, sixtyish. Their
	manner suggests intimacy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (V.O.)
</b>	          And now they're hurting. Everything
	          they had was because of oil.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. NEW BUILDING - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Glossy, but no people around. The limo stops, the mustached
	CHAUFFEUR hops out and holds the door as Myra and Hebbing
	emerge and cross to enter the building, Myra carrying an
	attache case.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (V.O.)
</b>	          They still got money, but they need
	          more money, and that's just the
	          kind of guy Cole and me like.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIMO - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	The chauffeur gets back behind the wheel, adjusts the
	interior mirror so he can see himself, peels off his
	moustache, scratches his upper lip, refits the moustache more
	to his liking.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. ATRIUM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	This building has a central atrium with corridors circling
	it, waist-high walls on the atrium side, glass-walled
	elevators rising up through the atrium. Myra and Hebbing are
	visible in an elevator coming up to a high floor. It stops
	and they exit, moving down the corridor.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (V.O.)
</b>	          When the oil money was good, they
	          put up all these office buildings,
	          and now they're half empty.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	ECU, translucent glass in door with company name: COE, STARK,

<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE showing the well-furnished outer office, the
	attractive and competent RECEPTIONIST welcoming Myra as
	someone she knows, gesturing her through, Myra graciously
	accepting, moving on. Hebbing's impressed by everything,
	trying not to show it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA  (V.O.)
</b>	          They'll give you anything to move
	          in; first two months free,
	          redecoration, whatever you want.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE in a clerical office, four CLERKS at well-equipped
	desks with computer terminals, hard at work.
	Maps and clocks on the walls indicate the world. Myra and
	Hebbing pass through.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (V.O.)
</b>	          They help you set up the store!
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE in the PRIVATE SECRETARY'S office, she on the phone,
	nodding and smiling at Myra and waving her through. Myra
	leads the way, opening a door marked HENRY FELLOWES, Partner.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (V.O.)
</b>	          I'm the roper, I go out and find
	          them and bring them in. Cole ran
	          the store, and he was the best.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra and Hebbing enter an office decorated with sleekly
	understated opulence; the view through large windows is of
	apparently-prosperous skyscrapers. Cole, a plausible rich
	businessman, happily greets Myra.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE 
</b>	          Mary Beth! As beautiful as ever.
<b>	
</b>	He lifts a dubious eyebrow toward Hebbing.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE
</b>	              (gentle disapproval)
	          I see you brought a friend.
<b>	
</b>	As Mary Beth, Myra has a faint southern-belle accent and a
	clinging flirtatiousness.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard, my

</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	              (gaily innocent)
	          Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about
	          it, how brilliant you are at making
	          money for your special clients!
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE
</b>	              (alarmed)
	          Mary Beth, I hope you aren't
	          spreading this good news too
	          widely.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Well, of course not! I know how

	          trust Mister Hebbing with anything.
	              (to Hebbing; suggestive)
	          Wouldn't I, darling?
<b>	
</b>	While Hebbing looks manly and flustered and pleased, Cole
	brings from under his desk a partially full gray canvas sack
	marked Federal Reserve Bank.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE 
</b>	          Well, I'll have to take your word

</b>	              (innocent avarice)
	          Goody!
<b>	
</b>	Myra opens her attache case on the desk. Cole takes banded
	stacks of bills from the sack, packs them neatly in the case.
	Hebbing tries not to look envious and impressed.
<b>	
</b>	HEBBING'S POV: The top bill in each stack is a hundred.
<b>	
</b>	PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra takes a stack, riffles it for Hebbing's
	benefit.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Isn't that just beautiful?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HEBBING 
</b>	          Yes, it is.
<b>	
</b>	Myra returns the stack to the case, talks to Cole.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Henry, next time, couldn't Mister

</b>	          Oh, I know, I know, and you've been
	          wonderful since I was widowed. But
	          Mister Hebbing has--

	          -- you don't mind my telling him,

<b>	
</b>	She gestures vaguely, unable to describe the situation
	accurately. Hebbing fills in, bluff and hearty.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HEBBING 
</b>	          Top up the tanks, as It were. Until
	          this little glitch in the oil
	          economy comes to an end.
	              (man to man laugh)
	          Not that I understand exactly what
	          you do, not from Mary Beth's
	          explanation.
<b>	
</b>	Cole broods, studying Hebbing, deciding at last to trust him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE
</b>	          Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you,
	          and if she told you the story
	          already...
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

	          Mister Hebbing, we are talking
	          about breaking the law here, I want
	          to be sure you understand that. No
	          one gets hurt, but the law does get
	          broken.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HEBBING
</b>	              (a real sport; laughing)
	          Well, that's what the law's for,

<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE
</b>	              (still serious)
	          And I don't just mean the SEC. We

<b>	
</b><b>	                    HEBBING
</b>	              (suddenly serious)
	          I certainly hope not.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE 
</b>	          Loose talk is the one thing I worry
	          about.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HEBBING
</b>	          I can keep my mouth shut, Mister
	          Fellowes.
<b>	
</b>	Describing the scheme, Cole becomes increasingly
	enthusiastic.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE 
</b>	          Okay, then. Sit down, sit down.
<b>	
</b>	Hebbing sits on the sofa, Myra beside him, holding his arm in
	both of hers. Cole paces, describing.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE 
</b>	          The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours
	          ahead of us, New York one hour
	          behind. There isn't one hour of the
	          day when both are open. Information
	          moves, but it has to wait. Now, we

<b>	
</b><b>	                    HEBBING

<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE
</b>	          You're right! And this boy tapped
	          into that main link between Tokyo
	          and the New York Stock Exchange. He
	          can give us, when it's really
	          useful, a seven second delay in

	          you know what that means?
<b>	
</b>	Hebbing doesn't want to admit ignorance.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    HEBBING 
</b>	          Well, you've got your information

<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE 
</b>	          Every once in a while, a major

<b>	
</b><b>	                    HEBBING

<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE 
</b>	          We have to be ready. We have to

<b>	
</b>	Cole crosses to an inner door, pushes it partway open, looks
	back grinning with his hand on the knob.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE

<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BARE ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A bare dusty room. A ladder leans against a wall, a paint can
	on the floor beside it. Only Cole is visible in the open
	doorway. He speaks back into the main office.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE

<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (O.S.)
</b>	          We're not really interested, Henry.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Cole remains in the doorway, luring Hebbing with a smile.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE 
</b>	          It's quite a sight. You sure?
<b>	
</b>	Cole's pushing this too far. Hebbing's thinking politeness
	requires him to look. Myra's nervous, her smile with an edge
	to it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Henry, don't try Mister Hebbing's

	          cash, or it wasn't worth while. The
	          least we ever took was forty

	          Or when I put their minds to it. I
	          stayed with them, that's the

<b>	
</b>	Cole shoots her, the SOUND very loud, the men flinching away.
	Myra slaps her hand to her breast; blood spurts between her
	fingers. In terror, she turns toward Hebbing, who stares at
	the blood seeping down her white blouse. She tries to speak,
	can't. She reaches out, her bloody hand sliding down
	Hebbing's front without getting any purchase, leaving a swath
	of blood diagonally across his jacket, shirt and tie. She
	topples forward. Hebbing tries to hold her, but she slips to
	the floor.
<b>	
</b>	Cole runs around the desk toward the door, waving the gun.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE

<b>	
</b>	Cole runs from the room. The two men pull guns from hip
	holsters under their coat-tails. Hebbing, kneeling beside
	Myra, watches them approach the door, crouch, run through.
	Hebbing rises, looks around, runs to the inner door, finds it
	locked. He crosses to the main door, looks out, cautiously
	creeps from the room.
<b>	
</b>	Myra sits up.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. OFFICE - DAY

</b>	Hebbing hurries through the empty secretary's office and out

	cross to re-enter Cole's office.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. ATRIUM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Cole stands behind a pillar, watching. Across the way,
	Hebbing comes out of the office, staring around, trying to
	wipe the blood from his clothes. In obvious panic, he runs to
	the elevator, presses the button.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE through the glass wall into the elevator as it
	stops. The doors open, Hebbing hurries in, frantically jabs
	the button. The elevator descends. CAMERA PANS to Cole coming
	around the corridor, entering the office.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	General hilarity. The secretary, two men, other two clerks,
	chauffeur and receptionist are all present, opening
	champagne, Hebbing's money now out of the sack and spread on
	the desk. Myra, stripped to the waist (unconcerned about the
	others present) cleans blood from her breasts with damp
	towels. He and Myra look at one another across the room,
	broadly smile.

</b><b>	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          No, baby. Not again.
<b>	
</b>	He stares at the floor over the edge of the bed, like a

<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE
</b>	          It's hollow. You'll fall through.

</b><b>	                    MYRA

<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE

<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Cole, you scare me when this
	          happens. One of these times...
<b>	
</b>	She touches him. He suddenly lashes out, knocking her
	backward, glaring at her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    COLE

	          Oh, Cole, please. Please come out
	          of it. What would I do without you?
<b>	
</b>	Distracted, gone, unaware of her existence, he gazes around,
	hugs himself, sits staring at demons. She watches him,
	mournful, knowing he's gone.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra looks back at Roy. Her expression makes it clear she
	isn't going to tell him any more than she already has.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          He retired, and that's it. But I

	his questions drop.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	              (dubious)
	          I don't know, Myra, I never had
	          partners. I never needed them.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Not to take soldiers for a hundred
	          bucks. But how about taking a bank
	          president for a hundred grand?
<b>	
</b>	Roy doesn't like this; he's feeling pressured. Myra sees it,
	but believes she's got him anyway, so she can let up. She
	pats his hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

</b><b>	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A little drunk and happy, Roy and Myra come down the corridor
	together, then make it obvious they're going into separate

</b>	              (coy, sexy)
	          See you later.
<b>	
</b>	Roy complains, but half-heartedly, half humorously; this
	argument has already taken place.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          I still don't see why we have to

<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
<b>	
</b>	They unlock the opposing doors, look back at one another.
	Myra's smile and good-night wave are consciously cute. Roy's
	response is a little forced. They go into their rooms.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Once he's alone, Roy stops trying to look like a good sport.
	Disgusted, he tosses the room key onto the dresser, then
	crosses to sliding glass doors closed in front of a balcony.
	He's about to close the drapes when he looks out, changes his
	mind, unlocks and opens the door. He steps outside.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	A high floor, with a wide view of ocean and starry sky. Roy
	leans on the rail, looking out, thinking. He mutters to

</b>	He continues to stand there, taking some solace from the
	night. BEAT. Phone RINGS. Confused, irritated, he turns to
	look into the room. Phone RINGS. At last, he goes back into
	the room.

	KNOCK on the door. She's startled. For just a second, she's
	like a trapped animal. Then she's calm again. She turns the
	purse around, opens another zipper section, removes a pistol
	and a silencer, quickly screws the silencer onto the pistol,
	lays the pistol on the table and covers it with the

</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          No. That was the point.
<b>	
</b>	She crosses to unscrew the silencer and put both pieces back
	in her purse. Roy, watching, points at the still angry burn
	on her hand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          You ought to put a bandage on that.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          No can do. Have to dip in and out
	          of my bag too much. Besides, it'll
	          heal in the air.
<b>	
</b>	Disdainful and hurt, she pushes at the wads of money.

</b>	His own hostility shows through.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          No.
<b>	
</b>	She's not used to being vulnerable, can neither hide it nor
	really express it; can't use it as a tactic.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          I thought... I was hoping we could
	          play it straight with one another.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          You, too, Roy.
<b>	
</b>	Roy finds this parting unsatisfactory, but has nothing to
	add. With a shrug, he leaves. Lilly looks after him, her

<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra sits in the back seat of a taxi parked across the street
	from the motel. The door to Lilly's room is visible in b.g.
	Roy walks toward the street from Lilly's room.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    DRIVER
</b>	          Here he comes.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          I see him.
<b>	
</b>	Reaching the sidewalk, Roy turns to an empty cab parked on
	that side of the street, in front of the motel. Myra's driver
	shifts into gear.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
</b>	          Wait. Hold it.

<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	          Just wait.
<b>	
</b>	Roy enters the other cab, which drives away, as Lilly comes
	out of her room in b.g.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
</b>	          Ah.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly gets into her Chrysler, backs away from the slot,
	drives to the street.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
</b>	          Now we follow her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    DRIVER

<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on the two vehicles, as they leave the motel.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. DELMAR - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Where the surf meets the turf. Over the punters' heads, out
	beyond the track, spreads the Pacific Ocean, unnoticed,
	ignored. In every shot in this sequence, the ocean is visible
	but not looked at.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Lilly, with her heavy shoulderbag, moving along
	empty tables, here and there picking up used tickets.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Myra, on a different level, watching Lilly.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Lilly at the betting windows.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Myra, on a high vantage point in the stands. A
	MAN near her watches the field through binoculars. Myra ASKS
	if she can borrow them for a minute. Men are always happy to
	do Myra favors; the man gives her the binoculars. She looks
	at the field briefly, then turns and looks through the
	binoculars the other way, outside the track. The man,
	surprised, looks the same way.
<b>	
</b>	MAN'S POV: The parking area.
<b>	
</b>	PREVIOUS SHOT. The man looks in curiosity at Myra, who
	concentrates, adjusting the focus.
<b>	
</b>	MYRA'S POV: Foreshortened through the binoculars, Lilly opens
	the Chrysler's trunk, stashes money.
<b>	
</b>	PREVIOUS SHOT. Myra smiles, turns it into a sweet thank-you
	smile as she returns the binoculars to their owner.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy dives into the pool, swims underwater to the ladder,
	climbs out near a YOUNG BLONDE on a chaise longue, who's been
	admiring him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    BLONDE
</b>	          You stay down real good.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

</b><b>	                    BLONDE 
</b>	              (pointing upward)
	          Your mother's calling.
<b>	
</b>	Roy looks up.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE to show Myra waving from her balcony, four flights
	up.
<b>	
</b>	PREVIOUS SHOT. Roy's at first surprised, then amused by the
	blonde.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Naughty.
<b>	
</b>	He gathers up his towel and heads for the building.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy stands in heavy spray in the shower, half asleep, gently
	touching his stomach where the bruise used to be. KNOCK on
	door. He ignores it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (O.S.)
</b>	          Roy! You drown in there?
<b>	
</b>	He rouses himself.

</b>	          Be right out!
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra moves away from the bathroom door. She's in a bad mood.
	She paces back and forth, out onto the balcony, then back
	into the room as Roy comes out of the bathroom wearing a
	towel.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          You were gone for a while.
<b>

	          I went out to Delmar.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

	          The track? Did you run into Lilly?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          I saw her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          She didn't see you, in other words.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          I'm not trying to make trouble,
	          Roy. It's just, she's always so
	          nasty to me, I thought, who is she
	          to be so high and mighty. I saw her
	          out there, and I called a friend of
	          mine in Baltimore, so now I know
	          who she is.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (dry)
	          You must have some very
	          knowledgeable friends.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          I'm well connected, Roy, Cole
	          introduced me to a lot of people.
	          Very valuable. Valuable for us.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Running your broker scam, you mean.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA
</b>	              (enthusiastic)
	          You and me, Roy. What a team we'll
	          make. We think alike; we get along
	          together.
	          Once or twice a year we take some
	          slob, the rest of the time we live
	          like this. You won't regret this,
	          Roy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Regret what? I didn't say I was
	          coming aboard.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          But why not? I thought it was
	          settled. What's holding you back?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Come on, Myra, don't talk business
	          here. This is time out.
<b>	
</b>	She considers him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          You mean, it would be too tough to
	          give me a turndown here. Easier on
	          home grounds.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (shrug)
	          Yes or no. They're both easier at
	          home. Okay?
<b>	
</b>	Myra makes a visible effort to be accommodating.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Whatever you say, darling.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. KAGGS' OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Kaggs sits at his computer terminal, bringing up data, not
	pleased by what he sees. Buzzer SOUNDS. He swivels to the
	desk, presses the intercom button.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          Yeah?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)

<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          Good! Send him in.
<b>	
</b>	With a now-we're-getting-somewhere manner, Kaggs turns back
	to the VDT, punches up a different set of data, sits looking
	at it in gloomy satisfaction. Roy enters, and Kaggs rises,
	extending his hand across the desk. They shake hands.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          Good to have you back, Roy. I was

</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	              (keen)
	          You're turning me down? Makes no
	          sense, Roy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          I guess I'm just not a leader of
	          men.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          Oh, come on, Roy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --

</b>	          Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I
	          like things the way they are now.
	          Pick my own hours, have time for,

<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          A well-rounded life. I respect
	          that. But it has to have a center,
	          Roy, something you care about,
	          something you can think about.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Maybe I'm just not ready for that

<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS

	          Well, Roy, if that's the way you
	          feel, I won't badger you.
	              (forced laugh)
	          Don't want to lose you as a
	          salesman, too.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

	          everything the way it was.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    KAGGS 
</b>	          That's what we'll do, then. But I
	          tell you what, Roy. Before I hire
	          anybody else, I'll ask you one last
	          time. Fair enough?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Fair enough.
<b>	
</b>	They shake hands.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy's room. He has one of the clown pictures face down on the
	coffee table. He takes money from his jacket pockets, crams
	it into the space, which is now just about full. As he's
	tightening the wing nuts closing the back, doorbell RINGS. He
	hurries, finishing the job, hanging the picture on the wall,
	then crossing to open the door. Myra enters, ebullient.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Darling, guess what? I had to tell
	          you right away.
<b>	
</b>	She gives him an enthusiastic kiss, then marches into the
	living room.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	              (grinning)
	          And hello to you, too.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          I called a fellow I know in Tulsa,
	          the one who plays my chauffeur.
	          There's a sucker there he says is
	          made for us. And a boroker that
	          just shut down, we can use their
	          office, not change a thing! Now, I
	          can scrape up ten grand without
	          much trouble. That leaves fifteen
	          or twenty for your end. We could
	          start this weekend, get the sucker
	          into position --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Wait a minute! When did this
	          happen, that we're partners?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	              (bewildered)
	          What?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          The last I looked, we were just
	          talking things over.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          But the setup's there. It's there
	          now.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          I don't think I need it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          You're too good for the small-time,
	          Roy. Move up to where there's big
	          dough to be made, and you don't
	          have to stick your neck out every
	          day.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Maybe I like it where I am.
<b>	
</b>	Myra's need breaks through her good sense.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Well, maybe I don't! I had ten good
	          years with Cole, and I want them
	          back! I gotta have a partner! I
	          looked and I looked and believe me,
	          brother, I kissed a lot of fucking
	          frogs, and you're my prince!
<b>	
</b>	Roy tries to treat this lightly.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Don't I get any say in this?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (pointing at her)
	          That's what I say.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

	          What?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          What I say is, no. We don't do

<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA (CONT'D)
</b>	              (raging)

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Mostly, because you scare the shit
	          out of me. I've seen people like
	          you before, baby. Double-tough and
	          sharp as they come, and you get
	          what you want or else. But you
	          don't make it work forever.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          Bullshit!
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

	          lightning hits. I don't want to be
	          around when it hits you.
<b>	
</b>	She stares at him, trying to find a chink in the armor,
	trying to find a reason, trying to find something.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

</b>	He frowns at her, not believing he understands her right.
<b>

	pursues her.
<b>

</b>	          How do you like this?
<b>	
</b>	He slaps her as hard with the other hand. Astonished,
	frightened, befuddled, she backpedals, bringing her forearms
	up to protect her face. He grabs her two wrists in one hand,
	holds them out of the way, slaps her forehand and backhand,
	forehand and backhand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA

	into the middle of the room. He's angry, but also remorseful,
	sorry he lost control but still enraged at the enormity of
	her suggestion.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          That's not like me. I don't do
	          violence.
<b>

	her raised arms. He settles down, becomes heavily calm.

</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          That's why we wouldn't work

</b>	          Goodbye, Myra.
<b>	
</b>	She lowers her arms slowly, as though her whole body aches.
	She's still scared, but angry now, too. She'd like to tell
	him off, but discretion tells her not to. She moves across
	the room toward the open door, but stops, not wanting to be
	that close to him.
	Understanding, he backs away from the doorway, gestures with
	cold irony for her to proceed. She moves to the threshold,
	looks back at him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    MYRA 
</b>	          And you don't even know it.

	          tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon,
	          this isn't an everyday occurrence

</b><b>	                    PIERSON

	          problem. It's just there's, uh,

<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY

	          Well, let's get the shock over
	          with.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MORGUE VIEWING ROOM - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	A bare bright room with tiled walls, a few plastic chairs, an
	ordinary office door on one side and wide hospital swinging
	doors on the other. Pierson and Roy stand watching.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Not many laughs in this room, eh?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    PIERSON 
</b>	          Not many.
<b>	
</b>	The swinging doors open and an ATTENDANT wheels in a gurney
	containing a body covered by a sheet. Roy braces himself. The
	attendant pulls the sheet away from the face.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    PIERSON (CONT'D)
</b>	              (to the attendant)
	          Remove that. We'll want a full, uh,
	          identification.
<b>	
</b>	The attendant removes the sheet. The body wears a nightgown.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Roy, swallowing bile, as he forces himself to
	move forward and look down at the face. He immediately looks
	away again.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Oh, Jesus.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    PIERSON 
</b>	          No question, huh?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          No, its -- Why did she--?
<b>	
</b>	He forces himself to look at the body again, his own face
	full of the unanswerable question. He looks her up and down,
	then his eyes stop. He focuses on something, a look of
	surprise coming into his eyes.
<b>	
</b>	Roy's POV: CU, the body's hands, crossed over the stomach,
	the wrists crossed, the palms down, the clear backs of both
	hands visible.
<b>	
</b>	CU, Roy. He knows. Sharpness comes back into his expression.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    PIERSON  (O.S.)
</b>	          That's that, then.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (starting to grin)
	          Oh, yeah. That's that.
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, Roy and Pierson. Pierson wants to leave, but Roy
	stands over the gurney. He chuckles. Pierson looks at him,
	surprised and appalled. Roy ignores him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY (CONT'D)
</b>	              (laughing quietly)
	          Mom.
<b>	
</b><b>	QUICK CUT.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY
</b><b>	
</b>	MONTAGE. Myra's baby blue Cadillac drives, at extreme high
	speed, alone on the highway.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra's Cadillac drives slowly past, comes to a stop at the
	curb half a block away.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE through the windshield at the driver, a woman,
	deeply weary. Her forearms are crossed on top of the steering
	wheel, her brow resting on the forearms. The burn on the back
	of her right hand is visible in illumination from a nearby
	streetlight. Traffic goes by. BEAT. Lilly lifts her head,
	looking out at the night. She's very tired, but determined.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE beside Lilly, inside the car. From the seat beside
	her she picks up Myra's large dangly earrings and fixes them
	in place. Then she puts on Myra's big-lensed dark sunglasses.
	(She's wearing the clothes Myra wore when checking into the
	motel.) Lilly checks her appearance in the rearview mirror,
	then gets out of the car.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. MADERO LOBBY - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Simms at the desk, talking to a TELEPHONE
	REPAIRMAN steadily at work fixing the switchboard.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	          The last modern thing I liked was
	          the miniskirt. Your technology,
	          now, nobody understands it, and
	          that's the simple fact of the
	          situation.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly enters in b.g., crosses to the elevator, presses the
	button. Simms waves to her.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	              (calling) )
	          Evening, Mizz Langley!
<b>	
</b>	The elevator door opens, Lilly boards and presses the button.
	The elevator door closes.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    SIMMS
</b>	          New things come in here all the
	          time, how do they work? You can ask
	          your Ph.Ds, your highly educated,
	          intelligent, professional people,
	          you can say to them, how does that
	          work, and you know what they'll
	          tell you? You plug it in. And
	          that's the way the donut dunks.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. MADERO APARTMENTS BALCONY - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	The balcony leading to Roy's apartment. It's illuminated by a
	light next to the public door from the interior hall.
	AN ANGLE on that door as Lilly cautiously opens it, looks out
	and around while remaining mostly behind the door, then
	focuses on the light. She reaches out and unscrews the bulb.
<b>	GO TO BLACK.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Roy's place. Dark. SOUNDS of lock being picked. The door
	opens, showing only blackness outside, Lilly enters and shuts
	the door, then switches on the main light.
<b>	
</b>	Ah ANGLE on Lilly, in the middle of the room, distractedly
	biting her thumbnail as she looks around, calculating. She
	looks directly at something.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly's POV: One of the box-framed pictures hanging on the
	wall.
<b>	
</b>	PREVIOUS SHOT. Lilly, making up her mind, crosses to the
	picture and takes it off the wall. She finds it surprisingly
	heavy. She carries it to the coffee table, puts it down there
	on its back, sits on the sofa.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Lilly studying the picture. She raps her knuckle
	against the sides, looks to see if the front or sides open
	someway, and finally turns the picture over, laying it face
	down on the coffee table. She sees how to remove the back,
	lifts it off, and looks at the stacks of money lying in
	there.
<b>	
</b>	CU, Lilly, almost fainting with relief.
<b>	
</b>	WIDE SHOT. Lilly looks at the other picture, looks again at
	the money, comes to a conclusion. She rises and leaves the
	room, deeper into the apartment.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Lilly switches on the light as she enters the room. She looks
	around, crosses to the closet, goes through the stuff in
	there, finds an old attache case on the shelf. She brings it
	out, puts it on the bed, opens it. Inside are a few decks of
	cards and a paperback book. She tosses them onto the bed,
	checks the case, finds that one of the clasps works but the
	other doesn't. One is good enough. She carries the attache
	case out of the room, leaving the light on.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Lilly enters, puts the case on the coffee table beside the
	picture, scoops the money out of the picture and puts it in
	the case. Then she unceremoniously dumps the picture on the
	floor.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly takes the second picture from the wall, puts it face
	down on the coffee table, opens the back, transfers the money
	to the case. She closes the case, attaches the one clasp that
	works, picks up the case.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY (O.S.)
</b>	          Hello, Lilly.
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, as Lilly whirls around, terrified and then
	relieved. Roy stands in the open apartment doorway, blackness
	behind him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Oh! Roy! You scared me.
<b>	
</b>	Roy enters the room and shuts the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Going somewhere?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Somewhere else, that's for sure.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          I just came back from Phoenix.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	              (anxious)
	          Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down.
	          Take a minute, tell me about it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          I've really got to --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          Not for long. Not when they do a
	          fingerprint check.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Why should they? The cops are
	          satisfied.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          Bobo won't be. He'll spend the
	          money to make sure.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Even so. You still got time. Relax
	          a minute, tell me what happened.
	          Sit down.
<b>	
</b>	He gestures at the sofa. Lilly's holding the attache case.
	The gutted pictures are lying around, one on the coffee table
	and one on the floor. She looks around at everything, awkward
	and embarrassed. But Roy hasn't said anything. And he's
	between her and the door.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Just for a minute.
<b>	
</b>	She backs up, sits on the sofa, puts the case on her lap. Roy
	pulls a chair over so it's directly between Lilly and the
	door. He sits, looking at her with polite interest.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Myra followed you, huh?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          She must have been the one that
	          blew me off with Bobo. I guess to
	          get me running. Did you tell her
	          about my stash?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (isn't worth discussing)
	          No.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          No, you wouldn't. That's what she
	          was after, though. But why hit on
	          me?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          I wouldn't go in on a deal with
	          her. She blamed you for it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (a shaky laugh)
	          As though you do what I say.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (cold grin)
	          That's pretty funny, all right.
	          What happened in Phoenix?
<b>	
</b>	Remembered emotion makes Lilly talk in little fast clusters
	of words.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Roy, it was terrible. You read
	          about people killing people and all
	          that, but when it happens, my God.
<b>	
</b><b>	EXT. ARIZONA MOTEL - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Myra, in nightgown, carrying the ice bucket, approaches Room
<b>	131.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          She was in her nightgown, you know,
	          the old grifter's dodge, nightgown
	          and the Ice bucket and she just got
	          into the wrong room by mistake.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. ROOM 131 - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	CU, Lilly asleep. Very dim light. The shadows shift on her
	face as Myra OUT OF FRAME approaches. Myra's hands ENTER
	FRAME, abruptly clamp on Lilly's throat. Lilly's eyes pop
	open wide, staring, her mouth stretches open. Myra's arms are
	locked straight, pressing her weight down onto her hands
	squeezing Lilly's throat. Lilly clutches at Myra's fingers,
	tries to reach Myra's face, twists and squirms, then suddenly
	lifts her arm up and behind her head, hand dipping under the
	pillow, coming out with the silenced gun, pushing the gun
	upward, straight-arm, the gun moving up OUT OF FRAME. SOUND
	of shot. Blood sprays Lilly's face. Myra's body drops down
	onto her, at an angle, so we can still see Lilly's horrified
	face over Myra's shoulder as Lilly gasps for breath.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Lilly stares across the room, breathing hard, reliving the
	experience.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          I sat in there with her, I thought,
	          what do I do now? Run and I've got
	          Bobo and the law after me. Stay,
	          and how do I explain?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          This way's perfect.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly sits back, showing that relief again.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a
	          break for me after all.
	          I've been wanting out of the racket
	          for years, and now I'm out. I can
	          make a clean start, and --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          You've already made a start.
	          Doesn't look that clean, though.
<b>	
</b>	Here's the awkwardness. Lilly looks guilty and embarrassed.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          I'm sorry. I hated to take your
	          money, but --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Don't be sorry. You're not taking
	          it.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly reacts as though he's slapped her. But then she gets
	her determination back. She splays out both hands, palm down,
	on the attache case on her lap.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          I need this, Roy. I can't run

	          I'm dead.
<b>

	where she was sitting. Roy, with a faint smile, watches her
	leave the room.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Very small, little used. Dark. Lilly switches on the light
	when she enters, then leans against the counter, fists
	clenched and trembling on the counter in front of her. She
	grits her teeth, hyperventilates, stares around the room in
	search of escape, an answer, something.
<b>	
</b>	CU, Lilly's face, desperate, grim, but not giving up.
<b>	
</b>	WIDE SHOT. Lilly opens cabinets, finds two glasses, opens the
	nearly-empty refrigerator, gets ice cubes from a tray, puts
	them in the glasses, puts the partial tray back in the
	freezer compartment, fills the glasses from the cold water
	tap, puts the glasses on the counter, stares at them briefly.
	She then shakes her head, searches the kitchen some more, and
	finds a cookie sheet she can use as a tray. She puts the
	glasses on the tray, carries the tray from the room, leaving
	the light on.
<b>	
</b><b>	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</b><b>	
</b>	Lilly enters with the tray, crosses to Roy, presents the
	glasses, speaks as he reaches for one.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          Take whichever one you want.
<b>	
</b>	He hesitates. It hadn't occurred to him Lilly might try to
	poison him or knock him out. He grins at her and takes a
	glass.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          You wouldn't do that.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly takes the other glass, puts the cookie sheet on a
	table, looks down at Roy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          You don't know what I'd do, Roy.
	          You have no idea. To live.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (easy)
	          Oh, you'll live, Lilly.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly crosses back to the sofa, sits beside the attache case,
	pats it absently as though it is a pet and she's glad it
	didn't move, waited for her. She sips water, puts the glass
	on the end table.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          I know what's bugging you, of
	          course.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Oh? I didn't know anything was.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (twisted grin)
	          Oh, really? You've got a legitimate
	          complaint, Roy, I don't deny that.
	          I wasn't a very good mother when
	          you were a kid.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (full laugh)
	          Not very good!
<b>	
</b>	She nods, accepting the correction.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          A bad mother. By any standards.
	          I've thought about it, you know,
	          from your side, since then. I know
	          just how bad I was.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (closed against her)
	          Uh-huh.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          I wonder did you ever think about
	          it from my side.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (not worth discussing)
	          Never.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          No, I guess not. It was pretty
	          lousy of me, I guess, to be a child
	          at the same time you were. Not to
	          stop being a child just because I
	          had a child. I guess I was a real
	          stinker not to be a grown-up when
	          you needed a grown-up.
<b>	
</b>	Roy didn't expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive, and
	he resents it.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          What do you want me to do? Pin a
	          halo on you? You're doing a pretty
	          good job of that yourself.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          And making you feel bad at the same
	          time, huh? But that's the way I am,
	          you know, the way I've always been.
	          Always picking on poor little Roy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          For God's sake, Lilly!
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (intense)
	          I gave you your life twice. I'm
	          asking you to give me mine once. I
	          need the money.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (not worth discussing)
	          No.
<b>	
</b>	Lilly subsides back onto the sofa. One hand rests on the
	attache case. With the other, she sips water, puts the glass
	back down. Roy watches her, unmoving, expressionless. Lilly
	frowns, not quite looking at him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          You're getting off the grift?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          That's right.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          That's good. You don't really
	          belong on this side of the fence,
	          you know.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	              (amused)
	          I don't?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          If you stayed a crook, do you think
	          you'd live to be my ripe age?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          I don't see why not.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Well, I guess I got it wrong, then.
	          Seems to me I heard about a guy
	          just your age that got hit so hard
	          in the guts it almost killed him.
<b>	
</b>	Roy's again unexpectedly uncomfortable. He shifts uneasily in
	his chair, trying to think of a response.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Well, uh...
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Sure, sure, that doesn't count.
	          That's different.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	          Well, it doesn't matter, does it?
	          I'm getting out.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (intense)
	          And that's why you've got to get
	          rid of this money. If you keep it
	          around, it'll just make you think
	          how clever you are.
	          It'll be a temptation to get back
	          into the game.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (full laugh)
	          Oh, that's it! You're stealing my
	          money for my own good! How very
	          motherly of you, Lilly.
<b>	
</b>	Once again, Lilly drops back against the sofa back. Another
	round in the fight is over. Roy watches her, patient, waiting
	for her to give up, seeing no other outcome.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Lilly, frustrated, feeling the need to move, the
	pressure of pursuit. Her head turns back and forth, her body
	starts false gestures. Finally, abruptly, she gets to her
	feet, looks at Roy, looks away, picks up the attache case.
<b>	
</b>	CU, Roy, alert. He won't let her reach the door.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE PANNING with Lilly as she prowls the room, pacing
	back and forth, the attache case swinging at her side.
	Finally, she stops, standing the attache case on the coffee
	table, her hand still on its handle.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Lilly.
<b>	
</b>	She looks at him, attentive without hope.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          If I should get out of the racket,
	          that goes double for you. That's
	          why you've got to change your life
	          completely, go to some town, get a
	          square job, live like a john
	          yourself. If you try to do it your
	          way, what future is in it?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          A future. The only future I've got.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          That money wouldn't last forever.
	          And then what? You'd be back in
	          some other part of the rackets.
	          Another Bobo Justus to slap you
	          around and burn holes in your
	          hands. This way, you've got to go
	          the square route. You could send me
	          a card when you're settled, I could
	          maybe help out sometimes...
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (bitter laugh) )
	          That's what it is, isn't it? Keep
	          me down. Your turn to be in charge,
	          have the power.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (stonewalling)
	          Just trying to help, Lilly.
<b>	
</b>	She sits on the sofa again, this time leaving the attache
	case to stand on the coffee table. She studies Roy,
	calculating.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          Roy... What if I told you I wasn't
	          really your mother? That we weren't
	          related?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (bewildered)
	          What?
<b>	
</b>	Lilly leans back again, but this time her manner is
	different; languorous, sexy. She crosses her legs, the upper
	leg swinging gently. She smiles gently, encouragingly, at
	Roy.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          You'd like that, wouldn't you? Sure
	          you would. You don't need to tell
	          me. Now, why would you like it,
	          Roy?
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Roy, understanding and not wanting to understand.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY
</b>	              (hoarse)
	          What's that all about? Of course
	          you're my mother. Of course you
	          are.
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT. Lilly leans forward toward Roy, inviting him.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (very soft)
	          Roy... Roy
<b>	
</b>	Roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          There's nothing more to talk about.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	              (very soft)
	          I have to have that money, Roy.
	          What do I have to do to get it?
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Roy, his face bruised-looking, eyes scared. He
	will not know what's going on. He shakes his head, not
	trusting himself to speak.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE on Lilly, leaning forward, tension showing through
	the seductive manner.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY 
</b>	          No? Won't you give me the money,
	          Roy? Can't I change your mind? What
	          can I do to change your mind?
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, as Lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward
	him. Roy's pressed back into his chair, trying to maintain a
	cold facade.
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b>	          Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
<b>	
</b><b>	                    LILLY
</b>	          Is there nothing I can do, Roy,
	          nothing at --
<b>	
</b><b>	                    ROY 
</b><b>	          NO!
</b><b>	
</b>	They both turn away at the same instant. Roy turns to the
	side to pick up the glass of water, to break the spell and
	the tension. Lilly turns back toward the coffee table and
	picks up the attache case. Roy, lifting the glass to drink,
	turns forward again as Lilly spins forward, swinging the
	attache case at his head with all her might. The case crashes
	into the glass and into his face. Roy SCREAMS and topples off
	the chair, as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and
	money goes flying, filling the air.
<b>	
</b>	AN ANGLE DOWN at Roy, face up, expression horrified, hands to
	his throat. A large triangle of glass is in his throat. Blood
	pumps thickly, fountaining up.
<b>	
</b>	CU, Lilly, staring down in horror. She lurches forward, but
	there's nothing to do. She stares around.
<b>	
</b>	ECU, wads of bills on the floor, getting bloody.
<b>	
</b>	CU, Lilly, in agony, but looking down, kicking.
<b>	
</b>	ECU, Lilly's feet kicking the bills away from the blood. 
<b>	
</b>	TWO SHOT, as Lilly drops to her knees beside Roy, who's
	already dying. Blood spurts less forcefully. His hands fall
	to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slightly.
	Lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at him,
	willing it not to happen. He stops moving. His eyes dull.
	Lilly clasps her arms around herself. She knows she doesn't
	dare scream. Lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she
	HISSES her agony through her teeth. She HISSES; she HISSES;
	she HISSES. Then, slowly, she regains control.
<b>	
</b>	WIDE SHOT as Lilly gets to her feet. She seems dazed now,
	like someone who's just been in a traffic accident. She
	blunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to
	pick it up. She studies the clasp, sees it still works, goes
	back to her knees.
<b>	
</b>	LOW ANGLE, Lilly in f.g., Roy in b.g., as Lilly repacks the
	money into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto the
	carpet. Finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her
	knees, bending over the case. She WEEPS grindingly.
<b>	
</b>	WIDE SHOT, entrance door in b.g. Lilly's weeping subsides.
	She gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. CAMERA
	HOLDS. SOUND of water running in sink. SOUND STOPS. Lilly
	reappears. She does not again look toward Roy. She picks up
	the attache case, crosses to the door, opens it, steps across
	the threshold, reaches back to switch off the light. GO TO
<b>	BLACK.
</b><b>	
</b><b>	                          THE END
