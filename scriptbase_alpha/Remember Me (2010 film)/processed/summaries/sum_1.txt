Tyler Hawkins, a rebellious, artistic New York student, was estranged from his father, ever-absent tycoon Charles Hawkins, since the suicide of his beloved elder brother Mark, and desperately wants paternal attention for his kid sister, nerdy Caroline, who doesn't fit in her school for the artistically gifted.
Ever-provocative Tyler and his college roommate, party animal Aidan Hall, are roughed up at a street fight and wrongly jailed by beastly NYPD detective sergeant Neil Craig.
When Aidan discovers Craig's daughter Alyssa 'ally' is a fellow student, he dares smooth Tyler to ask her out, but the two become lovers, also bonding over her own home rebellion.
Yet just when things seem to work out, fate strikes, in the end crushingly.
