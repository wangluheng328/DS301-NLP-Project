Shelly Kaplow, the ruthless manager of the Las Vegas mob's 'old-style' (violent) casino Shangri-La, engages spineless born loser Bernie Lootz as 'cooler', who is supposed to bring winners his bad luck.
Bernie's luck turns in the love department when he meets waitress Natalie Belisario, but ingrate son Mikey and his traitorous fianc√©e put him in an even nastier pickle.
Meanwhile conservative thug Shelly can't agree the mob's college-trained watchdog and his boss's big plans.
