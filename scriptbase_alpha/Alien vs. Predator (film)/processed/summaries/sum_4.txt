Thousands of years ago, huntsmen (the predators) found planet earth.
While there, they trained humans to build and were reverenced as Gods.
Every century, these "Gods" would go back to Earth, and when they did, they expected a sacrifice.
Humans were used as livestock to breed the vital prey (the aliens).
The predators would now combat the prey to establish themselves creditable or to "carry the mark" of becoming adults.
If the huntsmen (the predators) find themselves losing the battle, they would then self destruct in order to make sure that nothing survives.
Billionaire Weyland thinks that he has exposed the remains of an early pyramid temple, that is a cross between the Egyptian and Aztec pyramids.
It was hidden under the ice of Bouvet√∏ya Island in the Antarctic Ocean.
Now, what industrialist Charles Weyland and his comprised team of engineers and scientists didn't know was that the predators have set a trap for them.
They have lured them to this remote location using a heat beam picked up by Weyland's satellite.
This was done to make sure that the aliens had hosts to breed in.
As the humans battle both predators and aliens, predators and aliens also have a battle of the species which will leave only one race standing.
