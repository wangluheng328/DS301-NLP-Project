                                                  April 6, 1981
<b>         BLACKNESS
</b>
<b>    1    THE ELECTRONIC WORLD                                         1
</b>
         On one side of the screen, computer programming language is being
         printed, and we HEAR the sound of an electronic keyboard. In the
         center of the screen, glowing lines inscribe a rough computer
         simulation of a figure, in response to the programming. Gradually
         the figure is completed and refined, as we HEAR a resonant voice
         speaking.

<b>                               VOICE
</b>                    As astonishing advances in computer
                    science are made, artificial intelligence
                    programs are being designed to assist
                    us in every area of life...

         We see that the completed form is man-like, heroic and muscular,
         wearing a form of flexible armor. The face is calm, handsome and
         intelligent. As the voice continues, the form becomes rounded by
         the computer until it appears three dimensional and begins to rotate.

<b>                               VOICE (CONT.)
</b>                    In a world-wide network of electronics,
                    they travel through miles of circuitry
                    at the speed of light. We created them to
                    calculate and research, to help us design
                    and heal and think. With all that they can
                    do, are they only electrical impulses...
                    or are they a new form of life?

         The figure is rotated completely around, and as it comes back to face
         us, a glowing disk appears beside it; again in response to the
         programming printed out at the side of the screen. The disk moves
         towards the man-like figure and is rotated into position above it.
         As the voice reaches the final word, the disk is slammed into place
         on the back of the figure. There is an explosion of colored light,
         a resounding crash of MUSIC and the title appears across the top of
         the screen in huge letters.

<b>                                    T R O N ! !
</b>
         The MUSIC CONTINUES as the glow fades and we SEE that the figure has
         become real, a living being, although filled with glowing light, as
         if it had an inner core of electricity.

         The following is a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS in MONTAGE STYLE as the
         OPENING TITLES ROLL. The montage takes place in two worlds, the
         ELECTRONIC WORLD and the REAL WORLD.


         The Electronic World is a mirror of our own, consisting of the
         electronic information in our computers, television sets and
         telecommunications network. It is peopled by computer programs,
         data, and the characters from countless video games. For the first
         time, we are seeing their world as it really is, rather than through
         the window of television screens.


<b>                                                   CUT TO:
</b>

<b>    2    CYCLE GAME                                                   2
</b>
         TWO OTHER ELECTRONIC FIGURES standing on a glowing grid against a
         dark background. Each holds a bar between his fists, and as a BUZZER
         SOUNDS, a glowing light cycle is inscribed around them, completely
         encasing them.


<b>                                                   CUT TO:
</b>

<b>    3    LONG SHOT                                                    3
</b>

         as the cycles take off. We see that each leaves a solidifying laser
         trail behind it. One turns abruptly, creating a wall in front of the
         other.


<b>                                                   CUT TO:
</b>

<b>    4    REAL WORLD                                                   4
</b>

         Screen of a video game, the Real World version of light cycles,
         as we see one of the lines smash into another and disappear.


<b>    5    THE REAL WORLD                                               5
</b>

         We see teenagers, strangely lit from below with bluish light,
         their hands on electronic controls, levers, knobs. We HEAR
         electronic beeping and popping.


<b>    6    ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             6
</b>

         Futuristic tanks bearing down on one another in a flat grid-like
         landscape. One FIRES, and the other disappears when it is hit, to
         reappear, spinning wildly, in the distance. We HEAR a sound
         like a crack of lightning.


<b>    7    REAL WORLD                                                   7
</b>

         A video game in an arcade. On the screen is a typical version of
         Tank Wars with computer generated representations of tanks in a 2-D
         maze.


<b>    8/9  OMITTED                                                      8/9
</b>

<b>    10   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             10
</b>
         Two other game warriors on the grid, this time throwing
         glowing disks at one another like frisbees. We see the
         one colored blue throw; his disk smashes into the second
         warrior, and he dissolves into thousands of glowing lines.


<b>    11   REAL WORLD                                                   11
</b>

         A video game called "BERSERK," in which a human character'
         throws a glowing dot at monsters in a maze; we see a quick
         glimpse of the screen, then cut to a group of people staring
         down, LAUGHING.

<b>    12   OMITTED                                                      12

<b>    13   ELECTRONIC WORLD                                             13
</b>

         Another game in progress, from a LONG SHOT. A version of
         Jai Alai, in which the two players stand suspended in space
         on glowing colored rings, and throw a pellet of solid energy
         at each other.

<b>    14   ANGLE ON ONE OF THE WARRIORS                                 14
</b>

         He is huge, evil looking. His body is enormous, his head
         mechanical. This is SARK. He glows ominously blue. He is catching
         the pellet thrown from his opponent who is much smaller, glowing
         yellow.


<b>    15   CLOSE UP - FACE OF THE OPPONENT                              15
</b>
         fearful, nervous, poised on one ring.

<b>    16   SARK                                                         16
</b>
         sneering, as he uses his electronic cesta to hurl the pellet
         back with violent force.

<b>    16A  THE SMALLER WARRIOR                                          16A
</b>

         desperately trying to catch the pellet, but it smashes
         into the ring, which explodes into a million pieces. One
         last glimpse of the yellow warrior's tortured, desperate
         face as he falls to instant death.

<b>    17   SARK                                                         17
</b>

         triumphant, LAUGHING. High above him, etched in enormous
         glowing computer printed 3-D block letters, are the words:

<b>                        "WINNER:  BLUE - SARK!!"
</b>

         We see two TEENAGERS playing a table model video game, where we
         can see the words: "Winner - Blue" printed. The game console is
         prominently marked with the letter logo of the manufacturer: "ICOM."

         Sark is striding through a wide corridor where other tough
         looking blue warriors are lounging around, leaning against the
         walls, sitting on the floor against the wall. They look up as
         Sark comes in and one of them calls out:

         removing his cesta and tossing it aside carelessly. A BUZZER is
         sounding. Sark plugs himself into the feet sockets with a SIGH of
         satisfaction.

         The buzzer stops and we see the holographic image of a
         cylinder forming around Sark, at first translucent and then
         solidifying so that we can't see through it, and Sark is
         hidden from view.

                    Brutal and needlessly sadistic.


         The feet sockets glow and we see Sark absorbing the energy like
         a drug addict, eyes glazed.

         A lone program sits at the controls. His armor is worn and beaten
         and his glow subdued. This is CLU. With his thermos of glowing
         coffee and his suicide-jockey manner, he reminds us of a truck

         A spot of glowing light zips around the tank, stops and expands
         into a solid glowing green sphere with the suggestion of a face as

</b><b>         HELICOPTER
</b>
         We seem at first to be in the Electronic World still, flying over a
         vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. While this is our
         impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding
         scene, we HEAR the SOUND O.S. of a PHONE RINGING, as heard by the
         party placing the call. Then the click of the receiver being picked
         up, and a male VOICE (DILLINGER'S) answering:

<b>                               DILLINGER (O.S.)

                    Master Control Program


         As we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer
         focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather
         an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. We are
         approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish
         accurately. As we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually
         increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the
         sound of a HELICOPTER, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the
         landscape. We just become aware of this fact when the sound of a
         CONVERSATION begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and
         a passenger.

                    got some things to take care of.


         THE CAMERA PULLS AROUND for a VIEW OF THE HELICOPTER from behind and
         off to the side. It is a beautiful, gleaming jet black machine.
         In spotless reflective silver paint the letters ICOM are written
         across one entire side. It is obviously state-of-the-art technology.

         approaches the ICOM building, an enormous tower.

         helicopter touches down, they rush out to secure it.

         A huge wall-sized plate glass window shows a view of the grid-like
         suburban landscape. Dillinger stands behind a table. We see that the
         entire surface of the table is a gigantic computer terminal. His
         fingers punch out a code on the touch-sensitive keyboard and we see
         printed out on the screen:


         REQUEST: access to Master Control Program, User code 00 - Dillinger.
         Password: MASTER.


         The computer's screen clears, and the Master Control Program
         addresses Dillinger, simultaneously speaking in a human-sound voice
         through a pair of studio-quality stereo SPEAKERS and printing out
         its words on the computer screen, The MCP's VOICE is the same as
         that of the "bad cop" who grilled Clu, but its tone is now that of a
         compassionate psychiatrist working with a favored patient.

         a small Tonka toy Shogun warrior, and to one side is an ancient

         Alan walks down a short corridor to a heavy glass WINDOW through
         which the laser laboratory is visible. A sign over the window,
         marked "Experiment in Progress," is illuminated by a red warning

         of two white-suited figures visible through a network of two white-
         suited figures visible through a network of white scaffolding that
         encloses the giant laser structure. They are standing on a cherry-
         picker crane at the second story level of the laser, with a box of
         tools at their feet. We TRUCK DOWN THE SIDE of the laser, along the
         tubes which house the amplifying lenses, and MOVE UP, gradually
         getting close enough to hear what they are saying, and get a look
         at them.


         We see that the figures are a young, dark-haired, beautiful woman,
         with her hair tied back under a hard hat, and an older man, who is
         using a tool on a section of the laser, and is also wearing a hard
         hat. The woman is LORA and the man is DR. WALTER GIBBS. He's
         wearing a copper bracelet above his digital watch/calculator, and
         has an intense, almost insane look to his dark eyes, with their
         bristling white eyebrows.


         In contrast, Lora seems more serious and conservative, but she
         defers to Gibbs as a senior, and more accomplished, scientist.
         Both have protective eye goggles -- worn loosely around their necks
         at the moment.

         As the CRANE LOWERS THEM to the floor:

<b>                               GIBBS
</b>                    Hah. Interesting, interesting. You

                    well have said, "Here goes something
                    and here comes nothing." Hah?


         They step off the crane and walk to a short, lead-shielded
         cylindrical PLATFORM, on which rests a solid SPHERE of clear plastic
         polymer, about 3 inches in diameter. The "firing" end of the giant
         laser is aimed straight at the sphere. Five feet away is an identical
         plat-form -- empty.

         She crosses to a COMPUTER CONSOLE nearby. The console is
         connected to the laser by a few dozen wires and cables.


         Pulling her goggles into place over her eyes, she sits at the
         console. Gibbs, adjusting his goggles, takes a position near
         the platform bearing the sphere -- safe from the laser, but
         close enough to watch.

         The laser shoots a bolt of blindingly bright LIGHT at the polymer
         sphere. For a moment, the sphere has the look of a wavering, poorly
         received television picture -- wobbling lines of dots -- and then
         it disappears entirely. As Gibbs watches, a Lora works feverishly,
         the laser pivots to point at the platform a few feet away. A second
         discharge of LIGHT hits the surface of this platform, and -- like a
         film-in-reverse of the ball's disappearance -- it is reconstructed,
         five feet from its original position. When the beam shuts off, Lora
         rushes to join Gibbs in examining the born-again ball of plastic.

                    Perfect.


         At the SOUND O.S. of an appreciative pair of hands clapping, Lora
         and a Gibbs turn to SEE Alan, in hard hat, goggles, and paper
         shoe-covers, walking toward them.

                    While the laser is dismantling the
                    molecular structure of the object,
                    the computer maps out a holographic
                    model of it. The molecules themselves
                    are suspended in the laser beam. Then
                    the computer reads the model back out,
                    the molecules go back into place, and...

         A dark, panelled room, with a few comfortable chairs, a business
         desk with a typewriter and terminal (where we saw Flynn working in
         scenes 29, 33, etc.), and a couple of video games -- Flynn's
         favorites. As Flynn, Lora, and Alan enter, they find the arcade
         noise considerably muffled. Flynn settles into a chair; Alan leans
         against a game, nervous; Lora paces.

                    One night, our boy Flynn goes to his

                    slime didn't even change the names --

         in space, covered with a glowing circuit pattern, then a shot of
         millions of cancelled checks being counted electronically; then 3-D
         computer representations of vessels (aircraft carrier and Solar
         Sailer). On another screen, we see statements of ICOM's wealth

         approaching the camera, stuffing the last donut from his bag into
         his mouth. He takes the empty bag, raises it up, mugging to the
         camera, and pushes the bag over the lens. The SCREEN GOES BLACK,

         We see that one entire wall of the lab is a door and it is rising
         silently, so that Flynn doesn't notice.


         We can see as the door rises more of the laser equipment, and it
         is this section that is being activated.

         Suddenly, before Flynn can go on, the gigantic laser mechanism
         behind him sends a brilliant beam of LIGHT directly at him. He
         freezes. We see his body beginning to break into scan lines, like
         a video image -- the same thing that happened to Gibbs' polymer
         ball. We can see the terminal also glowing in the intense light,
         being scanned by the laser. The colors change, become monochromatic -
         with Flynn's body glowing orange - and the image of his figure
         blurs and becomes indistinct. ZOOM IN on Flynn and

    129  THE CAMERA RUSHING over a circuit pattern, like the one      129
         we saw at the opening of the film'.


         The pattern changes, dissolving into another image and we are
         rushing forward at great speed. We see the circuits rushing by and
         getting larger and then the picture dissolves into darkness with a
         glowing, spinning globe beneath us, like the globe from AIC's logo,
         covered with circuits. We are rushing at it, circling it, diving
         closer and closer, so that the detail on the globe becomes clearer
         with every second and we realize that the circuits are structures,
         angular towers and buildings, huge mechanical looking mountains and
         deserts covered with a glowing grid pattern. Everything glows with
         an internal energy.


         We continue diving, down, down, faster and faster and we see the
         structures of one city-like area across electronic mesas and cliffs,
         and then we're right over this area and diving straight down,
         everything blurring with the speed.

         staggering from the force of the fall, but upright.

         hands spread out flat on the table in front of him. A BUZZING NOISE
         fills the chamber and a holographic image begins to form, shimmering
         into awful shape. We see the stretched out face dissolving into the

         But as his hand reaches the dividing point between the two cells,
         it hits an invisible barrier, and we see a brilliant energy field
         come instantaneously into existence, stopping his hand, and then
         disappearing. Flynn pulls back in shock.

         We see they are entering an open part of the Game Grid, with two
         bridges of energy extending across open space to two separate
         circular platforms, made up of concentric glowing rings. Crom
         marches across-one of these, and Flynn follows suit on the other.
         When they each reach the circular platforms, the bridges disappear.
         We see Flynn turn and stare back across the empty space, then turn
         and face his opponent. Above them a third floating disk hovers. He
         looks over at Crom, who's anxious.

         A buzzer sounds. The game begins. Crom hurls a glowing pellet
         upwards. It strikes the upper platform, ricochets off, and heads
         straight for Flynn.


         Flynn lunges, but misses. The pellet strikes one of the rings of
         his platform, and that ring dissolves. Flynn's lunge takes him
         right to the edge of the open space created, and he just catches
         himself in time to keep from falling over the edge.

         reacting, judging where this one will fall, racing to the farther

         The ring he is holding on to dissolves, and with a SCREAM, he
         falls... and falls ... and falls...

         on the bridge. His finger wavers over another button, almost

         Flynn stares at him; then, in one smooth motion, reaches to his back
         and pulls out his disk.

         The three Blue Warriors are lined up facing our friends, on opposite
         sides of the large arena, about a half mile square, surrounded by
         high bulwarks, and surveyed by Recognizers. We can see the carrier
         hovering high overhead.

         watch the outer four cycles veer off to either side, leaving Tron
         and his opponent speeding suicidally at each other:

         We see these two cycles come together and almost crash ... but both
         turn at the last second to the same side and continue rushing
         forward. The other cycles can be seen racing around the edge of the
         arena.

         They rush past a wall, headed directly for a bulwark at the end of
         the arena. Tron is on one side, but the Blue Warrior is on the
         inside. Tron forces the warrior to smash straight into the wall.
         There is an explosion as the cycle de-rezzes, and a crack forms in
         the bulwark. We see that the walls created by the de-rezzed warrior
         dissolve as he does.

         around a corner onto a wider ledge with several dark openings in the

         We see the three cycles descend a long sloping ramp into the
         darkness, down, down into the dry rot section. The cycles come to a

         Ram, Tron and Flynn are climbing up to an opening in the wall of the

         With that, there's an EXPLOSION from outside the cave. Each of the

         into shape and race up the ramp, and on out.

         The cycles race out of the cave entrance and head down, away from
         the approaching tanks, through the electronic canyons, shells
         EXPLODING around them. We see the tanks close behind.

         They just make it around the corner when an EXPLOSION boasts the
         entrance to the arroyo, entering what appears to be a maze of very
         narrow canyons with short walls. They turn another corner and come
         to the edge of a gaping ravine.


         Several hundred feet to their left a narrow bridge connects their
         ledge with another canyon wall, and a wider ledge, which leads down
         to the floor of the entire area, and on to freedom.

         The tanks are following through the maze, smooth gray automatons,

         three race for the bridge, but behind them, we see the first tank
         turning the corner.

         the other side and Ram has just started to cross, there's a
         tremendous EXPLOSION of electronic FLAK, blasting Ram and tossing
         him back on top of Flynn. Both cycles de-rez. The bridge disappears,
         and a mass of rubble falls, partially Obscuring Ram and Flynn. Tron
         SCREECHES to a halt and swings his bike back around.


         He looks around -- Ram and Flynn are nowhere in sight. in the ravine
         below, he SEES a pile of motionless rubble.


         The tank fires again, narrowly missing Tron, and he REVS up again,
         speeds off down the ramp, and is gone.

         Ram weakly nods, but doesn't look very convincing. Flynn bites his
         lip and struggles on. They are down on the floor of the desert,
         leaving the towering canyons behind. A large, dim shape can be made
         out. Flynn peers at it hopefully and struggles towards it.

         Through the head of the Reco, we can look out at the landscape below.


         Flynn sits stunned for a moment, then stumbles over to Ram, who's
         going fast.


<b>                               FLYNN

         Ram nods weakly.

</b>                    Hang on. We'll get you outta here.


         Flynn touches panels, trying to get the Recognizer going, but with
         no result.

</b>                    Come here.


         Flynn goes over to him and kneels. Ram grabs his hands. Suddenly
         Ram's fading glow begins to flow through their clasped hands into
         Flynn. Horrified, Flynn tries to pull away, but Ram holds him fast.


<b>                               FLYNN

         Ram's last bit of energy flows into Flynn and Ram's body de-rezzes.
         Flynn watches in horror, frantically trying to reverse the flow,
         but it's too late. Ram disappears before his eyes. Stunned, he
         gazes at the empty space for a moment, then stands up.

         Tron arrives at the city, gazing around an empty, surreal, burnt-out
         landscape. Buildings seem two dimensional, barely there, at a low
         rate of power, so drained by the MCP. The cycle de-rezzes. There's a
         NOISE from above, and Tron looks up.

         A Recognizer floats over the city, moving towards him.

         He hides behind a building as the Reco passes. A strange, zombie-like
         figure comes down one of the streets, and the Recognizer swoops over
         it, the static field flashing between the legs, passing through the
         figure, dissolving it.

         Very grim. He looks out onto the street and sees two more of the
         figures, standing together, staring at each other, barely moving.
         Dead, lifeless, but animate. Tron comes out on the street, staring
         at these figures. He locks around the city in confusion, shaking his
         head sadly, but walks on.

         figuring the best way to get to the building. In front of the
         building stand a small group of the memory guards.

         This was his POV out of the window of the Recognizer. His face is
         sad, he is still mourning Ram. This is a very low point. He sighs,
         then looks around, putting his palm on one panel after another.
         One of them glows brilliantly as he touches it, and the Recognizer
         gives a violent shake, then stops.

         His eyes widen, then narrow. He non chalantly turns away, pretending
         to be still examining things.

         Flynn whirls around, fingers poised like a gunfighter. The Bit gives
         a violent start and leaps back, out of the way, but immediately
         comes back, peering at Flynn. Flynn is moving closer.

         The Bit is still in its pure energy form, but then it suddenly
         recognizes Flynn (thinks he is Clu), expands in a smooth green
         sphere -- the "Yes" mode and shouts:

         speaking, it reverts to a brilliant spark of light.

         In answer, the Bit moves toward the center of the cabin where a
         platform supports a four-foot tube with a crossbar. Flynn follows,
         stares at the setup for a moment, then steps onto the platform and
         grabs the cross-bar.

         This is the building Tron was eyeing when we left him. We see him
         inside now, in a corridor, passing a large opening which gives views
         of partially completed structures: an aircraft carrier, a strange
         elongated craft that resembles a sailboat on its side. All composed
         partially of glowing lines, and partially of flat smooth surfaces.
         We see several female programs working in these rooms. This building
         only has female workers, but they are all pale and listless, no
         interest in anything, staring at their feet as they shuffle along.
         Tron looks farther down the corridor.

         As the first girl passes his vantage-point, his hand flashes out and
         grabs her around the mouth, yanking her back into the niche with him.
         The line of workers mechanically files on past.


         We watch from the rear of the niche, as Tron holds the girl against
         his chest until all the workers are gone. She struggles feebly,
         half-heartedly.

         Tron and Yori walk through long hallways and arrive at her door.
         She whistles and the door disappears. They step through.

         As Tron and Yori enter. The apartment appears to be a box, with one
         window overlooking the cityscape, and the I/0 Tower. At first it
         looks empty, with strange murals of one dimensional furniture on the
         walls and floors.

</b>                    It's a flat. But wait a micro...


         She lays her palm on the wall near the door. The door reappears, and
         a glow starts to fill the room, softly, slowly. Tron looks around;
         the flat paintings of furniture are expanding, filling out, becoming
         three-dimensional. The room glows a soft rose color, becomes
         charming, soothing. It is still small and limited, but the light in
         the air and the few pieces of furniture give off a loving, seductive
         aura. Tron turns back to Yori, smiling, and stops.

         With her hand still on the wall panel, she is glowing absorbing
         extra energy, changing. The severe work clothes metamorphosize into
         shimmering, diaphanous drapery, twinkling with thousands of
         diamond-like points of light. A silvery tinkling SOUND comes from
         her robes as she moves forward; her beautiful face, now surrounded
         by a soft mane of hair, glows with pleasure at the expression in
         Tron's face. She smiles lovingly, and reaches out her hand.

         His face tells the story. The fugitive, returned from long exile, is
         being fully rewarded for his efforts.

         as their hands touch, and the glow springs out between their
         flattened palms.


         Tron pulls her close to him, sliding his hand up her arm, leaving a
         glowing trace, and her hands move up over his chest.

         They move together into an embrace, but their lips never touch. All
         the energy is transmitted through their hands. They sink down onto
         what looks like cushions made of stars, their glow increasing. The
         room fills with the brilliance of the energy they are giving each
         other, and we hear their sighs, as the MUSIC comes up. Each of them
         moves their hands over the other, moving slowly, as if they were
         trying to touch the other's entire body at once. They roll over and
         are enveloped in the cloud of stars...

         A slightly out-of-control Recognizer arrives in the city, wobbling,

         He lays his hands from panel to panel, causing one after another to
         light up in a random pattern, almost with a beat, but the Recognizer
         only slams into another building and keeps going. The Bit starts
         shouting:

         as the Reco screeches to a screaming stop... but the head of it,

         landing in what looks like a garbage dump.

         A group of low resolution programs are walking by. Flynn emerges
         from the broken-off head, stunned, but unhurt, the Bit flying by
         his side. He blearily sees the passing programs, but doesn't realize
         they are at such a low state of consciousness that they can't see

         Tron and Yori are crossing an open plaza-like area, on their way to
         the I/0 Tower. They pass by more zombie-like programs and overhear
         bits of conversation, all in dead-sounding monotones.

         on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the Tower,
         approaching a wide door in the wall.

         We see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now
         rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying Tron and Yori smoothly
         and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.

         as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. We get the
         sense of massive, over-size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery,
         dwarfing the programs who come to the Tower to communicate,
         preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared
         the sinner for confession. But here, everything is composed of clean,
         sharp, angular surfaces.  On this second story there is floor and
         ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city-grid below
         and beyond.


         Tron and Yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for
         a door into the inner parts of the Tower.

         wall, with a darkened opening behind it. A square, secondary altar
         supports the first, about fifty feet up a side.


         In the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing
         steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded
         suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the I/0 Tower
         priest, DUMONT. His eyes are shut. His face is lined with age, but
         still holds a sprightly sensitivity. It is the face of Dr. Gibbs,
         from the laser lab in the Real world. There is a large, V-shaped
         opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon,
         each a different color. The stripes of color thus formed bleed
         upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the V opening. There is
         only blackness beyond.

         We see Flynn and the Bit walking towards the Tower, staring
         curiously at the zombie-like characters on the streets.

         Below him, at waist level, also peeking around the corner, we see
         the glow of the Bit. Flynn moves out from the wall and starts going
         down the hall, Bit following.

                    real serious.


         CAMERA SWIVELS and watches him walking quickly away from us. We HEAR
         the sound of many feet marching as Flynn reaches the end of the
         corridor. He stops and glances over his shoulder.

         Sark... and a force of guards and six Blue Warriors. Sark is in

         going in for a final, easy kill of one renegade program who is
         trapped.

         over the warrior with the Bit hovering over him. As we watch, Flynn
         places both his hands on the Blue Warrior's chest. Quickly, the blue

</b>

         We see Tron approaching a bell-shaped structure, with the brilliant
         golden beam emerging from the highest point of the bell. It is
         surrounded by a cylinder of energy hundreds of feet in diameter.
         Tron walks into an opening at the base of the bell.


<b>    393  INT. COMMUNICATION BELL                                      393
</b>

         Tron stands on the rounded rim of a dish-shaped room, the floor of
         which rises to a cone in the center. The top of the cone is a flat,
         sliced-off surface. Tron walks down into the dish, a soft, padded
         surface, and then climbs up to the flat, central podium. We see that
         this surface is round, about four feet in diameter, and glowing from
         within, with a complex circuit pattern embedded in it. Tron looks
         down, and then up.

         We see Tron's upturned face. He steps up on the podium, hands gripped
         into fists at his sides. His face is gradually filling with a deep
         inner excitement and anticipation, his eyes searching the space
         above. His expression remains still, his mouth closed and even. Only
         his eyes project the emotion he is feeling, burning with the
         knowledge of the experience to come.


<b>    396  A SHOT FROM BELOW HIM, NEAR HIS FEET, LOOKING UP.            396

         He takes out his disk, grips it in both hands and slowly raises it
         high above his head. He stands stiffly, willing the response to
         happen... At first nothing stirs. Then a splendid, radiant beam of
         light bursts down from the opening in the top of the bell,
         illuminating Tron and the disk. His hands start to shake with the
         force of the communication beam, and suddenly the disk is ripped
         from his hands, to rise, glowing brilliantly, upwards to the source
         of the light.

         In the air above Tron, images begin to materialize, shifting,
         transparent forms. First we see a network with pinpoints of light
         at each intersection; it rotates, and becomes a globe, with a
         bright light at the center.


         We see one of the intersection lights become very bright, and the

         gradually we see an object emerging from the glow. The disk. It

         He is rising from the altar, the rest of his body emerging from the

</b>
         We see that this vessel is a simulation of a futuristic spacecraft,
         designed for travel in the Real world using solar energy, with an
         enormous metallic sail to catch the rays of sunlight like wind, and
         move with the speed of light.  The sail is at the bow of the craft,
         and a long, slender walkway connects it with the deck area, which is
         made up of several connected flattened box-shapes, giving it the
         look of a dragonfly. In this world, the Sailer catches data
         transmission beams instead of sunlight, and is propelled along the
         information paths to the Central Processing Unit.

         The elevator platform brings Tron and Yori through the center,
         forming part of the deck as it reaches a level position, locked
         into place.

         its tip ready to emerge. Below, on the ground, more guards are
         racing towards the hangar.

         Beating back the guards, tossing them over the side of the walkway.
         We see one last guard standing on top of the bunker that forms the
         connection of the craft to the sail. Tron advances on him... the
         guard stares at him, then looks down... then jumps off, intimidated.
         There's a sudden lurch forward, and Tron is thrown back, losing
         his balance.

         The transmission beam is flowing, passing directly through the craft,
         from behind, hitting the sail bunker, and passing through, so that
         it looks like a headlight. The Sailer starts moving, fast,
         accelerating so that it reaches a tremendous velocity in a matter of
         seconds.

         Just their two faces. Flynn bends closer, their lips almost touch.
         Suddenly her eyes widen as her form returns to solidarity, and color
         floods back into her. Her mouth opens in wonder and she looks up at
         Flynn. He pulls a little away from her, still holding her.

         Flynn lets go of her.

         He looks around, spots a small glow in one corner of the cell, runs
         to it and stoops down, cupping the glow in his hands. It wavers.
         Flynn wills his energy back into it, frowning with concentration.
         Suddenly the Bit pops into life.

         The prisoners file forward on the path to the MCP. Sark is leading
         them. We can see the structure of the MCP closer now, looming bigger.
         The four memory guards are standing at regular intervals along the
         path.

         speeding disk smashes into him, knocking him over. The CAMERA WATCHES
         over his de-rezzing body. We see a figure approaching closer... its
         arm is raised, and... the disk slams back into the hand.

         As the first one gets through the opening. The light from the MCP's
         beam pours out. Moving forward, through the entrance, the MCP is
         finally revealed. A giant cylinder, a hundred feet high, with a
         network of circuit lines, and stretched across all the visible
         surface... is a face. Flattened, stretched, bizarrely distorted,
         the face is capable of moving to any section of the-cylinder. The
         impression is similar to the look of a grotesquely fat person's face,
         but more so. It's horrible. Beneath the floating cylinder face two
         inverted cones of light, meeting at their apex, support it. We
         continue moving forward, the MCP looming over us. Then the CAMERA
         STOPS and the doomed programs file past us, separating and going to
         the inner walls. The MCP speaks, we see his enormous lips moving.

         in a de-rezzed, two dimensional state, disappearing completely in
         the course of this scene. Flynn runs to Sark's position, looking out
         the window.

         as the disk races at Tron. He dodges, drops to one knee and ducks
         under it. Sark's disk circles like a homing missile and attacks
         again. Tron deflects the second attack with his own disk, and the
         two meet with an explosion of light. Sark's disk ricochets off and
         races away, back to Sark. We see Tron throw his own weapon.

         Tron throws his disk. It's deflected off the base of the MCP, and
         returns to him.

         As Tron is preparing to throw again he notices Dumont and races over
         to him.

         Yori has steered them right next to the beam. She turns to Flynn,
         goes up to him.

                    just once...


         His head bends down and their lips meet. Yori's body begins to glow,
         change, metamorphosize until she has the same appearance as in the
         love scene with Tron, sparkling and gorgeous. Her eyes are closed.

         then open.

         He releases her, steps to the edge of the observation port, poises
         on the brink, and then leaps off, directly in the beam. We see Yori
         shakily grip the edge of the port and lean out.

         Flynn is diving through space in the beam, falling in slow motion
         directly into the center of MCP itself.

         Sark is much bigger than before, advancing on Tron. He speaks, but
         his voice is that of the MCP.

         We can see the MCP in the b.g. Suddenly there is an explosion of
         static, as Flynn falls into the MCP. We see a weird 2-D image of
         Flynn's face circling in the cylinder with the MCP as they battle.
         Sark falters, stumbles, distracted by this, and Tron ducks under him
         and hurls the code disk for the last time. It circles the MCP once,
         and then hurtles straight for the target, the apex of the energy
         cones. And connects.

         Dead face wracked with the pain of a second death. He begins to melt
         into a column of pure energy, dissipating completely.

         We see something materializing in the apex of the energy cones. It
         is dressed like Dumont was at the I/0 Tower, an old man in the
         padded altar costume, spinning, slowly, finally stopping. We see the
         wizened, wrinkled face of the true MCP for just a few seconds, and
         see that he is furiosly TYPING on an old Remington portable. Then he
         too dissolves into liquid energy, and disappears. The cylinder of
         the MCP glows brighter and brighter.

         Tron catches Yori as she jumps down. He hugs her close and looks at
         her, about to speak. But she reaches up and presses her lips to his

</b>

         CLOSE on the business end of the huge laser in ICOM's lab. A bright
         blast of LIGHT shoots out of the mechanism.


         WIDEN TO REVEAL the laser pouring its light onto the floor, near the
         chair where Flynn was sitting when he was digitized.


         Slowly -- in a reverse of his disappearance -- Flynn's BODY takes
         shape on the floor. As the laser shuts off, he is revealed intact --
         back in his real-world body and clothes... and as bewildered to find
         himself here as he was when he first arrived in the electronic world.


         He studies his hands -- and SEES that they're now nonluminescent
         flesh and blood.


         He looks out the window and SEES that it's shortly past dawn, with
         weak sunlight coming in.


         And, at the SOUND of light MACHINERY at work, he turns to look at
         Lora's computer terminal, where a hard-copy computer PRINTER is
         coughing out a long document on wide blue paper.


         Flynn gets up off the floor, goes over to the printer, and READS the
         document. As he does so, his eyes widen, and a SMILE appears on his
         face.


         The printer finishes its run, clicks patiently. Flynn, exuberant,
         tears the printout from the machine and rushes to the door with it.

         A BLUE CYLINDER, poised on a BLUE MESA -- resembling the MCP in the
         electronic world. And THREE YELLOW ROCKETS. They move randomly at
         first, then converge on the blue figure from three different
         directions.


<b>                               FLYNN (V.0.)
</b>                    you have any idea how much I can sue these
                    jokers for?


<b>                               LORA (V.0.)
</b>                    Well, just don't forget your old friends
                    when you're rich and famous.


<b>                               FLYNN (V.0.)
</b>                    Are you kidding? You guys'll he running
                    this joint by then...


<b>                               ALAN (V.O.)
</b>                   Your friend Dillinger sure won't...


         The yellow rockets all hit the blue mesa at the same time. It
         EXPLODES in typical video-game fashion -- radiating lines of blue
         SPARKS. The yellow rockets fly away from it and form a vertical
         formation, heading together toward the side of the CRT screen as we
         HEAR Flynn, Lora, and Alan heading for the door.


<b>                               FLYNN (V.O.)
</b>                    Hey, you know anybody who wants to
                    get hold of some video games... cheap?


<b>                               LORA (V.O.)
</b>                    You're getting out of the business?


<b>                               ALAN (V.O.)
</b>                    Shouldn't you wait till your
                    lawsuit's settled?


<b>                               FLYNN (V.0.)
</b>                    Nah...I decided...I've had enough of
                    video games to last me a good long
                    time. I feel like gettin' into some
                    real life...


         at the SOUND of the DOOR to Alan's office closing O.S., the three
         yellow rockets leave the CRT screen, sailing off its left-hand edge.
         HOLD a moment on the exploded blue figure and
