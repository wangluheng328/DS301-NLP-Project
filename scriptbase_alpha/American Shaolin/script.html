<b>EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE ­ NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE AT NIGHT, THE LIGHTS
</b><b>OF THE CITY SHINING BRIGHTLY.
</b><b>EXT. WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN A
</b><b>BURNED OUT ROW OF STORES.
</b>His is the only one still    occupied, and it doesn't look that
permanent. In the window    is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads
"Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu".    What remains visible behind the poster and
the security grate is an    IMPRESSION of people moving and milling
around.
<b>INT. WORKOUT AREA ­ SAME NIGHT
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.
</b>
The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old
and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would
be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered
sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is
typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the
students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is
a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth
shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.

<b>ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT
</b>
Struggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is
trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He
drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside
him.

<b>                     YOUNG ADULT
</b>
           Sifu Kwan, was that long enough? It's been 10 minutes...

Sifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he
walks past the student.
<b>                     KWAN
</b>           At Shaolin Temple, in misty Songshan mountains, We monks
           trained in iron palm until our hands bled...
                   (beat)

           ... then we trained some more.
He walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind.
<b>                     YOUNG ADULT
</b>                   (getting back into horse stance)
           I guess not...
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON KWAN
</b>As he walks around the different people training. As one woman is
moving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and
rearranges her hands.
<b>                       KWAN
</b>              Tiger grasps his tail, not hamburger!
He    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward
the    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door.
It    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As
he    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.
<b>                       STUDENT
</b>              Master Kwan, when can I learn flying kicks? I see Bruce
              Lee...

<b>                       KWAN
</b>
              Bruce Lee actor, we fighters, warriors. A sparrow in
              flight is beautiful, but a side kick to the ribs is
              effective. Show me.

The boy shrugs    and then    starts throwing side kicks. Kwan   is half
looking at the    boy and    half looking towards the door and   the clock.
The boy throws    three or    four kicks and then stops. He is   watching
Kwan watching    the door.    Kwan sees him, and turns back to   him.

<b>                       KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>
                    (shaking his head)

              A Shaolin warrior lets nothing intrude. Continue, never
              mind.

He continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door.
Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the
master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't
know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is
doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS.
RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles
widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously
hand made, and on the back is embroidered: "Kwan's Shaolin" and
underneath that is "Drew Carson". Kwan takes in the entire outfit,
while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They
are all very impressed.

<b>                       KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>              Never in my days at the Shaolin Temple have I seen
              uniform as beautiful as this. Thank you, Mrs. Rodriguez.
              I wish Drew were here to thank you himself. Ta ma de!
This last he says looking at the empty door.
<b>                       MOTHER
</b>
              I only hope it brings him luck in the tournament.
<b>
</b><b>                    KWAN
</b>           Luck is no concern, Mrs. Rodriguez. Shaolin warriors
           depend on heart and soul ­ that's how they saved the
           T'ang emporer.
He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering
his students around him.
<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Xie Xie, Mrs. Rodriguez.
                  (to class)
During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the
martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er...
fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But,
there was also time for individual training ­ where skills were honed
like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.

He turns to go.

One of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat.

<b>                    STUDENT 2
</b>
           What do you want us to do?

<b>                    KWAN
</b>
           When the blind follow the blind, they both fall over the
           cliff. Understand?

<b>                    STUDENT 2
</b>
           No.

The others mutter "No" and shake their heads, confused.

<b>                    KWAN
</b>
           No matter.
He exits, leaving his students staring vacantly after him.

They look at each other, honestly not knowing what to do.
<b>EXT. DREW GARAGE ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE.
</b>
It is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is
candlelight inside, and it is moving around ­ an effect not unlike a
ghost carrying a candelabra.

<b>INT. DREW GARAGE ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.
</b>The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu
and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the
spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREW
<b>
</b>CARSON, a    muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare
shoulders,    moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu
maneuvers.    He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot
wax on his    skin (INSERT).
In the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie.
<b>ANGLE ON KWAN
</b>Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching
Drew.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body
moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV.
Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts
instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls
but not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and
Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost
move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping
Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is
lit by the TV screen.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who, for the first time, sees that it is Kwan.

<b>                       DREW
</b>
<b>              MASTER KWAN!
</b>
He hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.

He leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax.
It pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's
chest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to
wipe the hot wax off.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
              Master Kwan! I'm sorry, very sorry!

<b>                       KWAN
</b>                    (blustering)

              I'm OK, never mind! What are you doing anyway?
<b>DREW
</b>Is taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling
the already hard wax off his chest.

<b>                       DREW
</b>              Practicing. I saw it in this movie...
Kwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of
him.
<b>                       KWAN
</b><b>
</b>           Why didn't you come to class? Why waste time with this...
           Should study tapes of opponent.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           I'll still win. Besides, the Shaolin monks never had
           tapes to study... they did it this way... right?
<b>                      KWAN
</b>           Not quite ­ our drills at the temple had meaning. If we
           had tapes, we would have watched them.
Drew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start.
<b>                      KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           "The    warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win
           100    times in 100 battles." Study the tapes I gave you.
           All    these years of one on one training ­ you're the best
           I've    ever taught.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           The best?

<b>                      KWAN
</b>
           Best white boy, maybe. Just fight like a Shaolin warrior
           ­ the rest will take care of itself.

                   (picks up tape)

           Face reality, before it breaks your jaw!

Drew holds out his hand for the tape, and Kwan slaps it into his
hand. Drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the VCR, when
Drew's stepfather, BOB, walks in. He is a big, overweight man, and he
is very angry.

<b>                      BOB
</b>
                   (shouting)
           Are you screwing around with this stuff again?

<b>                      DREW
</b>           Look, Bob, I'm not bothering you, am I?
<b>                      BOB
</b>
           It's your attitude that bothers me, son.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           I'm not your son, Bob. Lay off.
It is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension
in the room, and starts to say something.
<b>                      BOB
</b><b>
</b>                 (cutting him off)
           Don't say a word, yellow man.
<b>REACTION SHOT OF KWAN
</b>Closing his already opened mouth.
<b>                    BOB (CONT'D)
</b>           You're here because I told your Mom I'd see you were
           taken care of... after. At least respect my wishes, and
           make something of yourself... Stop wasting your time!
<b>                    DREW
</b>                 (sarcastic)
           When I'm the best fighter in the country, I'm not going
           to let you be part of my entourage...

<b>                    BOB
</b>
           You mean when you're in jail...

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Just leave me alone, Bob, OK? I NEVER asked for anything
           from you.

He spins and kicks one of the hanging bags, then walks out of the
workout room, leaving Bob and Kwan standing alone.

Kwan looks at Bob, who towers over him, and smiles sheepishly.

<b>                    KWAN
</b>
           Pressure. Big tournament this weekend.

He starts to walk out, but Bob follows him.

<b>                    BOB
</b>
           How would you have liked having to take care of a kid you
           never really wanted... ?
<b>                    KWAN

The grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully
laid out. A gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where TREVOR
and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. Polite
applause is

</b><b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>As he knocks out an opponent.
<b>ANGLE ON CROWD
</b>Applauding.
<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>Taunting a different opponent. Trevor executes a beautiful technique
and puts the guy down and out.

</b>(Psychologist, therapist, masseur, etc.) who are cheering Trevor on.
<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>As he plays with the next fighter.

<b>                         TREVOR
</b>
              They said you were good... ha!

He knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick. There is no
denying that he's a superior fighter.

<b>                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
              Can't you get me any quality sparring partners?

The next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist,
DR. PFEELGUT, calls for "Time" and motions Trevor over.

<b>                         PFEELGUT
</b>
              It's    not enough just to win, Trevor. You have to destroy
              your    opponent completely, mentally and physically. Beat
              him    once, he's a threat. Humiliate him, and he'll fear
              you    forever.

Trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to
leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool.
Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling.
<b>                         PFEELGUT (CONT'D)
</b>              Exactly!
Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it      to this guy,
alternately playing with him and hurting him. As      the guy tries to
hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose      and they start to
fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and      Trevor starts to
back up, laughing with the rest of the group.

<b>ANGLE ON PFEELGUT
</b>Toweling off, who is yelling to Trevor.
<b>                         PFEELGUT (CONT'D)
</b><b>
</b><b>           GET HIM! NOW!!
</b>Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees
what the psychologist is saying. He lunges immediately forward and
(in SLOW MOTION) knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull
his pants up.
<b>ANGLE ON CROWD AS THEY ENJOY THE SHOW IMMENSELY
</b>Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off.

</b>The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is doing a pedicure
and another is doing a manicure. An exercise physiologist is going
over a computer print out with Trevor, when an old Korean master,
MASTER KIM, comes into the room.

<b>                    TREVOR
</b>
           Ah, Master Kim.

                 (to physiologist)

           I'll look at these stats later.

Trevor indicates a seat near him, much lower than the one he is
sitting in. The Korean master prefers to remain standing.

<b>                    KIM

           A mountain lion doesn't ponder his weakness, and is
           therefore vulnerable.
<b>                    TREVOR
</b>                 (after a beat)

           Well, I'm pretty damn tired of this fortune cookie crap.
                 (beat)

The butler, CHAUNCY, comes forward and walks up to Master Kim.

              ref, to each other...

The referee gives them a signal and the fight begins. Drew is holding
his own, but Trevor is scoring. After several flashy moves, the round
is over.

Score: 6 - 1. We see Trevor's cheerleaders cheering.

2nd round: Drew's getting beaten worse than the first round. Nothing
he tries works. The score at the end of the round is 15 - 4, in favor
of Trevor.
<b>ROUNDBREAK

Drew is exhausted, frustrated and worried. Trevor is pumped and ready
to go on forever.

<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER
</b>The psychologist is exhorting him to destroy Drew. Trevor leans back
on his padded stool, smiling.
The 3rd round starts. In this round, Trevor is destroying Drew,
making him look ridiculous. A clinch comes, and
(INSERT HERE) before they can break, Trevor grabs the drawstring
<b>
</b>around Drew's waist and pulls.
They face off ("20 seconds" comes the call), and Trevor charges. As
Drew blocks, his pants begin to sag. Trevor, not trying to score,
just trying to keep Drew's hands busy, keeps coming.
Drew's pants drop lower and lower.
When they get around his knees, he finally notices them, and reaches
down to get them. Trevor drives and picks him up in a throw,
effectively showing Drew's bare ass to the world.
CUT AWAY to crowd laughing, girls shocked, cameras poised and
recording, one mom puts her hands over her daughter's eyes, etc.
Trevor dumps Drew and scores the final point, just as time runs out.
A buzzer goes off, signaling the end of the round.
Trevor thrusts his fists into the air in celebration. Drew tries to
crawl out of the ring, and everyone is watching him.

house, the acupuncture needle in his arm and his face pensive and
sad. Kwan busies himself around the needle, trying to alleviate the
pain of Drew's bruises.

<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           Don't talk like that. At Shaolin...
He pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew
looks at him funny ­ this is very against his character.

<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>
           I saw a Shaolin monk once. I was only 5 years old at the
           time, but I remember it like it was yesterday. I was
           coming back from the market with my father. Soldiers
           stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought.
           It was all we had left to eat ­ no more money. These were
           hard times in China, people were selling their children
           for food, and the soldiers had no right. Who can stop
           soldiers with guns, though? Yes?

He pauses, and takes a sip of tea, checking the needle, adjusting it
and turning it slightly this way and that.

<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>
           Just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of
           the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back.
           Well, naturally, they didn't. They pushed the monk, and
           the next thing I knew the soldiers were in the street,
           and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers,
           and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing
           with the dust of the street.

Kwan smiles with the memory ­ it is a sweet and heroic one.
<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           The crowd whispered "Shaolin", and he bowed to us,
           touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. I
           watched him until he disappeared in the distance. He was
           larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. I vowed
           then and there to become like him, fight for right like
           the Shaolin.
He pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why
he is telling him this story.

<b>                    KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           I never did, though. My family left China and ended up
           here in New York, a young boy's dream left behind in
<b>
</b>           China.
<b>                     DREW
</b>           You mean... all the stories...?
<b>                     KWAN
</b>                   (nodding)
           Made up. I never trained at the Shaolin Temple. When I
           realized my dream couldn't come true, I convinced myself
           that it had anyway. It was a small step to convince other
           people.
<b>                     DREW
</b>           Why are you telling me this?
<b>                     KWAN
</b>
           I've given you all I can, and it's not enough. It was
           never enough. You're like a son to me, Drew, and you have
           all the potential in the world, but I can't take you
           where you want to go.

Kwan takes the needle out of Drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where
it was with a cotton ball.

<b>                     KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>
           There, that should control the swelling.

He watches Drew, who is pondering what Kwan has said.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           So you're not a Shaolin?

<b>                     KWAN
</b>
           No.

<b>                     DREW
</b>           Never were?

<b>                     KWAN
</b>           No.
Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his
face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.

<b>                     KWAN (CONT'D)
</b>           What?
<b>                     DREW
</b>
           If you are not a Shaolin warrior, then I will become one.
<b>                     KWAN

</b>           What are you talking about?
<b>                       DREW
</b>           I'm going to the Shaolin Temple ­ they can train me so I
           will never lose like that again.
Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's
eyes.
<b>                       KWAN
</b>           He hit you so hard, you're delirious. I'll get a cold
           cloth.
He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.
<b>                       DREW
</b>                 (eyes intent)

           Don't you    see? You said    yourself I needed the right
           training ­    where better    than the Shaolin Temple? What's
           holding me    here? I have    the chance to do what you
           couldn't.    I will go to    the Shaolin Temple.

Kwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. He nods his head, giving
the idea serious consideration. He smiles along with Drew.

<b>                       KWAN
</b>
           I must pay for your ticket...

<b>                       DREW

           No! I'll make it there myself.

<b>                       KWAN

           I grew up on the stories of the Shaolin, and you can be

           let me help you. Let an old man make up for the trouble
           he's caused.
Kwan touches Drew's bruised cheek, fatherly love in his eyes. Drew

Ashema climbs off the back and takes the bike from Drew, marveling at
his awe-struck face.

           I have to help my grandfather with our stand. If you get

           Good luck.

                   (beat)

           Hey, thanks a lot for the ride. I hope I see you again.
They wave at each other, and Ashema pushes her bike off.

Drew turns back to stare at the front of the temple. He is letting it
all sink in.

After a moment, he picks up his backpack and heads for the front
door. He pulls it open and disappears inside.
<b>INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE INTERIOR AS DREW OPENS THE HEAVY DOOR.
</b>
The muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of
the day outside. Drew quietly closes the front door, and the half
light takes over.
He walks through the temple proper, and what follows is a MONTAGE of
temple shots, establishing the feeling of the
<b>
</b>temple:    the famous Shaolin monk painting, the depressions in the
floor of    the training hall, the incense blackened walls of the
temple,    the temple figurines, the red lanterns hanging from the
ceiling,    a huge wooden carving of
Bodhidharma, etc.
No one is around.
Drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. He wanders
into another hall, following the O.S. sounds of CHANTING.
Once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense
burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in
rhythm. No one notices that Drew is standing there. The monks eyes
are open, but they don't seem to see him.
He stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall.
He goes into a corridor, then passes the "Wooden Man Chamber".

<b>HE STICKS HIS HEAD IN, AND SEES ALL KINDS OF WOODEN STATUES LINED UP.
</b><b>HE ALMOST STARTS IN, BUT IS DISTRACTED BY THE SOUNDS OF TRAINING
</b><b>OUTSIDE (O.S.). HE WALKS OUT IN SEARCH OF THE SOUNDS.
</b>
<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ SAME DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA.
</b>
All manner of training equipment is standing outside (wooden men,
posts, hanging targets, heavy bags, iron palm jugs, balance beams,
etc.).

A monk, the DRILL SERGEANT (hereafter D.S.), is standing in front of
a wooden post, driving his hand into the wood.

The post TREMBLES with every strike.

Drew stands next to the monk, watching him intently. Again, the monk
takes no notice of him.

<b>                       DREW
</b>
              Excuse me, Master.
No answer.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
              Hello? Busy, huh?
Still no answer. The man is just slamming his hand into the post,
over and over.
Drew sighs and walks on. He goes down a path, and flowering bushes
are on either side of him. He can see the "pagoda forest" in the
distance. At the end of the path, a monk, SAN DE, is sweeping up the
path.
Drew walks up to the monk and bows.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b><b>
</b>           Master, may I ask you a question?
No answer nor response. Drew's kind of tired of this treatment.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           What's the deal here? Is everybody deaf in this temple?
           Even if you heard me, you wouldn't understand, would you?
           Huh, baldy? Shine your head for a quarter?
He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed.
He walks back into the chanting chamber.
<b>INT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b>The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more,
moving with the beat, until they stop chanting.
Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           That was great! Great!

The monks finally take notice of him, and they are shocked.

<b>                    MONK 1
</b>
           No tourists! Temple closed!

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           So you can see me?!?

Several monks rush up and start herding Drew towards the exit.

<b>                    MONK 1
</b>
                 (very agitated)

           No tourists! No tourists!

Drew stops their progress and makes sure he has the monk's attention.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           I'm not a tourist! I want to be a monk!
The monk stops, his face a mask of shock. He calls to another monk,
and they have a short conversation in Chinese.
<b>                    ADMISSIONS MONK
</b>           That's not possible.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
             I'm not leaving.

Drew starts to sit down, intent on staying, almost like a kid who is
going to hold his breath until he turns blue.

<b>                     MONK
</b>
             You give me no choice.

                  (to other monks)

             Remove him.

He continues in a stream of Chinese, and the other monks grab Drew
and physically force him to stand up and start moving him towards the
door.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
             I just want to be a monk!

Drew is forced through the courtyard to the front door.

They pass the monk who was sweeping up in the back of the temple. He
watches with interest as they open the door and force Drew through
it, out of the temple.
He smiles.

<b>
</b>The temple door opens again, and out comes Drew's backpack.
It lands next to him, but spews out a couple of pairs of underwear,
and some socks.
The people standing around laugh.
Drew gathers up the clothing and stuffs it back into his pack. He
sits there for a moment, then gets up and heads for the small shops
and stands ringing the courtyard.
He walks past a couple of the stalls, looking at the people running
them. He doesn't see Ashema. He passes a tea stall, where one old man
is sitting down sipping his tea.
The old man looks at Drew and smiles, and Drew is about to walk on,
when Ashema stands up from where she was squatting behind her stall.

Drew sits down heavily, putting his pack down next to him.

Ashema places a cup of tea down in front of him, the steam rising
from it.

The grandfather keeps talking, even though Ashema and Drew really
don't want to listen.

<b>                      ASHEMA (CONT'D)
</b>
           He is telling a story about a monk who was refused
           admission into the temple. It broke his heart not to be
           allowed to be a monk.

<b>                      DREW

           What did he do?

Ashema says something to him, and he continues in Chinese.

<b>                      ASHEMA
</b>
           He decided not to leave. He stayed in the courtyard until
           they let him in.

<b>                      DREW

           Of course they did ­ what kind of story do you think my

           until they could no longer say no. He went on to become
           one of the most famous monks in the history of the
           temple.
Drew sits there, thinking, letting it all soak in. He then gets up
and smiles.

The sun is barely coming up, and only a few shafts of light are
illuminating the darkness. A figure can be seen sitting cross-legged
in front of the door.

It is Drew, backpack at his side.
The front door opens and a monk pokes his head out to look around,
and he sees Drew sitting there. His eyes widen in shock, then he
quickly disappears inside.
Almost immediately, the door opens again, and the Admissions Monk is
standing there, surprised and angry to see Drew sitting there.
<b>                     ADMISSIONS MONK

there. He walks on.
The Admissions Monk slams the door, angry.

O.S. comes the sounds of gongs and drums.

A crowd has gathered in the courtyard. Ashema and her grandfather are
in the crowd, and they work themselves up to where Drew is.

Drew turns his head, and a procession of kids about his age (some
older and some younger) come walking into the courtyard.

The front door to the temple opens wide, and a column of monks, all
in their best saffron robes, are lined up waiting to receive them.

The young men who are walking in all still have hair, and they are
carrying some baggage. They begin to enter the temple.

Drew is sitting there, trying to understand what is happening when
the door to the temple opens again. The Drill Sergeant appears in the
doorway and impatiently motions for Drew to come in.
The crowd has stopped and is watching the drama unfold.
Drew gets up warily, expecting some trick.
The Drill Sergeant motions again, wanting Drew to hurry up.
Drew looks at Ashema and her Bau Bau and smiles. He picks up his
backpack and starts towards the temple, limping from sitting for so
long.
The crowd goes crazy, clapping and yelling.
Drew runs into the temple. The door closes behind him.

The line of disciples has stopped, waiting for Drew. Drew, back pack
in hand, takes his place at the end of the line.

They parade past a line of monks assembled in the courtyard inside
the temple.

As they walk by, some of the monks look nonplused, while a few are
put out by the fact that Drew is among them.

Several of the disciples turn around to look at Drew, and a couple
are openly hostile to him.

They file up to a raised platform, on which stand 20 monks, each
holding a scroll in their hands, one monk for every new disciple.

A gong sounds, and the questions begin.

</b>The monk pauses, for that is not the ritual answer to the question.
The Drill Sergeant comes up to him and whispers in his ear, and the
monk then continues.
<b>                     MONK
</b>           Will you abide by the rules of the temple, even if it
           means death?
<b>                     DREW
</b>           I do.
The Drill Sergeant comes up behind Drew and WHACKS him in the side
with his elbow.

The Drill Sergeant nods his head.
<b>                     MONK
</b>
           Will a fighting monk ever use his skills for personal
           gain?

Drew pauses, looking at the Drill Sergeant. The D.S. nods, urging him
on.
<b>                     DREW
</b>           Yes, without pause.

</b>           I mean, no, of course not.
Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded.
A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows
down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards
the raised platform in the center.
Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure.
It is San De!
San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then
clears his throat.
Everyone stands up again.

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Do these disciples accept the authority of the Shaolin
           Temple?

</b>
           Yes, without pause, Master San De.

           I'll be damned!

The DISCIPLE next to him, GAO, pokes him sharply in the ribs.

<b>                      GAO

<b>
</b>Gongs go off, firecrackers are set off, and a special flag is raised
on the flag pole. A roar comes from the crowd outside.
<b>ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
</b>All of whom are happy. All, that is, except for Gao, who is staring
at Drew.
Drew, notices the stare.
<b>                    DREW

</b>
           Your training begins tomorrow. For now, your shr fu will
           introduce you to our temple. Welcome to Shaolin.

San De walks away, and the disciples are split into several
"platoons". Drew is matched up with the Drill Sergeant, and Gao is
also in his group.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Great, just great.

They are motioned to follow Gao out of the courtyard and into the
temple proper.

<b>INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b>
Drew walks behind the other disciples, who are lining up to get their
robes. As he takes his place in line, a monk comes up to take Drew's
backpack. Drew resists, and a tug of war ensues.

<b>                    DREW
</b>           What are you doing, man?
<b>                    MONK

           You must surrender this.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           No way, man! Get your own...

The Drill Sergeant sees the scuffle and walks over.
<b>                    D.S.
</b>           It is unseemly to argue like this. Take the backpack into
           the sleeping quarters.
<b>
</b>                 (to Drew)
           Do not cling to material things ­ it is not good for your
           soul.
He walks away, and Drew reluctantly gives up his backpack.
Drew lines back up, and is about to get his robes, when Gao slides
over and takes them from him. Drew immediately shoves him and tries
to grab the robes back. Gao smiles and moves away, holding the robes
up and away from Drew.
Drew is pissed and ready to go after Gao. Before he can, however, LI,
another disciple, grabs another set of robes from the table and gives
it to Drew, pulling him away from the confrontation.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)

<b>                    LI

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Really? I hadn't noticed... Why'd they let him in,
           anyway?

<b>                    LI

           Who knows? Maybe for the challenge?

They both smile and walk off.

A number of cots are lined up side by side. The D.S. has assigned a
bed to each monk. Drew finds his bed, which is right next to Gao's.

<b>                    GAO

<b>                    GAO (CONT'D)
</b>
           Well, this monk smells!
Drew unconsciously smells himself. He shakes his head.
Li goes up to the D.S. and points to the bed he was assigned.

Gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed, hitting Drew
with his shoulder. Drew trips him as he walks away, all done very
secretively since the D.S. is watching.
<b>                      DREW

Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into

Drew stares up at the ceiling.

Drew, belatedly, gets into a fighting stance, but no other attack is

As they go through forms or free sparring. There are SHOTS of monks
throwing stars, working with weapons, etc. It is all very exciting.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who is more excited than all the others.

<b>ANGLE ON THE D.S.
</b>As he walks to the front of the group. In his hand he is carrying a
shovel.

building.

The D.S. leads the way to the latrine building, and the disciples
follow, each of them carrying a shovel. Drew is trudging along, not
believing what they are doing.

pole on his shoulders, the muscles in his arms, shoulders and back
straining. He walks off to the side of the area to dump it.
As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across his back. He
drops the buckets and falls to the ground. He gets up as quickly as
<b>
</b>he can, but there is no one to be seen.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES

<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES AS THEY EAT THEIR LUNCH

It is again very meager: a bowl of rice, a bowl of soup and a piece
of scrawny meat. Drew looks at it for a moment. The

D.S. is standing over his shoulder.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           Any problems?

Drew shakes his head and starts to eat, quickly.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
As he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole. He gets it up
onto his shoulders, in pain, and starts to walk. Immediately, the
D.S. is there in front of him.

He examines the baskets. They are not full.
He moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt.

<b>                    DREW

</b>           Do a job well or don't do it.

<b>ANGLE ON GAO AND THE DISCIPLES
</b>As they are in line for water. They each drink a large glass full,
then move back to their work area. Drew is the last in line. When
Drew gets to the front, the D.S. smiles and shakes his head.
<b>
</b><b>                       D.S.
</b>           Sorry, all gone. Get some more.
Drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up
at the D.S., then forces a smile. He takes the proferred buckets of
water (made of wood, with pointed bottoms and large handles). The
D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to
work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to
himself.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)

Gao is laughing as he watches Drew go.
<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY

Once they are filled, he starts back for the temple. His shoulders
are straining from the weight of the buckets.

He goes over the path to the temple, having to negotiate logs over
chasms, etc. After various trials and tribulations, Drew arrives at
the temple, his arms incredibly tired. The D.S. is there waiting for
him.

Drew, determined not to show any weakness, raises the buckets a
little bit higher. He comes to the D.S., proud and defiant. The D.S.
motions for him to put the buckets down.

Without thinking, Drew, puts the buckets down, and they both fall
over, spilling their contents onto the ground. Drew tries to stop
them, but he's too late. The water has all spilled out onto the
ground.

<b>                       DREW

Gao smiles and shakes   his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew
in the leg with a leg   sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and
fights a valient, but   losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt
in his buckets flying   everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and
continues walking.
<b>CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HAND
</b>A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S.
walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.

           Shaolin monks feel no pain. Rub some dirt on it and you
           will be fine.

He walks away.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES
</b>
On a work break. They are watching the monks training in the
distance. It is all the more desirable because it is unattainable.

In the distance, a monk can be seen walking between two other monks.
They are leading him out.

The monk continues walking until he walks right in front of the
disciples. His face and body are covered with bruises and welts. The
two other monks don't say a word, their faces grim.

           Imagine yourself sitting on the bank of a river watching
           your thoughts flow by. Clear your mind... Think of
           nothing.

Drew sits, trying to think of nothing. He is not succeeding.

<b>INT. DINING AREA ­ NIGHT
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WASHING DISHES, ALONE IN THE KITCHEN AREA.
</b>
He bends over to get a dish, when a pole comes and SMACKS him on the
rear end. He turns immediately in one direction, but gets hit again
from the OTHER direction.

Drew is furious, and he can't even see the attacker.

<b>                       DREW
</b>

No answer, as we HOLD on Drew looking around.

<b>                       DREW
</b>           Oh, man! You guys actually use this as fertilizer? That's
           disgusting!
<b>
</b>They turn to go back, and there is Gao, balancing a huge basket of
night soil over his head, peasant-style. He is on the same ridge that
they are going to walk on.

He reaches down and plucks a stick out of the earth at his feet, and
then closes on Gao a little bit.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           There's something on the bottom of your basket.

Drew pokes at the basket for a moment, right over Gao's head. Then,
he JAMS the stick in, and holds it there.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           Oops! I think I found the problem.

                 (beat)

           A hole.

Drew pulls the stick out and watches as the night soil cascades down
onto Gao's head. They back away as Gao goes running towards the pit
where the night soil is deposited.

           Well, somebody sure smells!

<b>EXT. WORK AREA ­ DAY
</b>
<b>THE DISCIPLES ARE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD.
</b>As they work, a group of fighting monks walk by after a workout. Drew
stops working and watches them pass.
<b>                       DREW
</b>           This is ridiculous.

Suddenly, a bamboo pole CRACKS Drew on the shoulder. He turns around,
ready for a fight, only to see the D.S. standing there, the pole
raised for another strike.

<b>                       D.S.

</b>In the b.g. can be seen Drew, Li, Wu and a couple other of the
disciples. They are waiting for something.

The D.S. hits the trip wire and suddenly two bamboo poles HURTLE
towards him, ready to slam him in the shoulders.

With one beautiful move, the D.S. breaks both poles, shattering when
they hit his arms.

The D.S. hardly breaks stride and continues walking. He looks back
once, and sees the outline of the group of disciples.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND THE GUYS

Suddenly, a bamboo shinai is SLAMMED across Drew's back, waking him
up.
<b>                       MEDITATION MONK

Who is holding court.

Drew goes to knock on the door, when it opens and San De is standing
there. The D.S. has just arrived. He looks at San De for
instructions, but San De indicates that he will deal with them.

<b>                    DREW

San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Here at the temple,    we use a period of intense physical
           labor to test your    patience, and to teach you humility
           and self-reliance.    As you continue training, you will be
           given chores every    day ­ remember the first time you saw
           me I was sweeping?    Physical labor keeps us humble.

<b>ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
</b>
Who tonight have been anything but humble.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           You've all performed    admirably, and have learned an
           important lesson ­ to    obey your shr fu without question.
           Because of this, I've    decided to begin your martial
           training sooner than    what is prescribed. Tomorrow
           morning.

The disciples can hardly believe their luck.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           I... I mean we, just wanted to... thank you for the
           opportunity to be part of the illustrious history of the
           Shaolin Temple.

                 (beat)
           Yeah, that's it. Right, guys?
They all say "Thank you" as one, and then bow to the headmaster with
their hands clasped in front of them. They turn away and head down
the hallway.
<b>ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES

As they increase their pace, almost running through the halls with
their excitement.

<b>INT. DORM AREA ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DOOR TO THE SLEEPING QUARTERS.
</b>Suddenly, it BURSTS open and in come the disciples, led by Drew. They
fan out into the room, Drew in the center.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           Gentlemen, this calls for a party!
He runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and
puts on some good old American Rock 'N' Roll.
Everyone, but Gao, is moving in time with the music. Drew is the most
accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad.
The entire effect of the bald-headed monks rocking out is very comic.
Drew starts showing Li and Wu a couple of dance routines (old stuff ­
the swim, the twist, etc.). Everyone is having a great time.

<b>ANGLE ON GAO
</b>
Glowering, as he moves toward the boom box.

He reaches for the "Stop" button.

Drew blocks the arm, and a pushing and shoving match starts.

<b>                    GAO
</b>
           You're trying to get us all kicked out!

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           I'm just trying to have a party. Chill out!

They push and shove into the middle of the room, a couple of kicks
and punches thrown, then they face off, ready to duke it out.

The party is raging, while Gao and Drew are the only ones static, set
to do battle.

Just then, the door starts to open. Everyone freezes and looks toward
the door, including Gao. Drew, meanwhile, has the presence of mind to
jump onto the boom box, shutting it off and hiding it with his body.
<b>ANGLE ON DOOR
</b>As the D.S. opens it and sticks his head in.
He surveys the room, seeing the tableau of frozen monks, with Drew
lying on his bed.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who waves to the D.S.

</b>Who knows that something is going on.
<b>                    D.S.
</b><b>
</b>           Go to sleep. Lights out.
He hits the lights and then closes the door. In the semi-darkness the
room relaxes in a collective sigh. Drew stands up and packs up the
stereo.
Gao walks over past Drew.
<b>                    GAO
</b>           It's not over, American.
<b>INT. MAIN CHAMBER ­ MORNING
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHAMBER FULL OF FIGHTING MONKS, ALL GOING
</b><b>THROUGH THE SAME SET OF MOVEMENTS.
</b>Kick. Punch.
Kick. Punch.

INTERCUT of feet striking the stone floor, depressions in the floor
testifying to the centuries of training this chamber has seen.

Through the door come the D.S., Drew and the others. They line up
along one wall, watching the fighting monks go through their form.

It is beautiful: powerful, graceful and intimidating.

Their form done, they file out of the chamber, leaving the D.S. with
his group, along with one fighting monk. The D.S. motions for them to
line up as the monks had.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           You will train 6 days a week, from 5 am to 9 p.m.,
           alternating with work and meditation. Sunday afternoon is
           free time.

D.S. lets that sink in, then motions for the monk to take over.

<b>                    MONK
</b>           In order to keep our bodies strong, Bodhidharma gave us a
           series of exercises and breathing techniques. Because the
           times demanded action, we developed Shaolin style wu shu
           from these exercises.
He goes through a couple of martial movements.
<b>                    MONK (CONT'D)
</b>
           The spirit of Bodhidharma remains. Training is like
           meditation. Be aware of everything, but aware of nothing
           in particular. Think not thinking.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           What do you mean, 'Think not thinking'?

            someone else is in danger... Follow my movements...

He starts moving through a series of techniques, and the rest of the
disciples try to mimic his actions. He is moving around the room, and
they are trying to do what he is doing.

Some are getting it, some aren't.

Drew, used to a more individualized type of training, isn't getting
it.

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY

A hand COMES INTO FRAME, grabs the wedge and pulls it back out of the

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Drew, along with the other disciples, lined up
and throwing these sharp wedges into the ground and pulling it back
out. Their muscles are bulging with the effort.
<b>ANGLE ON HUGE SMOKING BRASS URNS
</b>Filled to the brim with small stones. Drew is forcing his arms into
the urn in "Iron Palm" training.

<b>ANGLE ON MONK ON A SET OF POLES

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES PAIRED OFF.
</b>Drew is working with his friend Li. They are moving through a series
of techniques, ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to
blocked by a special Shaolin technique.

Each time Li throws the final kick, Drew gets hit, HARD.

His block isn't working. A monk comes up to him.

<b>                      MONK
</b>
           Block the way I showed you.

<b>                      DREW

           This is the way I was taught.

<b>                      MONK (CONT'D)
</b>
           Do it this way. You won't get hit.

Drew bows and turns to continue working with Li. By this time,
however, the ranks have shifted, and Gao is opposite Drew.

Drew attacks first in the series, and Gao uses the block to easily
deflect Drew's kick.
<b>                      GAO
</b>                 (menacingly)

He attacks, and Drew gets to the final technique. He blocks the way
he did before, and he gets slammed brutally by Gao.
Gao stands over him, smiling.

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS FLIPPING THROUGH THE AIR, DOING FLYING
</b><b>KICKS, AERIALS, ETC.
</b>A monk is alternately falling down and kipping up, falling down and
<b>
</b>kipping up.
Drew's group is working on several very athletic maneuvers, none of
which Drew is especially good at. Gao, of course, is having no
trouble.
Drew tries a flying move and falls into a heap on the ground. He is
very angry, and he hits the ground with his fist.
<b>                      MONK

Drew sits in the dirt, watching everyone around him sail through the
air and flip over the ground. He is not a happy camper.

<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA.
</b>
The entire group is gathered in a sort of pit, on a hard concrete
floor. D.S. stands in the middle.

<b>                      D.S.
</b>
              I want to go over some takedowns before we end for the
              day. I'll need a partner...

He scans the group, and then points to Drew. Drew smiles ruefully,
walks to the front and bows to D.S.

<b>                      D.S.
</b>
              Watch carefully as I take him down, using techniques from
              shwai jyau, Chinese wrestling.

<b>                      DREW
</b>                   (looking at ground)
              Excuse me, Master, but there aren't any mats here.
<b>                      D.S.
</b>              Do they always use mats in America?

The group laughs a little at that, and Drew's manhood is now
challenged.

<b>                      D.S. (CONT'D)
</b>              If you are scared, I'll get someone else. Perhaps Gao

<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Attack me straight on...
Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard
concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow.
Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the
ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack.

<b>ANGLE ON THE GROUP
</b>
Who can barely watch the destruction.

<b>ANGLE ON THE FIGHT
</b>
The D.S. does not let up at all, taking

Drew down hard each time. Every time, regardless of the impact, Drew
gets right back up. His eyes are dazed, there is a little blood
coming out of his nose, but he keeps coming back for more.

Finally, after a high arcing back throw, a real thumper, the worst of
all of them, the D.S. calls it a day.

<b>                     D.S.
</b>
           Any questions? Good, that's all for today.

Before anyone can move, however, Drew raises his hand as high as he
can, obviously in pain.

<b>                     DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I'm not sure I got that last throw clear in my mind.

The group gasps, knowing how much Drew must be hurting, admiring him
for his guts. Even Gao is impressed.

<b>                     D.S.
</b>           I said that's enough.
<b>                     DREW (CONT'D)

           understand.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Attack!

Drew attacks, and the D.S. executes the manuever perfectly, crashing
<b>
</b>Drew down almost on his head. Luckily, Drew is able to twist at the
last moment and take the impact on his already bruised shoulder. He
moans and groans and lies there.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I think I've got it now. Xie Xie!
The group disburses, shaking their heads in wonder. Li comes up to
Drew, who is still lying on the ground.

</b>           He hurts more than me, he's just not bleeding, that's
           all.

He tries to get up, but moans in pain and falls back down.

Li helps him up and takes him to the showers.

<b>ANGLE ON D.S.
</b>
Watching them go. There is a slight smile on his face.

<b>EXT. DORMITORY ­ SAME DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LI RUBBING THE BRUISE ON DREW'S SHOULDER WITH
</b><b>TIGER BALM.
</b>
It is huge, and looks really painful.

<b>                       LI
</b>
           If you go to San De, he can send you to a doctor...

Drew pulls away and stands up. He backs up to the wall of the
dormitory, right underneath a window.

<b>                       DREW
</b>
           I appreciate your concern, Li, but it's not that serious.
           I'm all right.

Just as he is talking, Gao comes to the window with a pan of dirty
water (from washing the floor of the dorm).

<b>GAO LOOKS DOWN (GAO POV) AND SEES DREW
</b>Hhe smiles, then pours the huge bucket over the edge, dousing Drew.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As the dirty water hits him, drenching him.
<b>EXT. WATERFALL ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WATERFALL.
</b>It is huge, and the water is crashing down from high above.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON A MONK, INSIDE THE WATERFALL
</b>He is going through martial arts techniques as the water thunders
onto him.
<b>ANGLE ON D.S. AND GROUP
</b>As they stand on the bank.
<b>                        D.S.
</b>              Concentrate on your stance. All I want you to do is try
              to hold your stance. Li, you're first.
Li smiles and walks into the waterfall, using a walkway that goes
behind the thundering water.
He moves into the water a little, and gets into a deep horse stance.
He stand there, immovable. After a moment, he turns to look at D.S.

<b>ANGLE ON D.S.
</b>
Who motions him farther into the water.

<b>ANGLE ON LI
</b>
Who nods his head and walks into the thundering water. As soon as he
gets into the main stream of water, he is forced off the ledge and he
falls about 20 feet into the pool below.

<b>                        D.S.
</b>
              Next...

Each of them try it in turn. Everyone fails.

Gao goes in, and he manages to stand under the impact of the water
for a moment, before he too succumbs and goes down into the pool.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
It's his turn. He walks to the waterfall and goes in. He picks up an
umbrella he stashed behind the waterfall (imprinted with a "NEW YORK
GIANTS NFL" logo on it ­ unmistakably American).

He walks into the waterfall, and the umbrella works for a moment.
Drew is holding it with both hands, and he gets into a deep horse
stance.
He turns to smile at the D.S., and then waves at the others. As soon
as he takes a hand off the handle of the umbrella, the water slams
him and off he goes into the pool.
He lands with a huge splash, doing a painful bellow flop. Drew comes
to the surface, still clutching the now- destroyed umbrella. He
smiles at the other disciples, who are still swimming, sheepishly.
<b>                        DREW
</b>
              Thought I'd join you guys.
<b>INT. TEMPLE TRAINING HALL ­ DAY
</b><b>
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUPS WORKING OUT.
</b>Drew is in with the group. Gao and Drew are chosen to do a training
exercise together.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           In this exercise, you try to touch your partner's chest
           lightly, and your partner tries to block.
The group gets started doing the drill, and Gao is almost caving
Drew's chest in with his blows. He is so close to Drew that Drew
doesn't have a chance to block it. On the last strike, Drew falls
back to the ground.
The D.S. is there immediately.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Something wrong?

Drew shakes his head and gets back up.

<b>                     D.S.
</b>
           Switch!

Now it's Drew's turn to strike, and he tries to hit Gao with the same
amount of force as he did, but Gao avoids his attack, throwing him
off balance. He throws another punch out, and Gao grabs it and pulls.

Drew falls to the floor again. A monk who was watching walks over.

<b>                     MONK
</b>
           The goal of this drill is not to hurt your partner. Just
           try to tap his chest.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           I know, but...

<b>                     MONK
</b>           Then do it that way...
The Monk walks away, shaking his head.

<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ EVENING
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, EMPTY EXCEPT FOR DREW AND LI
</b><b>PLAYING CATCH WITH A FRISBEE.
</b>Drew is flipping it in a bunch of different ways, and Li is enjoying
watching him.
To the side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall.

<b>                     DREW
</b>           This sure beats sweeping...
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON FRISBEE
</b>Floating past temple statues and ancient Chinese decorations, barely
missing them.
Drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder
than he should have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it
dead center, right in the face.
The statue starts to tip!
Drew and Li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips
over and smashes on the ground.
They look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't
fall. They start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S.
coming towards them.
Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms.

He tosses one to Li and they just begin sweeping again when the D.S.
rounds the corner.

The D.S. knows something is going on, but they look so innocent.

<b>                       D.S.
</b>
           Sweep the main chamber, Drew.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           Yes, master.

He bows and smiles goodbye to Li. He walks into the main training
chamber.

<b>INT. CHAMBER ­ SAME EVENING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING INTO THE CHAMBER.
</b>
This is the chamber where they had their first workout, and Drew just
stands there for a moment, soaking up the tradition of it.

He walks to an area of the chamber under the famous painting and
stands staring at it.

QUICK CUTS to different ANGLES of the painting.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who begins to sweep.

His broom is going over the depressions where the monks train, and
soon he loses his desire to sweep. He takes the broom in his hand as
a weapon and starts to spin it, going through a martial arts form,
his feet moving naturally into the depressions in the floor.
He finishes with a flourish, having moved into a shadowy area in a
corner, and then bows to an imaginary crowd, using the broom as a
microphone.
<b>                       DREW
</b><b>
</b>                    (imitating an announcer)
              Presenting, the greatest fighter in the history of the
              Shaolin temple... Drew Carson!
Drew holds his broom over his head, nodding his head to the imaginary
crowd.
<b>                          DREW
</b>              The crowd is going wild.
Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into
Drew's unprotected stomach!
Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee,
and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach.
Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and
sends him pitching to the floor.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
As he lands face down in the pile of dust and dirt he already swept
up.

<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ EVENING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, THE SUN SETTING IN THE
</b><b>DISTANCE.
</b>
Drew is standing in front of a painting-statue of Bodhidharma, one in
which he is made to look extremely fierce.

San De walks up behind Drew and stands there for a moment.

<b>                          SAN DE
</b>
              He was an amazing monk...

<b>                          DREW

              Yeah, what's up with him?
<b>                          SAN DE
</b>              Come with me...

San De walks away, and Drew follows him.
<b>INT. SAN DE'S CHAMBERS ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE BREWING TEA.
</b>The room is filled with paintings and scrolls. A Golden Sash hangs in
a place of honor.
San De    puts the tea    leaves into the pot, then soaks them with boiling
water.    He pours the    water out, then repeats the process several
times.    His movements    are all very precise and careful ­ it almost
looks    like a martial    art kata.
<b>
</b><b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Legend states that Bodhidharma gave us tea. Once, while
           meditating, Bodhidharma fell asleep, a natural reaction
           we all have to fight against.
San De looks pointedly at Drew, who doesn't meet his eyes.
<b>                 SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>           When he awoke, he was so enraged at his eyelids for
           betraying him, he tore them off and threw them to the
           ground.
                 (beat)
           From those eyelids grew the first tea bush. You see, even
           the leaves look like eyelids.
San De shows Drew a tea leaf.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Impossible.

<b>                    SAN DE
</b>
           Nothing is impossible if your spirit is pure, and your
           will is strong.

The tea is ready, and San De begins to pour for Drew.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           I understand you've been questioning some of the
           teachings of the temple...

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           It's just not the way I was taught...

San De keeps pouring into Drew's cup. It is getting to the rim. San
De is not stopping.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Master! Stop! No more will go in!

San De continues pouring until the tea runs all over the table.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Exactly! You are like this cup, full of what you have
           learned. How can we show you Shaolin unless you first
           empty your cup?
He picks up the cup and tosses the tea through an open window. He now
pours into the empty cup.
<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>           The rules and disciplines of the temple exist to free
           you, not restrict you. They keep your mind from harmful

Drew nods and sips at his tea.
<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ONE OF THE INSTRUCTORS TEACHING A SOFT STYLE OF
</b><b>SHAOLIN WU SHU.
</b>His body moves with the wind, bending and swaying. Another monk is
attacking him with a hard style, and the soft style is very
effective.
Drew and Li try it, and Drew is having a lot of trouble. He is used
to training hard style, and the soft style seems too weak for him.
D.S. comes over.

<b>                       DREW
</b>
           It's not fighting ­ I feel like I'm dancing or
           something... This soft stuff is unnatural ­ Fighting
           should be hard, tough...

The D.S. holds out his hand, in a tight fist.

<b>                       D.S.
</b>
           If my hand was always like this, what would you call it?

           Deformed.

He opens his hand, letting it go limp.

<b>                       D.S.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)

Li.

</b>As soon as they are out, the serious faces break into smiles, and
they are teenagers again. Some of the disciples run off to join
relatives waiting for them in the courtyard, while a group of them
stick together.
Drew is walking with Li, Wu and several others.

<b>ANGLE ON THE GROUP
</b>
As they walk through the small town outside of the temple.

They pass by Ashema's stand, but only the Bau Bau is there.

Drew bows to the Bau Bau, then slips off his hat, rubbing his bald
head for Bau Bau to see. Bau Bau laughs, and the rest of the guys
rush up to Drew, forcing his hat back on his head.

<b>                     LI

<b>                     DREW

He bows to Bau Bau and then they walk off.

They walk through the small town, checking it out.
They walk through the countryside, enjoying their freedom.

Drew has brought a frisbee with him, and they are tossing it around.

a group of kids swinging into the river on a rope. Drew stops to

They all shake their heads.
Drew nods his.
They continue to shake their heads.
Drew starts running towards the kids, stripping off his shirt at the
same time. The others pause for a moment, then follow his lead.
<b>ANGLE ON GROUP

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           It's a stupid rule, Li. But...
He is about to turn away, then spots Ashema as she runs down a path
to the group of girls. He stands up immediately and starts over to
her. He is jogging, at the same time trying to straighten his clothes
and his hat.
Li starts running after Drew. The others follow.

He turns to Ashema, who has now backed off a little bit and is
looking at Drew, a smile on her face, but is pretending that she is
embarrassed. The other girls are gathered around, giggling.

holding their pillows. He shakes his head and then closes the door.

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TWO BODIES FIGHTING, KICKING AND PUNCHING.
</b>
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew and Gao going at it. The other
disciples are paired off as well, but the only real action is here in
this ring.

Drew is getting tagged, hard, while the points he scores are all
relatively controlled. After one particularly powerful shot, Drew
stops.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           I thought this was light contact!

<b>                     GAO
</b>
           Fight, you coward!
Drew stares at Gao, then looks around for the D.S. He is over at the
other side of the training area.
<b>                     DREW
</b>
           You got it.
Before he can move, however, Gao attacks, slamming him full power in
the face. Drew almost falls to the ground, then attacks him and the
battle is joined.
The fighting is fast and furious, and soon the others see what is
happening, and gather around. One of the monks comes over and tries
to break it up, but they continue fighting, wrestling, kicking and
punching.

The D.S. finally gets over to them, and without moving a muscle,
barks ­
<b>
</b><b>                      D.S.
</b>           Stop!
Drew and Gao immediately break apart, breathing heavy and staring
daggers at each other.
<b>                      D.S.
</b>                   (to others)
           Back to work.
He turns and walks off, motioning for Drew and Gao to follow him.
Drew follows immediately, with Gao behind him. Gao shoves him once.
<b>INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, GAO AND SAN DE IN THE SHADOWS OF SAN DE'S
</b><b>ROOM.
</b>
San De is sitting down reading a Buddhist text. With a sigh, he puts
it down. On the wall behind is hanging a Golden Sash.

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           So soon?

                   (beat)

           Tell me what happened.

Drew looks at Gao, and Gao looks at Drew. There is a pause, one that
is very uncomfortable. Finally, Drew speaks.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           It was my fault. I started it.

<b>ANGLE ON GAO
</b>
Surprised at Drew's confession.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Disciple Gao was better than me.
Drew pauses, and Gao is even more surprised at the revelation.
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I lost my temper. He was only defending himself.

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>Who nods his head and looks at Drew.
<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Is this true, Disciple Gao?
Gao looks at Drew, wondering what he should say. Drew looks at him,
nodding for him to say yes.
<b>
</b><b>                      GAO
</b>           Yes. But, I am not completely blameless...
<b>                      SAN DE
</b>           I didn't think you were...
                    (beat)
           The Shaolin martial tradition is built on challenges. We
           challenge ourselves, but we do not fight with each other.
           Never do we fight to see who is best ­ we train to be
           able to right wrongs, not to let our hands and feet
           express emotions run wild. A Shaolin never throws a punch
           or kick in anger.
                    (beat)
           Shake hands and let your emotions go.

Gao looks at Drew, knowing that the anger is already long gone, swept
away in the shock of Drew taking the blame.

They shake hands.

Both Drew and Gao notice the Golden Sash hanging on the wall. It is
occupying a place of honor.

<b>                      SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           That is the Golden Sash, the highest honor of the temple.
           It is awarded to the monk who has attained the pinnacle
           of understanding.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           The best fighter?

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Among other things. Fighting is only a small part of
           being a Shaolin monk.
<b>                      GAO
</b>
           Yours?
San De nods.
<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Return to your training.
Drew and Gao get up, bow to San De and head for the door.
They get to the door at the same time, however, and for a moment they
jockey for position, trying to be the first one through the door.

Finally, Drew tires of the game and opens the door for Gao.
<b>                      DREW
</b><b>
</b>              Ten more seconds and I would have kicked your ass...
Gao smiles and walks through the door. Just as he passes Drew, he
punches him in the stomach.
<b>                          GAO
</b>              In your dreams...
<b>INT. DORM ROOM ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES GETTING READY TO GO OUT.
</b>They are dressed in "street" clothes and are just pulling on their
hats. Drew, instead of wearing his temple-issue hat, pulls on a New
York Yankees baseball cap!
<b>                          DREW
</b>              Now, we're ready!

He leads them towards the window of their dorm, but stops when he
gets there. He turns to where Gao is standing, all alone.

<b>                          DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
              Gao, you coming or what?

There is a moment of indecision, then Gao frowns, shakes his head and
comes jogging towards them.

<b>                          GAO
</b>
              I'm coming, just to keep you out of trouble!

<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME NIGHT
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF EMPTY COURTYARD BATHED IN MOONLIGHT.
</b>
Suddenly, a figure lands on the ground with a PUFF of dust.

In a crouch, Drew scans the area, then motions for the others to jump
down.

Immediately, other figures land with PUFFs of dust all around him. As
soon as they have all landed, they move off.

<b>ANGLE ON GROUP
</b>As they    sneak    through the courtyards and training areas of the
temple.    They    are about halfway across from the front door of the
temple    when a    monk comes walking towards them. He is weaving and
bobbing    ­ he    looks drunk.

Drew shoots Li and Gao a questioning look. Drunk? In the temple?
They take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk
makes his way past, weaving and throwing kicks and punches. It is a
tense moment as the monk comes uncomfortably close to where Drew and
Gao are standing, but he walks on.

<b>                          GAO
</b><b>
</b>                 (whisper)
           Drunken Kung Fu...
Drew nods and leads them out of the temple.
<b>EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP AS THEY HEAD DOWN THE DARK STREETS OF THE
</b><b>TOWN. EUPHORIA STRIKES, AND THEY ARE HAVING FUN (AD LIBS HERE) JUST
</b><b>BEING FREE AND A.W.O.L.
</b><b>EXT. GIRL'S SCHOOL ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF FRONT OF GIRL'S SCHOOL.
</b>It is the same school where Drew first met Ashema. The guys, still
happy, arrive at the school, and the realization of what they are
about to do sinks in.

They stop talking and are staring at the building. Drew starts toward
the door, and nobody follows his lead. He stops and motions for them
to join him. Nobody moves.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Are we men or are we sheep?

A beat, then the entire group bellows:

<b>                    GROUP
</b>
<b>           SHEEP!
</b>
And they follow Drew, the shepherd, in through the front door, making
noises like sheep.

<b>INT. PARTY ROOM ­ SAME NIGHT
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARTY.
</b>
It isn't happening. The boys are on one side, the girls are on the
other. The music is bad Chinese rock and roll.

The only ones together are Drew and Ashema, who are talking in the
center of the room. The disciples are all clustered together, staring
at the walls and the ceiling. A group of giggle girls are standing
around Drew and Ashema.
A group of toughs are standing at one side of the party room,
observing everything that's going on.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND ASHEMA
</b><b>                    DREW
</b>           Great party...

Ashema smiles a sheepish smile. Drew decides that if they are going
to have a good time, he's going to have a hand in it. He pulls out a
cassette tape, gives it to Ashema
<b>
</b><b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Play this when I signal, OK?
She nods and walks off. Drew motions for Gao and the guys to come
over. They do, and when they do, Drew turns to the giggle girls
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Ladies, allow me to introduce my best friends in all of
           China...
He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls.
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           This is Gao. And this wild man is Li...
Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing
them to stand with the girls for a moment. When everyone is paired
off, he motions to Ashema.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           Hit it!

INSERT of Ashema's finger on the tape player "PLAY" button.

<b>ANGLE ON THE ROOM
</b>
As the song the disciples have been singing in the fields blasts out.
Immediately, the disciples start moving with the music, and suddenly
the

Party is happening.

<b>                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON DISCIPLES
</b>
Who are now slow dancing to a romantic melody ­ some holding the
girls closer than others. Drew and Ashema are locked in an embrace,
their eyes closed.

A hand comes in and taps Drew on the shoulder.
<b>                      DREW
</b>                    (eyes still closed)
           Not now, Li...
The hand comes in again, punching Drew in the shoulder hard.

Drew opens his eyes, and sees that he is surrounded by five tough
guys, dressed in dark clothes and with sunglasses on.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           What can I do for you?
<b>                      TOUGH
</b><b>
</b>           Leave.
<b>ANGLE ON DISCIPLES.
</b>They have noticed what is going on.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b><b>                      DREW
</b>           No, thanks.
He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls,
away from danger.
The tough spins Drew around and pushes him HARD. One of the toughs
has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping
over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of
him.

Drew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           Can't we talk this over?

The tough pulls his fist back to strike Drew, who has been grabbed by
two other toughs, his arms pinned behind his back.

Suddenly, a figure FLIES in and SLAMS the tough to the ground.

It is Gao, and he immediately sets on the other toughs. The room
ERUPTS in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs.

The girls are SCREAMING as the boys kick and punch.

The disciples are winning, having a great time, until the door to the
room SLAMS open and the HEADMISTRESS comes storming in, screaming at
the top of her lungs for them to stop.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND THE DISCIPLES
</b>
As they all agree as one to hightail out of there. They go running
past the Headmistress and out the door, full speed.

<b>EXT. GIRLS SCHOOL ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES SPRINTING THROUGH THE DARKNESS.
</b><b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME NIGHT
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES
</b>As they climb back into the dorm room.
<b>INT. DORM ROOM ­ SAME NIGHT
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT AS THE LAST DISCIPLE CLIMBS THROUGH THE WINDOW ­ IT
</b><b>IS DREW.
</b>He lands on the hardwood floor, panting his lungs out after the run.
After a BEAT, he lifts his head and looks right at Gao.
<b>
</b><b>                      DREW
</b>              Did you say you were going to keep us OUT of trouble?
The group pauses for a BEAT, then they all laugh, relaxing.
<b>INT. DINNER ROOM ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO CARRYING A PLATE OF CHINESE FOOD OVER TO A
</b><b>TABLE WHERE THE DISCIPLES EATING, THEIR EYES SCANNING THE ROOM FOR
</b><b>SIGNS OF WARNING.
</b>Gao sits down and looks around. They are all dressed in their
training clothes, dirtied after a full day of training.
<b>                      GAO
</b>              I can't believe nobody's said anything! It's been a whole
              day!

<b>                      LI
</b>
              We broke every major rule the temple has, how could we
              get away with it?

<b>                      DREW
</b>
              I think we might have. If they knew, they'd have already
              gotten us! You guys just have to stop looking so guilty.

<b>ANGLE ON WU
</b>
Who pushes his dinner away from him.

<b>                      WU
</b>
              I've lost my appetite.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
              Let's go back to the dorm for a few minutes, go over our
              stories in case they seperate us...

He gets up to leave, and the others follow him.
<b>                      LI
</b>
              Seperate us?
<b>EXT. COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>IN THE COURTYARD ARE SEVERAL POLICEMEN, WAITING AROUND.
</b>Drew and the others spot the cops, and walk quickly to their dorm
room.
<b>INT. DORM ROOM ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>DREW AND THE OTHERS ARE FRANTIC.
</b>
<b>                      DREW
</b><b>
</b>           Cops! Somebody called the cops?!?
Before anyone can answer, the door opens and the D.S. walks into the
room, his face serious.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Drew! Come with me to San De's chamber...
He turns to go, but the others are on their feet, ready to follow
Drew.
<b>                     D.S.
</b>           Just Drew.
Drew looks at them and shrugs, then follows the D.S.
<b>INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ EVENING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE AND THE GIRLS SCHOOL HEADMISTRESS.
</b>
Also in the room are two high-ranking police officials. The
Headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs, and San De is just
sitting there, letting her vent. She has obviously been going at it
for some time, because her face is sweaty and flushed. She stops when
Drew and the D.S. enter and points an accusing finger at Drew.

<b>                     HEADMISTRESS
</b>
           He's the one!

<b>                     SAN DE
</b>
           Drew, I think you know Headmistress Low. Correct?

Drew can only nod.

<b>                     SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           The police have also come. A morals violation is what
           brought them...

Drew's head snaps up at the words "morals charge"
<b>                     POLICE LIEUTENANT
</b>           We demand that he leaves the temple, and China!
<b>                     POLICE CAPTAIN
</b>           He's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. He
           must leave.
They all agree that Drew should leave, and for a moment the sound of
the three of them agreeing fills the room (ad libs).
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who is staring down into the abyss.
<b>                     SAN DE
</b><b>
</b>           This is a serious issue, there is no question. This we
           will have to take under advisement ­ but we will handle
           matters of this temple.
<b>                    POLICE CAPTAIN
</b>           This involves more than just the temple. I am authorized
           to escort him from your temple to the jail now, tonight,
           where he will be held until he leaves the country.
San De pauses, letting this sink in. The D.S. steps forward.
<b>                    D.S.
</b>           Master, may I?
                 (San De nods)
           We accepted a challenge when this disciple came into our
           ranks. If we force him to leave China, we admit failure.
           Can we do that?

The police don't have an easy answer to that.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who is surprised that the d.s. is sticking up for him.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           You are wise. You know what is right and what is not
           right. This disciple does not even know right from wrong.
           Who will teach him if we do not?

This sinks in, and the police have nothing to say. The Headmistress
will not keep quiet, however.

<b>                    HEADMISTRESS
</b>
           He does not belong here!

<b>                    DREW
</b>
                 (whisper)
           Chill out, honey!
Drew catches a hard look from the D.S.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>           Would you be so hard hearted as to turn him away from
           that which he so desperately needs?
She is about to speak, but thinks better of it.
San De stands up, signalling that the meeting is over.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Thank you all for coming. I am pleased that you brought
           this problem to our attention. May you sleep well tonight
<b>
</b>           knowing that the situation has been swiftly resolved.
<b>                      POLICE CAPTAIN
</b>           I do not wish to visit you again with this kind of news.
<b>                      SAN DE
</b>           You will not have to.
The Headmistress starts to say something, but San De holds up his
hand, stopping her. He leads them out, then closes the door and comes
back to face Drew.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           Master, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I appreciate you
           both going to bat like that for me. I won't let it happen
           again.

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           Neither will we. You must leave the temple in the
           morning.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           But I thought... the police...

<b>                      D.S.
</b>
           You do not deserve to leave the country as a criminal,
           but you cannot stay.

Drew sits for a moment, looking back and forth between San De and the
D.S. His eyes are filling with tears, and he wipes at them.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           I'm sorry, Master.

<b>                      SAN DE
</b>
           As am I.
Drew gets up and walks out of the chamber.

They are shocked.

<b>
</b>Drew shrugs and goes over to his bed, lying down with a sigh.
<b>                     LI
</b>           The D.S. always told us that we're all responsible for

<b>INT. DORM ROOM ­ MORNING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WAKING UP TO AN EMPTY ROOM.
</b>
Everyone is gone already, their beds made up. Drew gets up quickly
and gathers up his few things. He puts on his New

York Yankees cap and shoulders his back pack, then looks around the
room one last time.

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           I hate long goodbyes anyway...

He exits the room.

<b>EXT. SHAOLIN COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Walking through the courtyard, for the last time. Only a few monks
are around, and they don't meet Drew's eyes.
The sounds of training can be heard O.S. Drew stops to listen to
those sounds for a moment, then heads for the door.
<b>EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As he leaves the temple. He pauses for a moment with the door open,
then shuts it sadly. He looks out over the courtyard, which is
completely deserted. Drew sighs, hitches his backpack onto his back
and starts out.
As he comes out of the doorway and into the courtyard proper, he
sees...
<b>THE ENTIRE CLASS OF DISCIPLES
</b><b>
</b>Dressed in street clothes with their bags packed. Li and Gao are in
the front, their bags in their hands, smiling.
<b>                    GAO

<b>                    DREW
</b>                 (smiling)
           I'm with you!
A cheer goes up from the entire group as Drew, Li and Gao embrace. In
the b.g. can be seen the D.S., who is observing all this.

The door opens and Drew walks in, the D.S. can be seen in the b.g.
San De indicates one of the chairs for him to sit in. He does.

<b>                    SAN DE
</b>
           Quite a show of solidarity, yes?

Drew nods, trying to hide a smile. He is trying his best to appear
humble.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           Why did you come to the Shaolin Temple?

</b>
                 (caught off guard)

           To train, Master.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           Yet you rebel at every rule, and blame the training for
           your inability to learn and progress?
No response from Drew, who is just looking down at the ground.
<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           You are like someone swimming in fresh water crying "I
           thirst!". What you seek is all around you. Don't fight
           with the ways of the temple, the battle is within
           yourself.

<b>                    SAN DE

           Life without committment is no life at all.

<b>                    SAN DE

           itself. If you go through your days here, squeezing every
           last bit of life out of every minute, you need not fear
           failure.
<b>                    DREW

           Then, it's up to me.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

           Yes. Your fellow disciples stood up for you. It's your

<b>                    DREW

           I don't want to let them down.

<b>                    SAN DE

He bows to San De and then leaves the chamber.

<b>DREW COMES OUT, FINDING GAO AND LI WAITING FOR HIM.
</b>
<b>                    GAO

Drew waits for a moment, studying their hopeful faces.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           Yeah, I'm staying. If only to keep you guys out of
           trouble!
They walk off, and just as they round a corner, a BANG is heard as
one of the monks drops the heavy wooden lid of a storage barrell.
Drew jumps, spinning around in the direction of the sound.
<b>                    LI
</b>
           Drew! Are you allright?
<b>                    DREW
</b><b>
</b>           Yeah, I'm just a little on edge, that's all. Ever since I

           stick ­ at night, in the toilet... anywhere! It's driving
           me crazy...
Gao and Li look at each other, nodding.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           What? Honest, it's happening! I...
<b>                    GAO
</b>           Every class of disciples, the one with the most potential

<b>                    DREW

</b>
In the b.g. comes Drew, dressed in his monastic robes, no hat on his
head. He is making no attempt to hide the fact that he is a monk.

Drew walks up to Ashema and takes her hand, and they stand like that
for a moment. She then turns to him, and starts to say something.
Drew stops her with a finger on her lips, then strokes her cheek.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Ashema, beautiful Ashema, I can't see you anymore. I
           will... miss you and remember you... always.

Ashema closes her eyes against the tears there, and buries her head
against Drew's shoulder.

<b>                    ASHEMA
</b>           Are they making you do this?
She wants to hear that they are, even if it's not true. She NEEDS to
hear it.

Drew pulls her head away from his shoulder, looking into her eyes. It
would be so easy not to take the blame for hurting her like this.

<b>                    DREW
</b>           No. It is my choice, and my responsibility. I'm sorry...
He embraces her for the last time, and she openly begins to cry. He
holds her for a moment, then breaks the embrace and with one last
long look at Ashema, walks away.

tries an especially difficult sequence of moves, and    falls with a
THUMP to the ground. Immediately, he is back up and    onto the poles.
He tries the same set of moves, falls again. Instead    of being angry,
Drew just laughs at himself, then climbs back up on    the poles.

He fills them up, and then starts moving back towards the temple, his
arms up and strong.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
As he goes through a thicket of bamboo. as he gets to the center, he
is attacked! The staff comes out, but Drew manages to block it with
one of the buckets. The staff strikes again, and Drew blocks again! A
third time, and Drew raises both buckets over his head to block it ­
and drenches himself with the water. Then, the staff hits him in the
stomach.

His attacker has vanished, leaving Drew alternately moaning from the
pain, and chuckling at himself in the bamboo.
<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND LI
</b>As they go through a very intricate, beautifully staged series of
techniques. The last technique is a very powerful kick, and one which
Drew is to block using the blocking technique he refused to learn
before.

This time, the kick is thrown and Drew blocks it with the new
technique, sending Li pitching to the ground is a cloud of dust.

Drew turns around and high-fives Gao.

laughter.
<b>EXT. TEMPLE ­ DAY
</b><b>TIGHT SHOT OF D.S.' ARM
</b>Gao's hands are around his elbow, pulling down.
<b>                    D.S.
</b>           Using your muscles, bend my arm.
Gao pulls down, while the D.S. tries to fight back with his muscles,
but finally, after great strain, his arm bends. A cheer goes up from
the group.
D.S. smiles and motions for an old monk standing near him to take his
place. the old man puts his arm up on Gao's shoulder, and takes a
deep breath. He does not tense up his arm and shoulder.

Gao looks questioning at the D.S.

<b>                    GAO
</b>
           What if I hurt him?

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           You will not.

Gao starts to pull down, gently at first, but when he sees that the
old monk's arm is not bending, stronger, until finally he is putting
all his strength into it. The old monk's arm has not moved, and his
expression of relaxation and piece has not changed.

Gao quits, not able to bend the arm. D.S. motions for Drew to get on
the other side of the monk.

<b>                    D.S.
</b>
           Grab his arms and try to pull him out of his stance.
Drew and Gao shrug at each other and take an arm. They pull and push,
straining and groaning, but there is no movement from the old monk.
It is like he is a heavy stone.
They give up, and the D.S. bows to the old monk.
<b>                    D.S. (CONT'D)

</b>Drew is on the ground, trying to do a kip. He is coming up, but then
is crashing back down onto his spine. The D.S. comes up to him and
points at his chest.
<b>                       D.S.
</b>           Try to hit me here with your feet.
<b>                       DREW

He carries them out to the garbage area, and begins to scrape them
off. From out of nowhere comes the staff, swinging for Drew.

Drew doesn't jump, but just calmly avoids it. The staff WHOOSHES over
his head. Drew stands up, and the staff comes again, from a different
direction. Drew avoids, and the staff finds empty air again.

Drew goes on with cleaning the plates, a slight smile on his face.
After a BEAT, he looks around, trying to find the attacker. When he
is sure no one is around, he smiles bigger.
<b>                       DREW
</b>
           Allright! I did it!
As soon as he finishes saying that, the staff comes out and SLAMS him

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES WORKING ON THE UNBENDABLE ARM.
</b>
Drew is in the middle, and Gao is straining to bend his relaxed arm.
He is getting the hang of it.

The D.S. walks up with another monk with    a spear. Together, they
position a wooden target. The monk bows    to D.S. and to the rest of
the disciples, then positions the point    of the spear in the hollow of
his neck. He then hands the shaft of the    spear to the D.S.

The D.S. holds the shaft and starts to push, bending the spear,
slowly but surely.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES
</b>Amazed.

<b>ANGLE ON THE MONK
</b>The spear is now almost bent double.
With a flick of his head, the spear goes flying into the target
positioned behind him, its point finding the bulls-eye.

Drew walks over to the target and sees that the very real spear point
is imbedded deep into the wood of the target.

<b>                      DREW

</b><b>EXT. TEMPLE GROUNDS ­ DAY 120 (SPRING TIME)
</b><b>TIGHT SHOT OF AMERICAN FOOTBALL SPINNING THROUGH THE AIR.
</b>Set against a deep blue sky, it could be spinning anywhere ­ but the
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Shaolin Temple "forest of stupa",
where the disciples are having a pick up football game ­ it's Sunday,
the disciples' afternoon off. The football spins into the hands of
Gao, who drops it.
Drew runs over, showing Gao how to catch the ball, and how to make
the cuts he has to make (no dialogue, music over).
Gao follows Drew's instructions, then they run the play. This time
Gao is all alone and he catches the ball easily for a touchdown.
Drew runs up and high-fives Gao, then teaches him how to spike the
ball.
They are playing some more, having a great time. This time Drew goes
out for a pass, with Gao playing defense. Li throws the pass, and Gao
intercepts. Drew, laughing, goes after Gao.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who goes long for a pass, which Gao lets fly.

It is immediately obvious that it is way too long.

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE

Who is walking along through the stupa, meditating as he walks.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who stops running and sees san de. the ball is going towards San De.

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>
The ball is heading right for his HEAD!

<b>ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND OTHERS
</b>
They are bracing for the impact, and the trouble it will cause.
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>Who at the last moment turns and catches the ball like a professional
receiver. He holds the ball and looks right at Drew, a very stern
look on his face.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Expecting the worst.
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>His stern face now taking on a mischevious look. He hefts the ball
and puts his fingers on the laces.

<b>                       SAN DE
</b><b>
</b>           Go long.
Drew pauses for a moment, not sure    what San De said, until San De
motions with his left hand, like a    NFL quarterback, for Drew to go
out. He takes off sprinting, with    Gao covering him like a blanket.
San De throws the ball to him in a    perfect spiral, to a spot where
Gao has no play on the throw, and    Drew catches it in stride.
San De immediately returns to his meditation, while Drew and the
others stand around dumbstruck.
<b>EXT. COUNTRYSIDE ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO, LI AND DREW RUNNING THROUGH THE
</b><b>COUNTRYSIDE.
</b>They come to a stream, and there by a stream is a beautiful young
woman who can't get across the stream without getting her clothes
soaked.

Without thinking twice, Drew allows her to get on his back and
carries her across the river. He deposits her on the other side and
then continues running.

Gao and Li run up next to Drew, and together they go back to the
temple. When they stop outside the temple, they are breathing
heavily. finally catching his breath, Gao turns to Drew.

<b>                       GAO
</b>
           I can't believe you carried that girl over the stream!
           After all the trouble you got into...

<b>                       LI
</b>
           Are you crazy? You almost got kicked out once over that
           kind of thing...

Drew smiles slightly.

<b>                       DREW
</b>
           I left that girl at the stream. Are you two still
           carrying her?
He turns and walks away, leaving Li and Gao to puzzle that one out.
As he walks away, San De comes out from behind a pillar where he had
been sweeping, smiling and nodding his head at Drew's answer.

<b>EXT. TRAINING AREA ­ DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING GROUND, WHERE SEVERAL GROUPS OF
</b><b>DISCIPLES ARE GOING AT IT.
</b>The action is fast and furious.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND GAO
</b>Who are squared    off and fighting. They are intense, and the
techniques they    are throwing are full power. Drew hits Gao, and he
bends over. Drew    closes, thinking that he has Gao at his mercy. At
the last minute,    Gao stands up and cold cocks Drew, who sags to the
<b>
</b>ground.
<b>TIGHT ON DREW
</b>Who is trying to get his bearings.
<b>                      DREW

           That's it! You're dead meat!

He comes at Gao, and they start fighting again, throwing all kinds of
acrobatic kicks and techniques.

A gong sounds, O.S., and Gao and Drew stop, bow to each other, and
then embrace, smiling.

<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)

Drew moves off to the side to get a drink of water, and to towel off.
As he rubs his neck, D.S. comes up to him.

<b>                      D.S.
</b>           San De wants to see you, in his chambers.

Drew raises his eyebrows, then looks over at Gao and Li. He rolls up
his towel and snaps Gao with it as he walks by.

San De takes out a map of the area.
<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)

</b>He goes over to a drink stand, and buys a cool drink. Just as he is
about to drink it down, it is KNOCKED from his hand.
Drew turns around and see four dirty thugs and their leader ­ the one
who hit the glass. They are yelling at Drew in Chinese, which he
doesn't understand.
<b>                    DREW
</b>
           OK, boys, just let me get my glass and...
Drew, not looking for trouble, bends down to pick up the glass, and
the leader kicks him in the rear end, sending him pitching to the
<b>
</b>ground. Drew rolls to a standing position, and the five men close on
him.
A crowd is now starting to form, eager to watch how the monk handles
this situation.
The thugs come after Drew, and the leader throws a roundhouse punch,
hitting Drew square in the jaw. They continue to attack, while Drew
tries to avoid getting hit. Drew catches a haymaker, and he spins and
drops, and the thugs laugh, kick him a couple of times, and then kick
dust and dirt onto him. Drew doesn't get up.
They soon tire of the sport and move on, the crowd staring at Drew in
pity.
<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)

<b>ANGLE ON THE THUGS
</b>
Who have now spotted a man and his young son. They are both loaded
down with goods from the store, and the thugs stop them. They take
the things from them, and start to walk off.

The father tries to fight back, but they easily beat him up, sending
him into the dirt. The young boy runs forward. The leader of the
thugs raises his hand, ready to slap the boy's face.

Before he can bring his arm forward, Drew's fingers come around his
wrist, stopping it.

<b>                       DREW (CONT'D)

              Oh, I don't think so...

<b>ANGLE ON THE CROWD
</b>
It's getting good now.
The fight    starts, and this    time Drew is unencumbered by    vows of non-
violence.    He has a cause,    and he's enjoying every minute    of the
fight. It    is over quickly,    as Drew is a superb fighter,    using
incredible    techniques. The    thugs limp away, leaving Drew    with the
little boy    and his father.

Drew bends down and picks up the goods, handing them back to the boy
and the father. Drew stops and kneels down in front of the boy,
looking deep into his eyes.
A whisper is going through the crowd: "Shaolin".
Drew touches the boy's cheek, smiles, then stands up and bows. He
moves on, the crowd watching him walk away.

</b>It is dark around him, with vague forms of the temple columns and
statues. Drew is sitting with his eyes closed, oblivious to his
surroundings.
<b>EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE ­ NEXT DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WORKING OUT NEXT TO A MOUNTAIN LAKE.
</b>
He is throwing kicks and going through his routines, concentrating on
his breathing. As he finishes a particularly strenuous series, he
strips off his clothes and dives into the lake.

As Drew's head breaks the surface of the lake, he is surprised to see
a beautiful woman standing next to where he left his clothes.

Drew starts to get out of the lake, then remembers that he is naked ­
he stops, not quite knowing what to do. He goes as close to the shore
as he can without coming out of the water.

The woman just smiles, and starts to strip off what clothing she has
on. She is very sexy.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           No, don't do that!

<b>                      WOMAN
</b>           Why not?

<b>                      DREW
</b>           I'm a monk. I've taken a vow to abstain...
<b>                      WOMAN
</b>
           No one will know...
<b>                      DREW
</b>           I'll know! Throw me my clothes, please.
Pouting, the woman takes Drew's pants and tosses them to him, but
they land (purposely) about 5 feet away from the lake edge.
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b><b>
</b>           Nice throw...
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who realizes he is going to have to get out of the water without a
cover. He gets up and hurries to where his pants are. He starts to
put them on, and the woman is all over him, trying to seduce him.
He takes her hands in his and forces her to look him in the eye.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Despite the fact that this is every teenage boy's dream
           come true, I can't!
He lowers her hands, and her head drops, pouting.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Besides, if I were to break my vows, it would not be with
           you.

He kisses her on the forehead, and then grabs the rest of his
clothes, running up the path away from the lake.

<b>EXT. TEMPLE ­ SAME DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF VERY ORNATE TEMPLE.
</b>
Drew walks up to the front of the temple, looks around for a moment,
then takes a drink of water from the well out front.

Just as he starts to drink, a huge TOUR BUS pulls up in front, air
brakes HISSING. Before he can react, the doors open and a bunch of
AMERICAN TOURISTS pile out of the bus and rush into the temple,
jostling Drew from side to side.

<b>                    TOURIST 1
</b>
           Not another temple!

<b>                    TOURIST 2
</b>           Do they have a gift shop?

<b>                    TOURIST 3
</b>           Guide! How do you say 'gift shop'?
<b>                    GUIDE
</b>
           You have 10 minutes to be back on the bus.
The wave of tourists passes Drew, and he stands there looking after
them. Then, as a group, they realize that they just passes a monk,
and turn back to Drew.
<b>                    TOURIST 1
</b>           A real live monk! Somebody, take my picture!

The tourist runs up to where Drew is and stands next to him. The
cameras click and whirr, and Drew is thoroughly embarrassed. When the
<b>
</b>first pictures are over, and someone else wants to stand next to him,
he raises his hands up to his face and bows.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           Oh Mi Two Fwo
He then turns and walks away.
<b>                    GUIDE (O.S.)
</b>           Monks don't like to be bothered, they are from a
           different world.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           I'll say...
<b>EXT. WATERFALL ­ EARLY MORNING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THUNDERING WATERFALL.
</b>
Drew stands at the side of the waterfall, studying his map. From his
expression, we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get
where he is going.

Drew pockets the map, checks that the box is safely in place, then
starts toward the waterfall. The drop off the side of the waterfall
is incedible ­ steep and deadly.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
As he enters the waterfall. The water hits his back, almost pitching
him into the abyss. Drew concentrates and moves forward, slowly but
surely.

He emerges on the other side, only to be confronted by a swamp.
Jutting out of the swamp are rocks and tree stumps.

Drew examines the distance between the objects, realizing that he can
jump from place to place and make it across.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Just like at the temple...
He starts out, jumping onto the first stone, then moving on to the
others. He almost falls a couple of times, but regains his balance.
He gets a rythm going, and is soon almost halfway across.
He gets to one particular rock, only to find out that it's the head
of an alligator! Its mouth opens to bite him!
Drew jumps off it quickly, onto a tree stump. When he lands on the
stump, he examines it carefully to make sure it isn't something else.
He continues across, more careful this time.

<b>EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW CLIMBING UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.
</b>It is much steeper now, and the going is much tougher.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As he comes up onto a rope bridge over a deep gorge, the way to the
arhat. Drew smiles, stashes the map and starts across the rope
bridge, hand over hand. He looks down once, at the DROP, then forces
himself to look straight ahead.
He just starts across when the rope bends and jumps. Drew turns
around to see a man RIGHT BEHIND HIM.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           Is this rope strong enough for both of us?
No answer from the man, who is now pushing Drew to go faster. He is
inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go
quicker.
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           OK, OK, I'm going!

<b>ANGLE ON THE ROPE BEHIND THEM
</b>
Which is starting to fray from the weight.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who sees that and is hurrying.

The rope is fraying more, and when Drew is almost there, the rope
snaps and they both go swinging into the side of the mountain.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who slams into the wall hard. when he hits, the scroll POPS out of
his pocket and goes up in the air.

Drew, groggy from the impact, manages to lash out and PIN the scroll
to the cliff wall with the BACK of his hand.

<b>ANGLE ON MAN
</b>
Who is barely hanging on, just below Drew.
He has his hand out to Drew for help.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who doesn't know what to do. If he tries to save the scroll, the man
might fall. If he goes for the man, the box will certainly fall.

<b>ANGLE ON THE MAN
</b>Screaming for help.
<b>                      DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Hold on...
Drew hears the headmaster's voice.
<b>
</b><b>                    SAN DE (O.S.)
</b>           The scroll that is in this box is more precious than
           life. Guard it well.
He looks down at the man, who is about to lose it.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           What the heck...
Drew reaches down for the man's hand, letting the box fall.
Their hands meet, and Drew pulls him up.
<b>ANGLE ON BOX
</b>As it spins down into the abyss.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW AND MAN
</b>
As Drew pulls him up onto his back, and carries him up the rope to
the other side of the gorge.

They look at each other and smile, but Drew is anything but happy.

<b>                    DREW

           What am I going to tell the arhat?

There is no bounce to his step, and he is dreading this audience.

<b>EXT. ARHAT HUT ­ EVENING
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ARHAT HUT.
</b>
Drew walks up to the entrance, looks around. He doesn't see anyone.
He walks into the hut.
<b>INT. ARHAT HUT ­ EVENING
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF HUT AS DREW WALKS INTO THE HUT ­ NO ONE IS
</b><b>AROUND.
</b>He walks through the rooms, looking at all the books and scrolls
littered around the room.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           Maybe he won't miss one little scroll...
He shakes his head and starts for the front door.

<b>EXT. ARHAT HUT ­ SAME EVENING
</b><b>
</b><b>DREW COMES OUT OF THE HUT AND WALKS AROUND TO THE AREA BEHIND THE
</b><b>HUT, HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN.
</b>The view is incredible. Drew stands looking at the view, and slowly
becomes aware of a figure sitting on the ground near him.
He looks down, and it is the ARHAT!
<b>                    DREW
</b>           Master! I apologize, I did not see you.
The Arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll.
Drew bows again, and gets down on his knees.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I failed, Master. A person was in danger...
The Arhat holds up his hand, and Drew stops talking.

<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           Of course, you're right. No excuses...

Drew bows once more and is ready to leave. The Arhat reaches into his
robes and pulls out the embroidered box that Drew was given at the
temple.

<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           You have it? How?

The Arhat holds up the box in front of Drew for a moment, then tears
it in two with his hands, scattering the pieces to the winds.

<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>
           So, I didn't fail, huh?

                 (beat)

           I can ask my question, then?

The Arhat sits without moving or speaking. Drew takes that as a yes.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           What is the meaning of life?

The Arhat ponders that for a moment, then smiles and puts his sandles
on his head and stands up.

<b>                    ARHAT
</b>           What is life? What is reality? The head of a dead cat.
He walks off, leaving Drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer.
<b>                    DREW
</b>                 (smiling ruefully)
<b>
</b>           I just climbed a mountain to ask a loon about the meaning
           of life.
He shakes his head and gets up, following the Arhat. The Arhat is
standing on the other side of his hut, the sandles still on his head.
<b>                      ARHAT
</b>           For forty years, Shaolin disciples have made their quest
           to deliver a scroll to me. You are not Chinese.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           No. American.
<b>                      ARHAT
</b>           I notice the littlest details.
<b>                      DREW
</b>
           How many succeeded?

<b>                      ARHAT
</b>
           A handful. You chose correctly. Nothing is more precious
           than human life.

<b>                      DREW
</b>
           But, I didn't obey.

<b>                      ARHAT
</b>
                 (smiling slightly)

           At the beginning of your training, you were to obey
           without question. Now, as you become a Shaolin, you must
           learn to question everything, and obey yourself.

Drew and the monk bow to each other, the sunset over the mountain in
the b.g.

           the temple.

<b>                      ARHAT
</b>           The bus.
Drew laughs at the crazy reply and starts for the mountain path that
brought him to the hut. The Arhat runs after him, grabs his sleeve
<b>
</b>and pulls him over to a place behind his hut.
<b>DREW'S POV OF A ROAD BEHIND THE ARHAT'S HUT
</b>A road! After all he went through to get there?

The Arhat returns the bow.

He walks off to the hut, while Drew makes his way down to the bus

<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING BACK INTO THE TEMPLE.

He is dirty, weary but triumphant. As he walks back through the
temple to San De's chambers to report, he sees a group of people
walking out the other way.

The group is made up of the thugs who attacked him, the woman by the
lake, and the man from the bridge. They are talking together on their
way out.

building.

<b>FOLLOWING MONTAGE SECTION

Different shots of the monks tearing the building apart with kicks
and punches. Shots of Drew, Gao and Li kicking through walls, through
doors, through windows, etc. Some the three of them destroy together,
others are seperate. Several shots of disciples as they concentrate

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           I warn you all, any monk who fails must leave the temple

San De pauses, letting this remark sink in.

<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           Disciple Drew Carson, as you will return to America, and

Who rises to the challenge.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Master San De, I am part of the disciple class, am I not?

San De nods.

<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)

           Your request is granted.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>In front of the entrance to the Wooden Man Chamber. San De and D.S.
are flanking Drew as he pauses in front of the door. Drew turns to
look at San De, and the D.S. smacks Drew in the back of the head.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b><b>
</b>           What did you do that for?

Drew smiles at the D.S.'s attempt to lighten him up. He turns to look
at the others from his disciple class, then opens the door and goes
through.
<b>INT. WOODEN MAN CHAMBER ­ SAME DAY
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WOODEN MAN CHAMBER.
</b>Drew pauses for a moment,      examining the room. It is filled with
wooden statues of monks,      all in different fighting positions. The
carvings are precise and      incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open
hands, fists and legs are      fashioned out of hard wood, and they look
very dangerous indeed.

Drew gathers himself for a moment, then starts into the chamber.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW'S FOOT
</b>
As it presses down on one of the stones of the floor.

The attacks start ­ from all sides, as the wooden statues COME TO
LIFE, spinning, lunging and striking.

Drew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to
the door of the chamber. The statues stop moving.

Drew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues,
letting his arms practice for the attacks.

There is fear in his eyes.

He starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are
different this time.

Drew is clobbered.

Driven back to the door, Drew slumps against the wall. His face is
already bruised and bleeding.
<b>                       DREW
</b>                    (whispering)

</b>
Including the one where Drew succeeded in evading them.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who gathers himself, straightens up and takes a deep breath, forcing
it out in a breathing exercise.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           I am a Shaolin monk.
He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again.
Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically).
He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him,
making his way across.
He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue
comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly
adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way.

Suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly
spears are streaking towards him. Drew blocks the SPEARS with his
arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him.

They THWOCK into the wall, sticking there.

As he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of
ARROWS comes HURTLING towards him. Drew blocks some, avoids others,
and catches one in each hand. He throws them down and continues on.

He goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the Wooden Man
Chamber. All that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out
the door.

Drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. He goes cautiously,
expecting a trap or a trick.

Nothing happens.

He gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. He spots a
handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand.

Immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling DROPS
right onto his arm, forcing it down. Drew fights back with his
muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck.
Behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a
dervish. Its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly.
The panel drops lower and lower.
<b>FLASHBACK TO UNBENDABLE ARM SEQUENCE
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>As he relaxes his face, and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body,
letting his inner energy take over.
<b>ANGLE ON PANEL
</b>
As it slows with a GRINDING NOISE, then stops.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm, his face and body
completely relaxed.
The panel goes back up into the ceiling, and the door opens.
The whirling statue slows, and then stops altogether. Drew reaches up
with a hook kick and taps it in the face.
<b>                    DREW (CONT'D)
</b>           Not this time.
Drew quickly walks through the door.

There are a few missing from their ranks, monks who did not make it

temple is gathered to watch the ceremony.

San De and D.S. are dressed in elaborate ceremonial robes.

After he goes through some complicated ceremonial movements,
including the waving of smoking incense over them, San De spreads his
hands

<b>                    SAN DE

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE (DREW'S POV)
</b>Who is walking towards the side of the temple, away from the party.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who sees him leave. He excuses himself from his group.
<b>                                                 CUT TO:
</b><b>EXT. BAMBOO GROVE ­ SAME EVENING
</b>
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>
Who is walking in the bamboo grove, his hands behind him. Drew walks
up to him and they bow.

<b>                    SAN DE
</b>
           Congratulations.

<b>                    DREW
</b>
           I wouldn't have made it through without you.

                  (beat)

           You once asked why I came here, why did you let me in?

<b>                    SAN DE
</b>
           Do you remember the story you heard about the monk who
           would not leave?
<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Yes.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           That monk was me.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who digests this. He smiles a little.
<b>                    SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>
           I would like to ask a favor.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           Anything.
<b>
</b><b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Before you leave for American, can you help at an
           international tournament in Beijing? The Shaolin temple
           has an entry, and he will be fighting men from all over
           the world ­ I'd like you to be there.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           No problem.
                 (he smiles)
           Without pause.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           Now, a friend would like to see you.
                 (beat)

           ... alone.

From out of the bamboo grove comes Ashema, her hands in front of her
and her head down. She is not sure Drew wants to see her.

Drew looks at her, then back to San De, but he is already gone. They
are alone.

Drew walks to her, takes her chin in his hand and tilts it up to look
at her face. Her eyes are full of love and tenderness, and a little
fear.

Drew kisses that fear away.

<b>EXT. BEIJING HALL ­ DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF HUGE EXHIBITION HALL. THE MARQUEE READS
</b><b>"INTERNATIONAL WU SHU COMPETITION".
</b>
<b>INT. BEIJING HALL ­ SAME DAY
</b>
<b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF HUGE HALL, THE FLOOR OF WHICH IS CROWDED WITH
</b><b>RINGS.
</b>
One large raised ring is in the middle of the floor ­ the place for
the finals.

<b>ANGLE ON SIDE OF THE RING
</b>Where Li, Gao, San De, D.S. and some others are waiting. They are all
in monastic garb.
Drew and Ashema walk up to them, holding hands. Drew is dressed in a
fighting monk's costume as well, and he bows to his fellow monks.
<b>                    DREW
</b>
           Are we late?
<b>                    SAN DE
</b><b>
</b>           The fight has not yet started.
<b>                       DREW
</b>           Did you think he would get into the finals?
<b>                       SAN DE
</b>           Who could know? He fights the winner of the Western
           countries, which is why I wanted you here.
<b>                       DREW
</b>           I'll help any way I can.
<b>ANGLE ON THE CROWD
</b>As it parts to let someone through. Drew turns casually to look at
the competitor. Slowly, a figure, followed by a large group of
people, comes clear... it is Trevor!

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who is stunned.

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>
Could he have known?

<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>
Who spots drew standing near the ring. He walks past him, trying to
place his face. Then, he comes back and walks right up to Drew and
slaps him on the back.

<b>                       TREVOR
</b>
           Carson! Drew Carson! I can't believe it! I come half way
           around the world, and run into you! I heard you left the
           city, but I didn't know losing to me drove you into being
           a monk!

Drew is dumbstruck, and Trevor takes advantage of it.

<b>                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>                  (to San De)
           He take a vow of silence too? Nice hair, Drew.
                  (he looks at Ashema)
           If he took a vow of chastity too, honey, you see me after
           this fight, 'Kay?
He puts his arm around Ashema and lets his hand slide down onto her
rear end.
<b>                       TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>           Wish me luck, huh?
He walks off, and Drew, who still hasn't said a word, stares after
<b>
</b>him. All of the monks are looking at Drew with questioning looks,
everyone that is except for San De.
<b>ANGLE ON THE RING
</b>As Trevor and the Shaolin entry bow to each other. The fight begins.
It isn't even close. Trevor is better than he ever was. He is
incredible, and he destroys the Shaolin fighter.
Oblivious to the boos and whistles from the crowd, he plays with the
Shaolin fighter, making him look like a real fool.
<b>INTERCUT REACTION SHOTS OF DREW
</b>Who is watching the destruction. Behind his eyes, he is reliving his
humiliation.
<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>
Who finishes the shaolin fighter off with a devestating technique,
and then immediately plays to the crowd, RIGHT IN FRONT OF DREW AND
<b>THE OTHERS.
</b>
The referee comes over to Trevor, and raises his fist up in victory.
Trevor tears his arm away and SCREAMS TO THE CROWD:

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
<b>           I'M NOT DONE!
</b>
The crowd, which before was wild and booing, now grows quiet.

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
           I want HIM!

He points right at Drew.

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
           I want to face the American who is now a Shaolin monk! I
           want to learn at the hands of a master!

The crowd, who has seen Drew and heard about him for quite a while,
warms to the prospect. They start cheering for the American Shaolin
to face Trevor.

<b>                    TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>           I want the American Shaolin!
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>

Who doesn't know what to do. San De appears and puts a comforting
hand on his shoulder.

<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>Pointing and yelling for Drew.
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b><b>
</b>Who climbs the ropes and goes into the ring. The crowd is going
crazy, eager to see the match. Drew, oblivious to the crowd, walks
over to Trevor.
<b>                     DREW
</b>           I came to the Shaolin Temple because of you, Trevor. You
           humiliated me, and I wanted to make sure it could never
           happen again.
<b>                     TREVOR
</b>           So, let's see what you've learned.
<b>                     DREW
</b>                   (shaking his head)
           I've learned that... there's nothing to prove. Beating
           you is no longer important. It was my ego that had to be
           defeated, not you.

<b>                     TREVOR (CONT'D)
</b>
           Bull! You're just chicken!

<b>                     DREW
</b>
           The arts should never be about who is best ­ they are too
           important for that.

He bows to Trevor and starts out of the ring.

<b>ANGLE ON CROWD
</b>
They don't know what's going on.

<b>ANGLE ON LI, GAO AND OTHERS
</b>
They don't know either. They want Drew to fight him.

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.
</b>Who know what is happening and are proud of Drew, prouder than they
have ever been.
<b>                     TREVOR
</b>
           COME BACK HERE! You can't just walk away!
Drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is
standing. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes.
<b>                     SAN DE
</b>
           Do you turn away from him out of fear?
<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>Who is seething.

<b>                     TREVOR
</b><b>
</b>           I thought the Shaolin monks were warriors, not babies!
           Look at him ­ he is too scared to face me!
<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>His face calm.
<b>                    DREW
</b>           No, master. I will not fight for personal glory, or for
           my ego.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           You have learned much.
<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b><b>                    TREVOR
</b>
           The Shaolin monks are PUSSIES! Warrior-monks? Ha!

<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>
Who indicates trevor with a inclination of his head.

<b>                    SAN DE
</b>
           You did the right thing.

<b>ANGLE ON TREVOR
</b>
<b>                    TREVOR
</b>
           How about you, baldy? Or you?

He is pointing at Li and Gao and the others, who are itching to climb
into the ring. Gao goes over to San De, and shoots a questioning look
at Drew.

<b>                    GAO
</b>
           Master, the American is insulting the Temple, and the
           fighting monks.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>                  (looking at drew)

           What should be done?
<b>                    GAO (CONT'D)
</b>           Someone should face him in combat. For the tradition of
           the temple.
San De looks at Drew long and hard.
<b>                    SAN DE
</b>           There are some times when a Shaolin must fight, and some
           people who will not learn until they are taught a lesson.
<b>
</b><b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>Who understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to
smile slowly.
<b>                      SAN DE (CONT'D)
</b>           It's your call.
Drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still
standing, trying to get someone to fight him.
Drew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and
Li and together they high-five.
<b>                      DREW
</b>           For the temple...
Drew climbs into the ring.

The crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as
he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match.
Immediately, his contingent of people start to work on him ­ massage,
drinks, etc.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW
</b>
Who sits alone in the other corner.

<b>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
</b>
Who see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.

<b>ANGLE ON GAO
</b>
Who pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to
give it to Drew.

<b>ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER
</b>
As it is flooded with monks. Some of them are massaging Drew
(painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels
to bring air to him, etc.

The referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do,
and he motions for them to bow to each other.

<b>                      TREVOR
</b>           Remember last time, punk?
<b>                      DREW
</b>           Nothing exists but the moment, and...
                 (beat)

           ... I'm going to enjoy it.
They back up, and the fight begins.
Trevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu.
<b>
</b>He continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy
technique, but he can't touch Drew.
<b>                      TREVOR
</b>           Stay still, dammit! Stand and fight!
And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry.
Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this    quickly. He
goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that    Trevor is
completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,    and soon has
Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of    high kicks,
takedowns, flips and punches.
Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even
bothering to defend himself.
Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his
right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-
fashioned roundhouse punch.

<b>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
</b>
Yelling for the knock out blow.

<b>ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE
</b>
Worried about this latest development.

Instead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his
hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.

Trevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a
thing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.

To teach him a lesson.

Trevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.

The crowd goes crazy.

<b>ANGLE ON LI AND GAO
</b>
Who also get the message.
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.
</b>Who knew the message all along.

<b>WIDE ANGLE OF ENTIRE RING
</b>Drew and Trevor standing together in the center. The monks on the
side climb into the ring to celebrate with Drew.
<b>EXT. GREAT WALL ­ MORNING
</b><b>ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STANDING ON THE GREAT WALL, THE SUNSET OVER
</b><b>HIS SHOULDER.
</b>
He is doing the beginning of a Shaolin form. When he finishes the
salute, a figure comes toward him.
<b>
</b>It is San De, and he has something in his hands.
Drew bows to San De, and San De holds THE GOLDEN SASH out to him.
Drew takes it and San De bows to him. Drew can't stand it anymore,
and rushes up to San De. He gives him a hug.
<b>ANGLE ON SAN DE
</b>Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then
his face softens and he returns Drew's embrace.
They break and bow again, and San De moves off. Drew stands there
holding the Golden Sash, the rising sun of the first day of the rest
of his life shining in the b.g.
<b>ANGLE ON ASHEMA
</b>Who comes up to Drew, taking his arm and walks with him along the
Great Wall.

<b>  FADE OUT
