When a group of college students win a contest to spend the night in the childhood home of brutal serial killer Michael Myers, they expect a few scares but none of them are prepared for what awaits them.
The house has been rigged with cameras as they are to be broadcasted live over the internet to be watched by millions.
As they wander around the house in search of some kind of answer for Michael's murderous actions they find a bigger problem.
Michael has come home and he does not intend to let anyone leave his house alive.
