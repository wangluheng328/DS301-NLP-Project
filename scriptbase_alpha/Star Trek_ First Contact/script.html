                                                               September 29, 1995





<b>               1   A BLACK VOID                                                 1
</b>
                   We can hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like
                   razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses...
                   the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an
                   eerie, alien cacophony.

<b>               2   EARTH                                                        2
</b>
                   appears, hanging now in the starry blackness. The
                   alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear
                   the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion.
                   Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we
                   REVEAL we are in --

<b>               3   INT. BORG RECON CENTER                                       3
</b>
                   The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is
                   only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall.
                   We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the
                   technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre --
                   a mixture of organic and mechanical elements.
                   Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with
                   what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can
                   still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises.
                   Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera,
                   vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is.

                   All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad
                   IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The
                   screens show everything from written Chinese... to
                   Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel
                   footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of
                   space battles from the 24th century. The entire range
                   of human history dancing across the monitors. The
                   effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever
                   is watching this is studying the human race.

                   There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors
                   SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will
                   come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of
                   voices speaking at once :

<b>                                           BORG
</b>                             Restrict search parameters to 1-9-
                             9-8 through 2-0-8-4.

                   The images on the monitors now change to show us images
                   from 21ST CENTURY Earth history.

                   Again, it's a collection of still photography, video
                   footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound-
                   bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of
                   enticing details. As the images race across the
                   monitors, we should learn the following.

                   -- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos.
                   Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations.
                   Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.

                   -- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions,
                   environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The
                   United States ceases to exist. All political authority
                   vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second
                   Dark Age.

                   -- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A
                   visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created
                   out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp
                   test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history.

                   -- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP
                   landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed
                   him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the
                   human race.

                   -- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an
                   alien civilization brings the planet together as never
                   before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning
                   to solve long-standing problems with new technology.
                   We see an early replicator producing food for the
                   starving millions. A new World Government is formed.

                   -- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form
                   an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of 
                   Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for
                   protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet.

                   -- These are images recounting the birth of the Star
                   Trek universe.

                   Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES
                   the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a
                   shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's
                   voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic
                   inflection, speaks for the first time:

<b>                                           WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>                             Stop search. Calculate temporal
                             coordinates. J-Fourteen.

                   Another explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to:

<b>               4   EXT. SPACE - A BORG SPHERE                                   4
</b>
                   A huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser
                   shot from an unseen vessel. The BLAST smashes into the
                   Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The
                   Sphere returns FIRE. FOLLOW the Borg fire to --

<b>               5   A FEDERATION STARSHIP                                        5
</b>
                   locked in battle with the Borg Sphere. The Borg fire
                   DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast.

<b>               6   NEW ANGLE                                                    6
</b>
                   as the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the
                   decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this
                   is just one small part of --

<b>               7   A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE                                       7
</b>
                   involving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged
                   in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships
                   turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement. 
                   It's a spectacular sight.

                   The Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading
                   off in another direction.
<b> 
</b><b>               8   NEW ANGLE                                                    8
</b>
                   In the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking
                   a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking
                   quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it
                   doesn't look like it can take much  more of this.

                   Suddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in
                   from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship,
                   causing massive damage.

<b>               9   THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E                                9
</b>
                   SOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered
                   starship.

                   The Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful
                   vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the
                   last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more
                   muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons

                   The Bridge has been redesigned. A single Captain's
                   chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and
                   stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard
                   instant access to his officers. PICARD in the

                   The Endeavor moves off as the Borg FIRE at the
                   Enterprise and BLASTS the saucer section. This should
                   also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the
                   traditional "bubble" shielding, the new armor of this

                   As Beverly scans it, Picard glances at a nearby desk...

                   board above the desk -- they show Zephram Cochrane and
                   two angles of his warp ship. The photos are odd-
                   looking, printed on what appears to be some sort of
                   cloth.

                   Geordi has found an emergency BOX with several
                   pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled
                   "emergency use only." He pulls down the lever, there
                   is a hissing sound, and the blast door slowly SLIDES
                   DOWN into the floor. We can now see the MISSILE SILO
                   itself beyond the door. Picard, Geordi and Beverly
                   step into...

                   Picard, Geordi and Beverly step onto the catwalk, which
                   surrounds the Silo walls. In the middle is the WARP
                   SHIP itself. It should look like an advanced ICBM
                   missile with a COCKPIT in place of the warhead, and
                   with numerous modifications to the fuselage. The
                   cockpit is on the same level as the control room. On
                   the side of the missile is the name "Phoenix". The
                   missile itself extends down another FOUR STORIES.
                   There are other catwalks below this one, with ladders
                   connecting the different levels. Beverly sees
                   something below.

</b>
                   Two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the
                   grating. They all scramble down the ladders past the
                   massive missile. (NOTE: Because of the design of the
                   Silo, we will see the entire missile only in a few
                   shots. For the most part, our view is limited to
                   sections of the missile.)

                   Beverly reaches the man, who is lying face-down on the
                   metal grating. She scans him...

                   Geordi looks over at the section of the missile on
                   their level. The side panels have been removed,
                   revealing complex circuitry within.

                   Picard joins Beverly, who turns over the injured man.
                   It's ZEPHRAM COCHRANE -- the man whose picture we saw
                   on the Borg monitors. Beverly begins pulling devices
                   out of her medkit, injects Cochrane with a hypospray.
                   Cochrane is a man in his mid-forties. He has a
                   youthful, dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation
                   burns.

                             to take him to the ship.

                   Picard nods, reaches into his pants pocket, takes out
                   a combadge.

                   Picard nods... then takes a deep breath, tries to
                   orient himself to the task at hand... there's a lot at
                   stake and a lot to do. He turns to Geordi.

                   Geordi takes a deep breath, it's a tall order.

                   Geordi goes to work. Picard bends down and carefully
                   hoists Cochrane up into a fireman's carry. Beverly
                   follows him up the catwalk...

                   Crewmembers walking along are suddenly KNOCKED to the
                   floor as hurricane force WINDS blow through the
                   Corridor. The ship is venting air into space, creating
                   a virtual VACUUM inside the ship! The people in the
                   corridor grab onto the bulkheads, struggling to hang on
                   against the force of the wind...

                   Suddenly an emergency AIRLOCK on the Bridge OPENS.
                   VIOLENT WIND roars through the Bridge and everyone
                   hangs on. Troi is ripped out of her chair, flown
                   across the Bridge, slams up against the bulkhead,
                   struggling to hang on. Worf runs over, grabs her arm,
                   keeps her from flying out.

                   Riker manages to reach a control panel -- hits a button
                   and an EMERGENCY BULKHEAD finally slides down over the
                   airlock and the wind DIES DOWN. Everyone takes a beat.

                   His eyes are closed. There's a beat, then his eyes fly
                   open and he looks around.

                   We PULL BACK slightly, revealing Data is lying on some
                   kind of tabletop with metallic clamps and restraints.
                   He tenses his arm and tries to move, but he is unable
                   to break the restraints. About two feet in front of
                   his face is what appears to be a bulkhead. There is a
                   cacophony of strange background NOISE -- scratching,
                   hisses, gurgling liquids, odd alien hums...

                   Suddenly, the table begins to MOVE. It ROTATES, and as
                   it does so we realize that Data has been hanging upside
                   down staring at the floor. It's a disorienting moment
                   as our perspective changes and Data rotates upright.

                   As the table gyrates, we REVEAL the ROOM slowly. And

</b>
                   The Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now
                   been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG.
                   The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical
                   jungle of cybernetic equipment.

                   The Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet
                   technology and materials into the living, bio-
                   mechanical look of the Borg. We see one Borg drone
                   attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate
                   it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of
                   BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console
                   inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower
                   bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED.

                   The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with
                   the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg
                   drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and
                   other conduits connecting them to various equipment...
                   while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying
                   out various modifications to the room. At one point,
                   we see Ensign Porter. He's been completely Borgified.
                   His skin pale, expression blank. No hint of humanity

                   still strapped to the table, which is twisting and
                   rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the
                   room. A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are
                   clustered together in one section of the room, each
                   with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits
                   connected to its face.

                   Through the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and
                   ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre
                   "feeding" or "renewal" is going on. The tubes all seem
                   to lead toward the ceiling.

                   Data is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS
                   into position. A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side
                   of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of
                   optical cabling to it.

                   The Borg ignores him, activates a console... and the
                   cabling connected to Data's head LIGHTS UP with power.
                   They're trying to connect him to the Collective.

                   Data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly...
                   and then suddenly there's a SHOWER of SPARKS from the
                   cabling he's been connected to. The lights on the
                   cable go out. Data has thwarted their attempts.

                   Suddenly a new VOICE is heard echoing through the room -- 
                   a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly:

</b>
                   Resurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people --
                   a rural, Western community that's probably existed for
                   at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of
                   the original ranching community in some of the
                   architecture. But it's also a community of the 21st
                   century.

                   The most striking feature of the town is that it sits
                   in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS, which
                   provide the only source of power for the town. The
                   blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them
                   are little more than simple poles. Some are sleek,
                   fiberglass, futuristic... others have a more cobbled
                   together, make-shift appearance. At the moment, only
                   a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze.

                   Picard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods
                   carrying the stretcher. They exchange a look at the
                   sight of the city and then head toward it...

                   A few minutes later. Picard and Beverly carrying
                   Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
                   end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of
                   post-apocalyptic 21st century life:

                   This is a recognizable American community, but it's
                   definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture,
                   technology -- all have changed over the course of
                   seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used
                   to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted
                   and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER-
                   CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements
                   now useless.

                   At one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT --
                   the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
                   can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The
                   entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later
                   we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the
                   only place where they can grow uncontaminated food.

                   What used to be a McDonald's, or some other
                   recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has
                   been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are
                   fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
                   tongs.

                   The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate
                   in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves,
                   others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of
                   them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --
                   victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental
                   dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion
                   to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic
                   elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as
                   people line up to get their daily rations.

                   A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with
                   curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community
                   that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man
                   dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic
                   weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He
                   stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks
                   off.

                   The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look
                   about them. They're going through something that makes
                   the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience.
                   But there's also a toughness to these people, a
                   resilience and determination to survive in the face of
                   overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and
                   it's on the verge of collapse.

                   A short time later. Cochrane is being lifted onto an
                   operating table. Picard and Beverly step back from the
                   table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over. The
                   doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered,

                   rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard
                   times. The light in the room is provided mostly from
                   the sunlight streaming in through the windows. Light
                   bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital --
                   we get the feeling they have very little power.

                   She's looking directly at Picard for an answer. Picard
                   realizes he has to say something. He looks into her
                   eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of
                   chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just

                   A short time later. Picard walking down the main
                   street back toward the gates. People passing him,
                   taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking
                   ahead. He happens to glance down a side street, then
                   he stops.

                   Looking down the side street. Ruby, the mysterious
                   woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera
                   bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a
                   moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover
                   car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made
                   FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of
                   the car. She continues on her way. Picard is
                   intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is
                   she could be taking a picture of. Just then --

                   Picard turns just in time to catch a small, metal
                   canister with a screw-top.

                   The man who threw it steps into view. It's LIEUTENANT
                   SCRIMM. Scrimm is the head of the town's militia.
                   While not a physically threatening man, there is a
                   quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an
                   intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility.
                   He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always
                   carries a sidearm. Before the war, Scrimm was probably
                   one of the "survivalists" who used to be dismissed as
                   radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came
                   true. At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his
                   friendliest face to Picard.

                   Picard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it.

                   Scrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never
                   leave Picard.

                   Picard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any
                   citizens of the town. Scrimm falls in next to him.

                   Picard steps around him and continues walking down the
                   street. Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him
                   again.

                   He steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but
                   a little bit of a smile fading from his face. Picard
                   realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily.

                   Picard walks around him and heads for the gates.

                   As Worf lands on his feet. The light is dim, no power

                   We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their

                             on this deck. Our tricorders are
                             useless.

                   The team continue to explore Deck 47. It's spooky,
                   eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. They
                   open doors, check room by room, section by section,
                   still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold
                   darkness.

                   The Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall,
                   ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative
                   Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry
                   and machinery of the ship itself. Unlike the rest of
                   the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing
                   through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off
                   an eerie glow.

                   We can also see that some of the machinery has been
                   altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly
                   arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads --
                   there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring,
                   equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has
                   gone on in this area of the ship. Worf steps forward,
                   examines the corridor closely.

                   Worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin
                   picking their way down the Borgified Corridor. It's
                   not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully
                   as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and
                   machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some
                   circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team
                   suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the
                   unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention.

                   Worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue
                   their search. They continue making their way down the
                   spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner...

                   where the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE
                   in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the
                   ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The
                   deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a
                   low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this
                   corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen
                   earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird
                   pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at
                   the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly
                   into the room, but clearly something is going on in
                   there.

                   Worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up
                   positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on
                   Environmental Control.

                   As Work and Riker continue talking, we MOVE TO Ensign
                   Hawk, who is now the last man in the formation,
                   covering the rear. He's shining his phaser-beacon into
                   the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over
                   his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant
                   Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where
                   the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him,
                   throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of
                   darkness.

                              deck into Environmental Control.

                   As Worf speaks, Ensign Hawk turns back, but this time
                   when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something
                   MOVES in the distance -- a shadow. The Ensign freezes,
                   brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his
                   imagination?

                   A tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing
                   happens. On the wall next to his head we see what can
                   only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping
                   out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the
                   Ensign's neck. Just as he begins to sense that
                   something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT
                   around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of
                   circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast
                   we have trouble following it.

                   Worf turns his head at the sound.

                             computers are down, and the fires
                             destroyed half the files...so
                             far, nothing.

                             this... it's like trying to

                   Moments later. Picard and Geordi are looking at the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   headshot of Cochrane and two different angles of the
                   three cloth-printed photographs seen earlier -- the
                   warp ship with people working on it. Picard spreads
                   them out on the desk.

</b>                             Yeah, I looked at these already.

                   Geordi points to a photo of the ship -- a worker is
                   walking in front of the throttle assembly, blocking
                   most of it from view.

</b>                             You can almost see the throttle
                             assembly in this one... but this
                             guy walked in front of it when
                             they took the picture.

                   Picard considers, absently sticks his hand in his
                   jacket pocket. He pulls out the canister of balm
                   Scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table.

                             from a photograph like this... if
                             that man wasn't blocking the view?

                   Geordi thinks it over.

                             get a clear look at the intake

                   It's a while later, and the Borg are making progress.
                   Data is strapped to the table, PANELS open on his HEAD
                   and CHEST. Three Borg drones are working methodically
                   on his inner-circuitry. The jagged voice of the woman
                   cuts in:

<b>                                            WOMAN'S VOICE
</b>                             Your resistance is... illogical.
                             To us, your neural net is simply
                             another piece of technology. We
                             will learn its secrets.

                   Data stares at the murky ceiling.

</b>                             That is a contradiction. The Borg
                             act as a collective consciousness.
                             There are no individuals.

                             Borg.

                   Out of the mist that hugs the top of the room DESCENDS
                   the BORG QUEEN.

                   She is unlike any of the Borg drones we've ever seen --
                   a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out
                   of her body. She has no legs. Her torso is SUSPENDED
                   by a complex rig of CABLES and HYDRAULICS. Her face
                   and upper-torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty-
                   pale white of Borg flesh. Her EYES have a silvery
                   glint to them. Her demeanor is seductive and sensual
                   in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings. She
                   is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and
                   mechanical.

                   With the soft HISS of hydraulics, she LOWERS herself
                   down to where her face is very close to that of Data's.
                   Her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint
                   in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness.

<b> 
</b>                   She stares at him intently, and we get the hint that
                   her interest in Data may go beyond simple assimilation.
                   She seems fascinated by him. Data picks up on this.

</b>                             How do you define perfection?

                   The Queen opens her arms slightly, clearly indicating
                   herself.

                             life in the galaxy.

                   Data eyes her, considering.

                             no organic components.

                   She looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind.
                   She might've just found the chink in Data's armor.

</b>                             That... can change.

                   The Queen looks to the three Borg drones and gives them
                   a silent command. The drones immediately stop working
                   on Data's open panels... and shift their attention to
                   his right ARM. One of the drones tears off the sleeve
                   on Data's uniform, exposing his bare arm. Another then
                   uses a small cutting device to SLICE OFF the synthetic
                   skin from Data's arm. As Data prepares himself for the
                   worst...

                   THREE armored SECURITY GUARDS with phaser rifles run
                   into view, hit a control panel on the wall. A giant
                   EMERGENCY BULKHEAD comes SLAMMING down, cutting off the
                   rest of the corridor.

                   The security guards turn to run down the hall, but then
                   there is a high-pitched shriek of wrenching metal.
                   They drop to the deck and take combat stances.

                   They make adjustments to their weapons just as the
                   bulkhead doors EXPLODE INWARD in a blinding flash. The
                   guards shield themselves against the fire and debris...
                   looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal
                   shapes of the BORG jumping through the smashed
                   bulkhead, racing down the corridor toward them. The
                   guards FIRE, and when they do the PHASER BLASTS
                   alternate color -- red, blue, green, purple, orange --
                   a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency.

                   The phaser blasts TAKE DOWN a few of the BORG... but
                   then we see the distinctive PERSONAL FORCEFIELDS of the
                   other Borg begin to compensate, and the phasers no
                   longer affect them.

                   The mood is tense, grim. Riker, Worf and Troi are
                   gathered around a SCHEMATIC of the ENTERPRISE. The

                   the color RED, representing the Borg advance through

                   Picard walks down the hall, stops outside a door marked
                   "X-RAY PROCESSING." The RED LIGHT is on above the
                   door, but that means nothing to Picard... who opens the
                   door and steps inside...

                   Much like a traditional darkroom, trays of chemicals
                   and washes, etc. But everything has a slightly
                   futuristic and cobbled-together feel. They are
                   developing X-rays by hand instead of by machine. The
                   room is lit with an AMBER glow. As soon as Picard
                   opens the door, we hear Ruby's voice:

</b>                             Shut that door!

                   Picard quickly shuts the door behind him, looks around
                   the room. Ruby, who's working at a tray of chemicals,
                   turns around in fury.

                   She pulls down a small pane of glass (probably from a
                   window) out of a tub of water... holds it up to the
                   light. And there on the glass is a X-RAY of a man's
                   SKULL. Picard moves to her.

                   She glances at him, sees he feels genuinely bad. She
                   softens a little.

                   She picks up a rubber squeegee and carefully starts to
                   dry off the pane of glass.

                             make those prints. Not the best

                   The X-ray is now dry, and Ruby turns and looks at him.

                   Picard doesn't realize she was kidding -- jumps on the
                   opportunity to get the photos.

                             some.

                   Ruby looks at him for a moment -- is he serious? She
                   gives him a curious smile.

                   Worf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing
                   for battle. They're setting up large, heavy-duty
                   phaser equivalents of machine guns --  big, mean-looking
                   weapons on tripods. There are two of these weapons
                   aimed at each entrance to Engineering. The Security
                   Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons,
                   building makeshift barricades over each of the doors.

                   Worf is in command, directing the action.

                             phaser... make certain that the
                             range setting is no more than
                             thirty meters. We don't want to
                             blast through the hull.

                   Worf turns and picks up his BAT'LETH SWORD off a nearby
                   console. He checks the sharpness of the blade.

                   moves off. Worf makes a quick practiced motion with
                   the sword... decides he's ready.

                   closer...right up to the perimeter of Engineering.
                   The dots begin surrounding Engineering -- which looks
                   like it's being swarmed over by a sea of ants.

                   As before. The security guards have taken positions
                   around the room, all weapons trained on the doors.

                   A massive HUM of power fills the room as all of the
                   phaser weapons begin charging. It's tense -- everyone
                   standing ready with their weapons charging. This is
                   the moment of truth.

                   Worf stands ready, phaser in one hand, Bat'leth in the

                   Riker and Troi, as before, watching the schematic of
                   the ship. The DOTS representing Borg have now
                   completely surrounded Engineering on all sides,
                   including the deck directly above and below. In
                   essence, the Borg have cocooned Engineering from the

                   As before. Worf and the security team in their
                   positions, tense. A few beats of silence...then they
                   start to hear soft SCRATCHING coming from somewhere
                   behind the walls -- it sounds like rats skittering
                   through the walls and ceiling of an old house.

                   Everyone stays alert, checks and re-checks their
                   weapons... a couple of hard swallows... then from
                   somewhere up above a LOUD, METALLIC CLANG. Then a
                   large, SCRAPING SOUND that seems to start at one end of
                   the room and travel to the other. There's an
                   overpowering sense of creatures just outside those
                   walls, moving about. It's unnerving, even for crack
                   Starfleet troops.

                   any moment. Worf tightens his grip on his Bat'leth,
                   teeth bared. Unbearable tension and then...

                   The noises begin to FADE AWAY... eventually
                   disappearing all together. If anything, the silence is
                   even scarier. Worf's eyes narrow. He looks around the
                   room, all his senses alert, waiting for the slightest
                   sign of the Borg... but nothing happens.

                   voice... bits and pieces of his life...

                   The theme of the sound bites should be Data's quest for
                   humanity: Picard giving him advice, Troi counseling
                   him, Soong talking to his son, etc. The last line of
                   dialogue we hear is Data saying "I want to be more

                   Data's eyes fly open, now awake. We PULL BACK
                   revealing that Data is still strapped to the Borg
                   operating table... his right arm and shoulder are
                   encased in some kind of strange cybernetic SHELL,
                   obscured from view. Clear tubes run out of the shell
                   into Borg machinery -- liquid is coursing through the
                   tubes. A couple of Borg drones are moving about the
                   room, carrying out various tasks.

                   There's been a change since we've been here last.
                   There are now several Plexiglass CYLINDERS surrounding
                   Data's table -- each of them filled with some kind of
                   murky red fluid, which is swirling around. Every once
                   in awhile, something that looks like RAW FLESH bumps up
                   against the clear Plexiglass, then disappears again.
                   We don't know what these tubes are for, but they're
                   definitely creepy.

                   Data takes all this in, but there is nothing he can do,
                   he's still immobilized.

                   Suddenly the table ROTATES and begins to MOVE up toward
                   the mist and cabling at the top of the ceiling. It
                   stops a few feet away... and Data finds himself face-to-
                   face with the Borg Queen again.

                   A WHOOSH of hydraulic power signals another movement by
                   the Borg Queen. She slithers through the air and down
                   slightly, so that she is on the same level as Data.
                   She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing
                   Data's right arm, which OPENS at her silent command and
                   moves away...

                   We can now see that all of the skin has been removed
                   from Data's right arm, showing the INNER-WORKINGS of
                   his android limb -- circuitry and servos, etc. But on
                   the top of the mechanical forearm there is something
                   new -- a small PATCH of HUMAN FLESH held in place with
                   various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes
                   carrying blood. It's a delicate, fragile piece of
                   organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface.

                   Data looks down at the patch of flesh with a little
                   puzzlement.

                   We are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see

                   A tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the
                   most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. No
                   yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other
                   structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very
                   solitary place. The windows are dark, painted over
                   from the inside.

                   Some large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are
                   sitting off the front porch.

                   After a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft,
                   feeble light.

                   Ruby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size
                   plastic jug. The light from the house now lights the 
                   equipment a little, giving us a better view. There's
                   a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind,
                   with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several
                   stages of filters and tubing in between. Ruby sets the
                   jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a 
                   moment on the edge of the porch. She takes a breath
                   and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back,

                   exhausting day.

                   behind a supporting beam of one the town's many

                   shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt,
                   revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off
                   long ago. She stands up... kicks off her boots...

                   kicks aside the jeans. She's now down to tee-shirt and

                   an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD
                   SYMBOL. She carefully opens the lid... takes a metal
                   pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a
                   pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE. She closes the lid, walks
                   over to the pump-filter contraption. She pours the
                   sludge-like waste into the funnel...primes the pump...
                   makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then

                   After a beat, a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come
                   out of the spigot. Ruby steps back and pulls off the

                   steps behind the girder, stays very still in the
                   shadows... waits quietly as Ruby passes by the windmill
                   without a glance and heads into town. After she's
                   gone, Picard steps out from his hiding place, watches
                   her go, then quickly heads for Ruby's house...

                   Picard opens the front door and goes inside... but he
                   doesn't notice that at the base of the doorjamb a small
                   RED LIGHT starts flashing -- some sort of silent alarm.

</b>
                   Picard ENTERS and closes the door behind him. It's
                   dark. He fumbles around for a light switch... finally
                   locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room.

                   The house has only one room, which functions as a
                   living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. This is also
                   Ruby's DARKROOM. The windows have been painted black,
                   and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-
                   equipment all around. But the most striking feature of
                   the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed
                   PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are
                   hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid-
                   air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of
                   furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced
                   Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --
                   bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of
                   carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment,
                   taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace
                   quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a
                   feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.

                   Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to
                   photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
                   silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at
                   Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about
                   her...

                   She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
                   mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope
                   amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There
                   seems to be a theme running through the photographs --
                   a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.

                   At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes.
                   It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the
                   streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece
                   of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a
                   single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to
                   bloom.

                   Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then
                   pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a
                   box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see
                   PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper. They show a
                   younger Ruby with her parents... Resurrection the way
                   it used to look... Ruby with a dog...

                   Picard pauses, frowns... gets the odd feeling that
                   someone is watching him. He turns around to see...

                   A three foot PHOTOGRAPH OF PICARD is drying in the air
                   behind him.

                   Ruby must've taken the photo when Picard was on the
                   street talking to Scrimm. It was taken through a
                   telephoto lens, a close-up of Picard's face -- he looks
                   focused, determined, heroic. It's a remarkable shot of
                   the Captain, and even Picard is a little taken aback by
                   the image. She's captured the essence of the man.

                   CLICK-CLACK! The sound of a shotgun being cocked.
                   Picard freezes... slowly turns around to see who's
                   there...

                   Picard glances down at the doorway, sees the flashing
                   red light in the doorjamb. He's busted.

                   She perches herself on the arm of a small couch, holds
                   the gun loosely, but never taking the aim away from

                   He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the

                   She SLAPS him hard across the face. Data feels the
                   <u>pain</u>, the shock. A small trickle of <u>blood</u> comes from

                   can say anything she moves forward and KISSES him on
                   the mouth deeply and intensely. It's a disturbing and

                   As Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the
                   top of the saucer section. It's a spectacular sight as
                   the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready,
                   marches toward the leading edge of the saucer. The

                   The CAMERA ROTATES AND SPINS with them as they

                   are about fifty feet away from Riker. From their prone

                   them off the hull one by one. They have taken cover
                   behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of
                   the ship. The Borg have to cross an open field of
                   metal to get to them, making then easy targets.

                   Suddenly the Borg change tactics. From the deflector
                   dish high above them, Borg begin LAUNCHING THEMSELVES
                   directly at the Starfleet Officers, jumping off the
                   dish and flying through the vacuum of space like
                   paratroopers. This tips the balance. There are too
                   many targets to defend from above and below. One of
                   the flying Borg CRASHES into a Security Guard and a
                   vicious hand-to-hand FIGHT erupts. The Borg SLASHES
                   the guard's pressure suit, which DEPRESSURIZES killing
                   the man instantly. Worf FIRES  a phaser blast into the
                   Borg, knocking him off the hull and into space.

                   Worf turns to Riker.

                   Without taking her eyes away from Data, she reaches out
                   a hand and touches a control on a nearby console. The
                   color of Data's FACE turns an ASHEN GRAY --  as though

                   time his eyes widen in shock.

                   The sensation of human feeling is gone.

                   voice:

                   face. Data gasps -- filled with <u>feeling</u> once again.
                   The Borg Queen runs her hand across his cheek -- her

                   nods. The Borg Queen touches the control again. A
                   sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to Data.
                   And the Queen <u>kisses</u> him on the mouth.

                   This time, he responds eagerly, throwing himself into
                   the emotion of the moment. She pulls back a little,
                   looks at him softly, passionately. Data stares back at

                   Two fifty-foot long sheets of metal fall away from the
                   ship on either side of the Phoenix, revealing primitive
                   WARP NACELLES tucked inside the craft. The warp
                   nacelles then begin slowly extending themselves outward
                   on either side -- the basic designs of the nacelles
                   should be familiar to anyone who's ever seen a STAR
                   TREK starship.

                   This is the beginning of a long-standing architectural
                   design element of our ships.

                   The ship is STRETCHING in the familiar "rubber band
                   effect" that tells us a ship is going into warp... but
                   this effect is much <u>slower</u>. It's on the verge of

                   -- The second Borg rushes at Data, swings his arm at
                   Data's head. This is the same Borg with the deadly
                   stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES seen earlier. The spikes
                   TEAR into the flesh of Data's neck, drawing BLOOD.

                   -- Data reacts in pain. He GRABS the Borg's arm and
                   with android strength KICKS HIM IN THE CHEST at the
                   same time. The Borg FLIES BACKWARD, causing the
                   cybernetic ARM to RIP from its socket in a shower of
                   sparks.

                   -- The Borg Queen SWOOPS down at Data for the kill.
                   But Data's too quick for her. With one swift motion,
                   he turns and THROWS the BORG ARM like a JAVELIN across

                   The onrush of gas is gone. But it has affected every
                   surface of the room like an acid wash. Every piece of
                   Borg machinery is smoking and hissing. The two Borg

</b>
                   lying on the floor, still locked together. Data is a
                   shocking image: all of his human flesh has been
                   STRIPPED AWAY, leaving only his pure android self. His
                   metallic skull gleams in the dim light... even his eyes
                   are gone. His mechanical left arm is still intact, but
                   the right human arm is completely gone. His torso is
                   stripped of the human flesh, leaving pure android with
                   no soft human touches. Data as we've never seen him
                   before -- raw and mechanistic.

                   Data rolls over... still locked around him is the
                   MECHANICAL SKELETON of the Borg Queen. A metallic
                   spinal column with two arms with clawed hands leading
                   off it... and a blinking, electronic BRAIN STEM at the
                   very top of the spine.

                   Data throws off the grotesque form. The Borg Queen
                   carcass writhes and claws at the air. She speaks in a
                   flat, mechanical voice.

                   as a HATCH opens on the Vulcan ship. The townspeople
                   behind them react with shock and fear... a few people
                   take a step back. Picard looks at Cochrane, who
                   hesitates for a moment... then finally takes a deep
                   breath... and strides out toward the alien ship. A man
                   alone about to change the course of human history.

                   Ruby moves closer to Picard and puts her arm around
                   him... and he puts his arm around her.

                             Are you all right? The Enterprise
                             disappeared from our sensors for
                             a moment.

<b>                                           PICARD
</b>                             We're fine, sir. It will take
                             some... time to explain.

<b>                                           ADMIRAL HAYES

                             report.

                   The transmission ends. Ruby turns to Picard with
                   amazement.

<b>                                           RUBY
</b>                             That makes two of us.

                   Picard gives her a gentle smile. OFF the moment...

</b>                   Geordi is directing a work crew of a dozen engineers,
                   as they clean up the room and repair the damage.

<b>                                           GEORDI

                             this entire bulkhead. We'll need
                             new bracing members for the deck
                             above and below.

                   The N.D.s move off, making notes on their PADDS.
                   Geordi turns and sees Data standing in the doorway.
                   He's now been fully restored to his original android
                   self.

                   Geordi moves to him, puts a hand on his shoulder.

<b>                                           GEORDI
</b>                             You look good as new.

<b>                                           DATA

                             old self.

</b>                             That's great.

                   Geordi's smile fades a little as Data walks into the
                   room.

<b>                                           DATA

                             here?

                   Geordi points over to a corner, where some N.D.s are
                   about to close a storage container. Data walks over.
                   Geordi goes with him. The N.D.s move aside, and Data
                   looks down into the storage container. The broken,
                   mangles pieces of machinery are all that's left of the
                   Borg Queen.

<b>                                           GEORDI

                             Institute for analysis.

                   Data stares down at the remains with a haunted look.

<b>                                           DATA
</b>                             I never realized how powerful an
                             emotion temptation could be.

<b>                                           GEORDI
</b>                             Temptation? You said in your
                             report it was all a ruse... you
                             were manipulating her.

                   A quiet beat.

<b>                                           DATA
</b>                             She was... a unique lifeform. In
                             her own way... nearly perfect.

                   Geordi smiles a little.

<b>                                           GEORDI

                             It almost sounds like you miss
                             her.

                   Data looks up at him -- his expression unreadable.
                   Geordi's smile fades. Data reaches out, closes the lid
                   on the storage container, turns and walks out of the
                   room. Geordi watches him go, left to wonder what Data
                   is really feeling.

                   A large memorial cordoned off by a chain. A PLAQUE on
