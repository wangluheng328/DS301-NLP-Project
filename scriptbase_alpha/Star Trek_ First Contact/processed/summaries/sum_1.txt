The Borg have returned, in another attempt to conquer Earth.
Disregarding orders, Captain Picard and the new Enterprise-E rush to save the Federation homeworld, only to get sucked back in time with the Borg as they attempt to interfere with the course of humankind's evolution into a peaceful, unified race.
If Zefram Cochrane (inventor of warp drive) does not make his flight (in the mid-21st century), a routine Vulcan mapping mission would not detect the warp signature, and first contact would not be made.
The Borg go back in time to destroy his ship, once an American nuclear missile left over from World War III.
