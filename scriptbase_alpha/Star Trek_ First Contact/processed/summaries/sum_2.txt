They call themselves the Borg - a half-organic, half-machine collective, with a sole purpose: to assimilate and conquer all races.
Led by their seductive and sadistic queen, the Borg are headed to Earth with a devious plan to alter history.
After an epic battle against the Borg, Captain Jean-Luc Picard and the crew of the Enterprise follow the Borg Sphere back into the 21st century, and must battle the Borg Queen before she assimilates mankind.
Meanwhile, Picard and his crew must make sure that Zefram Cochrane makes his historic maiden flight at warp speed, and makes Earth's first contact.
