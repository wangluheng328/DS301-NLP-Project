Ted Crawford shoots his unfaithful wife, confesses to the police - orally and in writing - but then pleads not guilty and opts to defend himself in court.
The young DA assigned to the case, Willy Beachum, has had a successful career with a 97% conviction rate.
Beachum however is actually on his way to a lucrative position in a big private law firm, but his desire to win keeps him on the case.
What ensues is a battle of wits between the two as Crawford systematically destroys his opponents case.
