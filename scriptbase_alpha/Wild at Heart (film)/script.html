				     a love story

				     written by
				     David Lynch

				 based on the book by
				     Barry Gifford



And now the story of Sailor and Lula.....




<b>1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to 
maximum R.P.M. up the street.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE
</b>
The sign reads “KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS”.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</b>
With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black ’66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY
</b>
Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each other’s 
flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

<b>				OLD WOMAN
</b>		Oh my God! ... Why they doin’ that?

<b>				OLD MAN
</b>		Who the hell knows.  What you have
		in your mouth?

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

<b>				OLD MAN 
</b>		Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth
		out ... doctor said.  What you 
		tryin’ to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!!

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a 
tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>5. WASP NEST
</b>
A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
The telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman 
around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across 
the livingroom and answers the phone.

<b>				MARIETTA
</b>		Hello...  Who is this?...

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY
</b>
A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost 
somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman 
- speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>			(into phone)
		...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk 
		to Lula?

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>6A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
<b>				MARIETTA
</b>		There’s no way in hell you can speak
		to her and...

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>7A. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY
</b>
<b>				SAILOR
</b>			(feeling a smile coming on)
		What?...

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
<b>				MARIETTA
</b>		...Yes you heard me...  Don’t ever 
		call back here again.

Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Marietta’s twenty-year 
old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Mama???

<b>				MARIETTA
</b>		You know who it was and you know 
		you aren’t, and I mean ARE NOT 
		gonna see him EVER...  End of story.

<b>				LULA
</b>			(quietly)
		Like hell.

Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard 
her knuckles turn white.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>8. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LULA’S ROOM UPSTAIRS - DAY
</b>
Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo.  Speed metal music jumps 
up to around one hundred twenty decibels.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>9. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY
</b>
The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.  
The iron bars of the door slide across Sailor’s face and close with a 
bang.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT
</b>
A beat-up, red ’64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane 
TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the 
club - leaning out the car in every direction.  They scream out to the 
desolate-looking passerby.

<b>				TEENAGERS
</b><b>		EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!
</b>
The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot 
pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT
</b>
Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 
while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH 
BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore James’s “Dust my Broom” 
into Robert Johnson’s “Me and the Devil” and Beany lets out a snort.

<b>				BEANY
</b>		I can dig this music...  But not 
		that singer.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Why?...  He’s right in the groove.

<b>				BEANY
</b>		He’s so ugly.  Guys with beards and
		beer guts ain’t quite my type.

<b>				LULA
</b>		          (giggles)
		Seein’s how you’re about as thick as
		a used string of unwaxed dental floss,
		don’t know how you can criticize.

<b>				BEANY
</b>		Yeah, well, if he says that all that
		flab turns into dick at midnight, 
		he’s a liar.

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

<b>				BEANY
</b>		So, Sailor’s gettin’ out soon, and
		you’re gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Meetin’ him at the gate.  That phone
		call this afternoon was the signal.
		My deranged mama’s hid the keys to
		my car.  But of course, I know 
		exactly where they are.

<b>				BEANY
</b>		I didn’t hate me so much, I’d feel
		better wishin’ you luck.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Can’t all husbands be perfect, and
		your Elmo prob’ly wouldn’ta ever 
		got that second one pregnant, you
		hadn’t kicked his ass out.

<b>				BEANY
</b>		So you’re gonna be needin’ the 
		“blue-bird” pretty soon?

<b>				LULA
</b>		Real soon ... I’ll be makin’ the swap 
		tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>12. EXT. BAY ST. CLEMENT - DAY
</b>
Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>13. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
An empty livingroom.  The smoke from the city fire appears during the 
course of the DISSOLVE to be in the livingroom - then it disappears.

An empty hallway.

An empty stairway.


<b>13A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTA’S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
Feet (Lula’s) was across carpet.

A closet door opens.

A hand (Lula’s) reaches into the pocket of a coat in her mother’s 
closet.  The hand comes out clutching car keys.


<b>13B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - STAIRWAY - DAY
</b>
Lula races down the stairs and through a door into the garage.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>14. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
The electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her ’80 Black Camaro 
out and away.  The garage door closes automatically.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>15. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
</b>
Lula drives fast up a neighborhood street.  She turns a corner and 
disappears.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>16. INT. BEANY THORN’S GARAGE - DAY
</b>
Lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to Beany’s 
’67 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the T-Bird’s 
front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off.

<b>DISSOLVE TO:
</b>

<b>17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the 
house.  We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.  The 
calling changes - it becomes angry.  The garage door opens and Marietta 
comes storming out.  She leaps in her Caddy and peels out.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>18. INT. “SOUTHERN TIME” BAR - DAY
</b>
Marietta enters the bar on the run.  She calls out to the BARTENDER...

<b>				MARIETTA
</b>		Where’s Johnnie?  He’s not in his office.

<b>				BARTENDER
</b>		Haven’t seen ’im yet today, Marietta.

<b>				MARIETTA
</b>			(slightly hysterical)
		Well I gotta find him - right this
		minute!

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY
</b>
Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing 
out a cloud of dust.  They’re both smiling.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Hey baby...

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Peanut...

They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while 
Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks,    
		baby...  Did I ever tell you that
		this here jacket for me is a symbol
		of my individuality and my belief
		in personal freedom?

<b>				LULA
</b>		’Bout fifty thousand times.  I got 
		us a room at the Cape Fear, and 
		guess what?...  I hear Powermad’s 
		at “The Hurricane.”

<b>				SAILOR
</b>			(smiling)
		Stab it and steer.

Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
</b>
Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the 
fan creak.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Did you ever think somethin’ like
		about the wicked witch of the east
		comin’ flyin’ in?...  Did you ever
		think somethin’ and then later think
		you’ve said it out loud to someone?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		I really did miss your mind while I
		was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The
		rest of you, too, of course.  But 
		the way your head works is God’s own
		private mystery.  What was it you
		was thinkin’?

<b>				LULA
</b>		Well, I was thinkin’ about smokin’ 
		actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros
		now, used to be she smoked Kools?
		I stole ’em from her beginnin’ in
		about sixth grade.  When I got old
		enough to buy my own, I bought those.
		Now I’ve just about settled on Mores,
		as you probably noticed?  They’re longer.


<b>				SAILOR
</b>		I guess I started smokin’ when I was
		about six...  My mama was already
		dead from lung cancer...

<b>				LULA
</b>		What brand’d she smoke?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Camels, same as me...  Guess both
		my mama and my daddy died of smoke
		or alcohol related illness.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Gee, Sailor.  I’m sorry, honey.  I 
		never would have guessed it.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		It’s okay.  I hardly used to see 
		them anyway.  I didn’t have much 
		parental guiding.  The public defender
		kept sayin’ that at my parole hearin’.
		He was a good ol’ boy, stood by me...
		Even brought me some cartons of 
		cigarettes from time to time.

<b>				LULA
</b>		I’d stand by you, Sailor ... through
		anything.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after
		I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man can’t
		ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

<b>				LULA
</b>		You move me, Sailor, you really do.
		You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lula’s breasts.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		You’re perfect for me, too.

<b>				LULA
</b>		You remind me of my daddy, you know?
		Mama told me he liked skinny women
		whose breasts were just a bit too
		big for their bodies.  He had a long
		nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever
		tell you how he died?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		In a fire, as I recall.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Started he couldn’t remember things?
		Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin’
		me it was on account of lead poisoning
		from cleanin’ the old paint off our
		house without usin’ a mask...  But
		I don’t know.  Seems like his brain
		just fell apart in pieces.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>21. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
CLYDE FORTUNE tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the 
cabinet contents all across the counter and floor.  He puts his fist 
through the kitchen window.  He leaps on the counter and bats the 
kitchen ceiling light - smashing it.  He kicks over the refrigerator.

<b>				CLYDE
</b><b>		FUCKIN’ BITCH!!!!
</b>
<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>22. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
</b>
Lula’s eyes look off, remembering.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Finally in the middle of the one 
		night, with me and mama asleep 
		upstairs ... he poured kerosene over
		himself and lit a match.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>23. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Clyde Fortune, completely engulfed in fire, races across and back the 
livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair.  The drapes 
behind him burst in flames.

<b>				LULA
</b>			(voice-over)
		Near burned down the house.  We 
		got out just in time.

The whole livingroom goes up in flames.

<b>								CUT TO:
</b>

<b>24. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY
</b>
CU the red hot ash of Lula’s cigarette as she inhales deeply.  As she 
exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor.

<b>				LULA
</b>		It was a year before I met you.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lula’s hand and puts it into the 
ashtray by her bed.  He pulls her to him and kisses her throat.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		You have such a pretty, long neck, 
		like a swan.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth
		white neck.  It was like on a 
		statue it was so white?

</b>		I knew this would happen.  Soon as

		Pee Dee, I knew there’d be trouble.
		He’s just got some kind of influence
		over her I can’t decipher.  There’s

</b>		He served his time for what he did.
		Another thing...  If Lula went with

		that is - there ain’t much can be
		done about it.

<b>				MARIETTA
</b>		Don’t talk down to me, Johnnie 
		Farragut.  I know what volition means,
		and that’s why I want Sailor Ripley
		off the planet!  He’s pure slime and 
		it’s leakin’ all over my baby.  
		Maybe you could push him into makin’
		some kinda move and then kill him
		dead.  You’d only be defendin’ 
		yourself, and with his record,

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

</b>		I’ll locate Lula, Marietta, and if

blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as she’d started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Sailor, you are somethin’ else,

		I should talk to her before I did
		anything about it.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		But honey, I thought you told me
		your Uncle Pooch raped you when

</b>		That’s true.  Uncle Pooch wasn’t
		really an uncle.  He was a business
		partner of my daddy’s?  And my mama
		never knew nothin’ about me and 
		him - that’s for damn sure.  His real
		name was somethin’ kind of European,
		like Pucinski.  But everyone just
		called him Pooch.  He came around the
		house sometimes when Daddy was away.
		I always figured he was sweet on 
		mama, so when he cornered me one 
		afternoon, I was surprised more’n
		a little.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		How’d it happen, peanut?  He just
		pull out the old toad and let it
		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

</b>		Whattaya do there?

<b>				REGGIE
</b>			(laughs)
		Oh, many things...

<b>				DROP SHADOW
</b>		Mr. San Pedro Sula’s got an appliance
		shop.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		But I am also with the government.

Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich.

<b>				JOHNNIE
</b>		In what capacity?

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		In many capacities.

<b>				DROP SHADOW
</b>		Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the 
		Secret Service.

Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands 
a card to Johnnie.

<b>				JOHNNIE
</b>			(reading aloud)
		General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.
		Telefono 666.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		He is my sponsor.  The General is
		the head of the secret police of
		Honduras.

<b>				DROP SHADOW
</b>		Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his
		operatives.

Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece 
of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		That is my permiso.

<b>				DROP SHADOW
</b>		Mr. San Pedro Sula’s permit to kill.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		Only if necessary, of course, and
		only in my own country.
			(laughs)

<b>				JOHNNIE
</b>		Of course.

Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie.

<b>				DROP SHADOW
</b>		Mr. San Pedro Sula’s authorized to
		carry a .45.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		United States Marine issue, before
		they made the unfortunate switch to
		the less dependable nine millimeters.
		I have it here, in my briefcase.

Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on 
the floor beneath his chair.

<b>				JOHNNIE
</b>		Why are you in New Orleans?  If you 
		don’t mind my askin’.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		Certainly not.  We are here only
		briefly, in fact, until this evening,
		when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit
		a friend of mine who is an agent for
		the CIA.

<b>				DROP SHADOW
</b>		He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula
		and me bass fishing.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		We are in the same businesses and
		also we are fishermen.

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

<b>				JOHNNIE
</b>			(extending his hand)
		It’s been a real pleasure.  I wish
		you both buena suerte wherever you go.

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnie’s hand.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		The same to you.  If you are in 
		Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and
		visit us.  The Hondurans are great
		friends of the American people.  But
		I have a joke for you before I go.
		If a liberal, a socialist, and a 
		communist all jumped off the roof of
		the Empire State Building at the 
		same time, which one of them would
		hit the ground first?

<b>				JOHNNIE
</b>		I couldn’t say, which one?

Reggie turns to Drop Shadow and lets him have the punch line.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Was in all the papers three years ago.
		I’m seventy-six, was only seventy-
		three then.  Had a business in
		Buffalo, New York, called Rats With
		Wings.  Killed pigeons for anyone
		who wanted ’em killed.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Why were you killin’ pigeons, Mr.
		Kovich?  Were you in the extermination
		business?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No, ma’am.  I was a housepainter, 
		in the union forty-one years.  I’m
		retired now, livin’ with my sister, 
		Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five
		years ago, married an oil man named
		Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  He’s dead now,
		so it’s just me and Ida.  I sold my
		house and moved down after the city
		of Buffalo put me out of business.
		Hell, RWW was doin’ them a service,
		and they charged me with endangerin’

</b>		Woman drivin’ down the street spotted

		the pigeons, the damage they do to
		personal property.  I used to complain
		to the city but they never lifted
		a finger.  I was gonna put out poison,
		but I was afraid somebody’s cat 
		would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats
		myself.  So I used the .22 because
		it didn’t make much noise and the
		ammo was cheap.

</b>		What happened on the charges?

</b>		Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred
		dollar fine and ordered to desist.
		Pigeons carry diseases and muss up

Kovich stands up and puts some money on the counter.

him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.

them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick 
his dirty fingers.

Roach pulls a piece of raw cow’s liver out of one of his pockets of his 
field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 
the dogs.

Lula opens her door and jumps out.

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 
of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 
the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

<b>				LULA
</b>		I’m truly sorry?  I’m truly sorry, 
		Roach.  But ain’t gonna make it to
		Alaska?  Least not any part of the

Sailor spots a Red Devil gas station that still has its lights on and 
pulls the car over.

Two skinny, pimply-faced guys, BUCK and BILLY, wearing dirty coveralls 
walk over to them.

<b>99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR 
COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 
long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  
Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 
tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into “the bird.”  He holds his 
hand that way while he speaks...

<b>BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
</b>		This is a friendly place, son.  You 
		folks just relax and have a nice time.

<b>				LULA
</b>		   (bound and determined not 
		    to be intimidated)
		You got yourself a deal.

<b>				BARTENDER
</b>			(to Sailor)
		That’s a real jacket...  By that,
		I mean a real stupid jacket.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me it represents a symbol of my 
		individuality and my belief in
		personal freedom.

<b>				BARTENDER
</b>		Fuckin’ honky cracker mumbo jumbo.


The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 
near the door.

<b>				LULA
</b>		I’ll be damned if I’m leavin’.  That
		band is too good?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Uh huh.

<b>				LULA
</b>		You notice that woman when we come
		in?  The white woman sittin’ by 
		herself?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Well, she ain’t talked to nobody 
		and ain’t nobody spoke to her that
		I could tell.  What you make of that?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Honey, we bein’ strangers here and 
		all, this is the kinda place we don’t
		want to make nothin’ of nothin’.

<b>				LULA
</b>		You think she’s pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		I tend to like ’em with a little 
		more meat on the bones.  Face ain’t
		bad, though.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		What’s wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin’
		botherin’ you?

<b>				LULA
</b>		Mama.  I been thinkin’ about her.
		She’s prob’ly worried to death by now.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		More’n likely.

<b>				LULA
</b>		I want to call her and tell her
		I’m okay.  That we’re okay.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		I ain’t so sure it’s a great idea,
		but that’s up to you.  Just don’t tell
		her where we are.

		Pardon me?  Y’all got a phone here 
		I can use?

<b>BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
</b>		Can’t you read?

fast and looks at Lula.  Everybody else in the place is still.

Sailor finds her sitting on the ground, leaning against the passenger

The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back 
through the lobby.  Santos walks over to Marietta.  Marietta stands.

<b>				MARIETTA

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 
gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 
tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 
to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 
leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 
of his.

<b>				JUANA
</b>		Johnnie, you take a good look at me,
		baby, cause you gonna haf’ta watch
		close to know when we do it to ya...
		Y’all count when I touch the bottle -
<b>		HO!!...

			across the face)
		There I slap that mutha fucka face -
		pay attention fucka - otherwise we 
		haf’ta work it all night...  Too 
		much fun for us - you see what I 
		mean?  Now watch me how I touch a
		bottle and you count how many times.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 
sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 
opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 
bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 
comes back and touches Johnnie’s face.

<b>				JUANA
</b>		You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number
		one bottle once, I toucha number two
		bottle once, and I touch your face.
		This is a game we love to play.  I
		get hot already...  Now you meet 
		second Mr. Killer...  Does he fish
		or don’t he?

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 
around to face him.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember
		Reggie, don’t ya?  Look what I caught.
			(to Juana)
		I’m gettin’ hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 
in front of Johnnie’s again.

<b>				JUANA
</b>		Now Johnnie...  We want to feel the
		feelin’...  Feel the feelin’...  We
		be gettin’ up close to you, mutha

		I talk ’bout NO MO JOHNNIE...  I

<b>				REGGIE

		I can’t stop her, Johnnie...  She
		get’s me too hot doin’ this...  I’m
		gonna be right here, but I’m gonna
		stand right behind ya with this big

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 
Automatic.

<b>				DROP SHADOW
</b>		That’s a Marine issue.  It goes off
		somethin’ terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud “click.”

<b>				JUANA
</b>		You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 
of Johnnie.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>			(laughs)
		Hell, it’s even worse than I 
		remember...  Wait a minute...

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 
again.

<b>				JUANA
</b>		Okay, gimmee ’nother kiss, Reggie
		b’fore I fuck ya right now...
<b>		FUCKIN’ HOT NOW, REGGIE.
</b>		    (she opens her mouth with 
		     her tongue sticking out)
<b>		FUCKIN’ HOT!
</b>
Juana screams like a monster from hell coming up close to Johnnie’s 
face.

<b>				JUANA
</b>		You think you gonna live through
		this night?...  YOU WRONG...  I
<b>		SMELL YO SHIT NOW, JOHNNIE.  GIVE
</b><b>		US ONE MO KISS, REGGIE.  OH FUCK 
</b><b>		ME!!!  WE TOUCH BOTTLES NOW - FO

Reggie goes back behind Johnnie quick.

<b>				JUANA
</b>		I go out now...  I toucha one bottle...
		Reggie...  I toucha two bottle...
		I come back, I touch Johnnie...  AHHHHH

			(she puts her hand 
		  between her legs)
		HA!...  Now I go out - I toucha one

		I go now and touch...  OH OH...  Okay...
		This time I toucha second bottle...  I

</b><b>		ROUND AND ROUND YOU AHHHH - GO OUT AND
</b><b>		TOUCH A NUMBER ONE BOTTLE - WAIT NOW!!!
</b><b>		...  REGGIE...  YOU SHOW NOW-
</b>
Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnie’s face - tears off tape and gag - 
then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 
design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

<b>				REGGIE
</b>		I forgot to show you this.  The
		gentlemen that gave this to me said
		you’d recognize it.  Said he wanted 
		it’d be ’bout the last thing you ever
		saw in this life.

<b>				JOHNNIE
</b>		     (recognizing cufflink)
  Oh God...  OH GOD...  Santos...  
		Oh God Marietta ... are you in on

<b>				JUANA
</b><b>		I GO ROUND AND ROUND - DO I TOUCH A
</b><b>		SECOND BOTTLE B’FORE I TOUCH JOHNNIE
</b><b>		- DO I?  DO I???.........
</b>		    (very quietly and breathy)
		No...  I touch Johnnie.

As her finger touches Johnnie’s face there is a loud “CLICK.”  Johnnie 
moans and closes his eyes.

<b>				JUANA
</b>			(counting fast)
		One ... two ... three ... four ...
		five ... GETTIN’ TOO FUCKIN’ HOT, 
		REGGIE...  FEELIN’ MYSE’F ... six

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

<b>				JUANA
</b>		Nine...
		   (she moves out of the way)
<b>		FUCK ME NOW, REGGIE...  TEN!!!
</b>
We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood.  Juana and Reggie 
race into each other’s arms and kiss right above Johnnie’s dead, 
bloodied head.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		You know, Lula, I never told you

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Not exactly, sugar...  One reason

<b>				LULA
</b>		You’re scarin’ me, baby.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Well, there’s a good side as well as
		a bad side to it...  The good side
		is I knew your daddy, and I thought
		Clyde was a good ol’ guy...

<b>				LULA
</b>		You knew my daddy?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Yes I did...  I sure did...  The bad

<b>				LULA
</b>		Oh shit...

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		I quit workin’ for ’im, but just

		a house...  I don’t know what it is
		they all think I saw that night, but
		I was just sittin’ out in the car

<b>				LULA
</b>		God, Sailor...  That’s the night my
		daddy died.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		I know, sugar...  But while the place
		was burnin’...  Before Santos came
		out - I pitched some rocks at the 
		second floor windows case anyone was
		upstairs sleepin’...  Afterwards...
		When I met you, I always liked to 
		think I mighta saved your life.

<b>				LULA
</b>		That’s some big secret you been

</b>		We all got a secret side, baby.  Hope

		’bout other things, sugar.

<b>				LULA
</b>		How’d you know my daddy?

<b>				SAIL0R
</b>		Met him through Santos...  Clyde -

Lula stays quiet for a moment - listening to the heavy hum of the V-8.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Lula, you there?

<b>				LULA
</b>		Yeah, I’m here.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		You upset with me?

The livingroom is on fire.

The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the 
smoke-filled hallway to her mother’s bedroom.

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mother’s 
bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window.  
Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula 
heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel.

<b>				LULA

		  (after a pause - she smiles)
		So Sailor, our histories have been

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		They have, sugar.

<b>				LULA
</b>		I take that as a sign that we were

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		It’s a comfortin’ idea.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Well, we’re really out in the middle
		of it now, ain’t we?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		There’s worse places, honey.

<b>				LULA
</b>		If you say so.

</b>		Trust me on it.

<b>				LULA
</b>			(turns to him)
		I do trust you, Sailor.  Like I 
		ain’t never trusted nobody before.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>			(after a moment)
		We’ll be al’right, peanut, long as 
		we’ve got room to move.

<b>				LULA
</b>		   (looking into the highway)
		What’s that?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		I don’t know...  Looks like clothes.

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 
clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 
of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each 
other - they’ve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the 
highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an 
overturned car.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Oh God, Sailor.


<b>				SAILOR
</b>		One bad car accident...

<b>				LULA
</b><b>		SAILOR!!!
</b>
Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - 
blood draining out of several deep wounds.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Sailor, what are we gonna do?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		I don’t know, honey, but we gotta 
		help that girl - get her to a town and
		hope no one catches on I broke parole.

They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming.

<b>				GIRL
</b>			(completely gone in shock)
		I’ve got about five hundred dollars 
		in my wallet and I can’t find it...
		My mother’s going to kill me.  It’s 
		got all my cards in it...  It was 
		in my pocket...  Now my pockets gone.
<b>		MY PURSE IS GONE!!!  NOW SHE TELLS ME.
</b>
The girl starts walking back toward the car.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Let’s get ahold a’ her quick.

<b>				LULA
</b>		You think she’s gonna make it?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Don’t know, but she’s gonna bleed
		all over our car, I’ll tell ya that...
		           (to Girl)
		Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta
		come with us, honey.

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girl’s arm.

<b>				GIRL
</b><b>		OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...
</b>		ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn
		sticky stuff in my hair...

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

<b>				GIRL
</b>		Gotta find my wallet.
			(to Sailor)
		Don’t you say one word of this to
		my mother.  God, she’s gonna kill me.

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 
Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

<b>				GIRL
</b><b>		WHERE’S MY HAIRBRUSH?...
</b>
Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

<b>				LULA
</b>		I can’t take this, Sailor.  She’s
		dyin’ right in front of our eyes...

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		I’m afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 
forehead.

<b>				GIRL
</b>			(wide-eyed now)
		Get my lipstick...
			(whisper)
		It’s in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

<b>				LULA
</b>		She died right in front of me.  Why’d
		she have to go and do that, Sailor?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Let’s get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girl’s forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

They stare at each other.  Lula suddenly feels sick to her stomach and 
slumps down on the edge of the bed.

<b>				RED
</b>			(with a smile)
		Well, I ain’t Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		Name’s Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at
		the drugstore thought you might have
		some work I could do.

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

<b>				RED
</b>		Things ain’t real hot right now.
		Rex, there though,
			(nodding toward a half-naked
			man burrowed under an ’83 Buick)

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

<b>				SPARKY
</b>		How’s it look?

</b>		Shit, that’s what I was afraid of.

		I’m Buddy, and this here’s Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		My girl and I are lookin’ for a 
		place to settle.  We’re bunked down

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

Sailor looks at Lula.

the group.

<b>				TOMMY
</b>		Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That

<b>				BUDDY

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

<b>				BOBBY
</b>		Hey, everybody.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Sailor, Lula, this here’s the man 
		himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor
		and Lula, the most recent strandees,
		economic variety.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

<b>				BOBBY
</b>		Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		Accordin’ to Red and Rex, Bobby’s
		the most excitin’ item to hit Big
		Tuna since the ’86 cyclone sheared
		the roof off the high school.

<b>				SPARKY
</b>		Only in town two months and there 
		ain’t a young thing around don’t 
		know how that cobra tattoo works, 
		right, Bob?

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 
front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

<b>				LULA
</b>		You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

<b>				BOBBY
</b>		I’m from all over.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		    (noticing a USMC tattoo
		     on Bobby’s right hand)
		You was in the Marines, huh?

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

<b>				BOBBY
</b>		Four years.

<b>				SPARKY
</b>		Bobby was at Cao Ben.

<b>				LULA
</b>		What’s Cao Ben?

<b>				BOBBY
</b>			(to Lula)
		How old are you?

</b>		Lotta women and kids and old people
		died at Cao Ben.

<b>				BOBBY
</b>		March, 1968.  We torched a village
		and the government made a big deal
		out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 
reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 
practically burn a hole in Buddy.

<b>				BOBBY
</b>			(to Buddy)
		You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to
		make contact with the people when
		you’re off floatin’ in the Gulf of
		Tonkin.

<b>				SPARKY
</b>		    (changing the subject)
		Hey Bobby, have yourself another

Sparky refills Bobby’s shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

<b>				BOBBY
</b>		Don’t mind if I fuckin’ do...  
		Speakin’ ’a Jack...  One-eyed Jacks
		yearnin’ to go a peepin’ in a

He walks out and after he’s gone...

</b>		Somethin’ in that man scares me.

<b>				BUDDY
</b>		No shit.


<b>				SPARKY

		Bobby’s got a way...  Can’t shake

Lula puts a hand on Sailor’s leg.

<b>				LULA

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and

</b>		I know you ain’t particularly pleased

</b>		Not that.  Look at what I wrote down

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads “I’m pregnant.”  Sailor looks into 
her eyes.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		It’s okay by me, peanut.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Well, nothin’ personal, but I ain’t

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.

		But it don’t matter now.  Lotta guys

Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.

<b>				LULA
</b>		I sure enjoy smokin’, Sailor.  I 
		hate that it’s bad for you.

Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his 
head.

Lula lights a second More off the first one and stubs out the butt on 
the dresser top.

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailor’s fist is already halfway through Bob 
Ray’s brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and

Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perdita’s hair and pulls her over the couch 
onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small 
turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of 
sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the 
volume increases.

Lula remembers some “moments” in her life with Sailor: (Music continues

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to “Slaughter House.”

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.

The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind 
the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor 
is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby 
finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole 
through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock.

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around 
and points it at Sailor.

<b>				BOBBY
</b>		You’re next, fucker.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  
It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 
Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 
old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 
spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 
old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 
front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.


<b>148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY
</b>
The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 
in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobby’s thigh and his 
second into Bobby’s left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 
Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobby’s right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy 
orders him to stand up.

Lula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the Iguana County 
Courthouse Building when Marietta and Santos walk in.  As soon as she 
sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses 
her.

<b>				MARIETTA
</b>		Oh baby, I was beginnin’ to think 
		I was never gonna see you again.

Tears are pouring down Marietta’s cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and 
Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos.

</b>		You’re comin’ home, precious.  Santos’
		gonna drive us to the San Antonio

<b>				LULA
</b>		Mama, Sailor’s in deep trouble here.

Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lula’s 
eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are 
pale.

<b>				MARIETTA
</b>		Oh, yes, you can.

Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble.

<b>				SANTOS
</b>		Your mama’s been real worried ’bout
		you, honey.  Me too...  Can you
		give your old friend Santos a hug,
		too?

Santos’ arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling 
scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a 
bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, 
orange, and silver.

<b>				LULA
</b>			(voice-over)

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing you’ll want to know is I’m keeping the baby.
Mama wasn’t for it in the beginning but I think she’s looking
forward to it.  I’m gonna name it Pace no matter if it’s a 
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, don’t it?  It’s
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 
when you get out.

I feel like I’m kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, it’ll be over and I’ll have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I don’t know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
you’re thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and they’re spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  I’m going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby they’re lookin’
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time don’t really fly honey does it?

Love,
your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>			(voice-over)

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing you’re
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of 
ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 
wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 
Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 
ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 
livingroom as she talks on the phone.

<b>				LULA

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a 
long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders.

<b>				PACE
</b>		How’ll we know what he looks like?

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

<b>				PACE
</b>		Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Don’t give me no trouble now, Pace,

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out 
of her mouth and drops it.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Damn it, child!  Now look what you
		made me do.

<b>				PACE
</b>		What I made you do, mama?

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the 
cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

		Mama’s just actin’ strange.

</b>		Still partial to Camels, huh?

Sailor smiles.

</b>		First pack of tailor-mades I had in

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 
Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		You must be my son.

</b>		Shake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lula’s hand and puts his own in Sailor’s.  Sailor grips it 
gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

</b>		Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them 
loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

off the engine and gets out of the car.

<b>				PACE
</b>		What’s wrong, mama?

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		     (turning to Pace and

		Don’t worry, son.  Just stay here.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the 
hood.

		Not seein’ each other for six years

</b>		What makes sense, is all.

Sailor goes around to the driver’s side, reaches in and pulls the keys 
out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 
closes the lid.

<b>				LULA
</b>		Don’t do this, Sailor, please.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the 
car.

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 
down her face.

ECU of Lula’s eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 
down her cheeks as in Sailor’s dream.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		You been doin’ fine without me, peanut.

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER 
TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 
him, coming in closer for the kill.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		What do you faggots want?

That’s all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 
begins to pour from his swelling nose.


<b>162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILOR’S FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

<b>				GOOD WITCH
</b>		Sailor Ripley...

Sailor’s eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		The Good Witch...

<b>				GOOD WITCH
</b>		Sailor...  Lula loves you.

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		But I’m a robber and a manslaughterer
		and I haven’t had any parental 
		guidance.

<b>				GOOD WITCH
</b>		She’s forgiven you of all these things
		...  You love her...  Don’t be

<b>				SAILOR
</b>		But I’m wild at heart.

<b>				GOOD WITCH
</b>		If you are truly wild at heart, you’ll
		fight for your dreams...  Don’t turn
		away from love, Sailor...  Don’t turn
		away from love...  Don’t turn away

The Good Witch disappears.


<b>162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on 
his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

<b>				GANG MEMBER

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULA’S NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 
jumps on the hood of Lula’s car.

She sees him.

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 
giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 
away.  Lula’s gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is Pace’s happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lula’s eyes and sings “Love 
Me Tender.” 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.
