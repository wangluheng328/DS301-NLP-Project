Young lovers Sailor and Lula take off for New Orleans following Sailor's release from prison, with Lula's hysterical mother, a weary detective and a sinister hitman after them.
During their journey, Lula and Sailor relate the events of their lives to date, while encountering a typical gallery of Lynch grotesques.
After being stranded in a small town, Sailor agrees to join the loathsome Bobby Peru in a criminal venture.
