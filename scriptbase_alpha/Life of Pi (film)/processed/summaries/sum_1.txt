When Pi's family business fails, they embark on a sea voyage to Canada to begin a new life.
One night aboard their Japanese cargo ship in the middle of the ocean, a deadly storm hits and sinks nearly all that Pi holds dear.
He survives in a lifeboat with several of their zoo animals, including a fearsome Bengal tiger.
In a struggle to survive, Pi and the tiger forge an unexpected connection that gives him daily motivation to live.
