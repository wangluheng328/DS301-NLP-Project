He tries to rub out his imprisoned employee Azul.
However, Azul overcomes the hit-men and escapes, determined to get his revenge.
Meanwhile, a wandering mariachi comes to the same town looking for work.
As Azul's trademark is his guitar case filled with weapons, the Mariachi is mistaken for him and finds himself a hunted man.
Everyone looking for him likes to shoot first and ask questions later, so correcting the misunderstanding will not be easy.
