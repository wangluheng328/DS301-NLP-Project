</b><b>          
</b>          A machete slashes INTO FRAME.  An American in battered
          fedora and leather jacket, accompanied by two gunbearers,
          hacks his way through dense bush.  We see him from the back
          only.  He hacks an opening, bats fly out AT CAMERA and the
          bushes part, revealing huge overgrown stone letters -- the
          Mayan ruin look -- that spell "AIRPLANE II."

<b>          
</b>          Two miners head to terminal doors and pass FOUR NUNS, who
          bid farewell to FATHER O'FLANAGAN.  O'Flanagan shakes the
          hands of the first three elderly nuns, then grabs the last
          young gorgeous nun and kisses her passionately.
