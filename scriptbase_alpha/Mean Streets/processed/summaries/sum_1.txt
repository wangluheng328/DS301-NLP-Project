In a series of character-led incidents set against the background of New York City's Little Italy, we follow the life of Charlie, a small-time member of the wiseguy community who collects protection money.
His friends Tony and Michael are part of the community, but his other friend Johnny Boy is unreliable and therefore must be shunned.
Charlie's secret girlfriend Teresa has epilepsy, and so must also be shunned.
When Charlie's uncle Giovanni offers him a restaurant - the first step up the ladder - Charlie is forced to choose between his desire for power, his love for Teresa and his duty to protect his friend Johnny Boy.
