All The King's Men is the story of the rise of politician Willie Stark from a rural county seat to the spotlight.
Along the way, he loses his initial innocence, and becomes just as corrupt as those who he assaulted before for this characteristic.
Also included is the romance between one of his "right hand women" and the up-and-coming journalist who brings Stark to prominence.
