<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. BOYLESTON STREET, BOSTON -- MORNING
</b>

<b>          
</b>          The boulevard is empty, eerie silence. No cars, no people. A man
          walks down the middle of the street, long trench, dark shades.
          Though he does not speak, we hear...

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 MAN V.O.
</b>                     There's two kinds of people in this
                     world when you boil it all down. You
                     got your talkers and you got your
                     doers.

<b>          
</b>          We recognize this man as ROCCO. He crosses Copley Square toward the
          looming dome of the Trinity Church.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 ROCCO V.O.
</b>                     Most people are just talkers. All they
                     got is talk. But when all's said and
                     done, it is the doers who change the
                     world. And when they do that, they
                     change us. That's why we never forget
                     them...So, which one are you? Do you
                     just talk about it? Or do you stand up
                     and do something about it? Because
                     believe you me all the rest of it is
                     just coffee house bullshit.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          FADE TO BLACK...
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. DEEP COUNTRYSIDE -- DAY
</b>

<b>          
</b>          SUBTEXT:   "Ireland"

<b>          
</b>          From behind we see two men perched atop a boulder. A flock of sheep
          encircles them. Their army sacks and shotguns are nearby. They roll
          their own cigarettes with effortless synchronicity and light up.
          CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (30's) now have long hair with heavy
          facial growth. Rugged. Piercing eyes. Looking to the horizon...

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 MURPHY
</b>                     Looks like a storm's comin'.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 CONNOR
</b>                     Aye.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. FIELDS -- LATER
</b>

<b>          
</b>          MOODY MUSIC: The brothers drive the flock across jewel green hills.
          Murphy cuts a sheep from a thicket and sets it off.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                 POPPA M V.O.
</b>                     Peace, they say, is the enemy of
                     memory. So it had been for my boys.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                           2.
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Connor shares some jerky with a sheep dog as the flock surges.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
</b>                    For some time now, their past had felt
                    like a dream to them...faded and worn.

<b>          
</b>          Murphy touches the faded Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. Connor
          sees. The music takes us to a secluded, pioneer-esque ranch.

<b>          
</b>          CLOSE ON: POPPA M's (58yrs) face as he coughs and watches his sons
          approach from his rocking chair on the porch.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                POPPA M V.O. (CONT'D)
</b>                    And then suddenly, as if not a day had
                    passed...it was back. I could see it
                    in their eyes.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          INT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT
</b>

<b>          
</b>          Poppa M and his sons eat a rustic dinner.   It storms outside.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                POPPA M V.O.
</b>                    I could feel it, heavy in their
                    presence. Something calling them back.

<b>          
</b>          Poppa M looks to his boys who just keep eating. DIP TO BLACK...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          INT. FARMHOUSE, FRONT PORCH -- NEXT MORNING
</b>

<b>          
</b>          Very early dawn, shadowy morning light. Connor and Murphy sip
          coffees and look out into the rain. Lightening lights up the flock.

<b>          
</b>          Through the open door behind them, Poppa M stokes a warm fire.

<b>          
</b>          Connor touch the Celtic Cross tattoo on his forearm. The boys look
          at each other as the rain suddenly stops and all the "little sounds"
          of morning cease. Something's amiss. Thunder. Ominous music as...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. BOSTON, TRINITY CHURCH -- NIGHT
</b>

<b>          
</b>          From behind, we see a man with a CREW CUT, staring at the dome of
          the Trinity.

<b>          
</b>          SLO-MO, CLOSE ON: Crew Cut's boots as he paces toward.    The
          threatening music bleeds over to...

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. FARM -- MOMENTS LATER
</b>

<b>          
</b>          Just inside the trees, a pack of wolves stalk the sheep flock...

<b>          
</b>          SLO-MO, CLOSE ON:   A wolf's paws as it paces toward...

<b>          
</b>          We intercut between BOSTON and IRELAND as chaos erupts...

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                                                           3.
</b>
<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          BOSTON:    Crew Cut quickly enters the church.

<b>          
</b>          IRELAND:    The wolves burst from the tree line.

<b>          
</b>          BOSTON: A frantic priest in his 50's weeps and begs as Crew Cut
          slams him to his knees with a .9 mm to his head.

<b>          
</b>          IRELAND:   The wolves savagely attack the screaming sheep.

<b>          
</b>          BOSTON:    Muzzle flash, blood splatters on the altar.

<b>          
</b>          IRELAND: BOOM! BOOM! Connor and Murphy blast shotguns at the
          wolves. One is hit, the rest retreat. The boys perform mercy
          killings on the wolf and one sheep.

<b>          
</b>          Everything calms as Poppa M rushes up with a mag light and stops.
          He coughs roughly. Moody choral music begins...

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                  POPPA M V.O.
</b>                      "And they cried out, How long O'Lord
                      dost thou not judge and revenge our
                      blood upon them that dwell on the
                      earth?"

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. FIELD -- LATER
</b>

<b>          
</b>          The boys toss the wolf carcass onto a bonfire.     It rains again.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                  POPPA M V.O.
</b>                      And God said, "All will fear the wrath
                      of the lamb. For the great day of
                      their reckoning hath come."

<b>          
</b>          Poppa M looks across the blaze to his sons. Connor and Murphy stare
          into the fire, bathed in the light of angry flames.

<b>                                  POPPA M
</b>                      "And they that holdest my name shall
                      come with the shaking of the earth and
                      the roiling of the oceans."

<b>          
</b>
<b>          EXT. FARM -- NIGHT
</b>

<b>          
</b>          Downpour. A rugged old jeep tears through the mud. It stops at the
          farmhouse. Poppa M and the boys come out onto the porch. A dark
          figure with a fedora and rain slicker exits the jeep and hurries to
          the porch. Meet Uncle SIBEAL (62yrs). He wears a priest's collar.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                  SIBEAL
</b>                      Something's happened.

</b>                    There is no new information on the
                    victim found slain this morning inside
                    Trinity Church. As you can see the
                    size of the crowd here has increased
                    substantially over the last couple of
                    hours. People are demanding answers as
                    to how a priest could be murdered in a
                    church. But perhaps more shocking, we
                    have confirmed that the body was
                    ritualized with pennies in the eyes.
                    Many remember this as the grisly
                    calling card of the prolific vigilante
                    killers known as the Saints, who went
                    on a murder spree here in Boston.

                             (denotes surroundings)
                    Outnumbered, outgunned. They kill
                    everyone...and leave.

                    often don't. But it's there. Knowing

                    proactivitously. The cops were
                    embarrassed by these guys too. With a
                    second bite at the apple, they got
                    every reason in the world to crank up
                    the heat. And as for their doting
                    public. I'd imagine they're gonna lose

<b>          INT. BERTH -- LATER

<b>          
</b>          Murphy sits, bare chested on a crate. With the rigged pen, he
          tattoos his brother's back. Connor cooks something, in a pot, on
          the hot plate. The resin of anger is evident.

<b>          
</b>          TATTOOS: Murphy's back has the crucified feet of Christ and
          Connor's shows Christ's downcast head on the cross.

</b>                    Think about it. People figure we did

                    drop a dime. Way easier to get to us
                    in prison, isn't it, now.

<b>          
</b>          The berth door is slightly ajar. In pops a bottle of Whiskey, then
          Romeo's head. He's expecting a cheer but the brothers have their
          backs to him. He's instantly taken by their ink.

<b>          
</b>          Our trio watches as a DOCK WORKER (22yrs) drives a forklift,
          unloading the crates from the flatbed and driving them through the
          huge open bay doors. The boys and Romeo huddle up.

<b>          
</b>          The "Queen" classic, Another One Bites the Dust, presides over this
          fantasy sequence. The boys, looking more "quaffed," do a pointless
          slow motion walk toward the forklift, throwing up their collars.

<b>          
</b>          Romeo, also looking polished, executes a "Dan Tana" pistol whipping
          on the Dock Worker who perfectly out of frame.

<b>          
</b>          INSIDE WAREHOUSE: The lift pulls to a stop before the gangsters,
          crate on the forks. Romeo is behind the wheel.

<b>          
</b>          SLO-MO: Connor and Murphy pop from the crate and fire on their
          Asian foe, hitting each squarely in the chest.

<b>          
</b>          SLO-MO: The boys leap down and light cigs as Romeo does the "one
          arm action star hang" off the side of the lift in b.g. WHIP PAN...

          pulls a metallic object and shoves it in Romeo's hand.

<b>          
</b>          "Gorgeous" GEORGE (47yrs) is face down as a female masseuse works
          his back, incense, mood music. Eunice silently slides in flashing
          her badge, a finger to her pursed lips.

<b>          
</b>          Uneasy, the woman continues her work as Eunice lotions her hands.
          She covertly replaces the masseuse and motions her out of the room.

          Crew Cut lies on the shop table. He's lost a lot of blood and is in
          shock. Using gardening utensils, the Old Man removes the bullet.
          We see his face for the first time. Unremarkable. In Italian...

<b>

          at the gates of Heaven. Cheesy music as they enter...

</b>          Romeo withdraws two gold plated .45's, intricately engraved, pearl

<b>          EXT. COMMON HOME -- MORNING
</b>

<b>          
</b>          This is a common home at the end of a cul de sac. The Old Man picks
          up the paper on his front stoop and shuts the door.

<b>          
</b>          He opens the paper with shock. A big picture of Crew Cut on the

</b>          The Old Man moves to Crew Cut's bedside. He sees the rosary about

          spy hole and unchains the front doors...

          steps in, stops and grabs his crotch with both hands.

          Greenly to the floor with a gaping wound in his back.

<b>          
</b>          Crew Cut bursts in with a smoking pig nose shotgun hanging from a
          shoulder strap. He pulls two Sigs and rapid fires at the brothers.

<b>          
</b>          The boys jump over the bar frantically try to reassemble their
          weapons. Connor and Murphy check their clips.

</b>          They see a shotgun behind the bar. Murphy grabs it.   Just as they
          are about to stand, they hear Doc cry out.

<b>          
</b>          SLO-MO: Poppa M emerges from the shadows and moves to Crew Cut with
          a smoking, silenced Walther pistol in hand.

<b>          
</b>          The brothers have just a moment of shock before Greenly chokes up
          some blood. They jump the bar and rush to him.

          As they hold Greenly and beg him to hold on, we move to Poppa M

</b>          Poppa M pulls two .38 revolvers. He snaps the rotary chambers out,

          He holds them out to Crew Cut. The boys weep, oblivious to this.

          for his opponent to go first. Crew Cut cocks his hammer back with a
          "click." The brother's eyes go wide.

          throat and he is blown to the floor, grasping his bleeding neck.

<b>

</b>          Over dialogue and music we see the following images...

<b>          
</b>          Noah cuts out a chalk sketch on a large sheet of shoe leather.

<b>          
</b>          Louie helps Noah make a "serious looking" leather vest.

<b>          
</b>          Louie hobbles in with a sack.   He dumps a bevy of handguns on a
          table. All different makes.

                    everything in detail.

<b>          
</b>          Louie draws a map on a note pad and speaks m.o.s.

<b>          
</b>
<b>          
</b>          Holsters and bullet belts are sewn into the vest.

<b>          
</b>          Noah loads the vest with guns as Louie tightens the buckles, stands
          back and looks Noah over. Ominous.

<b>          
</b>          A mob boss and two body guards wait for an elevator. The doors
          open. Insides is Noah, dark jacket, English Mac (hat). He opens
          his coat, revealing the vest. He draws two weapons, executes them
          all and calmly hits a button. The doors close.

                    those who had taken my father from me.

                    How hundreds of years ago, a bunch of
                    desperate gamblers in leaky ass ships,
                    crossed the ocean blue. They had no
                    clue what was on the other side of it.
                    Took real balls. But they sailed into
                    infinity and made it all the way to the
                    shores of the New fucking World...
                             (re: surroundings)
                    ...and all they had was their faith.
                    I'm always surprised how so many people
                    miss the simple fact that faith...is
                    the reason all of us are even here.
                    You can't underestimate the power of
                    it. Shit, you were the ones that
                    taught me that.

<b>          INT. T.V. TALK SHOW, "BOSTON BANTER" -- DAY
</b>

<b>          
</b>          Five guests, BALLPLAYER, COMEDIAN, ACTOR, POLITICIAN and a HOST are
          seated in the midst of an "audience in the round." The format is
          similar to "Politically Incorrect."

<b>                                   BALLPLAYER
</b>                       It doesn't change anything. What they
                       did is still more important. It's
                       still the issue.

<b>

          the same moment.

<b>          
</b>          They are bandaged and hooked to machinery.

</b>                    Well, I know this! They certainly
                    don't belong in prison.

<b>          
</b>          The boys turn and look out the windows at a group of cons in the
          yard, staring up at them.

<b>          
</b>
<b>                                HOST V.O.
</b>                    Oh, I don't know.

<b>          
</b>          Connor and Murphy's faces split with evil grins.   They mimic guns at
          the cons and gesture as if shooting them.

<b>

<b>                                HOST V.O. (CONT'D)
