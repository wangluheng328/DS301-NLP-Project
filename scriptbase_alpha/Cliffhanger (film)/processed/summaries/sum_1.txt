A group of thieves led by Eric Qualen hijack a $100,000,000 delivery en route to a Denver credit union.
Their plan to transfer the money mid-air to collaborators in another plane goes awry, and the hijackers crash land and lose the money in the surrounding mountains.
They radio for help, and former ranger Gabe Walker and his partner Hal Tucker answer the call.
Qualen and his men have a high-tech tracking device that shows them the locations of the three cases of missing money, but they need help traveling through the mountains, so they force Gabe and Hal to be their guides.
Forced to scale a rock face in the middle of a snow storm, Gabe grabs some of the money and escapes.
Gabe knows Qualen will kill Hal as soon as Qualen has the remaining cash, so, with fellow ranger Jessie Deighan, Gabe tries to reach the money before Qualen does.
