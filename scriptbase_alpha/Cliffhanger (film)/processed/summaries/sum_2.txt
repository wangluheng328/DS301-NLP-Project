Gabe hasn't recovered from a terrible climbing accident, so when he's asked to search for a group, missing in the Rockies, he is initially reluctant.
Adding to this the fact he has to work with an old friend, who now hates him; Gabe is not a happy man.
Unknown to Gabe and his 'friend', the group they are out to rescue are armed and dangerous.
The group need a local expert to locate and recover millions of $s of stolen money.
