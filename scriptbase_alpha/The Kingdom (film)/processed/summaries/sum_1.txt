In Saudi Arabia, the employees of an American oil company are attacked.
Later the FBI agent assigned to protect them calls his friend and fellow agent, Ronald Fleury, to come help him find the ones responsible but bureaucracy prevents them from going.
And while talking to his friend, there's another attack and his friend is killed.
So Fleury raises all sorts of hell to get permission to go.
But is still denied but eventually finds a way and so with three other agents they go there.
They begin by trying to check out the scene of the attack but Saudis won't let them.
Later an American diplomat wants them to leave but a Saudi Colonel helps them.
They later meet with a member of the Royal family and they convince him to let them help.
And they start by checking out the scene and finding out what happened.
They later learn that the one responsible is a fanatic who is very difficult to find.
