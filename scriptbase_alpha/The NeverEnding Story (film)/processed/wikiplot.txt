Bastian Bux (Barret Oliver), a quiet boy who loves to read, is accosted by bullies on his way to school.
He hides in a bookstore, interrupting the grumpy bookseller, Mr. Koreander (Thomas Hill).
Bastian asks about one of the books he sees, but Mr. Koreander warns him it is "not safe."
Nevertheless, Bastian "borrows" the book, leaving a note promising to return it, and races towards school.
He then hides in the school's attic to begin reading The Neverending Story.

The book describes the fantasy world of Fantasia which is being threatened by a force called "The Nothing," a void of darkness that consumes everything.
The Childlike Empress (Tami Stronach), who rules over Fantasia from the Ivory Tower, has fallen ill due to the Nothing, and she has summoned Atreyu (Noah Hathaway), a young warrior from the Plains People, to discover the means to end the Nothing.
Atreyu is given AURYN, a medallion to protect and guide him.
As Atreyu sets out, the Nothing summons Gmork (voiced by Alan Oppenheimer), a vicious, but highly intelligent werewolf, to kill Atreyu.
