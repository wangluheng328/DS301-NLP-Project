Bastian is having a hard time recovering from his mother's death when he stumbles into a bookstore and learns of a book that's "not safe".
Unable to resist such a temptation, he borrows the book and begins to read about the land of Fantasia, the land of human fantasy.
The land is being consumed by the Nothingness, and the Empress is dying.
A warrior named Atreyu is chosen to save Fantasia from the Nothingness.
As Bastian reads the adventures, he is drawn into the story, identifying with Atreyu.
Soon, however, he learns what the storekeeper meant about the book when he finds that the characters in the book seem to be aware of him, as well.
All seems hopeless as the Nothingness is consuming Fantasia.
Can Atreyu save them?
Can Bastian?
