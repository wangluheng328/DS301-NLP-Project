Seth Brundle is a scientist working on teleportation.
Just when he thinks he's ironed out the last bug in his system, the intervention of a common house fly turns Seth into a 6 foot insect.
The transformation from man to fly is gradual but horrific, and is witnessed by Veronica; a reporter documenting Seth's story.
Seth has some time to try to find a cure, but is there enough time...?
