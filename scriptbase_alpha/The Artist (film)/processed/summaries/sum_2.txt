In 1927, in Hollywood, the star George Valentin is the pride and joy of the president of the Kinograph Studios Al Zimmer and worshiped by a legion of fans.
Among them is Peppy Miller, who stumbles into George Valentin after the premiere of a silent film.
Peppy kisses George and the photographers take pictures of them.
The next morning, the headlines read "Who is that girl?"
and Peppy is selected in a dancing audition to be an extra in a film.
Over the next few years, Peppy climbs positions in the Kinograph Studios until the advent of talking pictures.
Proud George Valentin does not believe in the 'talkies', breaks off with the studio and decides to produce and direct a silent film.
The film is a complete failure and with the Great Depression, George Valentin falls and is bankrupt.
Meanwhile Peppy Miller rises as new star of Kinograph Studios.
But she never forgets her idol George Valentin.
