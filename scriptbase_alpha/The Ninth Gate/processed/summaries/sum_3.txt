Dean Corso, a somewhat sleazy rare book dealer, is hired by a mysterious patron who has just come into possession of one of the only three copies of The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows (a 17th century occult text said to give its owner unimaginable power).
The man hires Corso to track down the other two copies and compare them to his, but complications - both natural and supernatural - arise at every turn.
