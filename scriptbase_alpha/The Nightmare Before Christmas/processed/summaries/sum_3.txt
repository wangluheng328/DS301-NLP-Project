Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king of Halloween Town, is tired of the same old thing every year.
He wanders into the woods and finds some holiday trees and each has a town in it.
He goes to the Christmas one and finds himself in Christmas Town.
He likes the idea, tells the town to the citizens and they decide to make their own Christmas with their own twist.
