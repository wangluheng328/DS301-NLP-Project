It is the same routine every year in Halloweentown, on Halloween the monsters come out and perform a real scare.
This particular Halloween, the pumpkin king Jack Skellington, bored of the idea, saunters off into the woods with his dog Zero after Halloween night.
Upon the break of dawn, he discovers a clearing of trees with different doors representing various holidays.
The Christmas Tree door attracts his attention and upon entrance into the world of Christmas, Jack is fascinated with this new idea of Christmas that he must absolutely share with the citizens of Halloweentown.
