</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. STREET - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a 
package in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
 </p><p id="dia">Good morning, UPS!
</p><p></p><p id="act">He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
 </p><p id="dia">UPS, good to see you!
</p><p></p><p id="act">He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely 
around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
 </p><p id="dia">Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">The UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front 
steps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package 
behind him and back down the steps.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He goes back, retrieves the package, then enters the building.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. LOBBY - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Several people stand in the elevator. The UPS Man just makes it, but the door closes on the 
package... REPEATEDLY. He feigns embarrassment.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. 3RD FLOOR - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts 
kicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of 
APARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door.
</p><p></p><p id="act">We hear a small dog barking.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GRUFF MAN (O.S.)
 </p><p id="dia">Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt!
</p><p></p><p id="act">An angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GRUFF MAN
 </p><p id="dia">What do you want?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
 </p><p id="dia">UPS, sir. And how are you this
afternoon? Alrighty then!
</p><p></p><p id="act">The man grumpily unchains the door. He's a big guy - 6'5", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. A 
small Shiatsu stands beside him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
 </p><p id="dia">I have a package for you.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The UPS guy thrusts the package toward the man. We can clearly hear broken glass inside. The 
man takes the package.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GRUFF MAN
 </p><p id="dia">It sounds broken.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
 </p><p id="dia">Most likely sir! I bet it was
something nice though! Now... I
haver an insurance form. If you'll
just sign here, here, and here,
and initial here, and print your name
here, we'll get the rest of the
forms out to you as soon as we
can.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. The dog wags his tail and whines. We can see 
that he likes the UPS guy.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
 </p><p id="dia">That's a lovely dog you have. Do
you mind if I pet him, sir?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GRUFF MAN
</p><p id="spkdir">(mumbles)
 </p><p id="dia">I don't give a rat's ass.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
 </p><p id="dia">Oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GRUFF MAN
</p><p id="spkdir">(under breath)
 </p><p id="dia">Brother.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Before the Gruff Man can finish, the UPS Man stands back up and takes the form again.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
 </p><p id="dia">That's fine sir. I can fill out
the rest. You just have yourself
a good day. Take care, now! 'Bye
'bye, then!
</p><p></p><p id="act">THRASH MUSIC STARTS
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. HALLWAY -- CONT'D
</p><p></p><p id="act">The UPS Man moves swiftly down the hall and into the stair well.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D
</p><p></p><p id="act">The Gruff Man shakes the box, tosses it down and sits in front of the TV.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONT'D
</p><p></p><p id="act">The UPS Man bursts from the front door and hustles down the street very quickly. He passes 
several people.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">UPS MAN
</p><p id="spkdir">(quickly)
 </p><p id="dia">UPS, S'cuse me. UPS, comin'
through.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D
</p><p></p><p id="act">We see the back of the Shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door. He has not moved an inch. 
The Gruff Man looks over.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GRUFF MAN
 </p><p id="dia">Hey, stupid! Get away from the
door!
</p><p></p><p id="act">The dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. He gets up and heads for the dog.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GRUFF MAN
 </p><p id="dia">What's the matter with you, I said
<b>GIT!!!
</b></p><p></p><p id="act">He roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a 
stuffed dog. Around it's neck is a business card that reads, "You have been had by Ace Ventura - 
Pet Detective." He breathes fire.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GRUFF MAN
 </p><p id="dia">Son of a bitch!
</p><p></p><p id="act">He smashes the dog to the ground.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. ALLEY - CONT'D
</p><p></p><p id="act">As the UPS Man/Ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the Shiatsu's head 
sticks out. Ace is gloating.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
</p><p id="spkdir">(announcer's voice)
 </p><p id="dia">That was a close one, ladies and
gentlemen. Unfortunately, in
every contest, there must be...
<b>A LOOSER!
</b></p><p></p><p id="act">He jumps into an old beat-up Chevy Bel Air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE (CONT'D)
 </p><p id="dia">LOOOHOOOSERRRHERRR!
</p><p></p><p id="act">He then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow.
</p><p></p><p id="act">He tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. The dog shoots him a look.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
</p><p id="spkdir">(to dog)
 </p><p id="dia">No problem, it gets flooded.
We'll just wait a few seconds.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace sits back. SMASH!!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">From Ace's POV we see a Baseball bat shatter the front windshield.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Or, we could try it now.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace frantically tries to start the car. His new friend continues around the car beating the living shit 
out of it.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Oooh, boy.
</p><p></p><p id="act">ACE'S POV
</p><p></p><p id="act">We see the creep wailing on the car in Ace's side view mirror.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Warning! Assholes are closer than
they appear!
</p><p></p><p id="act">The dog is barking insanely.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
</p><p id="spkdir">(to dog)
 </p><p id="dia">You think you can do better?!
</p><p></p><p id="act">The baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Wanna give me a push while you're
back there?
</p><p></p><p id="act">BOOM! The back window shatters. Then the car's engine roars to life. Ace rejoices.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">FARFEGNUGENNNNN!!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel, screaming bloody murder.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. MIAMI CITY STREETS - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace and his new pal speed away freely.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Close on the happy dog, hanging his head out the car window. PAN across the broken windshield 
to Ace, also hanging his head out the window to see where he's going.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The car drives by a sign on a telephone pole: "Reward" -- with a picture of the Shiatsu in Ace's 
seat.
</p><p></p><p id="act">THRASH MUSIC ENDS
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. HOUSE - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">A very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the Shiatsu.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOMAN
 </p><p id="dia">My little baby. You missed mommy
didn't you? Did daddy hurt you?
I won't let him, no I won't. He
may have kept the big screen TV,
but he's not gonna keep my baby.
No he isn't.
</p><p id="spkdir">(very sexy to Ace)
 </p><p id="dia">Thank you, Mr. Ventura. How can I
ever repay you?
</p><p></p><p id="act">She slinks over to Ace and puts her arms around his neck.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Well, the reward would be good,
and there was some damage to my –
</p><p></p><p id="act">She cuts Ace off with a devastating kiss.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOMAN
 </p><p id="dia">Would you like me to take you
pants off instead?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Ummmm… Sure.
</p><p></p><p id="act">She pulls him toward the bedroom.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOMAN
 </p><p id="dia">It takes a big man to stand up to
my husband. He's already put two
of my lovers in the hospital.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">How did he find out? Does he have
you followed.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">WOMAN
 </p><p id="dia">No… I tell him
</p><p></p><p id="act">She plants a kiss on Ace's neck and pulls him down out of frame onto the bed.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">The stands are empty, but there's plenty happening on the field. The Miami Dolphins are 
practicing. Dan Marino is in top form, hitting pass after pass.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Behind one of the goal posts, the team's mascot, a rare dolphin (SNOWFLAKE), wearing #4, is 
practicing his routine. The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback.
</p><p></p><p id="act">TRAINER
Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Snowflake swims over, snatches a small football out of the Trainer's hand, and does an end zone 
dance on his tail. He then returns the ball to the trainer.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake "kicks" a perfect field goal. The 
Trainer blows a whistle and raises both arms.
</p><p></p><p id="act">DISSOLVE TO:
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHT
</p><p></p><p id="act">The stadium is now completely empty. Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Suddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The rear door slides open. Two men jump out in wet suits.
</p><p></p><p id="act">They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Snowflake surfaces to check out the action. One of the men holds out a fish. Snowflake eagerly 
takes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. Snowflake thrashes around.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. But the needle has done its 
job. Snowflake quickly goes limp.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. Move in on Snowflake's face. His excited cackle 
has turned into a painful whimper.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The truck skids away passing the guard gate. The guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free 
himself.
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. ADELLE'S FRIENDLY PET SHOP - NEXT DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Close up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper. We pull back to reveal ADELLE 
ROSENBERG, the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop. She's handing a live goldfish in 
a bag to JENNIFER,  a very sweet nine year old.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ADELLE

remember… this kind of fish
doesn't like it in the freezer.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ADELLE
 </p><p id="dia">Don't worry, I'll make sure she

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">EINHORN
 </p><p id="dia">He's lying! Shoot him!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace walks over to her.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Let's just see who's lying. Would
a real woman have to wear one of
these?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace dramatically pulls at Einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. Einhorn's head flies back. The hair is 
real. Ace keeps tugging it.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The SWAT team ready themselves.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE (CONT'D)
 </p><p id="dia">Boy, that's really on there! But
tell me this: Would a real woman
be missing these?!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace rips open Einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The sharp shooters are tensing. Ace is laughing nervously now.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Ha, ha, ha! That kind of surgery
can be done over the weekend! But
I doubt if she could find the time
during her busy schedule to get
rid of Mr. Knish!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace rips off Einhorn's skirt. Einhorn now stands there fully nude. She appears to be the perfect 
figure of a woman.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Oooh boy.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders. Then, just when it seems all is lost, Dan 
Marino who is back behind Einhorn, motions for Ace to come over.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MARINO
 </p><p id="dia">Psst… Ace. Come here.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
</p><p id="spkdir">(to everyone)
 </p><p id="dia">Could you excuse me just a second.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace goes to Dan. Melissa still holds Emilio hostage.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">EINHORN
 </p><p id="dia">Shoot him. Shoot him, now!!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MELISSA
</p><p id="spkdir">(to cops)
 </p><p id="dia">Don't anybody make a move!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Marino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the 
crowd.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed
colleague Mr. Marino, has just
brought some new evidence to my
attention. Now, history has
certainly shown that even the most
intuitive criminal minds can be
wrong, from time to time. But, if
I have been mistaken… if the
lieutenant is indeed a woman…
then my friends, she is suffering
from the worst case of hemorrhoids
I have ever seen!!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace spins Einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle 
has learned to keep tucked between his legs. (And if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.)
</p><p></p><p id="act">Everyone gasps. CLOSE UP ON EINHORN/FINKLE. He finally drops the facade.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FINKLE
</p><p id="spkdir">(deepest voice possible)
 </p><p id="dia">It was Marino's fault. The laces
were in.
</p><p id="spkdir">(breaking down now)
 </p><p id="dia">They were IN!!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. Then Emilio spits.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting. They all have kissed her/him/it. Even Snowflake blows his 
spout.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">Somebody read it its rights.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Suddenly, Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FINKLE
 </p><p id="dia">DIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY!!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Thinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake's makeshift tank. After 
a few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FINKLE
</p><p id="spkdir">(gasping for air)
 </p><p id="dia">Help I can't swim!!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Finkle goes under again. We see him under water sinking down.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side 
of the pool. Finkle lies there exhausted.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We 
see that it's the ring with the missing stone. Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. It's a 
perfect fit.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">LLLOOOSER! LLOO HOO SERR HERR
<b>HERR!!!
</b></p><p></p><p id="act">Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">EMILIO
 </p><p id="dia">Melissa… you can give me back my
gun now.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Now Aguado appears beside Ace.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">AGUADO
 </p><p id="dia">I don't know how you did it,
Ventura… but that was damn good
police work. Alright guys, let's
wrap this up!
</p><p></p><p id="slug">EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">Twenty or more police cars in single file provide more than ample escort for…
</p><p></p><p id="act">…Ace and Marino in Ace's Chevy Bel-Aire with the cracked windshield. Both of them have their 
heads sticking out so that they can see. Marino has a wad of gum in his mouth.
</p><p></p><p id="act">HIGH ANGLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">The long line of flashing lights and cop cars drives at top speed up Route One. Ace's Bel-Aire 
right in the middle.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MARINO (O.S.)
 </p><p id="dia">hey Ace?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE (O.S.)
 </p><p id="dia">Yeah, Dan?
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MARINO (O.S.)
 </p><p id="dia">Got any more gum?
</p><p></p><p id="act">CUT TO:
</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. STADIUM - DAY
</p><p></p><p id="act">The Super Bowl Halftime Show is in progress. Marino is in uniform warming up. Emilio is 
drooling at the cheerleaders. Ace and Melissa are standing near the fifty yard line taking in the 
awesome spectacle.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Some fireworks go off around the tank. A  marching band plays a triumphant tune. We see a 
helicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying Snowflake.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
 </p><p id="dia">Ladies and gentlemen, the Miami
Dolphins are proud to welcome back
to BOBBY RIDDLE Stadium, our
beloved mascot and star of the
halftime show…
</p><p></p><p id="act">ANGLE ON
</p><p></p><p id="act">The helicopter lowering Snowflake into his tank.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
 </p><p id="dia">Snowflake!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">As the crowd roars, Melissa turns to Ace, and with Snowflake in the background performing 
spectacular flips, they kiss.
</p><p></p><p id="act">ANOTHER ANGLE
</p><p></p><p id="act">As Melissa and Ace kiss, the prized 'White Pigeon' lands on a Gatorade dispenser in the 
foreground. Ace spots it and starts to make a move.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Just as he closes in for the grab, the Philadelphia Eagles mascot eagle walks up to get a drink and 
shoos the pigeon away. Ace is furious.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">You idiot! Do you know what
you've done?!
</p><p></p><p id="act">The giant eagle head looks up at Ace.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MASCOT
 </p><p id="dia">Huh?
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace grabs him.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">You just cost me ten thousand
bucks, Polly!
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MASCOT
 </p><p id="dia">Yeah Blow me.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ACE
 </p><p id="dia">REE HEE HEE HEELYYY?!!!
</p><p></p><p id="act">PULL BACK to find Eagle's mascot and Ace arguing. We can't hear what's said, but there's a lot 
of finger pointing.
</p><p></p><p id="act">Emilio stops his leering to check out what's going on.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The ANNOUNCER up in the booth reads a release.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANNOUNCER
 </p><p id="dia">The National Football League would
now like to offer a special thank
you to the man who rescued Dan
Marino and our beloved
Snowflake…
</p><p></p><p id="act">On the field the mascot shoves Ace. Ace shoves back.
</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ANNOUNCER (CONT'D)
 </p><p id="dia">A great humanitarian, and lover of
all animals… Mr. Ace Ventura!
</p><p></p><p id="act">Ace is straddling the eagle, pounding the shit out of giant head.
</p><p></p><p id="act">The image is flashed on the big stadium screen. We freeze frame on this huge picture of Ace, as he 
looks into camera with his fist raised.
</p><p></p><p id="act">MUSIC UP: THRASH METAL
</p><p></p><p id="act">ROLL CREDITS
</p><p></p><p id="act">THE END
</p><p></p><p id="act">(LOKI NOTE: My copy of this script has the bloody end of Vinnie and Roc physically crossed out 
by three black marker lines, presumably by the authors. Fortunately, they were crossed out 
diagonally, so I could still type the scene out for all to enjoy.)
