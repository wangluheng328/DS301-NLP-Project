He's the best there is.
In fact, he's the only one there is!
He's Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.
Ace is on the case to find the Miami Dolphins' missing mascot and quarterback Dan Marino.
He goes eyeball to eyeball with a man-eating shark, stakes out the Miami Dolphins and woos and wows the ladies.
Whether he's undercover, under fire or underwater, he always gets his man .

or beast!
