In 1979, the US Embassy in Iran is stormed by protesters who then take everyone there captive.
But 6 members manage to get out and go to the Canadian embassy.
After a few months, the 6 are still there.
And it's only a matter of time before the Iranians discover that 6 members of the embassy staff are missing.
So the CIA must find a way to get them out.
And so far they can't come up with a way.
Tony Mendez, an ex filtration expert comes up with a plan.
He will go in as a producer scouting for shooting locations for a movie and that the 6 are part of the production crew.
So he goes to Hollywood and with help from a friend, makes it appear that he is a producer.
And the movie they're producing is called Argo.
Eventually he goes to Iran to tell them what they have to do.
