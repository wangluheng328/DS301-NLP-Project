Return to a time when men and swamps were swamps.
Fire Swamps, that is.
Full of quicksand and Rodents of Unusual Size.
Lagoons were inhabited by shrieking eels.
And the most beautiful woman in the world was named .
.
.
Buttercup?
Well, it's a bent fairy tale.
Complete with all the fencing, chasing, escapes, and silly accents you'd expect.
Including such unique folk as Inigo Montoya, who has dreamed his whole life of finding the six-fingered man who killed his father.
Fezzik is his enormous sidekick.
And Max is the kvetching miracle man.
Blonde Buttercup loves Westley, a poor stable boy.
But when he's captured by pirates, she's chosen by evil Prince Humperdinck to be his princess bride.
Along the way, she gets kidnapped, he gets killed.
But it all ends up okay.
