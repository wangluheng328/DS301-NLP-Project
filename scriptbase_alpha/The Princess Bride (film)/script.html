<b>FADE IN ON:
</b>
<b>A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN
</b>
The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

</b>
<b>THIS KID
</b>
lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             A little bit.

<b>                         MOTHER
</b>             Guess what.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             What?

<b>                         MOTHER
</b>             Your grandfather's here.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>                  (not overjoyed)
             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
             sick?

<b>                         MOTHER
</b>             You are sick, that's why he's here.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

<b>                         MOTHER
</b>             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             I brought you a special present.

<b>                         THE KID

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             A book?

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

             It doesn't sound too bad. I'll

<b>                         GRANDFATHER

             The Princess Bride, by S.
             Morgenstern. Chapter One.
             Buttercup was raised on a small
             farm in the country of Florin.

The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of
the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English
countryside.

</b>                  (off-screen)
             Her favorite pastimes were riding
             her horse and tormenting the farm
             boy that worked there. His name
             was Westley, but she never called
             him that.
                  (to the kid)
             Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

             Yeah. It's really good.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (off-screen reading)
             Nothing gave Buttercup as much
             pleasure as ordering Westley
             around.

<b>BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY
</b>
BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
                  (a beat)
             --please.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

<b>BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (off-screen)
             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP

                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red
glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.

             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace.

             It was a very emotional time for

</b>             Of course you will.

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

             Westley didn't reach his

             Five years later, the main square
             of Florin City was filled as

<b>A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

</b>             A word, my lady?

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             We are but poor, lost circus
             performers. Is there a village
             nearby?

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             There is nothing nearby; not for
             miles.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL
</b>
A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

</b>
The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             What is that you're ripping?

</b>                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             Who's Guilder?

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

<b>                         INIGO

                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Probably he means no harm.

<b>                         FEZZIK

<b>                         INIGO

             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)

</b>                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

<b>                         FEZZIK

<b>                         FEZZIK

As Vizzini screams we:

</b>
<b>THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Why are you doing that?
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.
</b>

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Making sure nobody's following us.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             That would be inconceivable.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

</b>             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have

</b>             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM
</b>
It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.

And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

</b>
<b>THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM
</b>
And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI
</b>
staring at the other boat.

</b>                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Go in, get after her!

<b>                         INIGO

             I only dog paddle.

</b>
<b>BUTTERCUP
</b>
still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

</b>             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

</b>             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.

-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

</b>                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

</b>
<b>THE SICK KID'S ROOM
</b>
The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             What?

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             Because I can stop now if you want.

<b>                         THE KID

He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

</b>             Put her down. Just put her down.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b>
The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)

And once he's said the name--

</b>
<b>THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

<b>THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

</b>
<b>INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.

And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

<b>                         FEZZIK

</b>             You were supposed to be this

up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.

sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

</b>             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.

             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Slow going?

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Sorry.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
</b>

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I swear on the soul of my father,

Inigo.

             Thank you.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>                  (fondling it-impressed)

Even now, this still brings pain.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...

He touches his scars.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK

             swordplay?

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the

</b>
<b>THE TWO OF THEM
</b>
And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

</b>
<b>THE TWO MEN
</b>
finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.
</b>

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.

<b>                         INIGO

             You are wonderful!

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Because I know something you
             don't know.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             And what is that?

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>
stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

<b>                                            CUT TO:

</b>

A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             You're amazing!

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Tell me.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>
who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.
</b>

He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
staring in awe.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Who are you?!

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             No one of consequence.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I must know.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Get used to disappointment.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Okay.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>
Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

<b>                                            CUT TO:

</b>

<b>THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD
</b>
as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>
moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

</b>
<b>THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD
</b>
sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Kill me quickly.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>CLOSE UP: VIZZINI
</b>
<b>                         VIZZINI

<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.
</b>

<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>A COUPLE OF ROCKS
</b>
Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

<b>                                            DISSOLVE TO:
</b><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.
</b>

<b>THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>
racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>FEZZIK
</b>
He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
</b>

He flips the rock away.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN
</b>
The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>FEZZIK
</b>
as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             You're quick.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             And a good thing too.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
</b>

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>FEZZIK
</b>
as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>
And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b><b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.
</b>

<b>ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH
</b>
Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>
And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Why should that make such a
             difference?

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>FEZZIK
</b>
and there isn't much breath coming.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>
holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>FEZZIK
</b>
as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.
</b>

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>PRINCE HUMPERDINCK
</b>
as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

<b>                         HUMPERDINCK
</b>             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

<b>                         RUGEN
</b>             Who won? How did it end?

<b>                         HUMPERDINCK
</b>                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

<b>                         RUGEN
</b>             Shall we track them both?

<b>                         HUMPERDINCK
</b>             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned

<b>                         RUGEN

             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

</b>
<b>THE MAN IN BLACK
</b>
cresting the peak of the mountain.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>CLOSE-UP ON
</b>
a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Let me explain-

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>BUTTERCUP'S THROAT
</b>
as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>

stopping fast.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             You're that smart?

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Yes.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Morons.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.
</b>

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             To the death?

Another nod.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             I accept.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Inhale this, but do not touch.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Hmm.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>VIZZINI
</b>
watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.
</b>

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Australia.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

<b>                         VIZZINI
</b>             -- what in the world can that be?

</b>             What? Where? I don't see anything.

<b>                                            CUT TO:

</b>             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK

             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK

             is "Never get involved in a land

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

             I know who you are -- your

The Man In Black says nothing.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP

tears.

             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP

             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK

<b>                         BUTTERCUP

</b>             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or

             It was the "please" that caught

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
</b>             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP

<b>                         MAN IN BLACK
</b>             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

</b>             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

she pushes him with all the strength she has.

</b>             You can die too, for all I care!!

to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.

Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

</b>             ... as ... you ... wish...

</b>             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

The Prince shakes his head.

</b>             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account

<b>THE RAVINE FLOOR
</b>
TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             Can you move at all?

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             Well ... you were dead.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             Death cannot stop true love. All

<b>                         BUTTERCUP

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

             and Buttercup raced along the

nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

<b>THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP
</b>
Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             Singed a bit, were you?

<b>                         BUTTERCUP

He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

</b>
<b>WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

</b>
<b>THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
</b>

There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

</b>
<b>SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.

</b>

<b>                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
</b>             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

<b>HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --
</b>
An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

</b>
<b>THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

<b>                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.

</b>

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

<b>                         HUMPERDINCK

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

<b>FADE IN ON:

<b>THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

<b>SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

<b>                         ALBINO
</b>             The Prince and the Count always

<b>                         WESTLEY

The albino nods.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

<b>                         WESTLEY

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are

<b>                         HUMPERDINCK
</b>             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

<b>THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY
</b>
A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

<b>                         YELLIN
</b>                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

<b>                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
</b>             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.

<b>                         YELLIN
</b>             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

<b>                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
</b>             Ho there.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

<b>                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
</b>             But the Prince gave orders --

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

</b>                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             Hello.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             It's you.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

Inigo sits slumped in a chair, while FEZZIK spoons him some
stew.

             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

<b>TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             How many could you handle?

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             I don't think more than ten.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my

             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.

                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.

             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Thank you.

<b>                                            CUT TO:

<b>A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR
</b>
The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Father, I have failed you for

             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Guide my sword.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE GROVE OF TREES
</b>
as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

<b>                                            CUT TO:

heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             Westley's only faking, right?

<b>                         GRANDFATHER

</b>             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>                  (shaking his head)

                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO, IN DESPAIR
</b>
We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             The body?

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             I have a little.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
</b>

As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>A HOVEL - DUSK
</b>
Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

<b>                         LITTLE OLD GUY
</b>                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute

<b>                         FEZZIK

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX

             You are the Brute Squad.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             We need a miracle. It's very

<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.
</b>

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             He's already dead.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

</b>
<b>INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Sir. Sir.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX

</b>                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a

             miracles. You got money?

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Sixty-five.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.

             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>             Are you a rotten liar.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             I need him to help avenge my

             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             What's that?

He stops pumping.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.

He starts pumping again.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX

             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

<b>                         MIRACLE MAX
</b>             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

<b>                         FEZZIK

             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

<b>                         FEZZIK

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.

             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

<b>                         INIGO

</b>
<b>INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

<b>                         INIGO

<b>                         INIGO

             Please. FEZZIK!

             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

<b>                                            CUT TO:

him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

<b>BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

</b>                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

<b>                         QUEEN
</b>             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come

Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

<b>                         KING
</b>             What was that for?

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

<b>                         KING

                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

</b>
trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

<b>                         INIGO

and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

<b>                         RUGEN
</b>             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all

             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>BUTTERCUP
</b>
shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>WESTLEY
</b>
lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>                  (gently)
             Gently.

<b>                         BUTTERCUP
</b>             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

<b>                         WESTLEY
</b>                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>COUNT RUGEN
</b>
looking very much surprised.

<b>                         RUGEN
</b>             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

<b>PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</b>
Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.
</b>

<b>                         RUGEN
</b>             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

<b>                                            CUT TO:

stepping back, going for the heart again.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

</b>
stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>INIGO
</b>
slowly pushing away from the wall.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,

</b>

<b>COUNT RUGEN
</b>
suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

<b>                                            CUT TO:

<b>INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,

             die.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE COUNT
</b>
And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

<b>                         RUGEN

</b>
retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>                  (all he's got)

</b>             No --

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

<b>                         RUGEN
</b>             -- yes --

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

<b>                         RUGEN
</b>             -- all that I have and more
             please --

<b>                         INIGO

<b>INIGO
</b>
and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

<b>INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

<b>INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

</b>             Oh, Westley, will you ever

<b>                         BUTTERCUP

</b>             It won't be the last. To the pain

             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

<b>                         FEZZIK
</b>             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each

<b>SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

<b>                         INIGO
</b>             You know, it's very strange -- I

             so long, now that it's over, I

Now from that --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS
</b>
triumphantly racing through the night --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY
</b>
and at last their trials are done. They stop.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...

As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE KID'S BEDROOM
</b>
The Grandfather stops reading.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             What? What?

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             Okay.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY
</b>
locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,
             the most pure. This one left them
             all behind. The end.

<b>                                            CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE KID'S ROOM
</b>
The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             Okay.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.
<b>---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
</b>

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             Grandpa?

The Old Man stops, turns.

<b>                         THE KID
</b>             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

<b>                         GRANDFATHER
</b>                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

<b>FINAL FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>THE END.
