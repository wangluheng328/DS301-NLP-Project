A May-December romance.
He's 48, on the cover of New York magazine, an upscale restaurateur, and a womanizer who rejects ideas of love.
She's 22, living with her grandmother, artistic, facing a tumor that's life-threatening, which she tells him about the morning after their first night, when he tells her not to expect permanence from him.
Will finds Charlotte unprecedented and unpredictable, and experiences feelings of love, but she packs him off when he's casually unfaithful.
He's stung, and he's also flummoxed by the appearance of a young woman from his past.
Can he convince Charlotte to take him back, and can he help her through her illness and change his irresponsible ways?
