The ultimate forms of terror are about to be unleashed once again.
Dream demon Freddy Krueger is desperate to terrorize the teenagers of Elm St. once again, but he can't since the parents of Springwood have found a way to make the kids forget about him while doping them up with dream suppressant Hypnocil.
So, in order to inspire terror, Freddy manipulates hulking, hockey-masked serial killer Jason Voorhees, through visions of his mother, to go to Elm Street and dispatch the kids so the town will think that Freddy has returned.
But his plans don't go according to schedule when Jason starts to kill all of his "children," which really angers Freddy.
And that's when Jason finds out that Freddy has used him, which really sends him over the edge.
So, it's up to teens Will Rollins, Lori Campbell, and Kia, along with a few other survivors, to get Jason back to Camp Crystal Lake and Freddy out of the dream world for both of them to kill each other once and for all...
