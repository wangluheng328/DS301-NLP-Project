In Mexico, police officer Javier Rodriguez (del Toro) and his partner Manolo Sanchez (Vargas) stop a drug transport and arrest the couriers.
Their arrest is interrupted by General Salazar (Milian), a high-ranking Mexican official who decides to hire Javier.
Salazar instructs him to apprehend Francisco Flores (Collins), a hitman for the Tijuana Cartel, headed by the Obregón brothers.

Back in Tijuana, Flores, under torture, gives Salazar the names of important members of the Obregón cartel, who are arrested.
Javier and Salazar's efforts begin to cripple the Obregón brothers' cocaine outfit, but Javier soon discovers Salazar is a pawn for the Juárez Cartel, the rival of the Obregón brothers.
That entire portion of the Mexican anti-drug campaign is a fraud, as Salazar is wiping out one cartel because he has aligned with another for profit.

Javier's partner Sanchez attempts to sell the information of Salazar's true affiliation to the DEA but is killed for his betrayal.
Javier, who can no longer stomach working for Salazar, decides to make a deal with the DEA.
In exchange for his testimony, Javier requests electricity in his neighborhood so the kids can play baseball at night rather than be tempted by street gangs and crime.
Salazar's secrets are revealed to the public and he is arrested and dies in prison.

Javier explains to the media about the widespread corruption in the police force and army.
In Mexico, Javier watches as children play baseball at night in their new stadium.
