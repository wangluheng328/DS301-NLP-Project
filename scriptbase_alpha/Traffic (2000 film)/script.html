                             Simon Moore



<b>	EXT. COLUMBUS, OHIO - DAY
</b>
	The state capital of Ohio.  It's an impressive building for 
	a city this size.

<b>	SUPERTITLE: COLUMBUS, OHIO - STATE CAPITAL
</b>
<b>	INT. OHIO STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY
</b>
	In chambers striving for august, JUSTICES listen to a lawyer 
	MR. RODMAN, argue his case before the highest court in Ohio.  
	Mr. Rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice.

<b>				MR. RODMAN
</b>		This informant, paid by the police, 
		using taxpayers dollars to continue 
		his felony drug habit, was the link 
		which allowed police to raid a private 
		farm.  A working farm.  A farm where 
		honest Americans make their living.

	One particular justice, ROBERT WAKEFIELD, younger than the 
	others, is clearly bemused by this performance.

<b>				MR. RODMAN
</b>		The government, in its haste, has 
		employed an army of criminals whose 
		allegiance to the truth is, at
		best, questionable --

	Judge Wakefield interrupts --

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Mr. Rodman...it's too bad your client 
		didn't show as much sense in choosing 
		what he planted as he did in choosing 
		his attorney...

	A polite chuckle from the justices --

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Lately the only variation I'm hearing 
		in your argument is the name of the 
		client.  And you can sit there all 
		day arguing the ins and outs of 
		Illinois v. Gates, but you aren't 
		going to convince me that this country 
		has not sanctioned the use of 
		anonymous informants.
			(beat)
		Furthermore, there is no sacred 
		protection of property rights in the 
		United Sates.  When you make the 
		decision to have marijuana on your 
		farm, whether it's one joint or an 
		acre of plants, your property can be 
		seized and your property can be sold.

<b>				MR. RODMAN
</b>		I'm sorry the court finds my argument 
		repetitious.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Mr. Rodman, may I offer a piece of 
		advice?  The next time you argue 
		this point before this court, 
		regardless of my whereabouts, I 
		recommend you have something up your 
		sleeve other than your arm.

<b>	INT. ROBERT'S CHAMBERS - DAY
</b>
	The office is marble and dark wood.  A young CLERK, black, 
	29, enters carrying an oddly-shaped gift.  They both look at 
	it.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		What do you think it is?

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Depends who it's from.

<b>				CLERK
</b>			(reading the card)
		Your friends at Warren, Putnam and 
		Hudson.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		You can learn a lot about somebody 
		from this stuff.  Three categories: 
		you like me, you hate me, you want 
		something from me.
			(re: the elaborate 
			box)
		Definitely third category.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		What would a law firm want from the 
		new drug Czar?

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Depends on the state.

<b>				CLERK
</b>			(checks)
		Arizona.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Medicinal marijuana initiative.
			(beat)
		Or am I being cynical?

	They both laugh.  Robert reaches up and pulls a bottle of 
	Scotch from a shelf.  He pours a couple of fingers in two 
	glasses.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Maybe there's a book in it.

	The clerk takes one of the glasses.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Not by me.

	They toast and drink.

<b>	EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
	Robert exits, trailed by a small group of reporters.  He 
	gets into a car being driven by two security TYPES.

<b>	INT. AIRPLANE - DAY
</b>
	Robert sits in a business class window seat.

<b>	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	An expensive hotel.  Robert Wakefield stands at the window, 
	looking at the view of our nation's capital.

<b>	SUPERTITLE: WASHINGTON D.C.
</b>
<b>	ON THE TABLE
</b>
	The remnants of a meal.  It was a steak and a small caesar 
	salad.  The wine glass is half-empty.

<b>	ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT
</b>
	In front of the mirror now, trying on a dark, tasteful jacket.

<b>	CLOSER
</b>
	On Robert in the same position, only now we are in HIS HOME.  
	It's daytime, and his wife BARBARA is helping him into this 
	same jacket.  As her hands dust the lint off his shoulders

<b>					WE MATCH CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	ROBERT
</b>
	In the hotel rooms, making the same motions.  Satisfied, he 
	straightens, then turns to look at himself.

<b>	OMITTED
</b>
<b>	ANGLE ON ROBERT
</b>
	Back at the hotel room window now.  Reaches to the table and 
	lifts the wine glass.

<b>							CUT TO:
</b>
<b>	EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY
</b>
	This is the middle of nowhere.  Scrub cactus and dust and a 
	heartless sun.

<b>	SUPERTITLE: MEXICO - TWENTY MILES SOUTHWEST OF TIJUANA.
</b>
	A broken down-looking Police Sedan is parked on the side of 
	the road.  It seems abandoned except there are TWO MEN inside.

<b>	INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY
</b>
	Two Mexican men, State Police officers, JAVIER RODRIGUEZ, 
	30's, and MANUEL "MANOLO" SANCHEZ, 20's, wearing jeans, knock-
	off Polo shirts, and cowboy boots, wait patiently in the 
	car.

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		I had that dream again.

	A long pause.

<b>				MANOLO
</b>		Which one?

	Another long pause.

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		Where my mother's suffocating.

	They continue to wait until there is the sound of a JET 
	ENGINE.  It grows LOUDER as it approaches.

<b>	EXT. THE POLICE SEDAN - DAY
</b>
	The shadow of a large plane crosses the desert floor.  Then, 
	an old DC-3 flies fifty feet above the Police Sedan.

<b>	INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY
</b>
	They watch the plane disappear over a small rise in the 
	desert.  They look at each other and wait some more.

<b>	EXT. MEXICAN DESERT - LATER
</b>
	From the direction of the landing strip, a moving van lumbers 
	down the road, two TEENAGERS in the cab.

<b>	INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY
</b>
	Javi and Manolo watch the moving van approach.  Javi reaches 
	under the seat and picks up a bubble flasher.  He rolls down 
	the window and plants it on the roof.  He flips the switch.

	Nothing happens.  He jiggles the wire and the siren BURPS 
	and the light flashes.  Manolo and Javi step from the car, 
	smiling.

<b>	EXT. MEXICAN DESERT - DAY
</b>
	The moving van slows to a stop.  Javi approaches.  The DRIVER 
	unhurriedly rolls down the window.

<b>				DRIVER
</b>		Is there a problem?

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		No.  There's no problem.

	The driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his 
	wallet.

<b>				DRIVER
</b>		Okay.  I see.  How much do you want?

	The driver pulls a wad of bills.  Javi shakes his head.

<b>				DRIVER
</b>		You want more than this?

	Javi shakes his head.  The driver exchanges a look with his 
	partner.

<b>				DRIVER
</b>		You want something else?

	Javi smiles.  The driver gets out and walks to the back of 
	the truck.  He opens the rear door.  There are neatly-stacked 
	crates marked with a SCORPION logo and "911."  He reaches 
	into one of them and pulls out a tightly-sealed package also 
	with the scorpion stamped on it.  He turns to see Javi with 
	his gun drawn.

	Manolo, at the passenger side, has also drawn his gun and is 
	motioning the partner to move to the back of the truck.

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		Drop the package.  Put your hands 
		behind your head.  You're under 
		arrest.

	The driver hesitates.  He starts to comply then looks at 
	Javi and Manolo.

<b>				DRIVER
</b>		I don't understand.  I think there 
		must be some mistake.

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		No, there's no mistake.

	Javi motions to Manolo who cuffs both teenagers.  The driver 
	begins spewing OBSCENITIES under his breath.  Javi puts the 
	driver in the front of the Shadow.  Manolo follows in the 
	moving van.

<b>	OMITTED
</b>
<b>	OMITTED
</b>
<b>	EXT. DIRT ROAD - MEXICO - LATER
</b>
	The truck follows the Shadow down a desert road.

	Suddenly, from behind, four armored SUV's with tinted windows 
	appear, closing fast.

	The SUV's force both vehicles off the road where they pull 
	to a stop.  A long beat as hot wind blows desert detritus 
	past the truck.

	Finally, the SUV doors open and FEDERAL POLICE OFFICERS 
	surround them like a SWAT team.

	The passenger door of the lead SUV opens and GENERAL ARTURO 
	SALAZAR, 50's, a squat, powerful presence in a perfectly 
	pressed uniform gets out and approaches Javi.

<b>				SALAZAR
</b>			(to Javier)
		What's your name?

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		Javier Rodriguez.

<b>				SALAZAR
</b>		Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done 
		a very good job, but we'll take care 
		of it from here.

	Javier stares into the implacable reflection of his 
	sunglasses.  In the distance, the DC-3 takes off and ROARS 
	over their heads.

<b>				SALAZAR
</b>		We've been following these Narco-
		trafficantes for some time but had 
		not been able to bring them to 
		justice.
			(to his men)
		Put the prisoners in the car.
		Impound the truck.

	The men follow Salazar's orders.

<b>				SALAZAR
</b>			(to Javi)
		One question.  How did you find about 
		this?

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		An informant.

<b>				SALAZAR
</b>		What is the name of your informant?

<b>				JAVIER
</b>			(beat)
		It was an anonymous tip.

	Salazar looks at Javi a beat.

<b>				SALAZAR
</b>			(to his men)
		For a State Police officer, you're 
		very well informed.  Let's go.

<b>				MOMENTS LATER
</b>		Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of 
		vehicles drive away.

	Javier lights a cigarette.

<b>				MANOLO
</b>		Wasn't that General Salazar?

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				MANOLO
</b>		What's he doing up here?

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		I don't know.  Something.

	They start for their car.

<b>	EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY
</b>
<b>	SUPERTITLE: SAN DIEGO
</b>
	Two men, RAY CASTRO, 30's, proud, ambitious, and MONTEL 
	GORDON, 40's, suspicious of everyone including himself and 
	always, always the smartest guy in the room, walk from a 
	Lincoln Towncar toward a dumpy office.  Castro is talking 
	under his breath --

<b>				CASTRO
</b>		No telltales.  Nothing to read.
		Not touching my face.  Not even 
		blinking.  No giveaways.
			(beat)
		How're you feeling?

<b>				GORDON
</b>			(keyed up)
		I feel good.

<b>				CASTRO
</b>		No more pissant basin league bullshit 
		for us, hunh?

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Nope.

	Castro stretches his arms, swings them around.

<b>				CASTRO
</b>		Limbering up, gonna stay loose, keep 
		it all together.  Take this 
		motherfucker down.

	They reach the door to the office.  Gordon looks at Castro, 
	then turns the handle.

<b>				CASTRO
</b>		Showtime.

<b>	INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY
</b>
	It's a cluttered, rundown working office unusual only in the 
	extent of its ordinariness.  A SECRETARY goes about her 
	business like a somnambulist.  CLERKS shuffle and file.

	Castro switches into Spanish --

<b>				CASTRO
</b>			(in Spanish)
		Good afternoon, ladies, gentlemen.  
		We're looking for Eduardo Ruiz.  We 
		have a two o'clock appointment.

<b>	INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - LATER
</b>
	In a back alcove, Castro and Gordon sit across a cheap table 
	from EDUARDO RUIZ, 40's, an entrepreneur in an expensive 
	suit and bad hairpiece.  They are waiting.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		You ever buy a quarter ton?  Not 
		many people have.

	Another "businessman" enters from another door and whispers 
	in Ruiz's ear, then leaves again.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		So, it's worth the wait, right?
		What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have 
		an airlift?  It's not like you can 
		put it in a condom up some mule's 
		asshole, right?  How many peasants 
		would that take?  A line stretching 
		from here to Mexico City --

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Nobody said shit, Eduardo --

	One of Ruiz's hands dips under the desk where we see a handgun 
	is holstered on the underside.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		Relax.  We're waiting, that's it.

<b>				CASTRO
</b>		Hey, you want to hear a joke?  I got 
		a joke.  Why do women wear makeup 
		and perfume?

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Chill out --

<b>				CASTRO
</b>		It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's 
		quick.  Why do women wear makeup and 
		perfume?

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		I don't know.

<b>				CASTRO
</b>		'Cause they're ugly and they stink.

	Castro laughs uproariously.

<b>	INT. DEA SURVEILLANCE SPACE - DAY
</b>
	ON FUZZY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO: Castro laughing.  Ruiz politely 
	smiling, one of his hands hidden by the table.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Man, you never been close enough to 
		a woman to know how she smells.

<b>				DEA AGENT (V.O.)
</b>		What's his hand doing?  Watch his 
		hand.  Anybody?  I don't like the 
		hand.

<b>	IN THE OFFICE
</b>
	The room is filled with crappy surveillance equipment.  DEA 
	AGENTS, in DEA logo'd outerwear, jiggle a monitor fuzzily

	Through the window Ruiz, Gordon and Castro watch the van 
	disappear into the bay of a storage unit.  A man is pulling 
	down the door behind it when three unmarked squad cars ROAR 
	into the lot, surrounding the unit, officers exit the cars 
	with their guns drawn -- Gordon and Castro stare in disbelief.

	Ruiz FIRES the gun under the desk which hits Gordon full in 
	the chest, knocking him backwards.

	Ruiz's men run into the room pulling guns.

	Castro dives and pulls his weapon, firing at Ruiz's men, 
	hitting both of them.  Ruiz bolts through another door.  
	Castro pursues, talking into his shirt collar --

</b>		Agent down.  Repeat, agent down.

	Gordon gets slowly to his feet, shaking off the blast to his 
	Kevlar, and runs after them.

	The DEA are shooting at the men inside the storage unit who 
	are shooting back.

	From all over the stake-out location, DEA AGENTS emerge firing 
	their weapons.  An equal number of FBI AGENTS emerge firing 
	in return.  Nobody was aware of the other's presence.

	It's CHAOS, a clusterfuck of law-enforcement zeal with three 
	competing sets of good guys shouting through BULL-HORNS, 
	GUNSHOTS and SCREAMING.

	Ruiz breaks through the corner of the lot, cutting between 
	two buildings.  Castro emerges and chases him.

	Ruiz runs out the back of the storage company.  He cuts 
	between parked cars, heading for The Fun Zone, a kiddie 
	restaurant.

<b>	INT. THE FUN ZONE - DAY

	Castro enters The Fun Zone.  There's a cardboard cutout of 
	SPASTIC JACK, a beloved comedy figure who looks like a rabbit 
	version of Jar Jar Binks, promoting the "Special Edition" 
	glass: "Collect All Four."  There's an enclosure filled with 
	colored plastic balls.

	The restaurant is empty except for a CLOWN filling out a

</b>		Hey dudes, we're not open yet.

	Castro makes a motion for him to be quiet and keeps moving 
	toward the room of colored balls.

	Gordon enters the restaurant and follows him.  An ANIMATRONIC 
	BAND starts to play a SONG.

	Gordon sees a half-hidden foot buried underneath the plastic 
	balls at the far end of the room.

	He takes careful aim and FIRES.

	Ruiz SCREAMS and sits up.  Castro pounces on him, disarming 
	him, and roughing him up.

	A bong hit is expelled into the air.  In the living room of 
	a comfortable, preppy guest house, private school TEENAGERS 
	party and hang-out: cigarettes in ashtrays, beer and bong on 
	the coffee table, loud MUSIC.

<b>	SUPERTITLE: CINCINNATI, OHIO
</b>
	The TV is on with the sound off.  The curtains are closed.

	The four boys wear school blazers with their ties pulled 
	askew, the three girls' clothing are also identical.  Some 
	sit on couches, some on the floor.  They are stoned.

	One intense-looking boy, SETH ABRAHAMS, 17, wild curly hair 
	and the attitude of a young Coleridge, and a girl, CAROLINE 
	WAKEFIELD, 16, really sixteen which means she looks about 
	12, pretty and flirtatiously irreverent, sit at a desk in 
	front of a Powerbook G-3 playing an on-line trivia game.

	Seth speaks rapidly and precisely.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Father of Greek tragedy?  Anyone?
		Okay, Aeschylus it is.
			(hits keys)
		His trilogy?  The Oresteia.  I mean 
		this is beautiful, can anyone stop 
		the Seth Machine?
			(hits keys)
		Score.  Thank you.  Madmax from Omaha 
		we own you.  And Tragedy is closed 
		out.

	Seth leans over and snorts a line of coke from a mirror.  He 
	hands it to Caroline who effortlessly does one.

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		Entertainment.  The Susan Lucci 
		section or Banal Love Songs of the 
		Nineties?

	Seth looks at her.  He has a crush.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Banal Love Songs it is.
			(hits keys)
		Hey, you wanna try something?

	She nods.  They both take a swig of beer.  He takes her hand 
	pulling her past the stoned people on the couch --

<b>	IN THE KITCHEN
</b>
	Seth takes out a box of baking soda.  He tears off a square 
	of aluminum foil.  He takes out a spoon.  Caroline watches 
	as he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon.  He 
	adds a pinch of baking soda.  He puts in a few drops of water.  
	Stirs it around with the heel of a lighter.  Then holds the 
	flame under the spoon.

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		What are you doing?

<b>				SETH
</b>			(concentrating)
		Just watch.

	He watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and 
	bubbles, then separates... He pours the most viscous part 
	onto the aluminum foil, making four separate little puddles.

	He quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen, making a straw.  He 
	hands it to Caroline.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Inhale the smoke and hold it.

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		What is this, like freebase?

<b>				SETH
</b>		Not like.  It is.

	He lights the flame under the aluminum foil.  The puddle 
	crackles and pops, then starts to smoke --

<b>				SETH
</b>		Go...  Go!

	There's a rush of thick grey smoke.  Caroline catches most 
	of it.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Hold it.

	She pulls it in deeper and holds... Suddenly her expression 
	changes... Her eyes lose their focus, her face slackens, an 
	almost sexual response.  Seth is watching her intensely.

<b>				SETH
</b>		See... Now, you see.

	Caroline slumps back against the counter.  Seth moves against 
	her, kissing her, running his hands over her breasts and 
	body.  She stares over his shoulder, holding it as long as 
	she can.

	Finally she exhales --

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		More.

	The cloud of grey smoke from her lungs fills the room.

	This is a man you do not want to disappoint.

</b>		Until you officially take over the 
		office of National Drug Control 
		Policy, under no circumstances should 
		you speak to the press unprotected, 
		without going through this office or 
		having someone in the room.  There 
		are a lot of interests in this town 
		and, right now, they're all scared 
		of you.  The reason they're scared 
		of you...technically, you have veto 
		power over their budgets.  So think 
		about that: FBI, CIA, DEA, CUSTOMS, 
		TREASURY, ATF, DEFENSE, IRS, Radio 
		Shack and the DMV, they're all gonna 
		want to speak to you.  And that's 
		the good news... You'll also be 
		meeting Senators and Congressman, 
		each with a specially prepared 
		question.  Their question is designed 
		for one thing: to make them look 
		smart.  If you lecture them, they 
		won't think you respect them.  If 
		you respond with utter humility, 
		they will.  Remember, this is about 
		your respect for them, and the 
		President's respect for them.  
		Speaking of which, as soon as he 
		gets back from Russia and China, 
		we'll get you in there for some face-
		time, let the two of you catch up.
			(beat)
		It'd probably be a good idea for you 
		to meet your predecessor.  I'll have 
		Jeff Sheridan take you over.
		Also, four weeks from today you will 
		give your first official press 
		conference.  In it you will outline 
		the President's strategy for winning 
		the war on drugs.

		Okay, anything else?

	Robert makes his way through a warren of hallways in the 
	endless corridors of the Old Executive Building alongside 
	JEFF SHERIDAN, 35, an enthusiastic government employee who 
	has found his place.

<b>				SHERIDAN
</b>		I just want to be clear about one 
		thing.  I used to work for him, but 
		now I work for you.  I'm not a 
		partisan person, I'm an issue person.  
		In the next few weeks, if you allow 
		me, we'll get you well-versed on an 
		incredible array of issues.  The 
		most important of which, in my 
		opinion, being Mexico.  I know 
		everybody that you're gonna meet.
		It's important that they like you.
		It's not important that they like 
		me.  That's why I can help protect 
		you.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Like you protected Landry?

<b>				SHERIDAN
</b>		I see where you're going with that, 
		but if I could just say something, 
		which is basically that a guy like 
		Landry is so autocratic he doesn't 
		know how to let himself be helped; 
		it's a point of pride to take every 
		bullet, no matter who fired it, or 
		whether it was even aimed at him, 
		which personally I think it very 
		self-defeating.  Now, don't get me 
		wrong, he's a man of enormous 
		integrity, but there's a political 
		component to this job that the General 
		just didn't have any patience for.

<b>	INT. OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY - DAY
</b>
	Robert and Sheridan enter the office of outgoing Drug Czar, 
	GENERAL RALPH LANDRY, 60's, buzz-cut, professional soldier 
	with a sense of humor.

	Landry is putting some personal items in a box.

<b>				GENERAL LANDRY
</b>		Jeff, you want to excuse us for a 
		minute?

	Sheridan nods and leaves.

<b>				GENERAL LANDRY
</b>			(bemused, off 
			Sheridan's exit)
		Functionaries.  Nice people, the 
		Schedule C's.  About twelve graduate 
		degrees apiece, but it seems sometimes 
		all they do is start rumors.

	Robert and Landry shake hands.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		You've done a fine job here, Sir.
		The Office of National Drug Control 
		Policy is in better shape than when 
		you found it.

	Landry tries to determine whether Robert believes this.  He 
	looks around the office as if the policy is hiding somewhere.

<b>				GENERAL LANDRY
</b>		I'm not sure I made the slightest 
		difference.
			(wistful)
		I tried...  I really did.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		There are a lot of encouraging 
		statistics.  The work's just started, 
		but I intend to see it through.  
		You've got my word on that.

<b>				GENERAL LANDRY
</b>		You're here for two years, three 
		maximum.  What'd they promise you?
		Court appointment?  What?  District?
		Appeals?
			(checks Robert's 
			reaction)
		Not Supreme... Supreme?

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		I've come in to do a tough job and 
		that's what I'm going to focus on.

	General Landry SIGHS.

<b>				GENERAL LANDRY
</b>		When Kruschev was forced out, he sat 
		down and wrote two letters and handed 
		them to his successor.  He said "When 
		you get into a situation you can't 
		get out of, open the first letter 
		and you'll be saved.  And when you 
		get into another situation you can't 
		get out of, open the second."  Soon 
		enough this guy found himself in a 
		tight place.  So he opened the first 
		letter.  It said, "Blame everything 
		on me."  So he blamed the old guy 
		and it worked like a charm.

		He got into another situation he

</b>		It was right here.  It's been stolen.  
		I want to file a report.

		Right?  And he pays the police.

	And then our car appears.

</b>		Yes.  Better than filling out forms,

	The man reaches in his wallet and offers Javier a twenty.  
	Javi waves him off.

<b>				PHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYIST
</b>		We in the legal drug business, and I 
		mean Merck, Pfizer, the rest of my 
		very powerful clients, realize this 
		isn't a war with a traditional winner 
		and loser, but an organism at war 
		with itself, whose weapons of mass 
		destruction happen to be intoxicants.  
		And if you want a body count look no 
		further than alcohol which racks up 
		80,000 kills a year.  Cocaine manages 
		a measly 2,000.  Same for Heroin.  
		But, the big daddy is Big Tobacco 
		which kills 380,000 each year, which, 
		by the way, is more people than have 
		been killed by all the illegal drugs

<b>	ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

	listening to ETHAN, earnest advocate of harm reduction.

<b>				ETHAN
</b>		What's the difference between Prozac

		Molecules don't have morality.  
		Really, think about it: some molecule

		of poppies or takes the THC out of 
		marijuana.  Imagine a pill that 
		eliminates any psychological craving, 
		from Dilaudid to Dove Bars.  Law

	An argument is breaking out between an ECONOMIST and an 
	UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE with Robert as the audience.

<b>				ECONOMIST

		You're not battling traffickers or

		contains a paradox: if you arrest 
		traffickers, you raise prices, and 
		you also raise profits, which brings 
		more traffickers into the business.

<b>				UNDERSECRETARY
</b>			(to the Economist)
		Back in the real world, we're talking 
		about Mexico and not John Maynard 
		Keynes.  We will spend 18 billion 
		dollars this year on this "war," and 
		the question on the table every year 
		is do we certify Mexico as an ally 
		or not?

	Another man, RUSH PHILLIPS, a middle-aged powerbroker, 
	overhears, then joins and Robert is encircled.

<b>				RUSH PHILLIPS
</b>		You want to make a difference, hit 
		the users. You don't jeopardize our 
		financial markets by some hypocritical 
		stance on drug consumption.  We're 
		snorting it, why penalize Mexico for 
		supplying it?

<b>				UNDERSECRETARY
</b>		Mexico, don't talk to me about
		Mexico --

<b>				ECONOMIST
</b>		It's the stick of law enforcement 
		that creates the carrot of huge
		profits... That's economic truth --

<b>				RUSH PHILLIPS
</b>		Addicts don't vote; they don't have 
		PACs; they don't spend soft money,
		that's political truth --

<b>				UNDERSECRETARY
</b>		We're locking them up and
		consumption is falling --

<b>				ECONOMIST
</b>		The price of coke and heroin has 
		dropped and purity has increased.
		All this law enforcement has achieved 
		is kids can get better stuff, cheaper.  
		In economic terms, you can forget 
		it; this is not a winnable war.

<b>				RUSH PHILLIPS
</b>		Christ, you want to decertify 
		somebody, take Pakistan or Columbia.
		We don't need them for anything.

<b>				ECONOMIST
</b>		If you manage to seize an 
		inconceivable 50 percent of all drugs 
		coming into this country, you'll 
		still raise the price of coke and 
		heroin less than 3 percent which 
		won't affect drug use at all.

<b>				RUSH PHILLIPS
</b>		Why are we calling this a war at 
		all?  You don't declare war on your 
		own people.  Addiction is a little 
		worm that gnaws a house apart from 
		the inside.

	MICHAEL ADLER, about Robert's age, and as successful, but in 
	a different way, approaches, catching Robert's eye through 
	the arguing demagogues.

<b>				UNDERSECRETARY
</b>		We need Mexico for these reasons:
		number one -- Defense; two -- Trade; 
		three -- Tourism; then, way on down 
		the line, comes Drugs.  The President 
		knows this.  Why's he holding 
		everybody's feet to the fire?

<b>				MICHAEL
</b>			(solemn)
		Mr. Wakefield, there's a situation 
		that needs your attention right away.

	Robert looks at Michael, squints, looks closer, then follows.

<b>				RUSH PHILLIPS
</b>			(oblivious)
		One in sixteen Americans is of Mexican 
		descent.  Mexico our third largest 
		trading partner...

<b>	ANGLE ON ROBERT AND MICHAEL ON THE BACK PORCH.
</b>
<b>				ROBERT
</b>		You're looking pretty good for an 
		old guy.

<b>				MICHAEL
</b>		My work keeps me young.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Which part, getting terrorists loose 
		on bail or freeing convicted murderers 
		on technicalities?

<b>				MICHAEL
</b>		The worst serial killer in history -
		who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty 
		two people.  Our government killed 
		fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied 
		about it every day.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Michael, you represent drug dealers, 
		not civil libertarians.

<b>				MICHAEL
</b>		We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama.
		Is that covered in your Constitution?
		Because it isn't in mine.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Noriega is a criminal.

<b>				MICHAEL
</b>		Noriega was head of a sovereign nation 
		who made the mistake of doing business 
		with the U.S.  Government.  So, no, 
		I don't have a problem waking up 
		every day and fighting our government, 
		fighting people like you, trying to 
		keep this system a little bit honest.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>			(amused)
		Last I read your clients were chopping 
		people up with chainsaws and 
		delivering illegal narcotics into 
		this country.

<b>				MICHAEL
</b>		I hope when you were on the bench, 
		Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle 
		the presumption of innocence in the 
		same fashion.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		If I ever return to the bench, 
		Counselor Adler, I hope I have the 
		pleasure of hearing your arguments.

	equipment operated by Mexicans.

	Behind the Ayala gate we see David playing with his golf 
	club on the lush lawn.

	Workers set-up the party under the direction of a professional

	A BMW 740il with tinted windows pulls into the driveway.

<b>				DAVID
</b>		Daddy!

	The window lowers and we see CARL AYALA, 40's, handsome, 
	charismatic, second generation American, in expensive, 
	conservative clothes, covering his cell phone as he greets 
	his kids.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Hello.  Hello.

	He goes back to his phone call, pulling around to the garage.  
	David goes back to his game.

<b>	INT. AYALA DINING ROOM - DAY
</b>
	There are MAIDS in the house and a COOK in the kitchen.  The 
	large rooms are filled with fine art.

	Helena Ayala sits at the dining room table with plans, bills 
	and receipts spread before her.  Carl enters and paces around 
	the room, continuing his cell phone conversation.

<b>				CARL
</b>			(into phone)
		I'm sorry, Jonas.  I don't care if 
		that is the price you have gotten in 
		order countries.

	Helena watches her husband pace as he talks.  He can't help 
	it, but a portion of this call is theatrical, for an 
	audience's benefit, which in this instance happens to be his 
	wife.  Helena's expression of annoyance resets itself into 
	love.

<b>				CARL
</b>		This is America, a different country.  
		I am Carl, a different man.  So you 
		see, everything about our situation 
		is different and I believe the pricing 
		will be different, too.
			(beat, listens)
		You're a reasonable man... So take 
		the weekend to think about it.

	Carl clicks off the phone, turns to Helena.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Every day with this guy is like 
		starting all over again.

	Carl winds down and finally becomes present in the room with 
	his wife.  He looks at her.  She looks back.

<b>				CARL
</b>		Hi.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Hi.

<b>				CARL
</b>		What's up?

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Just watching you.

<b>				CARL
</b>		I got that.  How was your day?

	She pushes the topiary away from her.  Suddenly, she seems 
	tired.  Carl comes over and puts his hand on her pregnant 
	belly.

<b>				CARL
</b>		You all right?

<b>				HELENA
</b>		I keep feeling like I'm forgetting 
		something.

	Her husband watches her, then wraps his arms around her.

	Carl and Helena step out on the front porch of their home 
	and watch David play with his golf putter.

<b>	OUTSIDE THEIR GATE
</b>
	An unmarked police car rolls up and stops behind the wall.  
	Another arrives and another and another.  OFFICERS in DEA 
	jackets exit the cars.

	There is MURMURING, then SILENCE.

	Helena slowly turns to look at her husband.  He doesn't look 
	at her.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		David, come inside --

	Suddenly, POLICE and DEA enter the front yard.  Gordon and 
	Castro enter the yard and move quickly up the drive to Carl.

<b>				CARL
</b>		What is this?  What is going on?

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Mr. Ayala?

<b>				CARL
</b>		That's right.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		You're under arrest for violation of 
		Federal Narcotics laws.

	Gordon and Castro spin him, cuff him, and without emotion 
	begin pulling him from his yard.  David is trying to get to 
	his father.  In a kind of shock.  Helena trails after him.

	Castro drags Carl into the street toward the open door of 
	the cruiser.  He pushes him down into the backseat.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		We have a warrant to search your 
		home, Mrs. Ayala.

	Gordon hits the side of the cruiser and it pulls away.  Carl 
	looks at his wife through the window.

	Gordon and Castro head up the driveway toward her house.

	Helena is left standing in the street.  NEIGHBORS, who have 
	appeared in front yards and at the ends of driveways, stare 
	at her with suspicion.  David approaches and holds onto her

	Javier thinks about this.

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		Does this offer include my partner?

<b>				SALAZAR
</b>		Only if he can be trusted.

</b>		He'll do what I say.

	Salazar slides a folder across the desk.  Javier opens it

		Okay.  Okay, I'm worried I'm not 
		really smart or that I'm not nearly 
		as smart as people think I am, or

		been way too high since I was five, 
		I mean who knows they're going to

	Seth and Caroline push the table aside to get a better look.  
	Other people in the kitchen slowly take notice.

</b>		He's blue.  He isn't breathing --

	Helena is relieved, but she's not looking at Arnie and when

	"No."

</b>		To begin with, she's only sixteen

	cutouts from magazine pictures and copy.

	On the sink next to her is a little square of well-charred 
	aluminum foil; she's done many hits.  She leans over and 
	picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in 
	her soap dish.  She drops it on a clean place on the foil.  
	She picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's 
	turned into a straw.

	She heats the bottom of the foil.  The crack "crackles."

	She chases the smoke across the foil.  A huge hit.  She leans 
	her head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the 
	magazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling.

	She holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the 
	exhaust fan.

	She sees the shower.  She turns it on.  She drops her pajamas.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		Carlos, I mean Carl, started out in 
		the family connection business: real 
		estate in Tijuana, fishing boats out 
		of Ensenada, hydroponic raspberries.  
		He met up with the Obregon brothers 
		of the Tijuana Cartel who were 
		interested in two things: entering 
		society and using his fishing boats.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		So you pay off our customs officials?

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		In Mexico law enforcement is an 
		entrepreneurial activity, this is 
		not so true for the USA.
			(condescending)
		Using regression analysis we made a 
		study of the customs lanes at the 
		border and calculated the odds of a 
		search.  The odds are not high, and 
		we found variables that reduce the 
		odds.  We hire drivers with nothing 
		to lose.  Then we throw a lot of 
		product at the problem.  Some get 
		stopped.  Enough get through.  It's 
		not difficult.

<b>				CASTRO
</b>		You'd think he wasn't sitting here 
		facing life in prison.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		This has worked for years and it 
		will continue to work for years.
		NAFTA makes everything more difficult 
		for you.  The border is disappearing.
			(pointing at them)
		You people are like those Japanese 
		soldiers left behind on deserted 
		islands who think that World War II 
		is still going on.
			(with total disdain)
		Let me be the first to  tell you, 
		your government surrendered this war 
		a long time ago.

<b>				GORDON
</b>			(to Castro)
		This attitude's not gonna help him 
		any, is it?

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		I got greedy.  I decided to bring a 
		little in on my own and somebody 
		tipped you off.  That was my mistake.  
		Carl would never be so stupid.

<b>	EXT. TIJUANA - SAN DIEGO BORDER CROSSING - DAY

	Car after car, an unending multi-lane stream of vehicles 
	moving into the U.S.  Any of these cars could be carrying 
	drugs.

<b>	INT. CUSTOMS CONTROL BOOTH - DAY
</b>
	On an elevated walkway, this booth commands a view of 
	everything.  Robert and Sheridan listen to an OFFICIAL give 
	the spiel.

<b>				OFFICIAL
</b>		The busiest land border crossing in 
		the world.  Over forty-one thousand 
		vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand 
		pedestrians on foot.  I think we do 
		a pretty good job but we know a lot 
		of drugs are still getting through.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Any idea how much?

<b>				OFFICIAL
</b>		I've read official estimates but I 
		wouldn't bet my house on them.  I've 
		heard the entire cocaine supply for 
		the United States can fit into four 
		tractor-trailers.
			(gestures to the 
			traffic)
		At least a half-dozen of those cars 
		right out there are carrying a load 
		of dope, with drivers employed by 
		people who don't give a damn if 
		they're caught or not.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		What do you look for?

<b>				OFFICIAL
</b>		We ask questions and measure the 
		answers.  When something doesn't 
		ring true, a fact that doesn't make 
		sense, a slight hesitation, then 
		it's off to secondary for a closer 
		look.  Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 
		million trucks a year.  Now it's 
		almost double.  Pretty soon there'll 
		be Mexican truck companies that will 
		have as much freedom in crossing the 
		border as American truck companies.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Any way we can do it better?

<b>				OFFICIAL
</b>		Sure.  More money in intelligence on 
		their side of the border.  So we 
		have a better idea who we're looking 
		for.  More dogs.  More people.  
		Supposed to be getting some giant x-
		ray machines to run the trucks 
		through.  Outside of martial law 
		that's about the best you're gonna 
		do.
			(beat)
		But, I should tell you, there are 
		two things that really have us on 
		edge right now.
			(beat)
		In the last six months seizures have 
		tripled, even though we're pulling 
		over the same number of cars.  What 
		does that tell you?

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		That triple the amount of stuff is 
		going through.

<b>				OFFICIAL
</b>		Right.  But, that's not the biggest 
		problem.  One of our Intel officers 
		picked up information from DEA that 
		traffickers have come up with a 
		process, a chemical process, to turn 
		coke into something else.  It doesn't 
		smell like coke.  It doesn't look 
		like coke.  And what's worse, it 
		doesn't react to field test.  It 
		could be anything.  Maybe it's already 
		happening.  I mean, how would we 
		know?

	Robert looks out at the border activity.  It's anarchy.

	They turn down a street with a lot of activity on it.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Drugs weren't even a problem until a 
		hundred years ago when the white men 
		in power declared them a problem.  
		Opiates.  But, who was using 'em?  
		Chinese immigrants.  Slave labor.  
		And the darkies up in the inner cities

	TWO YOUNG STREET DEALERS fall in step with them.  One talks

	She hands over her money to Seth who pays and gets the drugs: 
	gram baggies of rock stamped with a scorpion and "911," and 
	wax-paper bindles of heroin, also labeled, "911."

	across the floor.

	They check out the decrepit room: the sloping mattress, the 
	black and white television bolted to the bureau.  The mini- 
	fridge.  Caroline bounces on the bed.  They are teenagers.

	Seth prepares the drugs by the light of the mini-fridge.

<b>				SETH
</b>		I love this place.

	Seth dumps the drugs on the bedside table.  From other pockets 
	he extracts aluminum foil, lighter, tube.  She trails away 
	watching him fix the first hit.

<b>				SETH
</b>		Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd

	He prepares the first hit.  She does it and lies back.  He 
	does one.

		The maid... They ask her what time I

	Seth starts kissing her.  They try to get into it, but both

		us money?

<b>				ARNIE
</b>		Yes, I told you before, there are 
		people who owe you money but they're 
		not paying.  There's too much heat 
		on Carl.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.

	Arnie thinks.

<b>				ARNIE
</b>		Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you.
		You do not want to come into contact 
		with these people.  Only Carl knows 
		who they are.  That's his real asset.  
		Ruiz doesn't know them.  They don't 
		know Ruiz.  Church and State.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		What about legitimate businesses?
		We own a construction concern, real
		estate --

<b>				ARNIE
</b>		Laundromats for the washing of money.  
		Unfortunately, Carl had only one 
		successful business.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Don't you have some good news?  Isn't

		say.

	There isn't.  Helena looks Arnie in the eyes.

		Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if 
		Carl doesn't get out.  I'm not very

		had a man in my life.  Always.

<b>				ARNIE
</b>		I remember when I first met you:

		even then that your survival instincts 
		were pretty well honed.

</b>		I'm glad you think so, but I'm 
		picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two 
		year-old mother whose ex-husband is 
		being compared to Pablo Escobar.

	Javier and Manolo ride through a nice neighborhood in Mexico 
	City.  Javi isn't familiar with the roads and drives 
	cautiously.

	A young lady, ROSARIO, early 20's, sexy and vulnerable, rides 
	in the back of the SUV.

<b>				ROSARIO
</b>		You two don't like me, do you?

	Manolo laughs and looks her up and down.  Javi watches her 
	in the rearview mirror.

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		We don't have an opinion on you.

<b>				ROSARIO
</b>			(to Javi)
		Maybe it's because I'm getting an 
		apartment nicer than anything you'll

	Javi says nothing.

</b>			(re: the neighborhood)
		I can't believe the old man kept his

</b>		They will say anything to get what

	Birds are chirping.  Javi waits in the car as Manolo takes 
	the young lady's bags from the vehicle and carries them up 
	the walkway to the arched doorway.  He knocks on the heavy 
	wooden door.

<b>				ROSARIO
</b>		You don't have the keys.  Oh that's 
		perfect.  Are you an idiot?

	Manolo knocks again.  They wait a long beat.

<b>				MANOLO
</b>		There's supposed to be someone here 
		to let you in.

	Finally, the door swings open and a BODYGUARD is standing 
	there.  Rosario SQUEALS and sweeps past him into the vast 
	space.  The bodyguard motions for Manolo to put the bags 
	inside the door.

	Manolo sets the bags down and sees another MAN standing a 
	few feet away.  The man wears sunglasses.  His complexion is 
	strange and his neck is bandaged.

	The body guard escorts Manolo back outside where he hears 
	Rosario's happy LAUGHTER drifting down from an upstairs 
	window.

	Manolo gets into the truck.  He's shaken by what he's just 
	seen.

</b>		Porfirio Madrigal is not dead.  I 
		just saw him.

	A long beat as Javier considers this.

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		This is why Salazar is so interested 
		in cleaning up Tijuana.  Madrigal, 
		who's supposed to be dead, owns him.
		And Madrigal is making a move on

<b>	INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Robert stands outside her closed bathroom door.

	There is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the 
	faint sound of a lighter CLICKING.  AGAIN and AGAIN, then a 
<b>	COUGH.
</b>
<b>	INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
	Caroline sits on the toilet.  Glamour Magazine on her lap.

	She's wild-eyed and paranoid.  The exhaust fan is running.

	The aluminum foil is on the sink.  The last little bit of 
	heroin in a wax-paper bundle sits beside it.

	She's listening hard for any SOUND in the house.  What she's 
	wondering is if someone is outside the door listening.

	She puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once 
	more before lighting it.  She does the hit.

	And seems to feel better.

	Suddenly there's a POUNDING on the door.  The VOICE of her 
	father muffled through the solid wood.

<b>				ROBERT (V.O.)
</b>			(muffled by the door)
		Caroline.  Open this door immediately.

	Caroline is up like a shot.  She looks around.  The POUNDING 
	on the door gets stronger.

	She crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet.

	The bathroom door SOUNDS like it's about to cave inward.

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>			(faking the best she 
			can)
		Who is it?  I'm going to the bathroom.

	She's coping now, full parallel process mode: she dumps the 
	last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it, checking 
	her nose in the mirror as she reaches for a can of air 
	freshener which she sprays into the air.

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		One minute.

	She takes the remaining crack, lighters, tubes, little smudgy 
	druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in 
	a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet.

	She pauses a beat, then opens the door, and tries to brush 
	by her father while avoiding his eyes.

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		Excuse me --

	Robert grabs her by the arms.  He pushes her against the 
	wall and looks at her pupils.  He looks at her fingernails.  
	The blister on her thumb from working the lighter is red and 
	irritated.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		You're not going anywhere, young 
		lady.

	She stands there; she's very high.

	Robert sniffs the air.  He throws open cabinets, searching 
	for drugs.  He sees the smudge mark on the counter left by 
	the charred aluminum foil.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Where is it?  Where are the drugs?
			(yelling)
		Where are they?

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		Fuck you.  I wasn't doing anything.  
		You're like the Gestapo.

	Robert KICKS the cabinets.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Fuck me?  Oh, okay.  Fuck me.  Fuck 
		you.

	Robert is losing it.  He throws stuff around the bathroom 
	and then, for the first time, looks up.  He sees the long 
	light in the box atop the medicine cabinet and it dawns on 
	him.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		I'm going to ask you one time to 
		tell me the truth so that I can help 
		you.

	She just stares.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Okay, young lady, that's it.

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		Like I give a fuck.

	Robert reaches above the medicine cabinet and pulls out a 
	charred spoon.  It confuses him.  He throws it into the sink.

	He pulls out another spoon.  He pulls out crumpled bindles, 
	rolled up, encrusted dollar bills, exhausted lighters, a 
	pill bottle, an empty pint of vodka.

	The detritus of drug addiction keeps on coming, filling up 
	the sink.  Robert stares at it, the amount and complexity 
	has him momentarily baffled.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		What is wrong with you?  What?

</b>		This is ridiculous.  Why is there no

<b>				GORDON
</b>		When the DEA gets into the narcotics

		Four Seasons.

	They walk down a hotel hallway.  Two more AGENTS stand outside 
	Room 407.  Gordon opens the door and they enter.

<b>	INT. SUITE OF CHEAP HOTEL ROOMS - DAY
</b>
	There are more AGENTS inside and old food and coffee 
	containers.  Gordon gives Ruiz a tour.  There are several 
	rooms.  A bored Castro sits at a table staring at a Scrabble 
	board.

<b>				CASTRO
</b>		Eddie, how you like your new home?  
		I hope you hate it as much as I do.

	Ruiz looks around with disgust.  He's accustomed to finer 
	places.  He goes to a window and looks out.

	RUIZ'S POV: of the Federal Court building not far away.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		This is not what my lawyers

	Gordon pours himself a cup of coffee.

<b>	INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
	A packed, tense courtroom listens to testimony from a 
	government witness, FRANK, 50's, very matter-of-fact and 
	truthful.

<b>				FRANK
</b>		He first came to me in January.  
		That would've been nineteen eighty- 
		seven.  He wanted to rent warehouse 
		space along the harbor.  I didn't 
		ask too many questions; I'm a 
		businessman also.

<b>	INT. FEDERAL COURTHOUSE - DAY
</b>
	Another witness, MRS. BERRY, 40's, pedantic on the stand --

		And I couldn't represent him unless 
		we could explain this...

	the witness --

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		I was the company secretary from 
		1991 to 1994.  I supposedly worked 
		for all six companies.  But... they 
		weren't... I mean, it was just one 
		empty office with a desk and a 
		telephone.  We never sold anything 
		the whole time I was there.  Sometimes 
		people came and got paid.  I don't 
		really know what we did.

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		Did Mr. Ayala say where the money 
		came from?

<b>				SHEILA
</b>		No, and I didn't ask.

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		Where do you think it came from?

	Carl's lawyer, Adler, is on his feet --

<b>				KAUFMAN
</b>		This speculation --

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		I'll rephrase.  Did you feel like 
		you were engaged in a legal 
		enterprise?

	Sheila is reluctant to answer.

</b>		No, not really.

	Helena gathers her courage, then...

</b>		A friend... of Carlos Ayala.

	There is a long pause.

</b>		I don't really like guns.  You shoot

		some doctor will keep them alive.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		When will you do it?

<b>				FRANCISCO
</b>		I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the

<b>	AT THE INTERSECTION

	behind Robert's car, Caroline crosses the street toward 
	Sketch's house.

<b>	INT. SKETCH'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
	A single candle lights the room.  Caroline is underneath 
	Sketch the drug dealer.  He is pounding away.  As she clutches 
	his back and holds on, her expression is both surprised and 
	druggy, and SOUNDS escape her mouth that she wouldn't believe 
	she could make.

	There's a KNOCK on the door.  Sketch continues his business.  
	The KNOCKING is more insistent.  Finally, he stops and gets 
	up and goes to the door.  Caroline lies back.  She's in a 
	bed with black sheets in a room with nothing else in it but 
	a dresser and some duffle bags.

	Sketch opens the door --

<b>				SKETCH
</b>		What the fuck do you want?

	SOMEBODY outside says something.  Sketch walks over to a 
	duffle bag and extracts some product.  Caroline's eyes are 
	glued to it as Sketch hands it through the door.  Sketch 
	sees her staring at the drugs.

	He comes back to bed.

<b>				SKETCH
</b>		You want some of that?

	Caroline nods.

<b>				SKETCH
</b>		What you gonna do to get some of 
		that?

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		Please --

<b>				SKETCH
</b>		What you gonna do?

	She turns her back to him, pouting.  He laughs.

<b>				SKETCH
</b>		Maybe a taste.

	He reaches over beside the bed where there is a small tray.

	On the tray is a rig, spoon, several powders, and an eye 
	dropper.  He pulls the candle over and rapidly fixes a 
	speedball.  He pulls the fluid into the neck of the syringe 
	and holds it up the light.  It has Caroline transfixed.

<b>				SKETCH
</b>		Feed this to you like a little bird.

	He squirts the tiniest amount of fluid into the air.  It 
	arcs in the candlelight.

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		Don't --

<b>				SKETCH
</b>		You want this?

	She nods.

<b>				SKETCH
</b>		This is the Express train.  Baby 
		turnin' pro and getting down in a 
		big, big hole.

	Her concentration is entirely, hypnotically focused on the 
	syringe.

	Sketch moves the syringe toward her lips.

<b>				SKETCH
</b>		Kiss it.  Kiss your new mommy hello.

	Caroline moves her mouth toward the side of the syringe, her 
	lips part.

	Sketch pulls the sheet back, exposing her legs.  He grips 
	one powerful hand around her ankle and squeezes... Veins 
	stand out on her foot.

	He slides the needle into the largest vein and slowly 
	depresses the plunger.

	Caroline watches, then her head tilts back, then forward, 
	she GROANS, sexually and slumps against the pillows, her 
	eyes half-open, her lips twitching.

	grey suit passes them going outside.

	The parking lot is empty of people.  The guards at the gate 
	talk about something distracting.

	Francisco passes by the cruiser and drops his keys.  Kneeling

	stands and walks toward the guard gate.

</b>		Nonetheless, your honor, we feel

	A tourist screams --

	Francisco is looking down at the widening red splotch in the

	Robert is standing in the middle of her room.  He's not sure 
	what he's looking for.  Everywhere he looks: her personal 
	things, beloved objects from more innocent times, pictures.

	Within moments a legitimate desire to connect with his 
	daughter has escalated into a search for clues.  He opens 
	her drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves.

	He becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her 
	room.  He tosses a stack of magazines.  A fashion magazine, 
	airborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic 
	tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the 
	ground.

	Robert stares at the foil on the carpet.  It's charred on 
	the outside.  He picks it up.  And unfolds it.  There's a 
	dried milky white substance.

	He picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them.  Then, 
	somewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth.  He 
	holds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky 
	substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud 
	of smoke.  Robert sucks all of it in.

	He waits a long time then exhales.  His eyes shut.  The tube 
	drops from his mouth.  He staggers and, overwhelmed by the 
	sensations, sits on the bed.  The lighter and foil fall from 
	his hands.

	A moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know 
	where he is.  He looks at the room, confused.  He stumbles 
	to the door and shuts it firmly behind him.

	Anna is weeping.  Javier sits next to her.  He puts his arm 
	around her and she leans her head against his shoulder.

<b>	INT. JAVIER'S SUV - DAY
</b>
	Javi drives through the streets of Tijuana.  He brakes for a 
	stop sign and watches, trance-like, the pedestrians crossing 
	in front of him.  As the intersection clears he remains still.

	A HONK from behind brings him back and he pulls forward 
	passing Helena Ayala who crosses going the opposite direction.  
	We stay with her.

	A shrewd Obregon Lieutenant, JUAN MARQUEZ, 40, sits at a 
	table opposite Helena.  The Strange Man who both threatened 
	Helena's child and executed Francisco sits in another chair.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		Mrs. Ayala.  Thank you for coming.  
		I am Juan Marquez, I work for Mr.  
		Obregon.  I believe you know my 
		associate, "Tigrillo," the Little 
		Tiger.

	Helena nods to Tigrillo --

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Yes, he threatened to kill my five 
		year-old son.
			(beat)
		I was under the impression I would 
		be meeting Juan Obregon.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		No, this is not possible.  And I 
		thank you for coming down here, though 
		I suspect it's been a pointless 
		journey.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		I hear these stories.  Your husband 
		in jail.  His business in chaos.  
		Various people fighting over the 
		scraps.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		My husband is the victim of an 
		informer in your organization, not 
		ours.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your 
		route is compromised.  Perhaps it is 
		time for me to deal with other 
		distributors in California.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		I don't think you're going to do 
		that.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		You don't?  Listen to this woman in 
		a man's world, a very violent world.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		There are plenty of other suppliers 
		in Mexico.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		But not in whose interest it is to 
		help you out of debt.

	Helena reaches into her bag and pulls out the Spastic Jack 
	action figure.  She puts it on the desk.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		My husband had been working on 
		something he called, The Project for 
		the Children.  Are you aware of this?

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		I don't know.  Perhaps I remember 
		something.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		We have the ability to change the 
		color, odor, and physical property 
		of cocaine.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr.  
		Espastico Jacobo.  That's nothing 
		new.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Not in...

	Juan Marquez is confused.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		This doll is cocaine.

	Juan picks up Spastic Jack and looks at him.  He bangs it on 
	the desk.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Every part, from his ears to his 
		accessory belt, is high-impact, 
		pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless.  
		Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable 
		by anyone.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		I don't believe you.

	She takes out the "solvent" and puts it on his desk.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Get a bowl.

<b>	INT. CLUB PLATINUM - OFFICE - LATER
</b>
	Spastic Jack is slowly dissolving in a bowl of solvent.  
	Only his shoulders, head, and ridiculous ears remain above 
	the quicksand of milky glop.

	Helena holds a mirror under the desk lamp.  She is drying 
	the paste.  She puts the mirror on the desk.  A white 
	substance has coagulated there.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Try it.

	Juan takes out a razor blade and chops the dried substance 
	into two white powder lines.  He hands a silver straw to 
	Helena.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		You first.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do 
		it.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		Fine, then we don't have deal.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Fine, then we don't have a deal.

	She stands.  He watches her a beat, then smiles.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		Okay, okay.

	He leans down and quickly snorts a line.  After a beat.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		That's good coke.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		It should be... It's yours.
			(beat)
		I want our debt forgiven.  I want to 
		be the exclusive distributor of 
		Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the 
		United States.  And I want the 
		principle witness against my husband, 
		Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I 
		must first ask you to pass a test.  
		I asked the same of your husband and 
		he succeeded with flying colors.

	Helena waits.  Juan Marquez reaches in his desk and pulls 
	out a quarter kilo of cocaine.  He pushes it across the desk.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		Take this back with you.  Deliver it 
		safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and 
		we have a deal.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		That's crazy.  My husband is on trial 
		for smuggling.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		Exactly, and this is how I know I'm 
		not getting into business with the 
		U.S. Government.

	She puts the quarter key in her bag and stands.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		You will help me with my other 
		problem.

<b>				MARQUEZ
</b>		Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in 
		San Diego.  And we have a deal.

	Tigrillo escorts her out of the room.

	Helena follows Tigrillo.  As they pass the restrooms she 
	signals that she has to stop.

<b>	INT. CLUB PLATINUM - LADIES' ROOM - DAY

	Helena goes into a stall.  She extracts the cocaine from her

	nods approval.  Hughes and Johnson exchange a look.  They 
	are dumbstruck.

	There is a KNOCK on the front door.  An AGENT goes to answer --

<b>				AGENT
</b>		Who is it?

<b>				SOMEBODY (V.O.)
</b>			(through the door)
		The Mafia.  I've got his breakfast.

	The agent opens the door and is handed a breakfast tray.  He 
	puts the food in front of Ruiz who uncovers the sausage and 
	eggs.

	An agent walking by tries to take a bite of sausage.  Ruiz 
	stabs it with a fork --

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		Fuck off.

	Gordon watches the interchange --

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Where's the love gone, Eddie?

	You'll be testifying for at least ten days.  What if we stop 
	feeding you?

	Ruiz begins to eat hungrily.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		You expect me to be grateful for 
		spending the rest of my life looking 
		over my shoulder.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		That thought makes me feel awful.

	Ruiz pushes eggs into a piece of toast.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		Can't you for a second imagine none 
		of this had happened?  That my drugs 
		had gone through.  What would have 
		been the harm?  A few people get 
		high who are getting high anyway.  
		Your partner is still alive.  We 
		avoid having breakfast together.  
		Don't you see this means nothing?  
		That your whole life is pointless?

<b>				GORDON
</b>		You're breaking my heart.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		The worst thing about you, Monty, is 
		you realize the futility of what 
		you're doing and you do it anyway.  
		I wish you could see how transparent 
		you are.
			(disgusted)
		This food tastes like shit.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		So go shower already.

<b>				RUIZ
</b>		You only got to me because you were 
		tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, 
		who's trying to break into Tijuana.  
		You're helping them.
			(beat)
		You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.

	Ruiz stands and heads for the bathroom.

<b>				GORDON
</b>			(yelling after him)
		And shave.  You better look nice and 
		believable for the jury.

	Ruiz disappears into the bathroom and slams the door behind 
	him.

<b>				GORDON
</b>			(to another agent)
		It's like having another wife.

	The agent laughs.  There's another KNOCK on the door.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Who is it?

<b>				SOMEBODY ELSE (V.O.)
</b>			(though the door)
		Breakfast.

	Gordon and the agent look at each other.

<b>				SOMEBODY ELSE
</b>		Hurry up.  It's getting cold.

	Gordon moves to the side of the door and pulls his gun.  The 
	other agent opens the door.

	A MAN with a breakfast tray enters.  Gordon puts the gun to 
	the side of his head.

<b>				MAN WITH TRAY
</b>		I'm on your side.  God, you're jumpy.

	Gordon is momentarily confused, then goes for the bathroom 
	door.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Call an ambulance.  Hurry.

	Gordon tries the bathroom door.  It's stuck.  He gets it 
	open a crack.  There's a body against the other side.  He 
	shoves.

<b>	INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Ruiz is on the floor in convulsions.

<b>				GORDON
</b>			(yelling)
		Call the ambulance.
			(to Ruiz)
		Don't die on me.  You will not die 
		on me.  Do you hear me?  Don't you 
		die on me.

	Ruiz's convulsions get worse, his claw-like fingers scratch 
	across the tile.

	The court is packed.  Helena and Arnie watch from the gallery.  
	The judge is at the bench.

	The prosecutor rises --

</b>		Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of 
		the jury...  Because of the sudden 
		death of Eduardo Ruiz, the people

	Robert Wakefield enters the office of the Chief of Staff,

	report, and is already mid-sentence.

<b>				CHIEF OF STAFF
</b>		Yeah, hi --
			(waves Robert to a 
			chair)
		So I've got a copy of your speech 
		here...
			(glances down, still 
			reading)
		It's fantastic... So, Robert, my 
		genuine thanks.  You're my choice 
		and you're gonna be great.  The 
		President is sorry he hasn't been 
		able to spend more time with you.  
		After the press conference he wants 
		to really sit down.
			(an afterthought)
		Oh, I got to the Post, too.  Don't 
		worry about that thing with your 
		daughter, it's not news; they're 
		willing to treat it as a family 
		matter, a personal matter.
			(off Robert's stare)
		Look, even if it came out, we'd turn 
		it into a qualification, I've been 
		in the trenches of this Drug War, I 
		have seen the face of the enemy, 
		etcetera.

	Robert just stares at him.

<b>	INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
</b>
	General Salazar sits in the same grimy cell that housed 
	Francisco Flores.  He is sweating and his breathing is 
	labored.  A DOCTOR enters and gives him an injection, 
	explaining that it will calm him down.

<b>	EXT. DESERT OUTSIDE TIJUANA - DAY
</b>
	It's a reprise of the earlier desert bust... a landing strip 
	in the middle of nowhere, a plane landing, SUV's approaching.

	This time Javi is at the wheel of one of them.  News crews 
	are trailing behind him.

<b>	EXT. DESERT AIRSTRIP - LATER
</b>
	Javi and Special Agent Hughes stand next to a giant mound of 
	seized cocaine, the same cocaine, in fact, Javi held briefly 
	at the beginning.  The same teenagers from the pickup truck 
	have been arrested.  The news crews get everything.

<b>				JAVIER
</b>			(to the press)
		This seizure is one of the largest 
		seizures in Mexican history...  It 
		represents the first bilateral effort 
		of the American DEA and the Mexican 
<b>		I.N.C.D.
</b>
<b>	INT. JAIL CELL - DAY
</b>
	General Salazar lies on his side, eyes and mouth open.  He 
	is dead.  Javier looks at him through the doorway.

<b>				JAVIER (V.O. CONT'D)
</b>		Today I'm very proud to announce 
		that Mexico, with the help of our 
		American partners, is finally winning 
		the war against narcotics trafficking.

</b>
	Robert and Javi walk through the headquarters, a nondescript 
	government building.

	Robert extracts photographs of the bust from a manila 
	envelope.  The crates of cocaine are clearly marked "911."

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		The cocaine brand, 911, is an East 
		Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, 
		and you must know it usually comes 
		through into El Paso?

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		I'm aware of that.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		So what's it doing in Tijuana?

	Javi looks Robert Wakefield squarely in the eye.  He shrugs.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Let me ask you a hypothetical 
		question: if Salazar worked for 
		Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and 
		he went out of power, would it mean 
		the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		It could mean that, yes.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		That would probably mean the Tijuana 
		Cartel is gaining power?

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		It's possible.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		Is it possible to have a Drug Czar 
		in Mexico who isn't connected in 
		some war to one of the cartels?

	Javi thinks along time before answering.

<b>				JAVIER
</b>		Yeah, it's possible... if you're 
		prepared to die.

<b>	EXT. AYALA FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON
</b>
	An outdoor party is going on.  Children and adults arrive 
	and mingle.  Caterers work the barbecue grill.  Waiters serve 
	food and drink on the rolling lawn.

	Helena circles through the crowd greeting friends.  She looks 
	past her tree line and up the street where a telephone repair 
	van is parked.  She turns back toward her guests.  Somebody 
	has raised a cup and everyone is CHEERING.

	Helena drinks with her guests, then walks inside her house.

<b>	AT THE FRONT GATE
</b>
	Montel Gordon walks through the gate and up the drive.  He 
	grabs a drink off the tray of a passing waiter.  He appears 
	drunk.

	Montel follows Helena into the house.

<b>	INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - AFTERNOON
</b>
	Carl hears the CHEERING outside and the sound of LAUGHTER.

	He makes a cellular telephone call.

<b>	INT. ARNIE METZGER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON
</b>
	Arnie is in his office and answers the cell phone --

<b>				CARLOS (V.O.)
</b>		It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too 
		hard.

<b>				ARNIE
</b>		Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming 
		right now --

	Behind Arnie in the office there is a movement of SHADOW.

<b>	INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - AFTERNOON
</b>
	Carl stands at the window looking at his guests while he 
	talks on the phone --

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		Don't bother.

<b>				ARNIE (V.O.)
</b>		What?

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		So Arnie, when were you going to 
		tell me about the 3 million dollars 
		we got in from San Francisco two 
		days after I got arrested?

<b>				ARNIE (V.O.)
</b>		I was just waiting for the right 
		time.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		And you didn't feel like you could 
		trust my wife with this news?

<b>				ARNIE (V.O.)
</b>		I just didn't want to take a chance.  
		I didn't want to risk it.  It could 
		have been frozen along with everything 
		else.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		You had it all figured out.  You 
		move into my house.  You raise my 
		kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It 
		was a good plan, Arnie.

<b>				ARNIE (V.O.)
</b>		Carl, that's insane.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		So my wife is lying?

<b>				ARNIE (V.O.)
</b>		Carl, think about it, if I was trying 
		to rip you off, I would have left 
		town after Ruiz was killed.  I 
		wouldn't sit next to you in court 
		listening to the dismissal.

	On the front lawn CHILDREN are lined up for the ice-cream 
	sundae bar that is being tended by a WAITER.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		Arnie, do think there's a difference 
		between a reason and an excuse,

<b>				ARNIE (V.O.)
</b>		Carl --

<b>				CARLOS

	Arnie turns around and there are TWO MEN in his office.

<b>	INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - AFTERNOON

	Carl hears MUFFLED GUNSHOTS over the phone.  He hangs up and 
	turns from the window.  Helena is standing there.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Who was that?

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		Arnie.  He's not going to be able to 
		make the barbecue.

	Carl and Helena share an embrace and a kiss.

<b>				HELENA
</b>		Come downstairs.  Everyone is waiting.

	Carl and Helena turn to leave the room and Montel Gordon is 
	standing in the doorway with his glass of champagne.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Hello, Helena.  What a great party.

<b>				CARLOS
</b>		Who are you?

<b>				GORDON
</b>		Nobody.  I'm a nobody who arrested 
		you, but your wife is a murderer.

	Gordon takes a sip of his drink.  Two SECURITY OFFICERS appear 
	in the doorway behind him.

<b>				SECURITY OFFICER
</b>		Hey, you can't be in here.

<b>				GORDON
</b>		I'm a cop.

<b>				SECURITY OFFICER
</b>		I don't care.

<b>				HELENA
</b>			(to the guards)
		Throw him out of here.

	The security officers grab Gordon.  There is a scuffle.  
	Gordon falls to the floor by the window.  They are wrestling.

	As they wrestle, Gordon reaches out and, unnoticed, affixes 
	TINY LISTENING DEVICE underneath the desk.

	He continues to struggle with the guards.  Helena and Carlos 
	start from the room.

<b>				GORDON
</b>			(calling out)
		You didn't win, Helena.  You lost 
		everything.  Tell your children a 
		nice bedtime story...  How you killed 
		my partner.

<b>	EXT. AYALA FRONT YARD - AFTERNOON

	The guests watch as the guards eject Gordon from the premises.

	Near the gate David has stopped playing to watch the action.

	Then he goes back to playing with his toy: a Spastic Jack

<b>	INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

	The PRESS SECRETARY stands at the familiar podium addressing 
	the White House Press Corps.

	Robert Wakefield stands to one side with Chief of Staff, his 
	lawyers, Sheridan and General Landry.

<b>				PRESS SECRETARY
</b>		...a sterling reputation and close 
		friend of the President, recently 
		confirmed into The Office of National 
		Drug Control Policy... our new Drug 
		Czar, Robert Hudson Wakefield.

	Applause from the assembled PRESS.  The Press Secretary 
	signals and Robert walks to the podium.  He looks back to 
	the Chief of Staff; he stares out at the expectant faces and 
	television lights and camera flashes.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>			(reading his prepared 
			speech)
		The War on Drugs is a war on our 
		nation's most precious resource...  
		our children.  Sixty-eight million 
		children have been targeted by those 
		who perpetrate this war and protecting 
		those children must be priority number 
		one.
			(beat)
		There has been progress and there 
		have been failures, but where we 
		have fallen short I see not a problem 
		but an opportunity.

	Robert is becoming increasingly uneasy.  He glances at the 
	Chief of Staff who bores into him.  He looks again at his 
	speech.  With great effort he continues.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		An opportunity to correct the mistakes 
		of the past while laying a solid 
		foundation for the future.
			(a long, uncomfortable 
			beat)
		This takes not only new ideas, but 
		perseverance.  This takes not only 
		resources, but courage.  This takes 
		not only government, but families.

	Robert stops again as though the words are choking him.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		I've... I've outlined a ten-point 
		plan, representing a new bilateral 
		effort...

	He can't finish.  Everyone stares at Robert.  The crowd of 
	reporters senses something is wrong.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		I can't do this.
			(beat)
		If there is a War on Drugs then our 
		own families have become the enemy.  
		How can you wage war on your own 
		family?

	He walks out of the room.  The crowd waits, expecting him to 
	return.

	Robert walks down a corridor and out of the White House.

<b>	EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
	A beautiful spring morning.  He walks down to Pennsylvania 
	Avenue.  He hails a cab and gets in.  The cab pulls away.

<b>	INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY

	A twelve step meeting is in progress.  Caroline shares from 
	her seat.

<b>				CAROLINE
</b>		On the good days I feel like I get 
		it, like it all makes sense.  I can 
		stay in the moment.  I don't have to 
		control everything in the future.  
		And I believe everything is going to 
		work out fine.
			(beat)
		On the bad days, I just want to grab 
		the phone and start dialing numbers.  
		I want to pull my hair and run through 
		the streets screaming.
			(beat)
		But, thanks to the people I've met 
		in these rooms, people like Margaret 
		and Jim and Sarah, people who've 
		taught me how to listen, I'm pretty 
		sure I'll make it through today.

	Caroline is finished sharing.

<b>				VOICE (O.S.)
</b>		Would you like to share?

	We pan over to reveal Robert and Barbara sitting next to 
	Caroline.

<b>				ROBERT
</b>		My name is Robert.  This is my wife, 
		Barbara.  We're Caroline's parents.  
		We're just hear to listen.
