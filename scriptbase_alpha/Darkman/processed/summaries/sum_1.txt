Scientist Peyton Westlake is working on a project to create synthetic skin.
Now the skin he has developed has a flaw--it will not remain stable for more than 99 minutes.
His girlfriend, Julie, a lawyer is investigating a developer.
She leaves some incriminating documents at Peyton's.
One night Peyton was working when the lights in his lab went out, he then discovers that the synthetic skin has remained stable past 99 minutes, he deduces that it's because of light that the skin doesn't remain stable.
And it is at that moment that a psychotic criminal, Robert Durant appears demanding the documents that Julie left there.
They beat up Peyton, and after finding the documents they blow up Peyton's lab.
Peyton was blown away and everybody believes he is dead but in reality, he was found, burned seriously and a new procedure was performed on him that renders him unable to sense pain, he also now has tremendous strength and is now prone to violent outbursts.
He is now working on perfecting the synthetic skin and at the same using his technology to make synthetic skin masks of the men who attacked him so that he could strike back at them.
