In the future artificial lifeforms called Surrogates are created so that humans can link up with them and go out into the world without having to deal with dangers the world presents.
There's a movement led by a man calling himself The Prophet who believes that Surrogates are an abomination and they live in areas where surrogates are not allowed.
When a surrogate is attacked supposedly by one of his members but the human controlling it was also killed which is very strange.
So FBI agents Greer and Peters investigate and they learn that the human who was killed is the son of the creator of the Surrogates.
When the attacker is found, Greer chases him but he ends up in the "No Surrogates" zone and is attacked.
Eventually his surrogate is destroyed.
Greer then for the first time in years goes out and continues to investigate and discovers that there's a lot going on.
