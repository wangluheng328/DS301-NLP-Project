In the not too distant future, technology allows humans to live their lives through robots they call surrogates.
Humans have in effect cocooned themselves in their homes, never venturing outside.
Rather, they explore life through their surrogates who may or may not resemble them.
Tom Greer and his partner Peters are FBI agents assigned to investigate the destruction of two surrogates that has also caused the unthinkable: the human hosts were also killed.
The use of surrogates is not universally endorsed with some humans living in technology and machine-free zones.
Led by a man called The Prophet, the fear is that they have put their hands on a weapon that would fundamentally change human society.
Greer believes they have also put their hands on a weapon that could fundamentally change society, though he begins to wonder if that might be a good thing.
