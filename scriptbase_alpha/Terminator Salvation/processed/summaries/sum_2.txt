In the not too distant future, John Connor is a key member of the resistance against the machines that have taken over the Earth.
From the recordings his mother has left him, he knows he has to find Kyle Reese and send him back to Earth if the future is to occur as it should.
Reese is just a teenager now, on the run like many other humans.
While in the company of another survivor, Marcus Wright, Kyle is taken prisoner by the machines and transported to Skynet's headquarters in San Francisco.
Connor sets out to rescue him but is shocked by Wright's true nature.
Not all is at it seems to be and success is far from guaranteed.
