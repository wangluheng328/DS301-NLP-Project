An accident on the Klingon moon Praxis forces the reluctant Klingon Empire into a peace treaty with the Federation.
Kirk, despite his mistrust of the Klingons after they murdered his son at Genesis, is forced to escort a Klingon cruiser carrying the Klingon Chancellor to Earth for the meetings.
During the voyage, the Klingon cruiser is attacked, and Kirk and McCoy are taken prisoner after the Chancellor is murdered by two Starfleet crewmen.
Spock immediately begins an investigation, while Kirk and McCoy are sentenced to life on Rura Penthe - a deep-frozen asteroid.
Meanwhile, Spock has discovered that a Klingon Bird of Prey - one that can fire when cloaked, and under the command of Klingon General Chang - is the ship responsible for firing on the Chancellor, and the two assassins came from the Enterprise.
A rescue of Kirk and McCoy is successful, after which they discover a conspiracy among Starfleet, Klingon and Romulan officials whose plan is to incite a full-blown war!
The Enterprise and the Excelsior - under the command of Hikaru Sulu - head for a deadly rendezvous with General Chang at the peace summit to prevent war from breaking out... but will they be too late?
