Antonio Salieri believes that Mozart's music is divine.
He wishes he was himself as good a musician as Mozart so that he can praise the Lord through composing.
But he can't understand why God favored Mozart, such a vulgar creature, to be his instrument.
Salieri's envy has made him an enemy of God whose greatness was evident in Mozart.
He is set to take revenge.
