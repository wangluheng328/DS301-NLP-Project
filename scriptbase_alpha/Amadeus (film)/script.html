<b>               INT. STAIRCASE OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT - 1823
</b>
               Total darkness. We hear an old man's voice, distinct and in 
               distress. It is OLD SALIERI. He uses a mixture of English 
               and occasionally Italian.

<b>                                     OLD SALIERI
</b>                         Mozart! Mozart! Mozart. Forgive me!  
                         Forgive your assassin! Mozart!

               A faint light illuminates the screen. Flickeringly, we see 
               an eighteenth century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs.  
               We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the 
               point of view of the landing. Up the stair is coming a 
               branched candlestick held by Salieri's VALET. By his side is 
               Salieri's COOK, bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and 
               biscuits. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is 
               thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian. It is 
               very cold. They wear shawls over their night-dresses and 
               clogs on their feet. They wheeze as they climb. The candles 
               throw their shadows up onto the peeling walls of the house, 
               which is evidently an old one and in bad decay. A cat scuttles 
               swiftly between their bare legs, as they reach the salon 
               door.

               The Valet tries the handle. It is locked. Behind it the voice 
               goes on, rising in volume.

<b>                                     OLD SALIERI
</b>                         Show some mercy! I beg you. I beg 
                         you! Show mercy to a guilty man!

               The Valet knocks gently on the door. The voice stops.

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                         Open the door, Signore! Please! Be 
                         good now! We've brought you something 
                         special. Something you're going to 
                         love.

               Silence.

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                         Signore Salieri! Open the door. Come 
                         now. Be good!

               The voice of Old Salieri continues again, further off now, 
               and louder. We hear a noise as if a window is being opened.

<b>                                     OLD SALIERI
</b>                         Mozart! Mozart! I confess it! Listen! 
                         I confess!

               The two servants look at each other in alarm. Then the Valet 
               hands the candlestick to the Cook and takes a sugared cake 
               from the dish, scrambling as quickly as he can back down the 
               stairs.

<b>               EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - VIENNA - NIGHT
</b>
               The street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, 
               five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing 
               couples and a sled and three dogs. It is a windy night. Snow 
               is falling and whirling about. People are passing on foot, 
               holding their cloaks tightly around them. Some of them are 
               revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or 
               hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties.  
               Now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house.  
               The window above the street is open and Old Salieri stands 
               there calling to the sky: a sharp-featured, white-haired 
               Italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing 
               gown.

<b>                                     OLD SALIERI
</b>                         Mozart! Mozart! I cannot bear it any 
                         longer! I confess! I confess what I 
                         did! I'm guilty! I killed you! Sir  
                         I confess! I killed you!

               The door of the house bursts open. The Valet hobbles out, 
               holding the sugared cake. The wind catches at his shawl.

<b>                                     OLD SALIERI
</b>                         Mozart, perdonami! Forgive your 
                         assassin! Pietˆ! Pietˆ! Forgive your 
                         assassin! Forgive me! Forgive! 
                         Forgive!

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                              (looking up to the 
                              window)
                         That's all right, Signore! He heard 
                         you! He forgave you! He wants you to 
                         go inside now and shut the window!

               Old Salieri stares down at him. Some of the passersby have 
               now stopped and are watching this spectacle.

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                         Come on, Signore! Look what I have 
                         for you! I can't give it to you from 
                         down here, can I?

               Old Salieri looks at him in contempt. Then he turns away 
               back into the room, shutting the window with a bang. Through 
               the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers 
               in the street. They stare back at him in confusion.

<b>                                     BYSTANDER
</b>                         Who is that?

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                         No one, sir. He'll be all right. 
                         Poor man. He's a little unhappy, you 
                         know.

               He makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the 
               house. The onlookers keep staring.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OLD SALIERI'S SALON - NIGHT
</b>
               The Cook is standing holding the candlestick in one hand, 
               the dish of cakes in the other. The Valet arrives, panting.

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                         Did he open?

               The Cook, scared, shakes his head: no. The Valet again knocks 
               on the door.

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                         Here I am, Signore. Now open the 
                         door.

               He eats the sugared cake in his hand, elaborately and noisily.

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                         Mmmm - this is good! This is the 
                         most delicious thing I ever ate, 
                         believe me! Signore, you don't know 
                         what you're missing! Mmmm!

               We hear a thump from inside the bedroom.

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                         Now that's enough, Signore! Open!

               We hear a terrible, throaty groaning.

<b>                                     VALET
</b>                         If you don't open this door, we're 
                         going to eat everything. There'll be 
                         nothing left for you. And I'm not 
                         going to bring you anything more.

               He looks down. From under the door we see a trickle of blood 
               flowing. In horror, the two men stare at it. The dish of 
               cakes falls from the Cook's hand and shatters.

               He sets the candlestick down on the floor. Both servants run 
               at the door frantically - once, twice, three times - and the 
               frail lock gives. The door flies open.

               Immediately, the stormy, frenzied opening of Mozart's Symphony 
               No. 25 (the Little G Minor) begins. We see what the servants 
               see.

               Old Salieri lies on the floor in a pool of blood, an open 
               razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive.  
               He gestures at them. They run to him. Barely, we glimpse the 
               room - an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte-
               piano, a chamber-pot on the floor - as the Valet and the 
               Cook struggle to lift their old Master, and bind his bleeding 
               throat with a napkin.

<b>               INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</b>
               Twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, 
               full orchestra.

               As the music slows a little, we see a Masquerade Ball in 
               progress. A crowded room of dancers is executing the slow 
               portion of a dance fashionable in the early 1820's.

<b>               EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SALIERI'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
               As the fast music returns, we see Old Salieri being carried 
               out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants, and placed 
               in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle-
               aged doctor in a tall hat. This is DOCTOR GULDEN. He gets in 
               beside his patient. The driver whips up the horse, and the 
               wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow.

<b>               INT. THE WAGON - NIGHT
</b>
               The wagon is galloping through the snowy streets of the city.  
               Inside the conveyance we see Old Salieri wrapped in blankets, 
               half-conscious, being held by the hospital attendants. Doctor 
               Gulden stares at him grimly. The wagon arrives outside the 
               General Hospital of Vienna.

<b>               INT. A HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               A wide, white-washed corridor. Doctor Gulden is walking down 
               it with a priest, a man of about forty, concerned, but 
               somewhat self-important. This is Father VOGLER, Chaplain at 
               the hospital. In the corridor as they walk, we note several 
               patients -- some of them visibly disturbed mentally. All 
               patients wear white linen smocks. Doctor Gulden wears a dark 
               frock-coat; Vogler, a cassock.

</b>                         He's going to live. It's much harder 
                         to cut your throat than most people 
                         imagine.

               They stop outside a door.

<b>                                     DOCTOR GULDEN

               Vogler nods and opens the door.

<b>               INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               A bare room - one of the best available in the General 
               Hospital. It contains a bed, a table with candles, chairs, a 
               small forte-piano of the early nineteenth century. As Vogler 
               enters, Old Salieri is sitting in a wheel-chair, looking out 
               the window. His back is to us. The priest closes the door 
               quietly behind him.

</b>                         Herr Salieri?

               Old Salieri turns around to look at him. We see that his 
               throat is bandaged expertly. He wears hospital garb, and 
               over it the Civilian Medal and Chain with which we will later 
               see the EMPEROR invest him.

               We see the pretty soprano KATHERINA CAVALIERI, now about 
               twenty-four, dressed in an elaborate mythological Persian 
               costume, singing on stage. She's near the end of a very florid 
               aria by Salieri. The audience applauds wildly.

               Slyly he plays the opening measure of Mozart's Eine Kleine 
               Nachtmusik. The priest nods, smiling suddenly, and hums a 
               little with the music.

               a gilded chair on a pile of books, playing the harpsichord 
               for the POPE and a suite of CARDINALS and other churchmen. 
               Beside the little boy stands LEOPOLD, his father, smirking 
               with pride.

                         of the brilliant little prodigy

                         taught him everything.

               The piece finishes. Leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord 
               and lifts up his little son to stand on it. Mozart removes 
               the blindfold to show a pale little face with staring eyes.  
               Both father and son bow. A Papal Chamberlain presents Leopold

               Serene music of the Italian Baroque - Pergolesi's Stabat 
               Mater - sung by a choir of boys with organ accompaniment.  
               We see the outside of the 17th-century church sitting in the 
               wide landscape of Lombardy: sunlit fields, a dusty, white 
               road, poplar trees.

               The music continues and swells. We see the twelve-year-old 
               Salieri seated between his plump and placid parents in the 
               congregation, listening in rapture. His father is a heavy-
               looking, self-approving man, obviously indifferent to the 
               music. A large and austere Christ on the cross hangs over 
               the altar. Candles burn below his image.

                         could make me dizzy, almost to 
                         falling.

               The boy falls forward on his knees. So do his parents and 
               the other members of the congregation. He stares up at Christ 
               who stares back at him.

</b>                         Whilst my father prayed earnestly to 
                         God to protect commerce, I would 
                         offer up secretly the proudest prayer 
                         a boy could think of. Lord, make me 
                         a great composer! Let me celebrate 
                         your glory through music - and be 
                         celebrated myself! Make me famous 
                         through the world, dear God! Make me 
                         immortal! After I die let people 
                         speak my name forever with love for 
                         what I wrote! In return I vow I will 
                         give you my chastity - my industry, 
                         my deepest humility, every hour of 
                         my life. And I will help my fellow 
                         man all I can. Amen and amen!

               The music swells to a crescendo. The candles flare. We see 
               the Christ through the flames looking at the boy benignly.

               CU, a large cooked fish on a thick china plate. Camera pulls 
               back to show the Salieri family at dinner. Father Salieri 
               sits at the head of the table, a napkin tucked into his chin. 
               Mother Salieri is serving the fish into portions and handing 
               them round. Two maiden aunts are in attendance, wearing black, 
               and of course the young boy. Father Salieri receives his 
               plate of fish and starts to eat greedily. Suddenly there is 
               a gasp - he starts to choke violently on a fish bone. All 
               the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling 
               him, but it is in vain. Father Salieri collapses.

</b>                         Suddenly he was dead. Just like that! 
                         And my life changed forever. My mother 
                         said, Go. Study music if you really 
                         want to. Off with you! And off I 
                         went as quick as I could and never 
                         saw Italy again. Of course, I knew 
                         God had arranged it all; that was 
                         obvious. One moment I was a frustrated 
                         boy in an obscure little town. The 
                         next I was here, in Vienna, city of 
                         musicians, sixteen years old and 
                         studying under Gluck! Gluck, Father. 
                         Do you know who he was? The greatest 
                         composer of his time. And he loved 
                         me! That was the wonder. He taught 
                         me everything he knew. And when I 
                         was ready, introduced me personally 
                         to the Emperor! Emperor Joseph - the 
                         musical king!  Within a few years I 
                         was his court composer. Wasn't that 
                         incredible? Imperial Composer to His 
                         Majesty! Actually the man had no ear 
                         at all, but what did it matter? He 
                         adored my music, that was enough. 
                         Night after night I sat right next 
                         to the Emperor of Austria, playing 
                         duets with him, correcting the royal 
                         sight-reading. Tell me, if you had 
                         been me, wouldn't you have thought 
                         God had accepted your vow? And believe 
                         me, I honoured it. I was a model of 
                         virtue. I kept my hands off women, 
                         worked hours every day teaching 
                         students, many of them for free, 
                         sitting on endless committees to 
                         help poor musicians - work and work 
                         and work, that was all my life. And 
                         it was wonderful! Everybody liked 
                         me. I liked myself. I was the most 
                         successful musician in Vienna. And 
                         the happiest. Till he came. Mozart.

               A grand room crowded with guests. A small group of Gypsy 
               musicians is playing in the background. Thirteen members of 
               the Archbishop's orchestra - all wind players, complete with 
               18th-century wind instruments: elaborate-looking bassoons, 
               basset horns, etc. and wearing their employer's livery - are 
               laying out music on stands at one end of the room. At the 
               other end is a large gilded chair, bearing the arms of the 
               ARCHBISHOP OF SALZBURG. A throng of people is standing, 
               talking, and preparing to sit upon the rows of waiting chairs 
               to hear a concert.

<b>                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
</b>                         One day he came to Vienna to play 
                         some of his music at the residence 
                         of his employer, the Prince-Archbishop 
                         of Salzburg. Eagerly I went there to 
                         seek him out. That night changed my 
                         life.

               We see Salieri, age thirty-one, a neat, carefully turned-cut 
               man in decent black clothes and clean white linen, walking 
               through the crowd of guests. We follow him.

</b>                         As I went through the salon, I played 
                         a game with myself. This man had 
                         written his first concerto at the 
                         age of four; his first symphony at 
                         seven; a full-scale opera at twelve.  
                         Did it show? Is talent like that 
                         written on the face?

               We see shots of assorted young men staring back at Salieri 
               as he moves through the crowd.

</b>                         Which one of them could he be?

               Some of the men recognize Salieri and bow respectfully. Then 
               suddenly a servant bearing a large tray of cakes and pastries 
               stalks past. Instantly riveted by the sight of such delights, 
               Salieri follows him out of the Grand Salon.

               The servant marches along bearing his tray of pastries aloft.  
               Salieri follows him.

               The servant turns into:

               Salieri's POV: several tables, dressed to the floor with 
               cloths are loaded with many plates of confectionery. It is, 
               in fact, Salieri's idea of paradise! The servant puts his 
               tray down on one of the tables and withdraws from the room.

<b>               INT. A PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S
</b>
               Salieri turns away so as not to be noticed by the servant.  
               As soon as the man disappears, Salieri sneaks into the buffet 
               room.

<b>               INT. BUFFET ROOM IN THE PALACE - DAY - 1780'S
</b>
               Salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously. He 
               is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of 
               sweet things. His attention is attracted in particular by a 
               huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a 
               pineapple. He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, 
               but at the same moment he hears giggling coming toward him.  
               He ducks down behind the pastry table.

               A girl - CONSTANZE - rushes into the room. She runs straight 
               across it and hides herself behind one of the tables.

               After a beat of total silence, MOZART runs into the room, 
               stops, and looks around. He is age twenty-six, wearing a 
               fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the 
               Archbishop of Salzburg upon it. He is puzzled; Constanze has 
               disappeared.

               Baffled, he turns and is about to leave the room, when 
               Constanze suddenly squeaks from under the cloth like a tiny 
               mouse. Instantly Mozart drops to all fours and starts crawling 
               across the floor, meowing and hissing like a naughty cat. 
               Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under 
               the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze. We hear a 
               high-pitched giggle, which is going to characterize Mozart 
               throughout the film.

               staff on the floor for attention. Immediately COLLOREDO,

               important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet 
               skullcap. He is followed by his Chamberlain, the Count ARCO. 
               Everyone stands. The Archbishop goes to his throne and sits. 
               His guests sit also. Arco gives the signal to start the music. 
               Nothing happens. Instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches

               The music is louder. Mozart hastens towards the Grand Salon 
               away from the buffet room, adjusting his dress as he goes.

<b>               INT. GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S

               The opening of the Serenade is being tentatively conducted 
               by the leader of the wind-musicians. Guests turn around as 
               Mozart appears - bowing to the Archbishop - and walks with 
               an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is 
               playing. The leader yields his place to the composer and 
               Mozart smoothly takes over conducting.

               Constanze, deeply embarrassed, sneaks into the room and seats 
               herself at the back.

               The music fades down. Salieri stands shocked from his 
               inadvertent eavesdropping. After a second he moves almost in 
               a trance toward the door; the music dissolves.

<b>               INT. GRAND SALON - DAY - 1780'S
</b>
               Mozart is conducting the Adagio from his Serenade (K. 361), 
               guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists. The squeezebox  
               opening of the movement begins. Salieri appears at the door 
               at the back of the salon. He stares in disbelief at Mozart.

                         whose legend had haunted my youth.  
                         Impossible.

               The music swells up and Salieri listens to it with eyes closed - 
               amazed, transported - suddenly engulfed by the sound. Finally 
               it fades down and away and changes into applause. Salieri 
               opens his eyes.

               The audience is clearly delighted. Mozart bows to them, also 
               delighted. Colloredo rises abruptly, and without looking at 
               Mozart or applauding and leaves the Salon. Count Arco 
               approaches the composer. Mozart turns to him, radiant.

               Mozart and Arco walk side by side. They pass Salieri who is 
               staring at Mozart in fascination. As they disappear, he steals 
               toward the music stands, unable to help himself.

               He extends his hand to be kissed. Mozart does it with a 
               furious grace, then leaves the room. As he opens the door we 
               see:

<b>               INT. PALACE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1780'S

               A group of people who have attended the concert, among them 
               Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment. At 
               sight of the composer they break into sustained applause.  
               Mozart is suddenly delighted. He throws the door wide open

               so that the guests can see into the private apartment where 
               the Archbishop sits - and he can see them. Colloredo is 
               clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee. He 
               smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small 
               ovation.

               Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line 
               of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause 
               for the Archbishop with conducting gestures. Suddenly 
               irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and 
               shuts the door, ending the applause.

               Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the 
               full score of the Serenade. He turns the pages back to the 
               slow movement. Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains.

               CU, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless 
               fascination. The music is played against his description of 
               it.

</b>                         Extraordinary! On the page it looked 
                         nothing. The beginning simple, almost 
                         comic. Just a pulse - bassoons and 
                         basset horns - like a rusty 
                         squeezebox. Then suddenly - high 
                         above it - an oboe, a single note, 
                         hanging there unwavering, till a 
                         clarinet took over and sweetened it 
                         into a phrase of such delight! This 
                         was no composition by a performing 
                         monkey! This was a music I'd never 
                         heard. Filled with such longing, 
                         such unfulfillable longing, it had 
                         me trembling. It seemed to me that I 
                         was hearing a voice of God.

               Suddenly the music snaps off. Mozart stands before him as he 
               lays down the score.

               highly correct. COUNT ORSINI-ROSENBERG: a corpulent man of 
               sixty, highly conscious of his position as Director of the 
               Opera. BARON VON SWIETEN, the Imperial Librarian: a grave 
               but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties. FIRST 
               KAPELLMEISTER GIUSEPPE BONNO: very Italian, cringing and 
               time-serving, aged about seventy. And Salieri, wearing 
               decorous black, as usual.

               At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries, using quill pens 
               and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is 
               said.

<b>               INT. BEDROOM IN SALIERI'S APARTMENT - DAY - 1780'S
</b>
               A somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study.  
               We see a four-poster bed. Also, a marble mantelpiece above 
               which hangs a handsome cross in olivewood, bearing the figure 
               of a severe Christ. Opposite this image sits Salieri at his 
               desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and 
               ink. On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he 
               occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, 
               with some difficulty. He scratches notes out with his quill, 
               and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig.  
               There is a knock at the door.

               A servant admits LORL, a young lower-class girl, who appears 
               carrying a basket in which is a box covered with a napkin.  
               She has just come from the baker's shop.

               Greedily he unwraps the napkin and lifts the lid on the box.

               He takes a biscuit and eats.

               She gives a little curtsey, flattered and giggling and is 
               shown out. Salieri turns back to his work, chewing. He plays 
               through a complete line of the march. He smiles, pleased 
               with the result.

               He inclines his head to the Christ above the  fireplace, and 
               starts to play the whole march, including the phrase which 
               pleased him.

</b>
               The march continues on the forte-piano as we see Mozart, 
               seated in front of a mirror, wearing an extravagant wig. On 
               either side of him stands a SALESMAN, one of them holding 
               another wig, equally extravagant. Mozart takes off the first 
               wig, to reveal his own blonde hair, of which he is extremely 
               proud, and hands it back.

</b>                         And the other one?

               The Salesman puts the second wig on his head. Mozart pulls a 
               face of doubt in the mirror.

</b>                         And the other one?

               He takes it off and the other Salesman replaces it with the 
               first wig on his head.

                         heads?

               He giggles. The music stops.

               A door opens. We glimpse in the next room the Emperor Joseph 
               bidding goodbye to a group of military officers standing 
               around a table.

               He turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits 
               him. It consists of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von

               Taking his instructions literally, the Majordomo is marching 
               very slowly toward the salon door. He is followed by a 
               bewildered Mozart, dressed very stylishly and wearing one of

               Mozart comes in eagerly. Immediately the march begins, played 
               by His Majesty. All the courtiers stand, listening with 
               admiration. Joseph plays well, but applies himself fiercely 
               to the manuscript. Mozart, still bewildered, regards the 
               scene, but does not seem to pay attention to the music itself. 
               It finishes and all clap obsequiously.

</b>                         No, no, please! It is not a holy

                         You know we have met already? In 
                         this very room. Perhaps you won't 
                         remember it, you were only six years 
                         old.
                              (to the others)
                         He was giving the most brilliant 
                         little concert here. As he got off 
                         the stool, he slipped and fell. My 
                         sister Antoinette helped him up 
                         herself, and do you know what he 
                         did? Jumped straight into her arms 
                         and said, Will you marry me, yes or 
                         no?

               Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle. Joseph helps 
               him out.

               The Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh 
               discreetly.

               and makes for the door. All bow. Then he becomes aware of 
               the manuscript in his hand.

               Mozart bows and hands the manuscript back to the Emperor.  
               Then he goes to the forte-piano and seats himself. The others, 
               except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the 
               King. Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly 
               accuracy.

                         The rest is just the same, isn't it?

               He plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a 
               phrase, which he repeats dubiously.

<b>                                     MOZART

               All the courtiers look at Salieri.

                         just a little more -?

               He plays another phrase.

</b>                         Or this - yes, this! Better.

               He plays another phrase. Gradually, he alters the music so 
               that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in 
               The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He plays it with 
               increasing abandon and virtuosity. Salieri watches with a 
               fixed smile on his face. The court watches, astonished. He 
               finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a 
               gesture of triumph - and grins.

</b>                         My dear, it will hardly enhance your 
                         reputation to be celebrated throughout 
                         Vienna as a singing prostitute for a 
                         Turk.

               He seats himself at the forte-piano.

<b>                                     CAVALIERI

</b>                         Perhaps.

               He plays a chord. She sings a scale, expertly. He strikes 
               another chord. She starts another scale, then breaks off.

</b>                         What does he look like?

<b>                                     SALIERI
</b>                         You might be disappointed.

<b>                                     CAVALIERI
</b>                         Why?

<b>                                     SALIERI
</b>                         Looks and talent don't always go 
                         together, Katherina.

<b>                                     CAVALIERI
</b>                              (airily)
                         Looks don't concern me, Maestro.  
                         Only talent interests a woman of 
                         taste.

               He strikes the chord again, firmly. Cavalieri sings her next 
               scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises 
               in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral 
               accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il 
               Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from 
               exercises to the exceedingly florid aria.

               We DISSOLVE on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not 
               merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish 
               manner, and we are on:

<b>               INT. OPERA STAGE - VIENNA - 1780'S
</b>
               The heroine of the opera (Cavalieri) is in full cry addressing 
               the Pasha with scorn and defiance.

               The house is full. Watching the performance - which is 
               conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the 
               orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and 
               Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box.

               In another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and 
               three girls, one of whom is Constanze. This is the formidable 
               MADAME WEBER and her three daughters, Constanze, JOSEFA and 
               SOPHIE. All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber 
               is especially enraptured by being there at all. Not so, 
               Salieri, who sits in another box, coldly watching the stage.

               Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch 
               du bist entschlossen.

<b>                                     CAVALIERI
</b>                         Since you are determined, Since you 
                         are determined, Calmly, with no 
                         ferment, Welcome - every pain and 
                         woe. Bind me then - compel me! Bind 
                         me then - compel me! Hurt me. Break 
                         me! Kill me! At last I shall be freed 
                         by death!

               After a few moments of this showy aria, with the composer 
               and the singer staring at each other - he conducting 
               elaborately for her benefit, and she following his beat with 
               rapturous eyes - the music fades, and Salieri speaks over 
               it.

                         they met - or how - yet there she 
                         stood on stage for all to see. Showing 
                         off like the greedy songbird she 
                         was. Ten minutes of ghastly scales 
                         and arpeggios, whizzing up and down 
                         like fireworks at a fairground.

               Music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria.

                         freed By! Death!

               The brilliant Turkish finale of Seraglio bursts over us.  
               All the cast is lined up on stage. Mozart is conducting with 
               happy excitement.

               The curtains fall. Much applause. The Emperor claps vigorously 
               and - following his lead - so do the courtiers. The curtains 
               part. Mozart applauds the singers who applaud him back. He 
               skips up onto the stage amongst them. The curtains fall again 
               as they all bow. In the auditorium, the chandeliers descend, 
               filling it with light.

               The curtains are down, and an excited hubbub of singers in 
               costume surround Mozart and Cavalieri, all excited and 
               chattering. Suddenly a hush. The Emperor is seen approaching 
               from the wings, lit by flunkies holding candles. Von Strack, 
               Orsini-Rosenberg and Von Swieten, amongst others, follow

               Chamberlain. All bow.

               Cavalieri turns with a savage look at Mozart and leaves the 
               stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her 
               plumed head. Salieri watches. Mozart stays for a second, 
               indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber.

               Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door. Cavalieri looks 
               after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of 
               control.

               She turns and collapses, crying with rage, into Salieri's 
               arms. We focus on him.

</b>                         It was incomprehensible. What was 
                         God up to? Here I was denying all my 
                         natural lust in order to deserve 
                         God's gift and there was Mozart 
                         indulging his in all directions - 
                         even though engaged to be married! - 
                         and no rebuke at all! Was it possible 
                         I was being tested? Was God expecting 
                         me to offer forgiveness in the face 
                         of every offense, no matter how 
                         painful? That was very possible. All 
                         the same, why him? Why use Mozart to 
                         teach me lessons in humility? My 
                         heart was filling up with such hatred 
                         for that little man. For the first 
                         time in my life I began to know really

               We see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop 
               Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne. Count Arco 
               stands beside him. Leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man 
               of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier.

                         Viennese slut is trying to trick him 
                         into marriage. I know my son. He is 
                         too simple to see the trap - and

               In deepest gratitude he kisses the Archbishop's hand. He 
               motions Leopold to rise. We hear the first dark fortissimo 
               chord which begins the Overture to Don Giovanni: the theme 
               associated with the character of the Commendatore.

               We see a huge CU, of Mozart's head, looking front and down, 
               as if reading his father's letter. We hear Leopold's voice 
               over this image, no longer whining and anxious, but 
               impressive.

               The camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling 
               beside Constanze. A PRIEST faces them. Behind them are Madame 
               Weber, Josefa and Sophie Weber, and a very few others. Among

               The opening kyrie of the great Mass in C Minor is heard.  
               Mozart and Constanze kiss. They are in tears. Madame Weber 
               and her daughters look on approvingly. The music swells and 
               continues under the following:

               There is a view of a castle in background. Leopold sits alone 
               in his room. He is reading a letter from Wolfgang. At his 
               feet are his trunks, half-packed for the journey he will not 
               now take. We hear Mozart's voice reading the following letter 
               and we see, as the camera roves around the room, mementos of 
               the young prodigy's early life: the little forte-piano made 
               for him; the little violin made for him; an Order presented 
               to him. We see a little starling in a wicker cage. And we 
               see portraits of the boy on the walls, concluding with the 
               familiar family portrait of Wolfgang and his sister Nannerl 
               seated at the keyboard with Leopold standing, and the picture 
               of their mother on the wall behind them.

               The music of the Mass fades as Leopold crumples the letter 
               in his hand.

               are seen cantering two people on horseback: the Emperor Joseph

               glossy horses. The Princess rides side-saddle. Running beside

               niece, a dumpy little Hapsburg girl of sixteen, like a sack 
               of potatoes. As they draw level with Salieri they stop, and

               He offers her the dish. She takes one and puts it in her

</b>                         Astounding! It was actually beyond 
                         belief. These were first and only 
                         drafts of music yet they showed no 
                         corrections of any kind. Not one.  
                         Do you realize what that meant?

               Vogler stares at him.

                         finished in his head. Page after 
                         page of it, as if he was just taking 
                         dictation. And music finished as no 
                         music is ever finished.

<b>               INT. SALIERI'S SALON - LATE AFTERNOON - 1780'S
</b>
               CU, The manuscript in Mozart's handwriting. The music begins 
               to sound under the following:

<b>                                     OLD SALIERI (V.O.)
</b>                         Displace one note and there would be 
                         diminishment. Displace one phrase, 
                         and the structure would fall. It was 
                         clear to me. That sound I had heard 
                         in the Archbishop's palace had been 
                         no accident. Here again was the very 
                         voice of God! I was staring through 
                         the cage of those meticulous ink-
                         strokes at an absolute, inimitable 
                         beauty.

               The music swells. What we now hear is an amazing collage of 
               great passages from Mozart's music, ravishing to Salieri and 
               to us. The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits 
               happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks 
               around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping 
               them on the floor when he is done with them. We see his 
               agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough 
               and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and 
               great pain coalesce. More pages fall than he can read, 
               scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles 
               the room.

               Finally, we hear the tremendous Qui Tollis from the Mass in 
               C Minor. It seems to break over him like a wave and, unable 
               to bear any more of it, he slams the portfolio shut. 
               Instantly, the music breaks off, reverberating in his head. 
               He stands shaking, staring wildly. Constanze gets up, 
               perplexed.

               massive chord, and the great Qui Tollis from the Mass in C 
               Minor fills the room. To its grand and weighty sound, 
               Constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri.  
               Between him and her, music is an active presence, hurting

               pounds in his head. The candle flickers over her as she 
               removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace. Suddenly

               door. The music stops abruptly. They stare at the appalled

                         Now let's go to it. I've been waiting 
                         all day for this.

               He leads the way into:

<b>               INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY - 1780'S
</b>
               A forte-piano is open and waiting. All the dogs follow him.  
               After them come Mozart Frau and Fraulein Schlumberg. To 
               Mozart's dismay, husband and wife seat themselves quite 
               formally on a little narrow sofa, side by side.

<b>                                     SCHLUMBERG

                         Now sit down all of you and behave. 
                         Zeman, Mandi, absolutely quiet!

                         Especially you, Dudelsachs - not one 
                         sound from you.

               The dogs settle at their feet. Husband and wife smile 
               encouragingly at each other.

               Mozart gestures to the music bench. Reluctantly, the girl 
               sits at the instrument. Mozart sits beside her.

                         Come on now - courage. Play me 
                         something you know.

               In response the wretched girl just stares down at the keyboard 
               without playing a note. An awkward pause.

<b>                                     MOZART
</b>                         Perhaps it would be better if we 
                         were left alone. I think we're both 
                         a little shy.

               Husband and wife look at each other.

<b>                                     SCHLUMBERG

                         just willful! You give into her now, 
                         you'll be sorry later. Strudel - 
                         play.

               Silence. The girl sits unmoving. Schlumberg bellows:

</b>                         Perhaps if I were to play a little 
                         first, it might encourage the 
                         Fraulein.
                              (to the girl)
                         Why don't you let me try the 
                         instrument? All right?

               Suddenly the girl rises. Mozart smiles at the parents. They 
               smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises 
               his hands and preludes over the keys. Instantly a dog howls 
               loudly. Startled, Mozart stops. Schlumberg leaps to his feet 
               and goes over to the beagle.

<b>                                     SCHLUMBERG
</b>                         Stop that, Dudelsachs! Stop it at 
                         once!
                              (to Mozart)
                         Don't let him disturb you. He'll be 
                         all right. He's just a little willful 
                         too. Please, please - play. I beg 
                         you.

               Mozart resumes playing. This time it is a lively piece, 
               perhaps the Presto Finale from the K. 450. The dog howls 
               immediately.

               Mozart stops.

<b>                                     SCHLUMBERG
</b>                         No, not you. I was talking to the 
                         dog. You keep playing. It's most 
                         important. He always howls when he 
                         hears music. We've got to break them 
                         of the habit. Play, please. Please!

               Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again. The dog howls 
               louder.

<b>                                     SCHLUMBERG
</b>                         That's it. Now keep going, just keep 
                         going.
                              (to the beagle)
                         Now you stop that noise, Dudelsachs, 
                         you stop it this instant! This 
                         instant, do you hear me? Keep going, 
                         Herr Mozart, that's it. Go on, go 
                         on!

               Mozart plays on. Suddenly the dog falls silent. Schlumberg 
               smiles broadly.

                         Very, very good Dudelsachs.
                              (to his wife, snapping 
                              his fingers)
                         Quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit.

               The wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits. A servant brings 
               in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray. He 
               puts it down beside Mozart as Schlumberg addresses the silent 
               dog with deepest affection.

                         reward? Clever, clever Dudi.

               He gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily.  
               Mozart stops playing and stands up.

                         goodbye, Sir!

               He bows to them and leaves the room. They look after him in 
               puzzled astonishment.

<b>               EXT. A BUSY STREET IN VIENNA - DAY - 1780'S
</b>
               A cheerful scene. We see Mozart strutting and beaming, making 
               his way through the crowd of porters, carriers and hawkers, 
               sellers of sausages and pastries, vendors of hats and ribbons.  
               Horses and carriage clatter past him. His mood is best 
               expressed by a bubbling version of Non piu Andrai played on 
               the forte-piano.

               Still in the same mood, he enters the door of his own house.

<b>               INT. MOZART'S HOUSE - HALLWAY -  DAY - 1780'S
</b>
               Suddenly, he stops. He looks up the stairs. The grim opening 
               chords from the Overture to Don Giovanni cut across the march 
               from Figaro. What he sees, looking up the stairs, is a 
               menacing figure in a long, grey cape and dark grey hat, 
               standing on the landing. The light comes from behind the 
               figure so that we see only its silhouette as it unfolds its 
               arms towards Mozart in an alarming gesture of possession.  
               It takes a beat in which the air of sinister mystery is held 
               before Mozart realizes who it is. Then, as the music 
               continues, he hastily sets down the bottle of wine and rushes 
               joyfully up the stairs and hurls himself into the figure's 
               arms.

               Both men embrace. The music slowly fades.

<b>               INT. MOZART'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - 1780'S
</b>
               A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied 
               for ages. We see music lying everywhere. Also there are many 
               empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a 
               mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white 
               keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food.

               Mozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an 
               aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His 
               face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health.

               Mozart ducks away and fetches his father's bags from the

               bedroom. Constanze lies in bed. She sits up, startled.

               Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold.  
               Leopold stares back from the doorway.

               The jaunty tune of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein (K.539) 
               sounds through all the following. This is an alternate song 
               from Il Seraglio: a very extroverted tune for baritone and 
               orchestra and a prominent part for bass drum. The vocal part 
               should be arranged for trumpet.

               This is a shop where one can buy costumes for masquerades.  
               It is filled with extravagant costumes of various kinds.  
               Wolfgang is wearing a costume, a mask pushed up on his 
               forehead; Constanze is wearing a little white velvet mask. 

               Amidst the merriment, Leopold is helped by two assistants to 
               put on a dark grey cloak and a dark grey tricorne hat, to 
               which is attached a full mask of dark grey. Its mouth is cut 
               into a fixed upward smile.

               He turns and looks at his son through this mask.

<b>               INT. A LARGE PARTY ROOM - VIENNA - NIGHT - 1780'S
</b>
               We are in the full whirl of a Masquerade Ball. Couples are 
               dancing around dressed in fantastic costumes. The music of 
               Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein increases in volume and 
               persists. We see the musicians thumping it out on a balustrade 
               above the dancers. A steer is being roasted. Through the 
               bobbing crowd we see a group, headed by the figure of Bacchus:  
               this is Schikaneder in a Greek costume, wearing vine leaves 
               in his hair. He is accompanied by his usual trio of actresses 
               and three other men. Constanze as Columbine and Mozart as 
               Harlequin are pulling Leopold by the hand of his dark cloak 
               and smiling mask. This whole group threads its way across 
               the crowded room and disappears through a door. As they go, 
               they are watched by Salieri, standing alone in a corner, 
               wearing ordinary evening clothes. He turns away hastily to 
               avoid being seen by them.

               As soon as they disappear into the far room, Salieri goes 
               quickly to a lady in the corner who is giving guests domino 
               masks off a tray. He quickly takes a small black mask and 
               puts it on.

</b>
<b>               INT. A GROTTO ROOM NEXT DOOR - NIGHT - 1780'S
</b>
               A fantastic room designed as a rocky grotto, lit by candles.  
               A forte-piano to one side is being played by Schikaneder:  
               the music of Ich Mochte Wohl Der Kaiser sein cross-fades to 
               another tune.  This is Vivat Bacchus from Il Seraglio which

               Schikaneder, dressed as Bacchus, is humming as he plays. The 
               music is actually accompanying a game of Forfeits, which has 
               begun. Five couples (the group we have just seen) are dancing 
               in the middle of a ring made by nine chairs. When the music 
               stops they will each have to find a chair, and the one who 
               fails must pay a forfeit.

               Constanze is dancing with Leopold; Mozart is dancing with 
               one of the actresses; the two other actresses are dancing 
               with two other gentlemen; and two children dance together - 
               a little boy and a little girl. The scene is watched by a 
               circle of bystanders; among them - from the doorway - is 
               Salieri.

               Schikaneder stops playing. Immediately the couples scramble 
               for the chairs. Leopold and Constanze meet on the same chair, 
               bumping and pushing at each other to get sole possession of 
               it. To the amusement of the people around, the chair over-
               balances and they both end up on the floor. Constanze 
               immediately gets up again, sets the chair on its feet, and 
               tries to pretend she was sitting in it all the time. But 
               Schikaneder calls out from the forte-piano.

<b>                                     SCHIKANEDER
</b>                         No, no! You both lost. You both lost. 
                         You both have to forfeit. And the 
                         penalty is you must exchange your 
                         wigs.

               People are delighted by the idea of this penalty. The children 
               jump up and down with excitement. The three actresses 
               immediately surround Leopold, reaching for his hat and mask 
               and wig, whilst he tries to hold on to them. Mozart takes 
               off Constanze's wig - an absurd affair with side-curls. 
               Constanze laughingly surrenders it.

                         please!

               Despite his protests an actress takes off his hat, to which 
               the smiling mask is attached, to reveal his outraged face 
               showing a very different expression underneath. Another 
               actress snatches off his wig to reveal very sparse hair on 
               the old man's head. The third actress takes Constanze's wig 
               from Mozart and attempts to put it on his father's head.

                         This is just a game, Papa.

               Constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice.

</b>                         This is just a game, Papa!

               Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the 
               children.

</b>                         This is just a game, Papa!

               As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds 
               in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody 
               bursts into applause. Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's 
               wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a 
               weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he 
               looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig.  
               Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to 
               dance. Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves 
               the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone. Seeing 
               this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father 
               entreatingly by the arm.

                         fun. Come on. Here, take mine.

               He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered 
               head. The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat 
               bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. He 
               takes Constanze's wig from his father. As this happens, the 
               music stops again. Mozart gently pushes his father down onto 
               a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; 
               and he is left as the Odd Man Out. He giggles. Schikaneder

</b>                         And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian 
                         Bach.

               Renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty. Mozart smiles 
               at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves. He 
               defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his 
               back to the keyboard. Before the astonished eyes of the 
               company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task. 
               His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, 
               and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant 
               fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been 
               dancing.

               Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer 
               to the instrument. So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of 
               the bystanders. Constanze watches him approach. Only Leopold 
               sits by himself, sulking.

               The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping. The guests call out 
               to Mozart.

                         For Salieri one has to face the right 
                         way around.

               Giggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard. Then, 
               watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody.

               He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his 
               eyes. Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, 
               in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a 
               totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and 
               dominant, endlessly repeated. The music is the very essence 
               of banality. The bystanders rock with laughter. Mozart starts 
               to giggle wildly. Through this excruciating scene, Salieri 
               stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks 
               challengingly back at him.

               Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a 
               fart noise instead of notes to end cadences. He builds this 
               up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly 
               he stops and cries out. The laughter cuts off. Mozart stands 
               up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his 
               breeches. The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl 
               of laughter.

               It is littered with manuscripts. In the middle stands a 
               billiard table. The beautiful closing ensemble from Act IV 
               of Figaro: Ah, Tutti contenti! Saremo cosi plays in the 
               background. Standing at the billiard table, Mozart is dreamily 
               hearing the music and playing shots on the table.

               From time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript 
               paper and jots down notes. He is very much in his own world 
               of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation.  
               Presently, however, we hear a knocking at the door.

               The final movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto in E-flat (K. 
               482) begins. To its lively music, the door of the house bursts 
               open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried 
               out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street.  
               Following them immediately appear Wolfgang, Constanze and 
               Leopold, all three dressed for an occasion. They climb into 
               a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte-piano. 
               As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering 
               slyly around to see that they are out of sight. Then she 
               shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction.

               the final movement of his E-flat concerto with an orchestra. 
               Listening to him is a sizable audience, including the Emperor, 
               flanked by Strack and Von Swieten.

               The crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood: it is a 
               delightful open-air scene. We hear the gayest and most complex 
               passage. Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays 
               his own work brilliantly. We stay with this scene for a little

               She opens a drawer in a sideboard. Inside we see one gold 
               snuff box: it is the one we saw Mozart being presented with 
               as a child in the Vatican.

               immensely excited. He moves slowly into the 'holy of holies' 
               picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball; a 
               discarded wig; a sock; a buckle - then objects more important 
               to him. Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, 
               he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather. He touches 
               the inkstand. He lays a finger on the candlestick with its 
               half-expired candle. He touches each object as if it were 
               the memento of a beloved. He is in awe. Finally his eye falls 
               on the sheets of music themselves. Stealthily he picks them 
               up.

                         do, I have good reason. Figaro is a 
                         bad play. It stirs up hatred between 
                         the classes. In France it has caused 
                         nothing but bitterness. My own dear

               It is a full orchestral rehearsal. Mozart is conducting from 
               the harpsichord with his hands; he does not use a baton.  
               The singers are all in practice clothes, not costumes.

               We are in the Act III and we hear the recitativo exchange 
               just before the march begins. Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno sit 
               watching chairs.

               Suddenly the march starts. Peasants and friends start to 
               dance in and at the same moment, Orsini-Rosenberg gets up 
               and comes down to Mozart. He is accompanied by an anxious 
               Bonno.

                         attended rehearsals - suddenly 
                         appeared.

               In the background the same recitativo before the March. The 
               Emperor steals in surreptitiously with Von Strack, his finger 
               to his lips. He motions everyone not to rise, and slips into 
               a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno.

               The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed.

               The recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is 
               silence. Mozart lays down his baton. The musicians lay down 
               their instruments. The celebrants of Figaro's wedding come 
               in with a few pitiful dance steps, in procession, only to 
               come presently to a halt, lacking their music. The singers 
               try to go on singing, but they have no cues from their 
               conductor or from the accompaniment. Everyone on stage looks 
               lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while. 
               Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart 
               glances back at the group seated in the theatre.  Finally,

               Countess sit in their chairs.

               In the theatre we see increasing pleasure on the Emperor's

               The theatre is brilliantly lit for the first public 
               performance of Figaro. Everybody is there: the Emperor, Von 
               Strack, Bonno Orsini-Rosenberg, Von Swieten, even Madame 
               Weber and her daughters in a box. The musicians all wear 
               imperial livery; the actors on stage are now in costume.  
               Mozart, conducting, wears his Order of the Golden Spur. The

               march, which reaches a triumphant climax.

                         revealed. One of the true wonders of 
                         art. The restored third act was bold

                         music of true forgiveness filling 
                         the theatre, conferring on all who 
                         sat there a perfect absolution. God

               The ensemble reaches its climax, and fades away to the very 
               quiet, slow chords immediately preceding the boisterous final 
               chord. Salieri becomes aware that some of the audience are 
               asleep and many mare are apathetic. In the near silence we 
               see the Emperor yawn behind his hand. Those nearby look at

               A performance of Salieri's grand opera, Axur: King of Ormus.  
               Deafening applause from a crowded house. We see the reception 
               of the aria which we saw Cavalieri singing on the stage near 
               the start of the film. Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian 
               costume, is bowing to the rapturous throng; below her is 
               Salieri. We see the Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, 
               Bonno and Von Swieten, all applauding. We hear great cries 
               of 'Salieri! Salieri!' and 'Bravo!' and 'Brava!'

               Then suddenly at:

               CU, Mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly. Behind 
               him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three girls we saw before

               CU, Salieri staring fixedly at Mozart, then Mozart still 
               clapping, apparently with tremendous enthusiasm.

               Salieri conducting the last scene from Axur: King of Ormus.  
               On stage we see a big scene of acclamation: the hero and 
               heroine of the opera accepting the crown amidst the rejoicing 
               of the people. The decor and costumes are mythological 
               Persian. The music is utterly conventional and totally 
               uninventive.

               CU, Mozart watching this in his box, with Schikaneder and 
               the three actresses. He passes an open bottle of wine to 
               them. He is evidently a little drunk, but keeps a poker face.

               The act comes to an end. Great applause in which Mozart joins 
               in, standing and shouting 'Bravo! Bravo!' Then he leaves the 
               box with Schikaneder and the girls.

<b>               INT. STAGE OF THE OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT - 1780'S
</b>
               A crowd of people rings Salieri at a respectful distance.  
               The Emperor is holding out the Civilian Medal and Chain.

<b>                                     JOSEPH
</b>                         I believe that is the best opera yet 
                         written, my friends. Salieri, you 
                         are the brightest star in the musical 
                         firmament. You do honour to Vienna 
                         and to me.

               Salieri bows his head. Joseph places the chain around his 
               neck. The crowd claps. Salieri makes to kiss his hand, but 
               Joseph restrains him, and passes on. Cavalieri, smiling 
               adoringly, gives him a deep curtsey, and he raises her up.

               The crowd all flock to Salieri with cries and words of 
               approval. All want to shake his hand. They tug and pat him.  
               But he has eyes for only one man - he looks about him, 
               searching for him and then finds him. Mozart stands there. 
               Eagerly Salieri moves to him.

               Explosive laughter as Mozart and Schikaneder enter the 
               apartment, very pleased with themselves and accompanied by 
               the three actresses. The front door opens, very gingerly.  
               Mozart, still rather drunk, sticks his head into the room, 
               anxious not to make a noise. He sees the strangers and breaks 
               into a smile.

               On stage we see a huge nailed fist crash through the wall of 
               a painted dining room set. The giant armoured statue of the 
               COMMENDATORE enters pointing his finger in accusation at Don 
               Giovanni who sits at the supper table, staring - his servant 
               Leporello quaking with fear under the table.

               The figure advances on the libertine. We see Mozart 
               conducting, pale and deeply involved. Music fades down a 
               little.

                         next and blackest opera. There on 
                         the stage stood the figure of a dead 
                         commander calling out 'Repent! 
                         Repent!'

               The music swells. We see Salieri standing alone in the back 
               of a box, unseen, in semi-darkness. We also see that the 
               theatre is only half full. Music fades down.

                         that the horrifying apparition was 
                         Leopold, raised from the dead. 
                         Wolfgang had actually summoned up 
                         his own father to accuse his son 
                         before all the world. It was 
                         terrifying and wonderful to watch.

               Music swells up again. We watch the scene on stage as the 
               Commendatore addresses Giovanni. Then back to Salieri in the 
               box. Music down again.

                         was played only five times in Vienna.

                         those five - all alone - unable to 
                         help myself, worshipping sound I 
                         alone seemed to hear.

                         understanding even more clearly how 
                         that bitter old man was still 
                         possessing his poor son from beyond

                         over God, my torturer.

               Music swells. On stage Don Giovanni is seized and gripped by 
               the Statue's icy hand. Flames burst from obviously artificial 
               rocks. Demons appear and drag the libertine down to Hell.  
               The scene ends.

               CU, Salieri, staring wide-eyed.

               Noise; smoke; the audience is sitting at tables for an evening 
               of vaudeville. Mozart, Constanze and their son Karl, now 
               about two years old, and sitting on his mother's lap, are 
               watching a parody scene by Schikaneder's troupe. They are 
               rowdy, bawdy and silly, incorporating motifs, situations and 
               tunes from Mozart's operas which we have seen and heard. 
               Before them on the table are bottles of wine and beer, plates 
               of sausages, etc.

<b>               THE PARODY
</b>
               On stage we see a set which parodies the dining room in Don 
               Giovanni's palace, shown before.

               Schikaneder as Don Giovanni is dancing with the three 
               actresses to the minuet from Don Giovanni (end of Act I), 
               played by a quartet of tipsy musicians. Leporello is handing 
               around wine on a tray.

               Suddenly there is a tremendous knocking from outside. The 
               music slithers to a stop. All look at each other in panic. 
               Leporello drops his tray with a crash. All go quiet. One 
               more knock is heard. Then all musicians, actresses, Don 
               Giovanni and Leporello make a dash to hide under the table 
               which is far too small to accommodate them all. The table 
               rocks. Schikaneder is pushed out. He is terrified. He shakes 
               elaborately. Three more knocks are heard; louder.

<b>                                     SCHIKANEDER
</b>                         Who is it?

               One more knock.

<b>                                     SCHIKANEDER
</b>                         C-c-c-come in!

               In the pit a chromatic scale from the Overture to Don Giovanni 
               turns into a anticipatory vamp. This grows more and more 
               menacing until the whole flat representing the wall at the 
               back falls down.

               An absurd pantomime horse gallops in. It has a ridiculous 
               expression, and is manned by four men inside. Standing 
               precariously on its back is a dwarf, wearing a miniature 
               version of the armour and helmet worn by the Commendatore.  
               He sings in a high, nasal voice:

<b>                                     COMMENDATORE
</b>                              (singing)
                         Don Giovannnnnnnnnni!

               He tries to keep his balance as he trots in, but fails. He 
               falls off onto the stage. He beats at the horse, trying to 
               get back on.

<b>                                     COMMENDATORE
</b>                         Down! Down!

               Bewildered, the horse looks about him, but cannot see his 
               small rider who is below his level of sight.

<b>                                     COMMENDATORE
</b>                         I'm here! I'm here!

               The horse, amidst laughter from the audience, fails to locate 
               him. Exasperated, the dwarf signals to someone in the wings.  
               A tall man strides out carrying a see-saw; on his shoulders 
               stands another man.

               The dwarf stands on the lowered end of the see-saw. There is 
               a drum roll and the man above jumps down onto the raised end 
               and the Commendatore is abruptly catapulted back onto the 
               horse, only backwards so that he is facing away from Don 
               Giovanni. The two men bow to the applauding audience, and 
               retire off-stage.

               The Commendatore tries to extend his arms in the proper 
               menacing attitude, and at the same time turn around to face 
               Don Giovanni. This he finds difficult.

               A trapeze sails in from above. On it stands a grand soprano 
               wearing an elaborate Turkish costume, like a parody of 
               Cavalieri's in Il Seraglio. She comes in singing a mad

               The Commendatore pulls out his sword, reaches up and thrusts 
               her through with it. The soprano collapses on the bar of the 
               trapeze. The audience applauds. At the same moment eight 
               dwarves march in bearing a huge cauldron of steaming water. 
               They sing as they march to the sound of the march that was 
               cut from Act III of Figaro. They are dressed as miniature 
               copies of the chorus in that scene except that they are 
               wearing cooks' hats.

               They set the giant pot down in the middle of the stage. The 
               trapeze with the dead soprano is still swinging above the 
               stage.

               We hear the chromatic scale from the Don Giovanni overture 
               again, repeated and repeated, only now fast and tremolando. 
               To this exciting vamp Schikaneder suddenly rides in on a 
               real horse, waving a real sword. With this he cuts the string 
               of the trapeze, and the soprano falls into the pot. A 
               tremendous splash of water. Schikaneder rides out. More 
               applause.

               All the dwarves produce long wooden cooking spoons and climb 
               up the sides of the pot. The three girls produce labeled 
               bottles from under their skirts. The first is SALT.

               around on a hinge to turn his hind-quarters straight on to 
               the audience. The rest of him stays sideways. His tail springs 
               up in the air to reveal a lace handkerchief modestly hiding 
               his arsehole.

               Schikaneder offers him a handful of hay. The horse eats it, 
               and out the other end comes a long Viennese sausage. The 
               audience roars with laughter. Another handful of hay and out 
               of the other end falls a string of sausages. Then a large 
               pie, crust and all. Then a shower of iced cakes! 

               Suddenly - silence. Schikaneder produces an egg from his

               Leporello pries open the horse's mouth. Schikaneder pops the 
               egg into it. A breathless pause as a drum roll builds the 
               tension, up and up and up, and then suddenly out of the 
               horse's rear-end flies a single white dove.

               Wild applause.

               It flies into the audience. Immediately all the cast start 
               humming the lyrical finale from Figaro: Tutti Contenti.  
               More and more doves fly out from the wings and fill the 
               theatre. Everybody picks up the sausages and cakes and begins 
               to eat. The end of the sketch is unexpectedly lyrical and 
               magical, and then, suddenly, the tempo changes and the coarse 
               strains of Ich Mochte wohl Der Kaiser take over and the whole 
               company is dancing, frantically. A general dance as the 
               curtain falls.

               It rises immediately. The audience - including Mozart - is 
               delighted. They applaud vigorously. Schikaneder takes a bow 
               amongst his troupe. Among much whistling and clapping, he 
               finally jumps off the stage and strides through the audience 
               toward the table where Mozart sits with his family. On stage, 
               a troupe of bag pipers immediately appears to play an old 
               German tune. Some of the audience joins in singing it.

               Mozart is smiling; he has been amused. Constanze has been 
               less amused and is looking apprehensive.

               waiting. We see a few other customers being served by the 
               staff: renting masks, costumes, etc. One of the staff emerges 
               from the back of the shop carrying a large box, which he 
               hands to Salieri's servant. The servant leaves the shop.  
               Through the window we see him hurrying away through the snowy 
               street full of passers-by, carriages, etc.

</b>
               The D Minor Concerto continues. Salieri, alone, eagerly opens 
               the box from the costume shop and takes out the same dark 
               cloak and hat that Leopold wore to the masquerade, only now 
               attached to the hat is a dark mask whose mouth is cut into a 
               frown, not a laugh. It presents a bitter and menacing 
               expression. He puts on the cloak, the hat and the mask and 
               turns his back. Suddenly we see the assembled and alarming 
               image reflected in a full-length mirror. The music swells 
               darkly.

<b>               EXT. A SNOWY STREET IN VIENNA - DUSK - 1790'S
</b>
               As the tutti of the D Minor Concerto continues, we see 
               Salieri, dressed in this menacing costume, dark against the 
               snow, stalking through a street which is otherwise lively 
               with people going to various festivities. Some of them wear 
               frivolous carnival clothes.

</b>
               Mozart sits writing at a table. He appears now to be really 
               quite sick. His face expresses pain from his stomach cramps.  
               There is a gentle knock at the door. He rises, goes to he 
               door and opens it. Immediately there is a SHOCK CUT:

               The dark, frowning mask stares at him and at us. The violent 
               D Minor chord which opens Don Giovanni is heard. Salieri in 
               costume stands in the doorway.

               Salieri extends his hand. In it is a bag of money.

               Almost against his will, Mozart takes the money.

               He turns away. Mozart closes the front door. Instantly we 
               hear the opening of the Requiem Mass (also in D Minor).  
               Mozart turns and looks up at the portrait of his father on 
               the wall. The portrait stares back. Constanze opens the door 
               from the bedroom. She sees him staring up.

                         His coffin, Mozart's little coffin 
                         in the middle. And suddenly in that

               Mozart sits working frantically at this demonic music. His 
               whole expression is one of wildness and engulfing fever. He 
               pours wine down his throat, spilling it, and grimaces as it 
               hits his stomach. All around him are manuscripts.

               There is a banging at the front door. Mozart does not hear 
               it; the music raves on. Another knocking comes, louder. 
               Constanze appears from the bedroom and stares at her 
               distracted husband. The knocking is repeated again, even 
               more violently and insistently.

               Now a little scared herself, Constanze goes to he front door 
               and opens it cautiously. Schikaneder stands there, floridly 
               dressed as usual. Lorl is seen peeking out from the kitchen.

               The Overture to The Magic Flute begins grandly. To the music 
               of the slow introduction, we see:

<b>               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
</b>
               The room, lit by a few candles, appears dirty. The camera 
               shows us again Leopold's portrait on the wall, looking down 
               upon a scene of disorder.

               Papers litter the table; dirty dishes are piled in the 
               fireplace; on the forte-piano lies Mozart's Masonic apron, 
               woven with symbols. To the more lyrical passage of the 
               introduction, we see Mozart take up a candle and enter:

<b>               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
</b>
               We watch him stand beside Constanze, who lies asleep. Mozart 
               now looks very ill; his wife appears worn out. Tenderly he 
               touches her hair. Then he moves to the cot where his son 
               Karl lies asleep and kneels, pulls up the child's little 
               blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the 
               boy's. Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him. Mozart 
               rises and returns to:

<b>               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1790'S
</b>
               The Introduction ends and suddenly the brilliant fast fugue 
               begins. Instantly Mozart starts to dance to it, all alone: 
               gleefully, like a child. He looks up at his father's portrait, 
               and makes a silly, rude gesture at it. He is, briefly, an 
               irresponsible and happy boy again.

               Then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door. The 
               music fades down. Warily, Mozart crosses and opens he door. 
               The familiar dark chords from Don Giovanni cut across the 
               happy music. It ends. Before him stands the masked stranger.

               He turns and looks. Constanze has come into the living room.  
               Nervously, Mozart indicates her.

               He turns and goes down the stairs. Mozart shuts the door; he 
               closes his eyes in fear.

               Her tears flow. Mozart looks at her helplessly.

               She sits down tearfully, staring at him.

               We hear the Rex Tremendai Majestatis from the Requiem and 
               see on the wall the portrait of Leopold Mozart looking down.  
               The camera pans slowly downward from it back to the table. 
               Mozart is writing the music. He looks up and sees that 
               Constanze is fast asleep in her chair. Mozart gets up quietly.  
               He puts on his hat and cloak, takes a bottle of wine and 
               tiptoes from the house. Without stopping, the music changes 
               from the heavy Requiem to the light-hearted patter of the 
               Papa-Papa duet from The Magic Flute.

</b>
               This little wooden structure stands in a courtyard in the 
               tenement by the Weiden. Inside, we see a table, chairs, a 
               forte-piano, bottles and a chaos of papers. Strewn about in 
               the chairs are the three actresses, giggling. Schikaneder 
               and Mozart, both drunk, are singing the duet of the two bird-
               people. The actor sings Papageno and the composer, in a 
               soprano voice, sings Papagena at the keyboard. Absurdly, 
               they end up rubbing noses and fall on each other's necks.

               There are a few people about. He goes into his apartment

               He comes through he door and stares across the living room 
               at an open bedroom door. Puzzled, he crosses.

               The bedroom is also empty. We see Constanze's empty bed; 
               Karl's empty bed; empty closets.

               Frau Weber sits grimly talking. Mozart sits also, completely 
               exhausted and passive under the rain of her constant speech.

                         I'm proud of it. 'Leave,' I said. 
                         'Right away! Take he child and go,

                         if you can.' I was shocked. Shocked 
                         to my foundation. Is that my girl?  
                         Can that be my Stanzi? The happy 
                         little moppet I brought up, that

                         and your music! Do you know how often 
                         she's sat in that very chair, weeping 
                         her eyes out of her head because of 
                         you? I warned her. 'Choose a man, 
                         not a baby,' I said. But would she 
                         listen? Who listens? 'He's just a 
                         silly boy,' she says. Silly, my arse.  
                         Selfish - that's all you are. Selfish!

               And with a scream Madame Weber's voice turns into the shrill 
               packing coloratura of the second act aria of the Queen of 
               the Night, in The Magic Flute.

               On stage we see the QUEEN OF THE NIGHT fantastically costumed, 
               furiously urging her daughter to kill Sarastro. As she sings, 
               we see the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged from 
               when we last visited it to watch the Cabaret. An audience of 
               ordinary German citizens stands in the pit area, or sits:  
               they are rapt and excited.

               The theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed 
               curtains - their inhabitants presumably engaged in private 
               intimacies. In one of them sits Salieri.

               Thunder and lightning. She disappears amidst tremendous 
               applause from the audience.

               We CUT TO the scene immediately before Papageno's song, Ein 
               Madchen oder Weibchen. Papageno, played by Schikaneder, 
               dressed in his costume of feathers, is trying to get through 
               a mysterious door. A voice calls from within.

               Papageno recoils.

                         Which was it? Was it this one? Come 
                         on, tell me!

               Papageno recoils.

</b>                         Now, I can't go forward and I can't 
                         go back. Oh, this is awful!

               He weeps extravagantly.

               In the pit, Mozart indicates to the first violinist to take 
               over as conductor. He slips from his place and goes stealthily 
               backstage. We follow him. Over the scene we hear Papageno 
               being addressed by the First Priest in stern tones.

<b>                                     FIRST PRIEST
</b>                              (on stage)
                         Man, thou hast deserved to wander 
                         forever in the darkest chasms of the 
                         earth. The gentle Gods have remitted 
                         thy punishment, but yet thou shalt 
                         never feel the Divine Content of the 
                         consecrated ones.

<b>                                     PAPAGENO
</b>                         Oh well, I'm not alone in that. Just 
                         give me a decent glass of wine - 
                         that's divine content enough for me.

               Laughter. An enormous goblet of wine appears out of the earth.

               We follow Mozart into the wings. Actors and actresses stand 
               around in fantastic costumes. We see a flying chariot and 
               parts of a huge snake lying about. Also the scenery door of 
               a temple with the word 'Wisdom' inscribed on the pediment. 
               Mozart walks to where there stands a keyboard glockenspiel 
               with several manuals, and a musician waiting to play it. 
               Silently Mozart indicates that he wishes to play the 
               instrument himself.

               On stage Schikaneder is being addressed haughtily by the 
               First Priest.

<b>                                     FIRST PRIEST
</b>                         Man, hast thou no other desire on 
                         earth, but just to eat and drink?

                         Well!

               Laughter from the audience.

<b>                                     PAPAGENO
</b>                         Well, actually I do have a rather 
                         weird feeling in my heart. Perhaps 
                         it's just indigestion. But you know, 
                         I really would like - I really do 
                         want - something even nicer than 
                         food and drink. Now what on earth 
                         could that be?

               He stares at the audience and winks at them. They laugh.

               Now Papageno's aria (Ein Madchen oder Weibchen) begins. It 
               is interpolated, as he pretends to play his magic bells, 
               with the glockenspiel actually being played off-stage by 
               Mozart. Schikaneder looks into the pit and does not see Mozart 
               conducting. He looks into the wings and realizes the situation 
               with amusement. He sings joyfully and the audience watches 
               entranced.

               At certain moments we see the stage from Salieri's point of 
               view: Schikaneder singing, then pretending to play; and then 
               we see Mozart playing the glockenspiel with great flourishes 
               in the wings. Then, suddenly, the actor mimes playing, and 
               no sound comes. He mimes again, but still nothing comes. He 
               looks offstage in anxiety; there is evidently some commotion.  
               People are looking down on the floor. The song comes to a 
               near-halt. Schikaneder stares. Then the comedian signals to 
               the deputy conductor to pick up the song and finish it. At 
               this moment Salieri gets up and hastily leaves his box.

<b>               INT. WINGS OF SCHIKANEDER'S THEATRE - NIGHT - 1790'S
</b>
               We see the actress playing Papagena, wearing an old tattered 
               cloak and about to tie a little painted cloth representing a 
               hideous old woman over her face. She is looking worriedly 
               down at Mozart, who is lying unconscious on the floor.

               A few people around him are trying to revive him. One has 
               put a wet handkerchief around his temples. Another is holding 
               a small bottle of smelling salts. There are voices saying, 
               'Doctor! Take him to a dressing room. Someone call a carriage. 
               Take him home.' Etc. Papagena is urged to go on stage by a 
               distracted stage manager. Suddenly we hear the voice of 
               Salieri.

<b>                                     SALIERI

               He steps forward.

</b>                         I have a carriage. Excuse me.

               The actors step back respectfully. He stoops and picks up 
               the frail composer in his arms. Mozart is quite limp and 
               Salieri has to fling his arms around his own neck. All this 
               is watched nervously by Schikaneder on stage whilst performing 
               his scene with Papagena as an ugly old woman.

               Audience laughter. The actress raises the little painted 
               cloth with the ugly old face on it to show her own pretty 
               young one to the audience. More laughter.

               A waiting sedan chair. Mozart has recovered consciousness, 
               but looks exceedingly ill. Salieri has set him down in the 
               winter's night. Snow is falling.

               The door is shut. The chair sets off and Salieri strides 
               beside it, through the mean street. A lantern with a candle 
               swings from the chair.

               The door opens. Salieri enters carrying the lantern from the 
               sedan chair. He is followed by Mozart, carried in the arms 
               of one of the porters. The room is now really in complete 
               disarray. The table is piled high with music: the pages of 
               the Requiem lie amongst many empty wine bottles. The porter 
               carries Mozart into

               This room is miserably neglected. The bed is unmade, clothes 
               lie about on the floor. A sock has been stuck into the broken 
               pane of one window.

               The porter lays Mozart down on the bed as Salieri lights 
               candles from the lantern to reveal plates of half-eaten food 
               and other signs left by a man whose wife has departed. It is 
               obviously very cold. Another very small bed nearby belongs 
               to the child, Karl.

               Salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal

</b>
               Mozart is sitting up in bed, propped against pillows. The 
               coins lie on the coverlet; many candles burn in the necks of 
               bottles. Salieri, without coat or wig, is seated at an 
               improvised worktable. On it are blank sheets of music paper, 
               quills, and ink. Also the score of the Requiem Mass as so 
               far composed. Mozart is bright-eyed with a kind of fever. 
               Salieri is also possessed with an obviously feverish desire 
               to put down the notes as quickly as Mozart can dictate them.

               Salieri writes this, and continues now to write as swiftly 
               and urgently as he can, at Mozart's dictation. He is obviously 
               highly expert at doing this and hardly hesitates. His speed, 
               however, can never be too fast for Mozart's impatient mind.

               Salieri sings back the first six measures of the bass line.  
               After the first two measures a chorus of basses fades in on 
               the soundtrack and engulfs his voice. They stop.

               His voice is lost on the last words, as tenors engulf it and 
               take over the soundtrack, singing their whole line from the 
               beginning, right to the end of the sixth measure where the 
               basses stopped, but he goes on mouthing the sounds with them.  
               Salieri writes feverishly. We see his pen jotting down the 
               notes as quickly as possible: the ink flicks onto the page.  
               The music stops again.

               Mozart glares at him, irritated. His hands move impatiently.  
               Salieri scribbles frantically.

               He again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, 
               conducting. On the soundtrack, we hear the second bassoon 
               and bass trombone play it with him and the first bassoon and 
               tenor trombone come in on top, playing the tenor vocal line.  
               We also hear the trumpets and timpani. The sound is bare and 
               grim. It stops at the end of the sixth measure. Salieri stops 
               writing.

                         to the dominant chord. Do you see?

               As Salieri writes, Mozart sings the ostinato from the 
               beginning, but the unaccompanied strings overwhelm his voice 
               on the soundtrack, playing the first six bars of their 
               agitated accompaniment. They stop.

                         whole thing from the beginning - 
                         now!

               The entire Confutatis bursts over the room, as Mozart snatches 
               the manuscript pages from Salieri and reads from it, singing. 
               Salieri sits looking on in wondering astonishment. The music 
               continues right through the following scenes, to the end of 
               the movement.

<b>               EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - WINTER NIGHT - 1790'S
</b>
               A carriage is driving fast through the night. Snow lies on 
               the countryside.

<b>               INT. THE CARRIAGE  NIGHT - 1790'S
</b>
               The carriage is filled with passengers. Among them Constanze 
               and Karl, her young son. They are sleepless and sway to the 
               motion of the vehicle.

</b>
               Mozart lying in bed exhausted, but still dictating urgently.  
               We do not hear what he is saying to Salieri, who still sits 
               writing assiduously. Mozart is looking very sick: sweat is 
               pouring from his forehead.

<b>               EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - WINTER NIGHT - 1790'S

               The carriage, moving through the night, to the sound of the 
               music.

               Mozart still dictating; Salieri still writing without stop.

</b>
               The carriage has arrived. Constanze and her son alight with 
               other passengers. Postillions attend to the horses. She takes 
               her boy's hand. It is a cold wintry dawn.

               The music stutters to a close. End of the Confutatis.

               Mozart closes his eyes. Salieri stares at him.

               Constanze and Karl approach along the cobbled street, hand 
               in hand toward their house. Snow lies in the street.

<b>               INT. MOZART'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN - 1790'S
</b>
               Mozart lies asleep in the bed, holding the last pages of the 
               manuscript. Salieri lies across from him on Karl's small bed 
               in his shirt sleeves and waistcoat. The child's bed is 
               obviously too small for him and he is forced in to a cramped 
               position.

<b>               EXT. MOZART'S APARTMENT HOUSE - DAWN - 1790'S

               Constanze and Karl arrive at the door. They enter.

               It is as disordered as before, save that the table, previously 
               littered with pages, is now completely bare. Constanze looks 
               at it with surprise and enters the bedroom.

               Mozart is asleep in the bed. Salieri is dozing on the nearby 
               child's bed. The room is full of the trailing smoke from 
               guttering and guttered candles. Startled by Constanze's 
               entrance and her young son, Salieri scrambles up. As he does 
               so, he attempts to button his waistcoat, but does it ineptly, 
               so that the vestment becomes bunched up, making him look 
               absurd.

               She notices a movement from the bed. Mozart wakes. He sees 
               Constanze and smiles with real joy. Forgetting Salieri, she 
               goes to her husband.

               She hugs her husband desperately. He stares at her with 
               obvious relief, not able to speak. Suddenly she sees the 
               manuscript in his hand.

               She takes it from his weak hand. At the same moment Salieri 
               reaches out his hand to take it and add it to the pile on 
               the table.

               She stares at him, trying to understand - suspicious and 
               frightened and at the same time unable to make a sound. Mozart 
               makes a convulsive gesture to reclaim the pages. The coins 
               brought by Salieri fall on the floor.  Karl runs after them,

               Salieri hesitates.

               With extreme reluctance - it costs him agony to do it - 
               Salieri hands over the score of the Requiem to her.

               locks it and pockets the key. Involuntarily Salieri stretches

               bed. Mozart appears to have gone to sleep again.

               the floor. Faintly we hear the start of the Lacrimosa from 
               the Requiem. Salieri watches as she touches her husband's 
               hand. As the music grows, we realize that Mozart is dead.

               CU, Constanze staring wide-eyed in dawning apprehension.

               The Lacrimosa continues through all of the following: a small 
               group of people emerges from the side door into the raw, wet 
               day, accompanying a cheap wooden coffin. The coffin is borne 
               by a gravedigger and Schikaneder in mourning clothes. They 
               load it onto a cart, drawn by a poor black horse. All the 
               rest are in black, also: Salieri, Von Swieten, Constanze and 
               her son, Karl, Madame Weber and her youngest daughter Sophie, 
               and even Lorl, the maid. It is drizzling. The cart sets off.

               The group has already passed beyond the city limits following 
               the miserable cart. The Lacrimosa accompanies them with its 
               measured thread.

               The drizzle of rain has now become heavy. One by one, the 
               group breaks up and shelters under the trees. The cart moves 
               on toward the cemetery, alone, followed by nobody, growing 
               more and more distant. They watch it go.

               Salieri and Von Swieten shake hands mournfully, the water 
               soaking their black tall hats. Schikaneder is in tears. 
               Constanze is near collapse. Salieri moves to assist her, but 
               she turns away from him, seeking the arm of Cavalieri. Madame 
               Weber takes Karl's hand.

               The music builds to its climax on Dona Eis Pacem! We CUT

</b>                         Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You 
                         serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, 
                         not I. Took him, snatched him away, 
                         without pity. He destroyed His beloved 
                         rather than let a mediocrity like me 
                         get the smallest share in his glory.  
                         He doesn't care. Understand that. 
                         God cares nothing for the man He 
                         denies and nothing either for the 
                         man He uses. He broke Mozart in half 
                         when He'd finished with him, and 
                         threw him away. Like an old, worn 
                         out flute.

</b>
               The rain has eased off. A LOCAL PRIEST with two boy acolytes 
               is standing beside an open communal grave. Mozart's body is 
               lifted out of the cheap pine box in a sack.

               We see that the grave contains twenty other such sacks. The 
               gravedigger throws the one containing Mozart amongst the 
               others. An assistant pours quicklime over the whole pile of 
               them. The acolytes swing their censers.

</b>                         Why did He do it? Why didn't He kill 
                         me? I had no value. What was the 
                         use, keeping me alive for thirty-two 
                         years of torture? Thirty-two years 
                         of honours and awards.

               He tears off the Civilian Medal and Chain with which the 
               Emperor invested him and has been wearing the whole time and 
               throws it across the room.

                         'distinguished - distinguished 
                         Salieri' - by men incapable of 
                         distinguishing! Thirty-two years of 
                         meaningless fame to end up alone in 
                         my room, watching myself become 
                         extinct. My music growing fainter, 
                         all the time fainter, until no one 
                         plays it at all. And his growing 
                         louder, filling the world with wonder. 
                         And everyone who loves my sacred art 
                         crying, Mozart! Bless you, Mozart.

               The door opens. An attendant comes in, cheerful and hearty.

<b>                                     ATTENDANT
</b>                         Good morning, Professor! Time for 
                         the water closet. And then we've got 
                         your favourite breakfast for you - 
                         sugar-rolls.
                              (to Vogler)
                         He loves those. Fresh sugar-rolls.

               Salieri ignores him and stares only at the priest, who stares 
               back.

</b>                         Goodbye, Father. I'll speak for you.  
                         I speak for all mediocrities in the 
                         world. I am their champion. I am 
                         their patron saint. On their behalf 
                         I deny Him, your God of no mercy.  
                         Your God who tortures men with 
                         longings they can never fulfill. He 
                         may forgive me: I shall never forgive 
                         Him.

               He signs to the attendant, who wheels him in his chair out 
               of the room. The priest stares after him.

<b>               INT. CORRIDOR OF THE HOSPITAL - MORNING
</b>
               The corridor is filled with patients in white linen smocks, 
               all taking their morning exercise walk in the care of nurses 
               and nuns. They form a long, wretched, strange procession - 
               some of them are clearly very disturbed. As Old Salieri is 
               pushed through them in his wheelchair, he lifts his hands to 
               them in benediction.

                         Amen!

               Finally, he turns full-face to the camera and blesses us the 
               audience, making the Sign of the Cross. Underneath we hear, 
               stealing in and growing louder, the tremendous Masonic Funeral 
               Music of Mozart.
