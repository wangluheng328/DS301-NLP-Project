During World War II, Lt. Aldo Raine leads his squad of Jewish-American soldiers behind enemy lines in Nazi occupied France.
Their job is simple: kill the enemy.
They also have a particularly violent approach to what they do scalping their victims.
Soon they are known and feared throughout the German army.
In Paris, Shosanna runs a cinema and through a chance meeting with a German war hero, is selected to host the premiere of one of Dr. Josef Goebbels propaganda film.
With all of the German high command scheduled to attend - including Hitler, Goering and Martin Bormann - it seems like the ideal opportunity for Lt. Raine and his men to bring the war to a quick end.
Shosanna, who is Jewish and whose parents and siblings were killed before her eyes, also has her own plans for the evening's festivities.
When she realizes that the man who killed her family Colonel Hans Landa, known as the Jew Hunter, will also be there it makes her own plans complete.
