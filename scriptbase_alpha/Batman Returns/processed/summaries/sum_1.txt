In this, the second Batman movie, megalomaniac businessman Max Shreck sets a plot against Gotham City in motion.
He is joined by Penguin, a deformed and rather deranged man abandoned at birth by respectable parents.
Penguin, backed by hoodlums and real penguins, runs for mayor.
The plot is further complicated by Selena, a wronged secretary who transforms into Catwoman, a villain with mixed motives.
