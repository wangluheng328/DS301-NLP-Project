When his old friend, the laboratory engineer Tom Gruneman, vanishes, detective John Klute is hired by Tom's colleague Peter Cable to search for him.
The unique lead is an obscene letter written by Tom to a call-girl in New York called Bree Daniels, and Klute moves to the Apple city to investigate the disappearance of Tom.
Klute blackmails Bree to help him to find other prostitutes that might have been with Tom using some tapes of her phone calls that he had secretly recorded.
They realize that some is stalking Bree, while Klute falls in love for Dress, and she has some sort of feeling that she can not understand for him.
