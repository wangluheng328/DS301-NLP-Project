Tom Welles, private eye, is hired by a wealthy widow, whose well-known husband passed away recently.
She has found a reel of S8-film in a safe.
On the film is a cruel slaughtering of a young girl, who obviously does not pretend or act: A snuff-movie.
Welles takes up investigation, which leads him to the girl's mother and from there to Hollywood, into the office of a porn flick producer.
Welles' rising obsession to solve the case also carries him away from his wife and new-born daughter.
But when finally names are at hand, Welles suddenly finds himself on ice much thinner than he planned.
