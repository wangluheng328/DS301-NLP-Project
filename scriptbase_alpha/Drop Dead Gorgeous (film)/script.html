</b>			(loud whisper)
		I'll be honest.  This is a hard time 
		for me.  This is the part of the 
		pageant when you realize that tomorrow 
		night, all but one of these girls will 
		walk out of here a loser.  It's hard 
		for me to know how that must feel, but 
		I'm sure it doesn't feel good.

	In b.g., a BIG STAGE LIGHT FALLS on Janelle's head.

		change numbers... God, I owe my life 
		to that deaf baby.

	Loretta enters, portable phone and drink in hand.

<b>				LORETTA
</b>		That was your mom.  She wanted you to

		Really, Loretta?

</b>		Loretta, never have kids.

	Loretta pulls a bag out of a closet and hands it to 
	Amber.

		I'm not sayin' I'm the best, or that 
		I'd even win, but shouldn't I at least

<b>				AMBER
</b>		Please, Mrs. K, I got so much Vaseline 
		on my teeth, I'm gonna be smilin' for

<b>				CHLORIS
</b>		No.  Here.

	Chloris pulls a simple BLACK LEOTARD from the bag.

				CHLORIS (cont'd)
		It's nothin' special, but talent like 
		yours doesn't need to hide behind 
		sequins.

<b>				AMBER
</b>		Mrs. K--

</b>		You're... you're special and... Ah

	Michelle Johanson is on stage, sitting on a stool, 
	wearing all black.  She smiles warmly.  Then, with one 
	sweep of her hand across her face, her smile drops.  
	She's dead serious.

<b>				MICHELLE
</b>			(without emotion)
		Fade in...Earth.  The year is two-

	She sweeps her hand back across her face and she's "in

	Amber, now in the leotard, talks to Iris.  Michelle

		Mrs. Clark, why are you doing this to

<b>				IRIS
</b>		Amber, I'm sorry.  I really am.  But 
		you know the rules.  All talent 
		costumes hafta be okay'd by Gladys 
		before the pageant.

<b>				AMBER
</b>		But, doesn't someone taking your 
		costume so you can't compete, overrule 
		that rule?

<b>				IRIS
</b>		Sorry.  I-I don't make the rules.

<b>				AMBER
</b>		This, this... This is bullshit!

</b>		Amber Atkins!  That is not American

</b>		Good, kcause this isn't an American

		Huh?

<b>				AMBER
</b>		I-I'm wearin' this costume.  I'm, uh, 
		I'm gonna do my talent tonight.

<b>				GLADYS
</b>		Oh really - I don't think so.
			(suddenly aware of camera)
		Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of 
		bad news, but rules state that a 
		costume must be okay'd at least a week 
		in advance.  And this...
			(pointing to costume)
		This is why we have the rule.  My 
		goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a 
		neckline this low on stage.  We have 
		kids in the audience.

<b>				AMBER
</b>		But, you - I mean... It's not my 
		fault.  I-I... Please?  I didn't do 
		anything wrong...

	Amber starts to cry.

<b>				MICHELLE
</b>			(climaxing)
		That's why... I must say...
			(raising arm upward)
		Soylent Green... is... people.

	She doubles over.  She's given it all.  APPLAUSE.

<b>				GLADYS
</b>		Oops, that's my cue.

	Gladys starts out on stage as Molly Howard, dressed like 
	a red, white and blue cowboy, runs up next to Amber.  
	She's twirling toy guns on her fingers.

<b>				MOLLY
</b>		Wish me luck.

		Good luck, Molly.

	One of Molly's guns flies off her finger.  She goes to 
	retrieve it.

		Oh, Amber...

	Getting an idea, Lisa starts to take off her jacket.

				LISA (cont'd)
		Amber?  Here.

<b>				AMBER
</b>			(still sobbing)
		"Here," wh-wh-what?

<b>				LISA
</b>		My jacket.  Take it kcause, y'know, I 
		got my costume okay'd before the

<b>				MICHELLE
</b>		Oh man, Lisa, I wouldn't do this.

<b>				LESLIE
</b>			(to Lisa)
		They're never gonna let you perform 
		naked.  I asked.

<b>				LISA
</b>		Shut up, yous guys.  Look, Amber, I'm 
		not gonna win.  And let's be honest, a 
		family only needs one "Liza" and you 
		know Peter's got much better legs than 
		me.

<b>				AMBER
</b>		Your parents'd kill you.

<b>				LISA
</b>		Oh c'mon, I love kem, but you know 
		they only had me kcause Peter needed a 
		kidney.

<b>				AMBER
</b>		Lis, I want to, I really do, but... 
		Oh, I can't.

<b>				LISA
</b>		Then do it for Peter.  Mrs. Leeman 
		used to call him a "skinny little fag" 
		when he'd bag her groceries.  He'd pop 
		his Nancy-belt if his old jacket 
		somehow, I don't know, got her back.

<b>				AMBER
</b>		Yah?

		I introduce contestant number six, who 
		also happens to be president of her 
		class - two years running - a member 
		of the honor roll and the new 
		President of the Lutheran Sisterhood 
		Gun Club - Rebecca Ann Leeman!

	STAGE GOES BLACK.  SPOT HITS BECKY, who sits at the edge 
	of the stage, holding a mic.  She's head to toe sequins 
	in her poodle skirt, sweater, saddle shoes, etc. 

<b>				BECKY
</b>			(talking over music)
		I don't know how many of you know 
		this, but I've got a very special 
		fella in my life - that's right, I 
		do... And if nobody minds, I'd like to 
		sing a little song, just for him.

	SPOT FOLLOWS as Becky stands and walks center stage to 
	what appears to be a COVERED MANNEQUIN.  TAPED INTRO TO 
	"I Can't Take My Eyes Off You."

				BECKY (cont'd)
		You're just too good to be true.  
		Can't take my eyes off of you.  You'd 
		be like Heaven to touch.  I wanna hold 
		you so much.  At long last love has 
		arrived and I thank God I'm alive.  

	Becky removes the sheet, revealing a MANNEQUIN dressed 
	like JESUS as he appeared on the cross: long hair, beard, 
	crown of thorns, loincloth.  The ARMS ARE STUFFED so they 
	move freely.  (Hands of stigmata.)

				BECKY (cont'd)
		You're just to good to be true.  Can't 
		take my eyes off of you...

	Becky TALK-SINGS - a la William Shatner's "Rocket Man" - 
	and DANCES around the Jesus mannequin doing the jitter-
	bug, the twist and a slow dance (his arms on her 
	shoulders).

		y'know, was okay'd a month ago?  I'm

	Amber breaks a smile.

	Taped music ENDS.  APPLAUSE.  Gladys, mic in hand, joins 
	Becky for a big hug.

<b>				GLADYS
</b>		Boy, I'd hate to follow that.  Wow!

	Becky exits, pulling the wheeled Jesus behind her.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		Voice of an angel, that one.

	Iris runs self-consciously out on stage, whispers in 
	Gladys' ear, then runs back off stage.

		...Uh, I was just told that contestant 
		number seven, Lisa Swenson, has quite

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		Well, these things happen.  At any 
		rate, we still have one more 
		contestant - number eight, Amber 
		Atkins.

	Gladys exits.  A taped hip, hot DRUM BEAT starts.  
	Suddenly, Amber glides into CENTER SPOT.  (Now wearing 
	Lisa's costume, sleeves rolled up.)  Her feet burst into 
	an amazing routine.  The loud drum beats seem to fly from 
	her hands and feet as they punctuate the rhythm.  There's 
	no glitz, just unbelievable skill.  It appears effortless 
	as she floats around stage.  Like watching Michael 
	Jackson moon walk for the first time, you can't take your 
	eyes off her.  She concludes, center stage, with the 
	GREATEST THIRTY SECONDS OF HER LIFE.  The audience goes 
	WILD!  Amber takes bow after bow - they love her.  Gladys 
	enters quickly, mic in hand.

				GLADYS (cont'd)
		Okay, okay, okay!  Well, now, it's 
		finally time to say good-bye to our 
		judges, so they can go make the 
		toughest decision of their lives.

<b>				PASTOR
</b>		That's why, dear Lord, it's with such 
		great sorrow that we turn over to you

	as he exits.  She approaches Amber with a packet.

<b>				AMBER (V.O.)
</b>		I never liked her, but she didn't

		This came for you, sweetie.

	Colleen and Terry smoke and drink at a tall tiki table 
	that's covered with empties.  In the b.g., a pageant 
	worker passes out PINK BAGS to the contestants.  All the 
	while, TWO FAT KIDS play "Marco Polo" in the pool.

<b>				COLLEEN
</b>			(tipsy, holding up glass)
		I can sum up our entire philosophy

	Amber, now looking like a Midwestern news anchor, sits 
	with a BLOND MALE ANCHOR.  A LOGO in B.G. reads: TV WAZB 
<b>	TWIN CITIES.  
</b>
<b>				BLONDE NEWS ANCHOR
</b>		I'm Peter Aitchison.

<b>				AMBER
</b>		And I'm Amber Atkins for WAZB News.

	SUPER: ...was given her job.

				AMBER (cont'd)
