Ben Carson is an ex-police detective in New York whose alcoholism made him incompetent on the job and caused him to kill a man.
Now he's trying to get his life in order.
He's living with his kid sister to save money.
He's taking medication to wean himself off the booze.
Most important, he's trying to win back the trust of his estranged wife, a medical examiner, and maintain a loving relationship with his two young children.
To make money while waiting for reinstatement, he takes a job as a night watchman at a department store gutted by fire.
That was a mistake.
He is soon tormented by the same supernatural mirrors that plagued his predecessor.
The images in these mirrors do not reflect reality as we know it.
The images will stare back at you, but remain in the mirror when you walk away.
The images will even try to kill you.
Soon, Ben Carson finds that the mirrors' demons follow him everywhere in every reflective surface.
They're willing to harass him and his family until they get what they want.
Ben's job is to find out exactly what that is.
