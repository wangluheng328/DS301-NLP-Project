Mary Wells and her friends, Elaine, Helen and Marcia, are forced out of town by the reform element, and start for California.
Along the way they meet Clay Phillips and his kid brother Steve, and Mary asks for their help.
Clay grudgingly agrees to take them as far as the Wyatt ranch as he has troubles of his own.
He and STeve are driving a herd of blooded horses to his California ranch, and trying to avoid an escaped convict, Ledvon, who has sworn to kill Clay on sight.
Marcia's boy-fiend arrives and Marcia leaves with him to get married.
At the Wyatt Ranch, Elaine finds and remains with her parents.
Mary and Helen persuade Clay to take them to California and Mary, finding that Steve has never learned to read, teaches him along the way.
The party reaches the camp of a young prospector, Fowler, and Helen decides to stay and marry him.
Shortly afterward, Lednov and his two escaped-henchmen arrive and learn that Clay is just ahead of them.
The trio brutally murders Fowler and Helen.
Clay and MAry argue, and he flags down and takes the stagecoach to Sonora.
Steve incurs Clay's anger and he announces he's going on by himself.
Then the three outlaws ambush Clay.
