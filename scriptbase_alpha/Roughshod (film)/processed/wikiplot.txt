Three escaped convicts led by Lednov kill three cowboys in Nevada and steal their clothes.
They ride on looking for revenge against a rancher, Clay Phillips, who is warned by friend Jed Graham to get out of town.

Clay and younger brother Steve head toward Sonora, California with a herd of horses.
They come across four stranded saloon girls, Mary, Marcia, Elaine and Helen, with a broken wagon wheel.

Helen's fiance turns up to take her home.
Elaine, who is depressed and ill, flees.
Steve saves her and they end up at the Wyatt ranch, where it turns out Elaine is a long-missing daughter.
Back on the trail, Helen decides to stay with an Irishman named Fowler who has struck gold.

An argument later leads Mary to steal a wagon, which she crashes into a creek.
Lednov, in pursuit, roughs up Helen and kills Fowler to make her reveal where the Phillips brothers have gone.
A gunfight ensues, in which Clay and Steve are victorious, whereupon Mary returns to Clay's arms.
