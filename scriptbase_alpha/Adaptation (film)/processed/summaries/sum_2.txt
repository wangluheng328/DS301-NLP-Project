An account of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman's attempt to adapt Susan Orlean's non-fiction book The Orchid Thief, which is the story of John Laroche, a plant dealer who clones rare orchids then sells them to collectors.
We see the action of the book as we see Kaufman struggle to adapt it into a movie.
This is presumably a somewhat true story, as Charlie Kaufman is the real life screenwriter of Adaptation.
