               FADE IN: EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

               MOVING SHOT CLOSE

               On a motorcycle coming fast -- straight for the camera. The 
               rider -- wearing a black leather jacket -- is low over the 
               machine, part of it, his face hidden behind large goggles.

               He roars in close, the cycle and the noise filling the screen 
               for an instant, then overtakes the camera. Now we see twenty-
               five or thirty more cyclists following the first. They are 
               all identically dressed -- leather jackets and goggles -- 
               giving them the look of an anonymous, faceless, and 
               frightening horde. They roar toward us, cutting recklessly 
               in and out of traffic on the busy highway, singly or in groups 
               of three or four. They overtake cars and each other, at great 
               speed, gathering finally into a speeding, roaring mass. Over 
               them, SUPERIMPOSED, appears the following title:

               This is a story of shocking violence. It couldn't have 
               happened in most American towns, but the fact that it happened 
               in this one -- in this way -- is a stern warning that it 
               must not happen again.

               AS THIS TITLE FADES:

               MOVING SHOT LOW ANGLE VERY CLOSE (PROCESS)

               A motorcycle racing down the highway at great speed. The 
               explosive roar of the motor segues into the opening music; 
               SUPERIMPOSED over this FAST MOVING SHOT, appears the MAIN 
               TITLE:

               SERIES OF SHOTS UNDER CREDITS

               The cyclists, as they continue racing down the highway. When 
               the road is clear of traffic for a moment, they move into 
               tight formation. Then, suddenly, they break into small groups 
               again to thread through traffic.

               Just as suddenly, they re-group again -- a solid, roaring 
               mass.

               AS CREDITS FADE:

               EXT. ROAD APPROACH TO TOWN AND INTERSECTION - DAY

               LONG SHOT

               The troop of cyclists comes barrelling down the road, swerves 
               into the main street of a small town, the CAMERA PANNING as 
               they head straight for a crowded, busy intersection blocked 
               to regular traffic.

               CLOSER SHOT TOWARD INTERSECTION

               An official A.M.A. race similar to the annual Catalina event 
               is in progress. This intersection is the Control-Point and 
               Finish Line, indicated by a banner. There are additional 
               banners stretched across the street: "WELCOME AMERICAN 
               MOTORCYCLE ASSOCIATION," "4TH ANNUAL CYCLE MEET," "WELCOME 
               CYCLISTS -- SAFE WITH SAE OIL." A public address system is 
               garbling constantly somewhere in the b.g., mostly drowned 
               out by the noise of the machines. The timing officials and 
               an Announcer are on a parallel, giving them a view over the 
               heads of the crowd.

               ANOTHER ANGLE INTERSECTION

               The cyclists have headed directly into the middle of all 
               this. As they are forced to slow down by the crowd, several 
               white-uniformed officials and one or two cops step out 
               quickly, shouting at them, waving them off. The rider in the 
               lead hesitates momentarily, then veers off sharply into a 
               side-street, the CAMERA PANNING as the rest of the group 
               follows him.

               EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY

               FULL SHOT

               The newly arrived group of cyclists roars up the street -- 
               past motorcycles backed into the curb in orderly rows. Finding 
               an opening in front of a bar, the lead rider cuts in sharply, 
               the rest following.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As the cyclists park their machines quickly and start 
               dismounting we are on the backs of their leather jackets. 
               Each is lettered: "B.R.M.C.". Underneath these letters is 
               painted a skull with goggles. Crossed under the skull -- in 
               place of bones -- are piston rods. As a succession of these 
               identical insignias stop in the f.g.,

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

               PAST CROWD SHOOTING UP THE STREET

               Some of the contestants come roaring down the straightaway, 
               gearing down for the turn at the intersection. The crowd is 
               pressing forward against the ropes. Eight or ten of the 
               cyclists wearing the B.R.M.C. jackets move into the shot in 
               the f.g., start shouldering their way to the front. They 
               have taken off their goggles and helmets -- which are hanging 
               around their necks or from their belts -- but we still do 
               not see their faces. Several people in the crowd react with 
               annoyance, but the boys crowd forward anyway.

               REVERSE SHOT

               From the front as the boys crowd up, some of them drinking 
               from beer bottles. We see now that they are all fairly young -- 
               eighteen to twenty-two. Each has his name lettered on the 
               left breast of his jacket, big enough to be read in most 
               scenes. They look rough and arrogant, ignoring the spectators 
               they are displacing. Automatically, almost like a group of 
               royal retainers, the group splits in two -- making a place 
               for one of its members. This boy -- whose jacket says "JOHNNY" -- 
               moves regally into the spot thus created for him -- and 
               automatically into a fairly CLOSE SHOT.

               He is just past twenty, handsome, rugged; the chip on his 
               big shoulders is visible half a block away. Raising his bottle 
               of beer, he looks off, almost bored.

               JOHNNY'S ANGLE

               A cyclist comes into the turn too fast, spins off, unloads 
               into a bale of hay. Efficient A.M.A. officials in white suits, 
               wearing A.M.A. arm bands, step out quickly, keeping the crowd 
               back, running out to give oncoming riders the caution flag. 
               The rider and machine are untangled from the hay, the cycle 
               dragged aside. The rider gets to his feet, dazed, walks around 
               in circles. Spectators crowd around to stare. An official 
               darts into the street to wipe up some spilled oil with a 
               handful of hay.

               (NOTE: Whatever dialogue we hear at this point is merely 
               jargon, throw-away stuff -- for effect rather than sense. It 
               is obscured and punctuated by the whine of the machines coming 
               into the turn, gearing down, and the series of explosions as 
               they come out of it and dig in.)

               FEATURING JOHNNY

               He looks toward all this with a kind of irritated 
               condescension, nods, turns back into the crowd, the others 
               following. A serious woman spectator gives them a look, moves 
               into the spot just occupied by Johnny, making notations of 
               some sort on a piece of paper. Meanwhile, something like the 
               following can be understood over the P.A. system:

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         Rick Riley has developed trouble 
                         back in the hills! We'll know in a 
                         minute if it's serious. He is still 
                         two minutes, twenty seconds ahead of 
                         Art Wilson -- Two minutes thirty-two 
                         ahead of Freddie Orr. It's still 
                         anybody's race --

               The crowd edges a little closer.

               FINISH LINE

               A racer tears around the turn and off. The Chief Referee 
               steps into the street with his set of flags, unfurling the 
               yellow and checkered.

               CROWD AT FINISH LINE

               Johnny and his group re-appear, shouldering their way non-
               chalantly to the front again, through the densest part of 
               the crowd.

                                     ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                              (shouting over the 
                              noise)
                         -- When the winner gets the checkered 
                         flag -- don't cross the street yet -- 
                         please! That doesn't mean the race 
                         is over! Some of these boys will 
                         still have a lap to go --

               As another racer grinds by, a girl beside Johnny leans out 
               across the rope, yelling in a kind of crazy ecstasy:

                                     GIRL
                         Come on, Al!

               She yells something else, but it is drowned out. Johnny gives 
               her a look, a tense superior sort of smirk.

               CLOSER SHOT ON JOHNNY

               He flicks his eyes as a series of racers pass -- each with 
               the characteristic zarumpphf! zarumphf! zarumphf! The CAMERA 
               MOVES IN CLOSER as the sounds hit him, each one increasing 
               his look of tense belligerence.

               SHOT OF FINISH LINE

               As the first rider in gets the checkered flag, swerves off, 
               and is enveloped by his retinue.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               Tense, about to explode.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                              (shouting over noise)
                         Art Wilson -- Art Wilson the first 
                         man in -- Stay where you are -- don't 
                         cross the street!

               Johnny steps abruptly out of the shot, into the street. 
               Somebody yells.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Johnny has started sauntering casually across the track, his 
               group trailing loosely after him. Several angry A.M.A. 
               officials are running toward them, shouting at them, waving 
               them back and then on across. The Announcer is screaming 
               something incoherent over the P.A. System. We hear a cycle 
               grinding down into the turn.

               AN OFFICIAL

               Swearing under his breath, he grabs up a flag and darts out 
               to slow down the oncoming machine.

               SHOT FROM OFFICIAL'S PARALLEL

               It's a near-miss. The oncoming cyclist manages just in time 
               to brake, swerve around Johnny's group. He almost crosses-
               up, but recovers and makes the turn.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The last of Johnny's group to get across is a wiry little 
               toughie whose jacket says "MOUSE." He pulls himself quickly 
               up on a telephone pole and shouts, mockingly:

                                     MOUSE
                         Please! Don't cross the street! Don't 
                         get hurt! Blood makes the track 
                         slippery!

               One or two people nearby titter, not many.

               GROUP SHOT

               Johnny in the center of a little whirlpool, angry officials 
               and spectators crowding around.

                                     OFFICIAL
                              (shouting; furious)
                         What's the matter with you chowder-
                         heads? You in such a big hurry to 
                         die?

                                     GRINGO

                         About this man -- he says one of 
                         them little bikes would hurt --

                         Straight man --

                                     ANOTHER OFFICIAL
                         Don't words mean anything to you 
                         squirrels? Or you just looking for 
                         trouble?

               During this, more cyclists have crowded up. Most of them -- 
               in sharp contrast to Johnny's group  -- are clean and smartly 
               uniformed. Others, who have actually been racing, are in 
               full leathers.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               A couple of the racers step forward. They are serious, tired. 
               The white patches around their eyes where their goggles 
               protected them from the dust give them a weird, intense look.

                                     RACER
                         We're trying to finish a race out 
                         there.

                                     SECOND RACER
                         If you goons want to have a circus 
                         why don't you go gulley-scramble 
                         someplace. Pick yourself a spot 
                         somewhere --

               DINKY, a big, baby-fat boy, turns to one of the racers, 
               simpering.

                                     DINKY
                         Oh, you got all dirty!

               Crazy follows up, making a show of brushing off the racer.

                                     CRAZY
                         Say, how much an outfit like this 
                         cost? That real leather?
                              (to others)
                         Hey, look, speedball's got himself a 
                         suit all real genuine leather!

               The others crowd around, the racer pushing them away. One of 
               the officials starts to intervene; GRINGO grabs his arm.

                                     GRINGO
                         Hey, Dr. Kildare! You want to see a 
                         race, whyn't you let my boy Johnny 
                         here race?

               ANGLE FEATURING JOHNNY

               He is just standing there. Another batch of B.R.M.C. boys 
               appear from nowhere, crowding up, taking in the situation. 
               Belligerent, ready, anxious for any kind of trouble, they 
               eye Johnny, wait.

                         trouble you can cause --

               The B.R.M.C. boys crowd around him in mock humility.

                         First of all get yourself sober enough 
                         to get into a decent club --

                                     DINKY
                         We got a club already --

               He turns around to show off the insignia on his back; this 
               brings him face to face with a couple of the regular 
               motorcyclists who have come up.

                                     DINKY
                              (continuing)
                         Hey, you squares want to join our 
                         club? You ride around the block and 
                         don't fall off, you can join for 
                         four bits --

               ANGLE FEATURING THE OTHER CYCLISTS

               Trying to ignore the baiting, they start to turn away.

                                     CYCLIST SPECTATOR
                              (to official in passing)
                         They don't want to race. They just 
                         want to screw things up. None of 
                         these outlaw outfits wants to do 
                         anything but foul things up for 
                         everybody --

               Another of Johnny's boys, RED, catches the regular cyclist 
               by the arm.

                                     RED
                         Hey, what kind of outfits? Say that 
                         again --

                                     CYCLIST SPECTATOR
                              (not intimidated)
                         Outlaw outfits -- like yours --

                                     RED
                              (grinning unexpectedly)
                         That's what I thought you said. Okay, 
                         Square -- Right now. You want to 
                         drag Johnny a hundred yards for beers? 
                         Or you chicken?

               The man gives him a look, ignoring him, turns away.

                                     DINKY
                         Aw, the Square's chicken. They're 
                         all chicken --
                              (turning to official)
                         You want to see something, you want 
                         to see Johnny go. He really goes. He 
                         really screws it on. Arraaaaah!

               He makes the noise of screwing it on, banks away, his elbow 
               cocked on an imaginary turn. Another of the boys, DEXTRO, 
               approaches the official, continuing the needling.

                                     DEXTRO
                         Hey, what do you get when you win 
                         one of these scrambles? Five thousand 
                         dollars? Hey, I'd like to win me 
                         five thousand dollars!

               Red cuffs him roughly.

                                     RED
                         Aw, you dummy! You win, they give 
                         you a beautiful gold statchoo! Solid 
                         gold! Solid gold dipped!

                                     DEXTRO
                              (straight man; 
                              impressed)
                         Yeh? Hey, what about that!
                              (reacting)
                         What do you do with it?

                                     RED
                         You show it to your mother! Then you 
                         throw it away! It isn't good for 
                         nothing!

               A couple of the boys giggle.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As the officials, fed up, are about to turn away. Mouse 
               follows, fawning one of them, fingering the material of his 
               white suit.

                                     MOUSE
                         Hey, wait a minute -- where can I 
                         get me one of these suits? I want to 
                         look like a street cleaner too --

               The official flares, pulls his arm a way, gives Mouse a slight 
               push. Johnny comes suddenly to life, reaches the official in 
               one swift move.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Who are you? What do you do here? 
                         You a cop or something?

               TWO SHOT

               A beat. Then, as the official turns, disgusted, to step past 
               Johnny, he touches his shoulder. Johnny whirls with sudden 
               violence, grabs him.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Don't push anybody.

               At the same moment, he hunches his shoulder, starting a blow. 
               It never lands. A big arm is flung across Johnny's chest, 
               blocking it. Furious, he snaps his head.

               WIDER ANGLE

               The arm belongs to a big, business-like cop.

                                     COP
                         Okay. Break it up --

               Johnny stares at him with insolent bravado. One or two other 
               cops move up in the b.g., ready.

                                     COP
                              (continuing)
                         We got enough entertainment here. Go 
                         on -- make yourselves scarce --

                                     MOUSE
                         We want to watch the thrilling race, 
                         Daddy --

                                     COP
                              (harder)
                         One more cute remark and I'll run 
                         the bunch of you in, right now. Let's 
                         go. Get out of here.

               The boys smirk, but nobody says anything. Johnny breaks it 
               suddenly, nods off. The whole group swaggers off, knocking 
               its way through the crowd that falls back, a little 
               disappointed.

               OFFICIALS AND COPS

               The cops eye the departing group.

                                     COP
                              (to official)
                         Where that bunch from?

                                     OFFICIAL
                              (shrugging wearily)
                         I don't know. Everywhere. I don't 
                         think they even know where they're 
                         going... Termites... Nutty. Ten guys 
                         like that give people the idea 
                         everybody rides a sickle is crazy... 
                         What are they trying to prove, anyway?

                                     COP
                         Beats me.
                              (rather sadly)
                         They're usually looking for somebody 
                         to push them around so they can get 
                         sore and show how tough they are... 
                         And they usually find it, someplace, 
                         sooner or later...

               He stands there a moment longer than the officials, 
               thoughtful. Then he moves off slowly toward his cycle.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK AND SHOPS - AFTERNOON

               LONG SHOT

               The augmented B.R.M.C. group comes parading toward the camera, 
               stretched out along the sidewalk in a long straggling line, 
               Johnny himself somewhere in the rear. The boys in front force 
               other people on the sidewalk to give way, pause in the f.g., 
               looking into a shop window.

                                     DINKY
                         Hey, look at all the gold --

               ANOTHER ANGLE PAST BOYS

               to show an array of motorcycle trophies in the window of a 
               combination printing and stationery shop. There are cups and 
               trophies of various kinds, some of them quite large, with 
               figures of motorcycle racers, etc.

                                     GRINGO
                         Let's get us some gold --

               He heads abruptly into the shop. As the others crowd in after 
               him:

                                     OTHERS
                         Let's get Johnny some gold -- Look 
                         at that -- Well, la-de-stinkin-dah!

               Johnny comes sauntering into the scene, glances after them 
               casually, drifts on a bit past the door with his group.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               A sexy-looking girl is approaching.

                                     MOUSE
                              (to girl, loudly)
                         Hi, Red --

               THE BOYS

                                     MOUSE
                              (turning away as girl 
                              passes the group)
                         -- in the papers the other day, that 
                         the world is coming to an end, 
                         sometime --

               This is very funny. They all laugh except Johnny, who follows 
               the girl sullenly with his eyes, the boys jostling her as 
               she crowds through, embarrassed.

               ANOTHER ANGLE ON STREET

               Another group of boys including PIGEON, Dextro and Gringo, 
               merges into Johnny's contingent, the whole group flowing 
               along the sidewalk. Pigeon moves close to Johnny, hands him 
               one of the trophies we've seen in the shop window.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               As he hands it to Johnny. It's about ten inches high, the 
               figure of a motorcyclist on a pedestal.

                                     CRAZY
                         Hey, look at that --

                                     OTHERS
                         Look at the gold -- Look what Johnny 
                         won!

                                     JOHNNY
                         How did you get this?

                                     PIGEON
                         I bought it -- for a buck!

               This is greeted with a loud hurrah.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Red looking at the trophy over Johnny's shoulder.

                                     RED
                              (reading the 
                              inscription; reacting)
                         Hey, what's the matter with you? 
                         Second place! Johnny won second place!

               He raises his arm as if to strike Pigeon.

                                     PIGEON
                              (pulling back)
                         First place was two feet high --

               Johnny slips it under his leather jacket, holds it against 
               his body with his arm. The CAMERA HOLDS AND PANS as the group 
               continues on, the boys in the lead turning into the side 
               street where they left their cycles.

               EXT. SIDE STREET - AFTERNOON

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny and his immediate group follow, rounding the corner. 
               Just beyond, lined up at the curb outside the cheap bar, are 
               their cycles -- big, beat-up Harleys and Indians. The 
               remaining members of the club are here, tinkering with their 
               machines, sleeping on them, fiddling with bed-rolls, etc. In 
               the b.g. two boys are entertaining themselves with a rough 
               slugging match.

                                     CRAZY
                         Hey, Johnny, where we going to go?

                                     DINKY
                         Let's get out of here, go someplace 
                         have us a ball, really cut up a hog --

                                     BOXER
                         Hey, Johnny -- these squares got 
                         themselves a big dance here tonight. 
                         We can really clobber that up --

               Johnny gives him a patronizing look, continues toward his 
               cycle.

               CLOSER SHOT ON SLUGGING MATCH

               This is at the far end of the line of cycles belonging to 
               the B.R.M.C. Beyond are the cycles of an orthodox club. One 
               of the fighters stumbles off the curb, crashes against a 
               clean English machine, knocks it over, knocks over the owner -- 
               who with his girl companion was polishing it. He gets up, 
               mad. Everybody else laughs.

                                     OWNER
                         Hey, take it easy --

               The two boys who were slugging, the other B.R.M.C. boys crowd 
               around. One of them pushes the boy who knocked the machine 
               over.

                                     RED
                         What's the matter with you? You want 
                         to scratch all up Junior's bicycle?

               With mock concern, they gather around, helping right the 
               fallen machine.

                                     GO-GO
                         Polish it up for Junior --

               He pours beer on the fender, starts rubbing it with an oily 
               rag. The owner pushes him aside.

                                     OWNER
                         Hey --

               Somebody pushes back; very quickly it has all the makings of 
               a real brawl.

                                     GIRL COMPANION
                         No, Jack -- Please!

               JOHNNY

               He straightens up from his machine, starts toward the 
               disturbance.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Almost simultaneously, three or four cops wheel in sharply 
               on big Harleys, dismount. The big one in the lead is the 
               same cop we saw earlier. He steps into the middle of the 
               fight.

                                     COP
                         Okay -- that does it ---

               The brawl stops. The cop looks up and sees Johnny standing 
               there, gives him a sour look.

                                     STINGER
                         Come on, Johnny, let's get out of 
                         here, go some place. Every place you 
                         look is cops --

               Eyeing the cop, Johnny says nothing. Go-Go saunters up to 
               the cop, looks over his impressive, chromium-plated Harley.

                                     GO-GO
                         Where do I put the nickel in? I want 
                         to hear music. Show me where to put 
                         the nickel in.

                                     COP
                              (jerking his thumb)
                         We'll put you on your way, so you 
                         don't get lost in any bars. If I 
                         find any of you back here tonight, 
                         I'll take your sickles away for a 
                         month.

               He remounts. The other three cops remount, wait.

                                     COP
                              (continuing)
                         Let's go.

               The other boys wait to see what Johnny is going to do. For 
               the moment he just stands there. The cop crosses his arms to 
               indicate he can wait all day. Then, suddenly, Johnny moves 
               to his cycle, gets on, still holding the trophy under his 
               coat, revs up his machine. The others in the group quickly 
               follow suit. The cop wheels back to give them room. The whole 
               line of cycles is now revved up, making a terrific din.

               ANGLE FEATURING JOHNNY

               He throws his cycle in gear, digs in, roars out from curb in 
               a reckless crazy burst of speed. The others follow.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON (SERIES OF SHOTS)

               THE GROUP

               barrelling along at a crazy speed, passing cars, cutting in -- 
               all wearing their helmets and goggles again.

               JOHNNY (PROCESS)

               As he rides, identifiable only by the gold trophy, which has 
               now been wired to his front fender.

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT

               The group comes roaring down the highway, Johnny in the lead. 
               The CAMERA PANS as he swerves off onto a side-road. The pack 
               swerves off behind him.

               EXT. HIGHWAY APPROACH TO TOWN - (MATTE) - AFTERNOON

               LONG SHOT

               The road winds off through the hills toward a small town in 
               the distance. The troop tears by and is lost from sight 
               somewhere in the hills beyond, the sound dying out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET

               FULL SHOT

               A mongrel dog ambles across in the f.g. In the b.g. one or 
               two people stroll through. In this brief pause we get a 
               feeling of quiet, peace, and dignity. Then we hear the cycles 
               again -- a faint hum at first, growing quickly louder, until 
               the troop of thirty riders pours into the street with a 
               deafening roar.

               SERIES OF REACTION SHOTS

               Various local citizens pause in whatever they are doing, 
               stop on the sidewalk, or step out of shops and stores, staring 
               blankly at this sudden, noisy phenomenon.

               FULL SHOT STREET

               SHOOTING PAST a large sign in the f.g. It reads: "BLEEKER'S - 
               BAR - CAFE." As the cycles bear down on the camera, it PANS 
               with them TOWARD a garage and filling station across the 
               street and beyond Bleeker's.

               INT. BLEEKER'S CAFE

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WAITRESS

               She is a pretty girl, but not too pretty, about eighteen. 
               She has paused just now, about to place two cups of coffee 
               on the counter. This is KATHIE.

               WIDER ANGLE

               including the two men about to receive the coffee. One is 
               HARRY; he is in his shirtsleeves, but beside him on the 
               counter is a cap with a police badge. The other is BEN, who 
               is in work clothes -- the garage man. Looking off through 
               the windows toward the swarm of cyclists descending on his 
               place, Ben is already getting up.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As another man moves into the shot, looking off over Kathie's 
               shoulder. This is BLEEKER, Harry's brother; they look 
               something alike, but Bleeker is a year or two older, more 
               affable, relaxed.

                                     BLEEKER
                              (smiling)
                         Business before pleasure, Ben --

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Ben is already on the way out. Bleeker picks up several clean 
               glasses and starts off, toward a large archway through which 
               we see into the bar.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Tell Jimmy we need some glasses in 
                         the bar, Kathie.

               The CAMERA HOLDS ON Kathie, who has nodded vaguely. She is 
               looking off toward the street.

               EXT. BEN'S GARAGE AND FILLING STATION

               CYCLISTS

               Milling around, yakking, scuffling, revving their motors, as 
               Ben arrives and starts giving some of them gas.

                                     GRINGO
                         Hey, let's get hot. Let's go someplace --

                                     PIGEON
                         What time is it?

               Nobody answers him. Nobody cares.

                                     DINKY
                              (looking around)
                         What's this joint? What war's this 
                         joint left over from?

               ANGLE PAST JOHNNY

               He is sitting his machine, nervously twisting the grips. In 
               the b.g. is Bleeker's, with its prominent sign advertising 
               beer.

                                     MOUSE
                              (coming up)
                         Hey, Johnny, where we going?

                                     STINGER
                         Let's get gassed --

                                     DEXTRO
                              (looking off to 
                              Bleeker's)
                         Hey, drag for beers! Who wants drag 
                         for beers? Last guy in the door that 
                         joint buys beers!

               As Ben passes, Dextro grabs the rag he uses for cleaning 
               windshields out of his hip pocket.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Very quickly, fifteen or so riders respond to Dextro's 
               suggestion, swing around abreast. Johnny ignores the whole 
               thing.

                                     DEXTRO
                              (shouting)
                         Last guy in the door buys!

               The motors roar and pop. Dextro is about to drop the flag. 
               Red grabs his arm, shouts:

                                     RED
                         Hold it!

               A car comes down the street. Dextro is poised, waiting. The 
               few people on the street stand aside, watching with interest.

               INT. BLEEKER'S CAFE

               HARRY AND KATHIE

               Harry has turned in his seat, reacting.

               EXT. STREET

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT TOWARD GARAGE

               Dextro flashes the rag. The fifteen or so machines leap out 
               suddenly, coming straight for Bleeker's.

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT

               An old car appears suddenly from the other direction, heading 
               straight for the cyclists.

               INT. CAFE

               FLASH OF KATHIE

               Reacting, frozen.

               EXT. STREET

               LONG SHOT

               The driver of the old car loses control, skids around. In an 
               attempt to avoid a collision, the cyclists swerve away, piling 
               into each other, shooting off in all directions... There is 
               a crash as the car ends up against a light pole. One cyclist 
               comes bouncing up onto the sidewalk, still in the saddle, 
               just avoids crashing through the window.

               TOWARD BLEEKER'S

               Bleeker, Harry and the customers are already piling out into 
               the street.

               TOWARD HARDWARE STORE

               The window lettered "HANNEGAN & THOMAS". Thomas and Hannegan 
               themselves emerge from the store, joining the crowd hurrying 
               toward the scene of the accident.

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT OF THE CHAOS

               One front fender of the car is crumpled into the pole, but 
               it is still upright. Cyclists are trying to get out from 
               under machines or scrambling around trying to cut them off. 
               Others are just lying where they fell in the street, laughing 
               like mad. Those who were left at the garage come tearing up 
               on their cycles, everybody delighted.

               MEDIUM SHOT MAN IN CAR (ART KLEINER)

               He is smallish and fifty or so; badly-panicked, he is making 
               a frantic attempt to get out, but the door is jammed.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Bleeker and others hurrying forward.

                                     BLEEKER
                         It's Art Kleiner --
                              (shouting to cyclists)
                         Help that man out!

               They take this up, like a gay chant.

                                     CYCLISTS
                         Help the man out! Help the man out!

               Several of them yank open the car door.

                                     CYCLISTS
                              (continuing)
                         Help the man out!

               They reach in, grab the frightened KLEINER, lift him bodily 
               out from behind the wheel, and put him down on his feet.

               GENERAL CROWD SHOT

               Everybody yakking at once.

                                     DEXTRO
                         Hey, who won?

                                     GRINGO
                         Hey, you see Red unload? You seen 
                         him brodie?

                                     MOUSE
                         Lucky he hit on his head -- went 
                         right over the risers --

                                     DINKY
                              (holding an exhaust 
                              pipe aloft)
                         Who lost a funnel?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Bleeker and Harry have by now reached Kleiner, who is 
               apparently unhurt but still a little rattled.

                                     BLEEKER
                         You okay, Art?

               Art nods vaguely. Harry turns to the boys who lifted him 
               out.

                                     HARRY
                         What you guys think this is --? What 
                         are you trying to do?

                                     RED
                              (with gestures)
                         Just dragging for beers -- zarum! 
                         and this guy vreey! Karooey!

               Art is prevented from answering by MR. WILSON, the local 
               druggist, who appears quickly from behind the car.

                                     WILSON
                         There's a boy hurt here --

               Bleeker and Harry turn, abandoning Art.

               ANGLE DOWN

               One of the cyclists, Crazy, is lying on the ground, his head 
               on his twisted cycle. He looks calm and comfortable. Ben 
               works Crazy's heavy boot off and rises just as the men step 
               in.

                                     BEN
                         Ankle's broken --

                                     GRINGO
                              (crowding in)
                         Hey, Crazy, you can't sleep in the 
                         street --

                                     GO-GO
                              (also crowding in, 
                              seeing the twisted 
                              bike)
                         Boy, look at that sickle -- you really 
                         stacked up that sickle --

                                     WILSON
                              (to Ben)
                         I'll call Dr. Zeigler. Get your pickup 
                         and we'll take him over --

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Ben and Wilson move off in opposite directions. Art grabs 
               Harry's arm and pulls him aside, toward his car.

                                     ART
                              (excited)
                         Harry, you seen how it happened. 
                         These motorcycles coming straight at 
                         me -- I swung the wheel hard as I 
                         could -- look at that --

               Hannegan, Thomas, and a few other men move up.

                                     HANNEGAN
                         What about this, Harry?

                                     HARRY
                              (mildly)
                         It was an accident. I saw it. Art 
                         got excited --

                                     ART
                              (bristling)
                         Aren't you going to arrest them?

                                     HARRY
                         No. I'm not going to arrest anybody. 
                         Take it easy, Art --

               Before Art has a chance to reply, Johnny crowds up to Harry, 
               giving with the real tough act, the big bluff.

                                     JOHNNY
                         What's the beef?

               Harry looks at Johnny, taken aback. Johnny goes on quickly, 
               not giving Harry an opening.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (continuing)
                         Okay, you're the big copy here or 
                         something --
                              (indicating Art)
                         Tell him look where he's going next 
                         time. He don't know how to drive. 
                         Turn one way or the other. Guys all 
                         over the street trying miss him. 
                         He's okay. Got a guy all busted up.

               Harry just looks at him, unprepared for this attack. Art 
               starts to protest.

                                     HARRY
                              (quietly)
                         Forget it, Art. Forget it.

               Johnny turns away, just as abruptly, followed by his group.

               JOHNNY AND GROUP

               As they move away, the boys smirk, pleased, proud of Johnny's 
               act.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Some cop, hey? You hear Johnny back 
                         him down? Real screwball joint here --

               Johnny smiles ever so slightly.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Kathie emerges quickly from the crowd, her head down as if 
               affected by what she has seen. As she steps up onto the 
               sidewalk, heading for the cafe, JIMMY appears around the 
               corner of the building. Jimmy is at least sixty-five, no 
               taller than Kathie, pushed down rather than stooped; his 
               expression is vague and constantly abstracted, a little 
               foolish. He is wearing a cook's apron and is carrying a pair 
               of pruning shears. His voice is a little high, but 
               unexpectedly vigorous.

                                     JIMMY
                         What's all that, Kathie? What's all 
                         that?
                              (mildly)
                         Somebody killed?

               Kathie pauses an instant, gentle and indulgent with the old 
               man.

                                     KATHIE
                         Some boys on motorcycles ran into 
                         Art Kleiner's car --

                                     JIMMY
                         Art Kleiner? Art Kleiner's too old 
                         to be driving an automobile. Where 
                         was he going, anyway? Everybody always 
                         going someplace. Crazy, excited. 
                         Always taking a lot of vitamin pills -- 
                         drinking --

                                     KATHIE
                              (remembering)
                         Oh. Uncle Frank wants some glasses 
                         in the bar, Jimmy.

               She starts on. Jimmy gives no evidence of having heard, 
               stubbornly continues his original thought:

                                     JIMMY
                         Over-stimulated. Jumping around --
                              (in general)
                         Ought to arrest the lot of them. 
                         Call the militia.

               He turns firmly, disappears around the corner of the building.

               LOW ANGLE JOHNNY AT CURB

               Johnny is squatting down, fiddling with the trophy on his 
               front fender. Kathie's figure moves through the f.g. An 
               instant later, Johnny looks up sharply, following her toward 
               the door of the cafe with his eyes, intent, an aroused animal.

               INT. CAFE

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Kathie steps behind the counter, busies herself automatically 
               with the coffee apparatus. A moment later the door opens and 
               Johnny comes in, standing there, dangling the trophy 
               carelessly at his side. Then he starts across -- a slow, 
               swaggering, self-conscious saunter.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As he sits, deliberately, near Kathie, places the trophy 
               down in front of him. Kathie hesitates, somehow disturbed by 
               him.

                                     KATHIE
                              (finally)
                         Do you want something?

               There is a beat -- as usual with Johnny -- before he answers. 
               He scowls. Talking is painful for him.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Sure...
                              (what else could he 
                              want?)
                         Beer.

                                     KATHIE
                         Beer's just in the bar.

               She nods toward the bar. A flash of violent anger crosses 
               Johnny's face, but he seems to control it with great effort, 
               turns his head to look toward the bar, then back. He rises, 
               starts for the bar, taking the trophy along. Kathie hesitates 
               a moment before following him.

               INT. BAR

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The bar is empty and unattended, of course. Johnny steps up, 
               throws down some coins, places the trophy in front of him. 
               Kathie comes around behind the bar, bringing up a bottle of 
               beer, opening it for him, meeting his eyes for an instant, 
               then turning away to return to the cafe. Johnny picks up the 
               bottle and glass in one hand, the trophy in another, turns 
               to follow her, the CAMERA PANNING.

               INT. CAFE

               PAST COUNTER

               As Kathie comes around behind the counter again. In the street 
               beyond, cyclists and others are grouped around Harry and 
               Bleeker, apparently arguing. Other cyclists have started 
               racing off senselessly in all directions, or burning circles. 
               Another small group is starting for the cafe. Johnny, having 
               followed Kathie back, sits again, re-establishing the trophy 
               in front of him, looks around.

                                     JOHNNY
                         What do you sell here?

               Kathie is disturbed, looks a little faint.

                                     KATHIE
                         Coffee, milk, sandwiches... I got a 
                         little sick for a minute --

                                     JOHNNY
                         Why?

                                     KATHIE
                         That boy -- his ankle -- I saw the 
                         bone sticking out...

                                     JOHNNY
                         Yeh?

               He just looks at her, carefully, as if trying to understand 
               why this would upset her.

               KATHIE AND JOHNNY

               There is a pause; she looks away from him to the trophy.

                                     JOHNNY
                         You live here all the time?

               She nods, smiles a little wryly.

                                     KATHIE
                         All my life.

               He thinks about that, glances around, frowns, wondering what 
               to say next.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (finally)
                         We were over at Harrison.

               She nods.

                                     KATHIE
                         A bunch of motorcycles went through 
                         that way yesterday. They didn't stop.
                              (continuing; focusing 
                              on trophy again)
                         Is that what they give you -- in 
                         those races -- for killing yourself?

               Johnny reacts sharply. His face works a moment, then:

                                     JOHNNY
                              (abruptly)
                         You want it?

               Kathie is startled.

                                     KATHIE
                         What?

                                     JOHNNY
                         You want it, I give it you.

               She is pleased, but confused, picks it up and looks at it 
               more closely, puts it down again.

                                     KATHIE
                         Well, no... you can't do that. You 
                         won it... You have to get your name 
                         engraved on it -- or whatever you 
                         do...
                              (flustered)
                         It's important to you. You wouldn't 
                         give something like that away, just 
                         like that... unless you knew a girl 
                         real well... and liked her...

               He reaches for the trophy suddenly, puts it down beside his 
               beer.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Pigeon, Dextro, and Dinky have entered the cafe. They bust 
               up to Johnny.

                                     PIGEON
                         Hey, Johnny, about this town -- they 
                         got a doctor here --

                                     DEXTRO
                              (running it all 
                              together)
                         They going to do a cement job on 
                         Crazy -- We going to sit around 
                         scratch ourselves? Hey, let's get a 
                         scramble going here! Blow those 
                         squares -- have a scramble for 
                         ourselves!

               Johnny isn't listening.

                                     PIGEON
                         We going to wait for Crazy -- or we 
                         going to get with it?

               Johnny takes his time, pours himself some beer, glances at 
               Kathie.

                                     JOHNNY
                         We're going to wait for Crazy.

               Pigeon looks shrewdly from Johnny to Kathie.

                                     PIGEON
                              (to Kathie)
                         Hey, you know who this man is? He's 
                         a big important motorsickle racer.
                              (pointing to trophy)
                         See that? Wins big important races 
                         all the time. Wins five thousand 
                         dollars sometimes. Where you get 
                         that brew?

                                     KATHIE
                         Beer's just in the bar --

               She starts for the bar. Pigeon and Dextro follow her.

                                     DINKY
                              (turning back to Johnny)
                         We really got them going. Everybody 
                         out there kicking it around. The cop -- 
                         he don't know what to do. Another 
                         guy -- he smells a buck.

               He grins, goes on. Johnny glances toward the street.

               EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

               MEDIUM SHOT

               A number of cyclists and local characters combine to push 
               Art Kleiner's car back away from the light pole against which 
               it stopped. Harry, Bleeker, Hannegan, Thomas, cyclists and 
               others crowd up.

                                     KLEINER
                         Harry, look at that fender. It's 
                         rubbing on the tire --

               Red grabs the fender, braces a foot against the wheel, and 
               pulls. The fender crunches up.

                                     RED
                              (smoothing out old 
                              fender with hand)
                         Okay. How's that? Now it's not rubbing 
                         on the tire no more. Just as good as 
                         the others --

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Pigeon and Dextro come elbowing their way back into the group, 
               each drinking from a bottle of beer he has gotten in the 
               bar.

                                     PIGEON
                              (to Gringo)
                         Hey, Johnny says we stick around for 
                         Crazy, they fix him up --

                                     GRINGO
                         What do we do here?

                                     DEXTRO
                         Hey, I talked to Johnny -- we're 
                         going to scramble.

                                     GO-GO
                              (to Dextro)
                         Where's the brew?

               Dextro indicates the bar in the b.g.; Go-Go and several others 
               troupe off in that direction. Bleeker follows them with his 
               eyes. Red, Pigeon, and Stinger glance at each other, step 
               toward him -- an act.

                                     RED
                         Where do we eat?

                                     BLEEKER
                         We can take care of you, all right.

                                     PIGEON
                         You got some steaks? You got some 
                         Kansas City steaks?

                                     BLEEKER
                         We serve good meat.

                                     STINGER
                              (to Hannegan)
                         Where's the motels?

                                     HANNEGAN
                         There's the Valley Hotel, just off 
                         the main street --

                                     STINGER
                         Hey, they got a real hotel here.

                                     KLEINER
                              (pressing Harry)
                         Aren't you going to do anything about 
                         this?

                                     BLEEKER
                              (before Harry can 
                              answer)
                         What do you want Harry to do, Art? 
                         Arrest all of these boys -- all thirty 
                         or forty of them, or whatever there 
                         is?

                                     KLEINER
                              (hotly)
                         It's a matter of principle. You let 
                         something like this go, anything 
                         goes.

                                     THOMAS
                              (siding with Art)
                         You want to make a complaint, Art?

                                     KLEINER
                         I sure do --

                                     HARRY
                         Art, that's silly. Your car's okay -- 
                         you're okay -- you're lucky the way 
                         you drive --

               Kleiner turns angrily, stomping toward his car.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Kleiner gets into his car. The starter grinds, nothing 
               happens.

                                     CYCLISTS
                              (yelling advice)
                         The fire went out! Turn on the jets! 
                         Hit it with a hammer!

               The motor catches with a great popping and banging; the car 
               goes bucking and bolting off up the street, the CAMERA 
               PANNING. As crowd scatters, the cyclists cheering,

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET (MILDRED'S BEAUTY SALON) - DAY

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               A cyclist burning a tight circle in the middle of the street. 
               The CAMERA PULLS BACK on a small crowd of local people 
               watching the circus. In the b.g., Mildred and a customer, 
               BETTY, come out of the shop. Mildred looks up. The two girls 
               move into the f.g., stop, watching a moment. Mildred is 
               visibly excited. She nods to Betty and they move on, the 
               CAMERA PANNING to HOLD on two rather elderly men, who are 
               both puzzled and fascinated:

                                     MAN
                              (raising his voice 
                              over the racket)
                         What? What you say they're doing?

                                     OTHER MAN
                         I don't know. Doesn't make any sense 
                         to me. I can't even understand what 
                         they're talking about --

               EXT. BLEEKER'S - DAY

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Red, Dextro and Pigeon are sitting their machines at the 
               curb when Mildred and Betty come up, entering the bar. The 
               boys dismount immediately, waltz in behind them.

               INT. BLEEKER'S BAR - DAY

               PAST BLEEKER

               as Mildred and Betty enter, quickly lost in the crowd. 
               Bleeker, in the f.g. is happily meeting the demand for beer, 
               opening bottles like mad. The boys are picking them up as 
               fast as he opens them, not waiting for glasses.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Here you go -- One brew here, Pop -- 
                         Here you go -- Hey, gas me -- Knock 
                         one --

                                     BLEEKER
                              (simultaneously)
                         Coming up -- how many here -- enough 
                         for everybody --

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including Harry, sitting at the end of the bar near Bleeker, 
               poking at some coins in front of him.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Never rains but it pours -- nothing 
                         like beer to settle the dust, eh?

               Bleeker is raking in money, making change, opening beer, all 
               at once. Harry glances around uneasily at the growing 
               confusion.

               INT. CAFE

               KATHIE AND JOHNNY

               It is quiet here, by comparison. Johnny is just sitting, 
               studying Kathie as she works. Then he gets up from the 
               counter, moves restlessly to another seat, regards Kathie 
               moodily.

                                     JOHNNY
                         What do you do later?

               She hesitates, half-smiles.

                                     KATHIE
                         I work.

               He scowls. We hear the noise of the cyclists and others 
               trouping into the bar, yakking it up.

                                     JOHNNY
                         You have to goof off, some time.

                                     KATHIE
                         What?

                                     JOHNNY
                         Nobody works forever.

                                     KATHIE
                         It feels like it sometimes.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Tonight, I mean.

               She shrugs.

                                     KATHIE
                         I have to stay, as long as we're 
                         busy.

               She nods toward sound of growing activity in bar, smiles.

                                     KATHIE
                              (continuing)
                         Sounds like we're going to be busy, 
                         until you leave.

               ANGLE TOWARD BAR

               Johnny scowls again, uncertain how to proceed, shifts 
               restlessly. A few cyclists have started wandering in from 
               the bar with their beer.

                                     KATHIE
                         Where are you going -- when you leave 
                         here?

               He raises his head sharply. She sees his completely blank 
               expression, does a slight take, smiles.

                                     KATHIE
                              (continuing)
                         Don't you know?

               Johnny's face works a moment.

                                     JOHNNY
                         We just go.

                                     KATHIE
                              (shrugs)
                         It's nothing to me. I was just making 
                         conversation.

               ANGLE FEATURING JOHNNY

               Kathie starts to turn away. Anxious to hold her, Johnny wets 
               his lips. He is very tense.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (abruptly)
                         Weekends we go out.

               Kathie half-turns back.

                                     KATHIE
                         What do you do?

                                     JOHNNY
                              (impatiently)
                         We just go.

                                     KATHIE
                         You mean you just ride around? Or 
                         you go on a sort of a picnic, or 
                         something?

               He stares at her in blank frustration.

                                     JOHNNY
                         You're real square, aren't you?

               Another pause; he scowls, obviously trying to explain 
               something very difficult for him.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (continuing)
                         It builds up. You understand?

               She nods, understanding nothing.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (continuing; with 
                              increasing tension)
                         A bunch gets together... After all 
                         week. You got to have a ball. Every 
                         day the same thing. Crawling around 
                         underneath. You shoot a Chevvy.
                              (continuing; the sound 
                              of a lube gun)
                         Phhuuusp! Phhuuuusp! Okay. You shoot 
                         a Study. Phuuuusp! Phuuuuuuusp! 
                         Phhuuuuuuuuusp! Same thing. Grease. 
                         It builds up. You got to sing. You 
                         got to feel good. You got to really 
                         go.

               A pause; this Kathie understands. She nods, rather wistfully.

                                     KATHIE
                              (quietly)
                         I'd like to go some place, sometime.

                                     BLEEKER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Kathie, where's Jimmy?

               She looks up, startled.

               WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING BLEEKER

               Who has come up, annoyed.

                                     KATHIE
                         I guess he's our, back, working on 
                         his roses --

                                     BLEEKER
                              (very irritated)
                         The roses. Every time we get a little 
                         business, the crazy old fool is doing 
                         something to his roses. Go get him. 
                         Tell him I'm swamped --

               Kathie nods, starts toward a door in the rear.

               JOHNNY

               watching her go. He turns his head, aware that Go-Go is right 
               beside him, also interested in the departure. Go-Go smirks.

                                     GO-GO
                              (making the gesture 
                              of twisting the grips 
                              on a cycle)
                         Araaaah! Araaaaah!

               Johnny's expression doesn't change; he looks back at the 
               door through which Kathie has gone.

               INT. BAR

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Jimmy emerges from the door at back of the barroom with a 
               tray of glasses, starts around behind the bar just as Bleeker 
               returns, glowers at him.

                                     BLEEKER
                              (snapping)

                              (unruffled)
                         Kathie said you wanted some glasses --

                                     BLEEKER
                         That was an hour ago. Get a couple 
                         more cases on ice -- never mind -- 
                         take over here --

               He turns away.

                                     RED
                         Hey, Jimmy, brew me here, Jimmy --

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Very unhurried Jimmy opens a bottle of beer and serves it.

                                     DEXTRO
                         Hey Jimmy, what do you hicks do for 
                         kicks around here?

                                     JIMMY
                         What? Speak up. Stop mumbling --

                                     PIGEON
                         Anything ever happen here?

                                     JIMMY
                         What? Yes. The roses grow. People 
                         get married. Crazy as any place else. 
                         The bugs get on them and cause 
                         trouble, sometimes -- that is, if 
                         you don't spray good --

               The boys give each other looks. This is fun. Here's the 
               village idiot and he's fair game.

                                     RED
                         No bugs on you, eh, Jimmy?

                                     JIMMY
                         I mind my own business. Listen to 
                         the radio. Music, that is. News is 
                         no good. Excites people.

                                     DEXTRO
                         How about TV, Jimmy? You like TV?

                                     JIMMY
                         What?

                                     PIGEON
                         Television. You heard about that new 
                         thing, Television --

                                     JIMMY
                              (placidly, as he works)
                         Oh, pictures. No, no pictures --

               Looking off down the bar, Dextro reacts, nudges Red. As Red 
               looks:

                                     JIMMY
                              (continuing)
                         Everything these days is pictures. 
                         Pictures and a lot of noise. Nobody 
                         even knows how to talk -- just grunt 
                         at each other --

               ANGLE DOWN BAR PAST RED AND OTHERS

               Mildred is at the bar, in the middle of a group of cyclists, 
               laughing loudly at something one of them has said.

                                     MILDRED
                              (raising her glass; 
                              loudly)
                         Skol! Gesundheit!

               GROUP JIMMY, RED AND OTHERS

               Red looks back at Gringo, knowingly, lifts his glass 
               elaborately.

                                     RED
                         Skol!

                                     GRINGO
                              (business of twisting 
                              grips)
                         Araaaaah! Araaaaaah!

               Jimmy looks at him with distaste.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny has taken up a position against the wall near the 
               archway, following Kathie with his eyes. Two cyclists, Go-Go 
               and Boxer, come up to him, pulling Mildred and Betty. The 
               girls are having a fine time.

                                     GO-GO
                         Hey, Johnny, get Mildred!

                                     MILDRED
                         Hi, Johnny. Skol! Meet Betty --

                                     BOXER
                              (to Mildred)
                         Hey, show Johnny!

               He gives her a little push. Giggling, Mildred leans in very 
               close to him, shaking her head to make her earrings tinkle.

                                     BETTY
                         See! Real bells, isn't that cute?

               Johnny gives her a look, stares past her.

                                     GO-GO
                         Mildred likes to dance. Hey, Mildred, 
                         let's dance --

               Johnny ignores them, his eyes on Kathie. Mildred grabs 
               Johnny's shoulder, indicating the legend on the back of the 
               jacket.

                                     MILDRED
                         Somebody tell me what that means -- 
                         B.R.M.C. -- What does that mean?

                                     BOXER
                         Black Rebels' Motorcycle Club.

                                     MILDRED
                         Oh, that's cute. What are you 
                         rebelling against?
                              (grabbing Johnny)
                         What are you rebelling against, Johnny

               Johnny gives her a quick stony look.

                                     JOHNNY
                         What have you got?

               Kathie has come up during the above and paused -- her way 
               through the archway cafe blocked by this group. Mildred turns 
               now, laughing, sees her.

                                     MILDRED
                         Hi, Kathie. Aren't they wonderful? 
                         Did you hear what I said? I said 
                         what does that mean -- B.R.M.C. -- 
                         and he said 'the Black Rebels' 
                         Motorcycle Club.' And I said what 
                         are you rebelling against, Johnny? 
                         Johnny said, 'what have you got?' 
                         What have you got! Isn't that cute? 
                         Kathie nods, starting pushing through.

                                     KATHIE
                         Excuse me...

               TWO SHOT

               As she comes past Johnny, he moves with her back toward the 
               cafe.

                                     JOHNNY
                         You like to dance?

               As she hesitates, thinking he means now:

                                     JOHNNY
                              (continuing)
                         The squares got a dance tonight at 
                         Harrison. We could go over to 
                         Harrison.

               She stops, looks at him uncertainly, interested but cautious.

                                     KATHIE
                         I don't dance very well...

               She continues on into the cafe. He frowns, follows her 
               doggedly.

               INT. CAFE

               MEDIUM SHOT

               as Kathie comes around behind the counter again, Mouse and 
               BEBOP sit down.

                                     MOUSE
                              (to Kathie)
                         Aren't you Miss --
                              (turning aside to 
                              Bebop)
                         -- taken about that? Didn't you say...

               Turning, he looks past Bebop, trails off. The joke dies.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Johnny is looking at him hard; his expression says, "Lay 
               off."

                                     MOUSE
                              (mildly; back to Kathie)
                         Coffee. Two coffees.

               Kathie glances at Johnny, nods, continues on to the coffee 
               urn. Johnny follows.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny sits opposite Kathie as she gets the coffee.

                                     JOHNNY
                         You like to go?

               Kathie shakes her head.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (continuing)
                         Why not? what's the matter?

               She turns, holding the coffee.

                                     KATHIE
                         I can't... and it's crazy. You just 
                         came from Harrison.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (shrugs)
                         So I go back to Harrison. We go to 
                         the dance --

               She smiles, wavering, turns with the coffee, stops. Johnny 
               follows her look.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Mouse and Bebop have gotten up from the counter and are 
               wandering away toward the bar.

               JOHNNY AND KATHIE

               She hesitates, uncertain what to do with the coffee now. 
               Johnny rises decisively.

               ARCHWAY

               Mouse and Bebop walking away. Johnny steps up behind, grabs 
               them, spins them around and starts cuffing them roughly. 
               They are thoroughly amazed, start swinging back, automatically 
               protecting themselves.

                                     MOUSE
                              (protesting loudly)
                         Hey, Johnny, what's the matter with 
                         you?

                                     JOHNNY
                              (shouting)
                         You jerky or something! Drink the 
                         coffee! You ordered coffee -- sit 
                         down -- drink it!

               They stare at him.

               TOWARD BAR FEATURING HARRY

               poised to leave his stool. Everyone has paused, turned to 
               see what this is about.

               BACK TO GROUP

               Johnny shoves the boys roughly toward the counter.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Sit down.

               They exchange looks, but obey, drift back toward the counter, 
               the CAMERA PANNING.

                                     BEBOP
                         What's with him?

               Mouse shrugs. Kathie places the coffee in front of them. She 
               smiles, glances toward Johnny.

               THREE SHOT

               Johnny has resumed his seat, staring at his beer. Harry drifts 
               into the shot, sits beside him. Kathie moves closer.

                                     HARRY
                              (awkwardly, indicating 
                              trophy)
                         Won yourself something there, did 
                         you?... Nice souvenir to have --

               ANGLE FEATURING JOHNNY

               He gives Harry at most a quick glance, ignores him.

                                     HARRY
                         Look, Johnny, out there... I think 
                         you got me a little wrong...

               He has put his police cap between them on the bar; Johnny 
               pushes it away from him. Harry reacts, but continues ineptly:

                                     HARRY
                         I got a job to do around here, but 
                         I'm not hard to get along with... 
                         It's usually just a misunderstanding -- 
                         I mean anything that develops into 
                         any kind of trouble...

               Johnny tenses on "trouble," but refuses to look at Harry, 
               jams a cigarette into his mouth.

                                     HARRY
                              (continuing)
                         It can be avoided most of the time -- 
                         if people sit down and talk it over...

               With this he has struck a match -- extending it to Johnny in 
               his cupped hands. Johnny refuses it with an elaborate, don't 
               crowd-me sort of gesture, pushing Harry's hands away, 
               extracting the match and lighting his cigarette from it 
               himself.

               ANOTHER ANGLE THREE SHOT

               Kathie looks from Johnny to Harry, who takes the rebuff, 
               sits there a moment, rises abruptly.

                                     KATHIE
                              (to say something)
                         You want me to have Jimmy make you a 
                         steak sandwich, Dad?

               Johnny reacts sharply on the word "Dad." As Harry shakes his 
               head, moves away, Johnny glances from him back to Kathie, 
               gives her a sardonic look. Then he rises abruptly with his 
               trophy, strides for the door.

               CLOSE SHOT KATHIE

               Uncertain, watching Johnny exit.

               EXT. BLEEKER'S

               FEATURING JOHNNY

               He steps to his cycle, starts quickly re-wiring the trophy 
               to the fender. Several boys who have followed him out crowd 
               up.

                                     BOXER
                              (nodding back; grinning)
                         Got yourself lined up?

                              (impressed)
                         Yeh? How about that?

               attaching the trophy.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Come on, let's blow out of here --

                                     RED'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I'd like to get me a cop's daughter 
                         sometime. Some deal --

               Johnny's flicker of reaction is cut short by the sudden roar 
               of a motor, the sound exploding right on top of the scene. 
               He pulls back.

               TOWARD CAFE DOOR

               A cycle -- driven by Gringo, with Crazy on the jump seat, 
               one foot sticking out in a plaster cast -- jolts past the 
               group onto the sidewalk. A cyclist coming out just barely 
               has time to jump aside, holding the door, the cycle charging 
               past him. Johnny and his group swarm in after it, laughing. 
               There is, simultaneously, a concerted shout from inside.

               FULL SHOT

               The crowd scattering as Gringo crosses the cafe, rides through 
               the archway into the bar.

               INT. BAR

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Mildred and the boy she was dancing with jumping aside. A 
               tremendous din as Gringo heads the cycle straight for the 
               bar.

               CLOSE SHOT ON BLEEKER

               Startled, a flash of outrage.

               Poised to leave his stool.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Gringo bringing the cycle to a reckless but expert stop 
               flanking the bar, opposite Bleeker, cutting the motor.

                                     GRINGO
                              (loud in the momentary 
                              silence)
                         One beer --

                              indicate Crazy)
                         One sidecar --

               A cheer goes up -- everybody talking at once, crowding around 
               the cycle. Bleeker grins slowly, accepting the joke, starts 
               filling the order. Harry glances at him, resumes his seat. A 
               few intelligible phrases emerge from the bedlam as Johnny 
               and his group come in from the cafe:

                                     AD LIBS
                         Hey, drive-in service -- Hi, Crazy, 
                         how you been boy? Hey, Crazy had his 
                         clutch overhauled --

               TOWARD STREET DOOR

               A flying wedge of cyclists, lead by Dextro, bursts through 
               the door. They have rope and other props for a race. Several 
               have improvised arm-bands with the word "Official" lettered 
               on them. Dextro is waving a rag on a stick and shouting 
               something. While he is climbing onto a stool in the b.g. the 
               others crowd around Gringo and Crazy in the f.g.

                                     AD LIBS
                              (seeing plaster cast)
                         Hey, that's a wedgie, that's a real 
                         wedgie -- Hey, Crazy, we're going to 
                         scramble! You want in! Aarrraaaaaaah! 
                         Put it down, Crazy, put it down on 
                         the turn -- you won't feel a thing!

                                     DEXTRO
                         Attention! Attention please!

               DEXTRO

               as he gets comparative quiet:

                                     DEXTRO
                         Attention! The First Annual Hog 
                         Scramble Time and Trial Race starts 
                         in ten minutes --

               CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY AT BAR

               He scowls.

               BACK TO DEXTRO

                                     DEXTRO
                         You got five minutes to get gassed 
                         up! You get gassed up, report to the 
                         starting officials outside -- and 
                         let them smell your breath! Nobody 
                         isn't gassed up can race!

               This is a big yak, everybody crowding around, milling toward 
               the bar, Dextro trying to continue.

               EXT. MAIN STREET

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT

               This is the same angle from which we saw the B.R.M.C. boys 
               enter town. With a sudden roar, an entirely new group of 
               cyclists swing into the street in single file.

               The rider in the lead comes abreast the camera, gearing down, 
               slowing. The CAMERA HOLDS, PANS with him -- long enough to 
               see that he is a fantastically-dressed character with a beard 
               and dark glasses, some sort of big feather flowing from his 
               hat. This is CHINO.

               The others come on by. They are each, in some way, 
               outlandishly costumed. Some six or eight of the cyclists 
               have girls on the jump seats, clinging to their backs. At 
               this point, and from this angle, however, the girls -- in 
               jeans and jacket and various screwy outfits -- are barely 
               distinguishable from the boys.

               EXT. STREET (BLEEKER'S)

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The group comes abreast Bleeker, almost past. Chino stops so 
               suddenly the riders behind pile up into him and around him.

                                     CHINO
                              (looking toward parked 
                              cycles)
                         Hey, looks like the Rebels! Johnny's 
                         here!

               He starts wheeling back toward Bleeker's.

               INT. BLEEKER'S BAR

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The uproar continuing. Go-Go turns to Harry.

                                     GO-GO
                         Hey, Chief -- what are you drinking, 
                         Chief! Everybody gets gassed --

                                     BOXER
                              (to Bleeker)
                         One gas for my friend the Chief!

               ANOTHER ANGLE JOHNNY

               He is still grim, apart from this.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (to Gringo)
                         Let's get out of here --

                                     GRINGO
                         We're going to scramble --

                                     JOHNNY
                         Scramble someplace else --

               Dextro jumps onto a stool again, looking at his watch.

                                     DEXTRO
                              (shouting)
                         Time! Time! Everybody out! Report to 
                         the starting officials everybody 
                         wants to race!

               There is a concerted rush for the door. Johnny stands there 
               leaning against the bar until the place is almost empty, 
               then follows.

               HARRY AT BAR

               He looks up at Bleeker, worried.

               EXT. BLEEKER'S - AFTERNOON

               MEDIUM SHOT JOHNNY

               the last one out, pushes his way through the cyclists -- 
               stops dead on the curb, staring off.

               MEDIUM SHOT CHINO'S GROUP

               It has arranged itself in a rough semi-circle, the boys 
               sitting their machines, enclosing the cycles of the Rebels' 
               parked at the curb.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT LOW ANGLE CHINO

               In the center of the semi-circle. His arms are folded. He is 
               a very heavy men, almost fat, with big swollen hands. He is 
               smiling a peculiar smile. The dark glasses, the feather 
               sticking out of his hat -- make him look like a kind of 
               frightening clown.

               In the f.g., unmistakably attached to Chino's front fender, 
               is Johnny's trophy.

               JOHNNY

               as he stares angrily.

               THE TROPHY

               attached to Chino's front fender.

                                     CYCLISTS'S VOICE
                         Hey, look, Chino gleeped Johnny's 
                         gold!

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT

               The babble in the b.g. has stopped abruptly. Johnny takes a 
               step forward, glaring at Chino, and for an instant the whole 
               scene is frozen. Chino just sits there, grinning.

               MEDIUM SHOT KATHIE

               She comes up, stops, then edges a little closer, curious, 
               apprehensive.

               FULL GROUP SHOT

               The cyclists of both groups look from Johnny to Chino to see 
               what is going to happen. Other cyclists move up in the b.g. 
               to increase the circle around them.

               MEDIUM SHOT JOHNNY AND CHINO

               confronting each other.

                                     CHINO
                              (abruptly)
                         Hi-ya, sweetheart. What are you doing 
                         here in this miserable gully, Johnny, 
                         my love?

               Johnny steps toward him in his slow, insolent way, stops, 
               looking off.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Johnny meets Kathie's eyes for a moment, seems to hesitate. 
               A beat, then he continues to Chino; Kathie follows him with 
               her eyes.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny moves to the front of Chino's machine, stops, looking 
               from the trophy to Chino, who unfolds his arms, props his 
               chin elaborately on one hand:

                                     CHINO
                              (expansively)
                         Johnny, I love you. I been looking 
                         in every ditch, Fresno to here, hoping 
                         you were dead --
                              (with a wicked smile)
                         I looked for you in the race. I looked 
                         all over. I didn't see you race. I 
                         wanted to see my hot-shot boy scramble 
                         and win some gold... Wouldn't they 
                         let my boy scramble? Was my boy too 
                         tough?

               KATHIE

               interested, puzzled.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Chino looks Johnny over carefully, solicitously.

                                     CHINO
                         Johnny, you look pale. You been taking 
                         care of yourself? You been staying 
                         out too late?

                                     JOHNNY
                              (hard; indicating 
                              trophy)
                         That's mine. Take it off.

               Without changing his expression, Chino leans forward a little, 
               gives the trophy a pat.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Take it off.

               Chino doesn't move. Johnny reaches out suddenly to grab the 
               trophy. Chino gives him a vicious cut on the forearm with 
               the side of his big hand. Johnny pulls back, furious, and 
               swings on him. It's a solid blow. It knocks Chino backwards, 
               half off his cycle. With no change in expression, Chino 
               scrambles the rest of the way off, onto his feet, with 
               surprising agility. He dives at Johnny, who is now trying to 
               unfasten the trophy, envelopes him in a bear-hug, pinning 
               down Johnny's arms. In a crazy rage, Johnny fights free, 
               lets fly at Chino again. The blow lands on Chino's shoulder, 
               sends him backwards. Chino -- still grinning, his dark glasses 
               at a cockeyed angle -- spreads wide his arms in an expansive 
               gesture of delight and admiration.

                                     CHINO
                         Johnny -- that's better -- I've missed 
                         you. Ever since the club split up, I 
                         missed you --
                              (with a wicked leer 
                              and a wide gesture 
                              to indicate his flock)
                         Everybody missed you. All the beetles 
                         missed you --

               SEVERAL CUTS

               to members of Chino's group, looking toward the protagonists 
               expectantly. We get a better look at the "beetles," the girls 
               in their tight jeans, kerchiefs, black leather jackets. One 
               of them, with a sad, sultry face, almost calls out; the word 
               "Johnny" forms, but is not quite said.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Chino moves slowly toward Johnny, cautious, grinning, his 
               arms spread wide as if to embrace him.

                                     CHINO
                         Johnny, I love you. Let's have a 
                         beer -- then I'll beat the living 
                         Christmas out of you, Johnny --

               As he steps forward, Johnny shoves him roughly back, starts 
               to work the trophy loose.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Recovering his balance, Chino suddenly assumes a ridiculous, 
               wheedling, mendicant-like pose, comes sidling up with his 
               hands clasped together.

                                     CHINO
                         Johnny, don't take that away from 
                         Chino. It's so beautiful. Chino needs 
                         it. It makes Chino feel good. It 
                         makes Chino feel like a big strong 
                         man --

               For some reason, this hits Johnny hard; he pauses.

                                     CHINO
                              (continuing; having a 
                              fine time)
                         Chino didn't win it, my boy. Chino 
                         just gleeped it. Chino gleeped it 
                         off a guy didn't win it either --

               Johnny straightens up, furious, leaves the trophy dangling 
               by a wire.

                                     CHINO
                              (continuing)
                         If you want one -- go gleep one some 
                         place for yourself --

               ANGLE SHOT FEATURING KATHIE

               A suspended, thoughtful look on her face. Over her shoulder, 
               Dextro waves the starter's flag, shouts:

                                     DEXTRO
                         Hey -- scramble for it! Put it up 
                         for stakes!

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Chino whirls toward Dextro.

                                     CHINO
                         Who said that?

               There is a chorus of shouts:

                                     AD LIBS
                         Scramble for it, if you want it! 
                         Hey, Johnny, you and Chino scramble! 
                         Put up the gold! Hey, Chino, you and 
                         Johnny scramble for the gold!

               Chino whirls back, grabs Johnny by the shoulders, delighted.

                                     CHINO
                         Johnny, you got a scramble going! 
                         You didn't tell Chino! Okay. I feel 
                         hot!
                              (grabbing trophy, 
                              snapping the last 
                              wire)
                         I'll screw it on with you! Big man 
                         takes the gold! You get to prove to 
                         your girl here what a big brave jerk 
                         you are! Okay?

                                     JOHNNY
                              (a beat; a quick glance 
                              toward Kathie; then 
                              grimly)
                         Okay.

               Everybody starts crowding around, talking at once. Chino 
               waves the trophy aloft, shouts over the noise.

                                     CHINO
                         Big man takes the gold! Big man takes 
                         the stakes --
                              (whirling, he comes 
                              face to face with 
                              Kathie, thrusts the 
                              trophy on her)
                         The lovely young lady here will hold 
                         the golden stakes! The timid maiden 
                         of the hills clutches the gold to 
                         her breast and fights back a tear as 
                         her hero bleeds to death in the street -- 
                         Where do we start?

               Dextro pushes importantly to the front of the group crowding 
               around Chino:

                                     DEXTRO
                              (hammy; the big 
                              official)
                         The officials are now laying out the 
                         course, young man! You will all 
                         proceed to your positions for the 
                         massed start! Right this way! The 
                         officials are now laying out the 
                         course!

               Chino and the others have already turned toward their cycles; 
               there is a general noisy milling about.

               EXT. START OF RACE

               ON CROWD

               that has started to collect. An "Official", wearing one of 
               the improvised arm-bands, steps out to make like an announcer, 
               using a beer can for a "mike".

                         the finish!

               CLOSER SHOT PAST OFFICIAL

               as two boys on a cycle start off to mark the course. One of 
               them, on the jump-seat, is riding backwards, a hundred pound 
               sack of flour in his arms.

               The cycle bucks forward, the CAMERA PANNING TO FOLLOW it off 
               down the street -- the boy on the back spilling flour as 
               they go. The crowd laughs.

               EXT. BLEEKER'S

               JOHNNY

               He is now moving grimly to his cycle, unsnapping his goggles 
               from his belt. Several of his group follow, talking it up.

                                     CYCLISTS
                         Hey, Johnny, you can take him! You 
                         can take Chino! Come on, Johnny, 
                         let's go! The girl who almost called 
                         out Johnny's name catches up with 
                         him, impulsively catches his arm.

                                     GIRL
                              (eagerly)
                         Hi, Johnny --

               He stops dead, turns and stares at her with vacant intensity, 
               with absolutely no indication of recognition.

                                     GIRL
                              (continuing)
                         Hi, Johnny...

               Her hand goes to her name, BRITCHES, printed on her jacket, 
               in the manner of the Rebels.

                                     GIRL
                              (continuing)
                         Britches... you remember... 
                         Britches...
                              (uncertainly, as he 
                              just stares)
                         You remember -- the last weekend we 
                         went out scrambling before the club 
                         split up... How you been, Johnny? I 
                         didn't know what happened to you... 
                         Well, it's been a year I didn't see 
                         you... I thought about you...

               She trails off, embarrassed. Johnny pulls his arm free, turns 
               abruptly away. The CAMERA HOLDS AN INSTANT on Britches as 
               she looks after him, confused and hurt.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               He reaches his cycle, jumps on, snaps down his goggles -- a 
               look of maniacal intensity in his eyes -- kicks the starter. 
               The machine roars and pops.

               WIDER ANGLE

               He backs out to turn, and then guns off crazily; Kathie 
               reaches the curb too late and stands there, holding the 
               trophy.

               EXT. MAIN STREET START OF RACE - LATE AFTERNOON

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               The crowd is growing. In the center, a jumble of motorcycles 
               and noise.

               KATHIE

               Hanging onto the trophy, pushed forward by the people crowding 
               up for a view of the start of the race.

               KATHIE'S ANGLE OF STARTING LINE

               This is a massed start, highly disorganized. Popping, revving 
               up, cycles jockeying for position in the ragged line 
               stretching across the street and up onto the curb... There 
               are perhaps fifteen members of Johnny's group -- all helmeted 
               and goggled -- and ten of Chino's -- identifiable by their 
               weird costumes.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Most of the cyclists who are not entering the race are 
               wandering around, wearing "Official" arm-bands, shouting, 
               arguing, fighting, adding to the confusion.

               CLOSER SHOT ON JOHNNY

               finds a spot in the line. Intense, twisting the grips, a 
               maniacal look behind his goggles.

               CHINO

               Several riders away, grinning, clowning, waving his feathered 
               hat at the crowd.

               CRAZY

               Moving into the line of starters, the leg in the cast jutting 
               out. There is a cheer for him.

               GROUP OF LOCAL MEN

               They crowd up, starting to bet.

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT THE START

               Dextro staggers out front, raises his starter's banner, whips 
               it in the air, and almost falls down. There is a deafening 
               concert of explosions. The cyclists take off -- more or less 
               simultaneously -- in one hell of a tangled mess, half of 
               them colliding with each other, some of them unloading 
               immediately.

               KATHIE IN CROWD

               Jumping back out of the way with the crowd as a cycle spins 
               toward her.

               MEDIUM SHOT AT FIRST TURN

               An "Official" with a napkin tied to a stick waves around the 
               four or five riders who have taken the lead. Chino skids 
               around into the f.g., glances back over his shoulder for an 
               instant, grinning. Then Johnny comes slithering around, hot 
               after him.

               MILDRED

               A little tipsy, giggling, being lifted onto the shoulders of 
               several cyclists.

               The boys on the cycle marking the course with flour, well 
               ahead of the racers. They leave town, head for open country.

               EXT. TOWN HALL

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT

               A small crowd has collected here -- where the course makes a 
               right angle around the Town Hall. This is a small, neat 
               building in the b.g., housing all the municipal functions, 
               including the police department and jail. The leaders, 
               including Chino and Johnny, tear past in the f.g.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               ANOTHER ANGLE SHOT

               A cyclist spins out on the turn. A couple of others pile 
               into him. One of them rights his cycle, but can't get it 
               started. Pigeon, Boxer and Dinky, who have crowded forward 
               to give advice, have to jump back as Crazy comes around the 
               turn, the CAMERA PANNING WITH him. He puts his foot with the 
               cast down on the ground and slides around the turn on it.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               This is a street of pretty, white-framed houses, neat lawns 
               and flower beds. Chino in the lead, tears past in the f.g., 
               then Johnny, trying to pass.

               ANOTHER ANGLE AT TURN

               Johnny cuts in, takes Chino on the turn. There is a shout of 
               "He got him!" The CAMERA HOLDS ON the turn as other cycles 
               follow them around. One of them hares off at a tangent, up 
               over the curb, right through a low picket fence.

               ON CYCLIST

               cutting a swath of devastation across the lawn, through flower 
               beds, miring for a moment in mud, recovering and plunging 
               through the picket fence again, back onto the course. A 
               furious, frantic woman, moves quickly into the f.g.

                                     WOMAN
                         Can't somebody stop this?

               Nobody pays any attention to her; they are all too interested 
               in the race.

               A group of cyclists comes through with an improvised sign -- 
               the word "FINISH" lettered on a sheet torn lengthwise, ropes 
               tied to each end to suspend it.

               KATHIE

               In the crowd, still clutching the trophy, the crowd pressing

               JOHNNY AND CHINO

               as they re-enter town. Johnny comes into a turn, takes it a 
               little wide and Chino, with an opening, takes the inside and 
               cuts him off. Johnny swerves to miss him, goes out of control, 
               spins off.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Several of Johnny's group have rushed over to help him, all 
               talking at once, all giving advice, helping right the cycle.

                                     CYCLISTS
                         Come on, Johnny -- You can still get 
                         him -- Go get him, Johnny --

               Furious, Johnny is already scrambling back onto the machine. 
               He kicks it twice before it starts -- then takes off like a 
               rocket, the CAMERA PANNING. Chino is out of sight.

               SERIES OF SHOTS RESIDENTIAL STREETS

               with Chino holding his lead -- Johnny a very poor second, 
               tearing recklessly around the turns some two hundred yards 
               behind. Members of Johnny's group look at each other. "What 
               happened?" In the final shot, Chino enters the straightaway 
               into the finish line. Johnny isn't in sight yet.

               EXT. MAIN STREET (RANCH)

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT

               Chino coasting into the stretch, heading for the "Finish" 
               banner now stretched across the street.

               CLOSER SHOT ON CHINO (PROCESS)

               He glances back, slows down, and starts clowning. He stands 
               up, tipping his feathered hat to the crowd on either side -- 
               wobbles, loses control. He goes one way, the bike the other. 
               The crowd parts, the machine bounding off, riderless.

               CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               Flat out.

               MEDIUM SHOT CHINO

               Picking himself up from the middle of the street -- still 
               some yards from the finish. He starts after his cycles, stops 
               suddenly, hearing a sound, looking back.

               CHINO'S ANGLE

               Here comes Johnny. Everybody is yelling.

               MEDIUM SHOT CHINO

               He hesitates just an instant, calculates, decides to abandon 
               the bike, takes off under his own power and starts hot-footing 
               it ponderously for the finish line.

               FROM FINISH LINE

               Chino scrambling for the finish -- Johnny bearing down on 
               him. Chino makes it, just a few seconds before Johnny flashes 
               past. Everybody starts shouting, closing in.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Cyclists and townspeople crowding around Chino, who clasps 
               his hands over his head, fighter fashion, then starts looking 
               around.

                                     CHINO
                              (very winded, but 
                              delighted)
                         Where's my gold? Where did that 
                         gorgeous little stake-holder go?

               He starts pushing his way through the crowd, the CAMERA 
               PANNING. There are cries of "Here! Here!" He turns.

               MEDIUM SHOT KATHIE

               Frightened, as Chino comes swooping down on her, arms 
               outstretched.

                                     CHINO
                         Come to Chino! Come to Chino, baby, 
                         you beautiful thing!

               All in one motion he lifts the trophy from Kathie's arm and 
               kisses her on the forehead.

               MEDIUM SHOT JOHNNY

               having overshot the finish and circled, he stops now, his 
               group crowding around to congratulate him.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (abruptly)
                         Come on, let's blow this joint -- 
                         Wait'll I get back my gold --

               He heads his cycle into the crowd.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               as Johnny stops his machine, jumps off, rips off his goggles. 
               Furious, he reaches for the trophy. Chino defends it, pushes 
               Johnny away.

                                     CHINO
                         Now, Johnny, Chino won it -- Chino 
                         won the race --

                                     GRINGO
                         You won the flat-footed race -- you 
                         didn't win any sickle race --

                                     LOVER BOY
                         He crossed the finish first -- who 
                         says you got to cross the finish on 
                         a sickle?

               During this, Johnny has come for Chino again, Chino has pushed 
               him back once more. Now -- with sudden violence -- Johnny 
               throws himself at Chino, knocking Chino backward and into 
               the crowd near Kathie.

               ANOTHER SHOT

               Chino shakes himself, a weird smile on his face, thrusts the 
               trophy on Kathie again, and lunges.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Gringo, Lover Boy, and several others crowd forward, talking 
               it up.

                                     GRINGO
                         Right this way! Everybody right this 
                         way! We are not awarding the prizes!

               SERIES OF FIGHT SHOTS JOHNNY AND CHINO

               They both attack and retreat alternately, putting as much 
               speed and weight behind their blows as possible -- so that 
               it is a sort of ambulatory fight, rather than a stationary 
               slugging match. Chino has more weight and is more durable 
               perhaps, scrambling to the attack and then scrambling away -- 
               like a stubborn, flat-footed bear. Johnny has more skill and 
               more real savagery. He steps in quickly, delivers cutting 
               blows, steps back. Chino reels after him, trying to tackle 
               him, the silly pleased smile rarely leaving his face.

               This is INTERCUT WITH VARIOUS REACTION SHOTS of:

               a. KATHIE, frightened, horribly fascinated, swept along with 
               the crowd.

               b. CYCLISTS of both groups, watching in objective, stoical 
               silence.

               c. TOWNSPEOPLE, children, and various characters already 
               established.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ON JIMMY

               in the crowd.

                                     SIMMONDS
                              (to Jimmy; excited)
                         What happened? What are they fighting 
                         about?

                                     JIMMY
                         Don't know. Don't know themselves 
                         probably. -- World situation --

               Simmonds is pushed aside; Jimmy finishes the speech to nobody 
               in particular. Nobody is listening.

                                     JIMMY
                              (continuing)
                         Mad at everybody. Confusion. Fight 
                         and make a lot of noise... Terrible 
                         waste... Corruption ...

               GROUP SHOT

               A number of the local men have collected around Hannegan in 
               the doorway of the hardware store.

                                     WILSON
                              (concerned)
                         This is getting rough --

               Harry walks into the SHOT; Thomas ignores him.

                                     THOMAS
                              (hotly)
                         Let's stop this. I've seen hoodlums 
                         like this before. If you don't get 
                         tough with them the minute they get 
                         out of line you're sunk --

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as Den returns with Harry, who looks harassed.

                                     HANNEGAN
                              (quickly; to Harry)
                         We're getting a lot of complaints. 
                         This is getting out of hand --

                                     THOMAS
                         You a cop or aren't you? If you can't 
                         boot these jerks out, there's plenty 
                         of us can -- even if we have to bust 
                         some heads --

                                     HANNEGAN
                         Wait a minute, Charlie, wait a minute 
                         now --

                                     THOMAS
                              (disgusted)
                         You're wasting your time talking. 
                         I'm going to see if everything's all 
                         right at home --

               He turns away.

               MEDIUM SHOT JOHNNY AND CHINO

               Johnny has knocked Chino backwards and is standing back 
               waiting for him to get up. Chino sitting on the ground, trying 
               to get his breath. Johnny just standing there, breathing 
               hard, waiting. Lover Boy steps in, hands him a bottle of 
               beer. He takes a swig, grins up at Johnny foolishly, his 
               mouth bleeding.

                                     CHINO
                         Johnny, I love you --

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Thomas' car is hemmed in by spectators and cyclists sitting 
               on their machines to watch the fight. Thomas appears, starts -- 
               around the front of his car, through the cyclists.

                                     THOMAS
                         Make some room here, boys, I'm going 
                         out --

               They just stare at him rudely.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Thomas comes around, gets in on the driver's side, starts 
               the motor, honks, waves the cyclists aside. Inching forward, 
               cramping his wheels, he manages to pull away from the curb. 
               The cyclists refuse to give, just sit there as he barely 
               scrapes by.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Pulling out some ten or fifteen feet, Thomas is completely 
               blocked by cyclists on their machines who have encircled the 
               fighters.

               CLOSE SHOT THOMAS

               Irritated, he honks without effect.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Thomas blowing his horn. Red steps over to him.

                                     RED
                         Pipe down. Where you think you're 
                         going?

                                     THOMAS
                         I'm going out --

                                     RED
                         Aw, come on, get back -- you're 
                         blocking the street --

               CHINO AND JOHNNY

               Both more or less in the same position; Johnny standing, 
               waiting; Chino sitting in the middle of the street, swigging 
               the beer.

                                     CHINO
                         Johnny, I'll tell you --

               He starts to rise, but sits again promptly as Johnny makes a 
               move toward him. He grins, starts propelling himself slowly 
               toward Johnny on his ass.

                                     CHINO
                              (continuing)
                         -- I'll tell you what we'll do --

               Thomas's horn has started blowing insistently. Chino reacts, 
               breaks off, annoyed by this interruption.

                                     CHINO
                              (continuing; bellowing 
                              off)
                         Shut up!

               He grins back at Johnny, inches forward, reacts again as the 
               honking continues, louder.

                                     CHINO
                              (continuing)
                         Shut up! I'm negotiating with my 
                         boy, Johnny, here!

               HANNEGAN AND GROUP

               They have reacted to the honking.

                                     HARRY
                         I'll get hold of this boy, Johnny, 
                         and have a talk with him --

               Harry reacts to a sudden burst of honking, shouting, starts 
               off. The crowd around him surges forward.

               CHINO AND JOHNNY

               They react too. Chino gets to his feet. Johnny turns with 
               him toward the center of the disturbance.

               MEDIUM SHOT FRONT OF THOMAS' CAR

               Tremendous confusion, shoving, and angry shouting. Whatever 
               happened -- there is now a cyclist (MEATBALL, Chino's group) 
               on the ground in front of the car, his cycle knocked over 
               and partly under one of the front wheels. Cyclists are diving 
               in helping Meatball up, pushing Thomas' car back to free the 
               crushed cycle, yelling; another group has descended angrily 
               on Thomas himself, shouting at him, trying to open the door 
               and pull him out -- Thomas yelling back, trying to defend 
               himself.

               KATHIE

               trying to protect herself in the crush.

               HARRY

               moving forward quickly.

               SHOT FEATURING CHINO

               diving into the center of the brawl, not asking any questions. 
               He thrusts aside the boys trying to get at Thomas, grabs him 
               himself, hauls him from the car -- gives him a couple of 
               solid cuffs that send him reeling aside.

                                     CHINO
                              (exhilarated; to Red)
                         What'd he do?

                                     RED
                         Tried run Meatball over --

               Chino reacts quickly, leaves Thomas in other hands, turns to 
               the car.

                                     CHINO
                              (bellowing over the 
                              noise)
                         Up and over!

               Other cyclists join him, putting their weight against the 
               car, taking up the cry.

                                     CYCLISTS
                              (CHINO'S GROUP)
                         Up and over! Up and over! Hep! Ho! 
                         Heave!

               OPPOSITE SIDE OF THOMAS' CAR

               as it comes up on two wheels, teeters an instant, then topples 
               over onto its side -- the crowd scrambling back out of the 
               way, a woman dragging a child back by the hand, just in time.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Harry diving into the middle of the group of boys man-handling 
               Thomas, shouting at them, pushing them aside.

                                     HARRY
                              (shouting)
                         All right! All right!

               Flailing about him, he manages to break it up. Cyclists and 
               local men start pressing in from all sides -- everybody 
               yelling at everybody else.

                                     GRINGO
                         Hey, Harry, hey Chief -- you seen 
                         him try to run Meatball over --?

               Thomas, dishevelled, apoplectic, gets into it, too.

                                     THOMAS
                              (whirling angrily on 
                              Gringo)
                         Nobody ran anybody over! He ran his 
                         motorcycle into the front of my car --

                                     CHINO
                              (getting into it)
                         And then that sickle just crawled 
                         right in under your front wheel -- 
                         all by its little self --

               Thomas whirls on him, his face close to Chino's distorted 
               with rage.

                                     THOMAS
                         Harry, I want this man arrested!

                                     CHINO
                         Hey, is that your face? Or you wearing 
                         a mask?

               Thomas sputters. Chino does a phony, delayed take, turns on 
               Harry in meek alarm.

                                     CHINO
                              (continuing)
                         He wants me arrested, Harry! You 
                         hear what he said?

                                     THOMAS
                              (to Hannegan, who has 
                              come up)
                         He hit me!

                                     CHINO
                              (spreading wide his 
                              arms)
                         Well, hit me back -- you coward!

               ANGLE TO INCLUDE KATHIE

               crowded in between several men, including Art Kleiner, who 
               shouts angrily at Harry:

                                     KLEINER
                         I seen it! Arrest them both! Arrest 
                         them both, Harry!

               Kathie glances off, from Harry toward Johnny.

               JOHNNY

               just standing there, near Chino, watching the whole procedure 
               with contempt.

               GROUP SHOT FEATURING HARRY

               He is getting a little rattled by people shouting at him 
               from all directions. Thomas turns on him.

                                     THOMAS
                         Harry --

                                     HARRY
                              (with sudden decision)
                         I'm going to take the both of you 
                         and lock you up -- so we can talk 
                         without everybody yelling --

               Thomas' mouth drops.

                                     HARRY
                              (continuing)
                         Whether I hold anybody depends on 
                         how bad this boy here is hurt --

               He turns aside. Thomas is left there, unable immediately to 
               believe this.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Meatball is limping around in circles, holding onto Lover 
               Boy's shoulder.

                                     HARRY
                              (coming up)
                         You hurt, son?

               He just gives Harry a vicious look; the other cyclist answers 
               for him:

                                     LOVER BOY
                         He don't feel a thing --

               Harry turns back, the CAMERA PANNING. Hannegan takes his 
               arm, pulling him aside.

                                     HANNEGAN
                         Harry, look, you sure you know what 
                         you're doing?

                                     HARRY
                         I know what I'm doing --

                                     HANNEGAN
                              (quickly; low)
                         Charlie could be part to blame, but 
                         let's just try and get these guys 
                         out of town --

               Harry wavers, rattled, suddenly pulls his arm away.

               GROUP SHOT

               Harry steps grimly up to Chino.

                                     HARRY
                         Okay, let's go --

               Chino turns and embraces him, his long-lost brother.

                                     CHINO
                         Harry!

                                     HARRY
                              (fighting off Chino's 
                              embrace)
                         Come on --

               He starts herding Chino off, the CAMERA FOLLOWING. Chino 
               hangs back, struggling, hamming it up.

                                     CHINO
                         Harry, no! I don't want to leave my 
                         friend Frog-Face here! You said you 
                         were going to arrest him, too!

               Harry pushes him on. Johnny steps out in front of them, 
               belligerently blocking the way.

                                     CHINO
                              (to Johnny)
                         Johnny, look at me! In the hands of 
                         the law! Isn't it terrr--rrrible!

                                     JOHNNY
                         What'd he do?

               Harry tries to ignore him, pushing on, but Johnny blocks him 
               with his body.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (continuing; evenly; 
                              menacing)
                         What'd he do that guy didn't do?

               He nods off.

               GROUP SHOT FEATURING THOMAS

               He is flushed, angry. Harry turns abruptly to Johnny.

                                     HARRY
                         Johnny, come here --

               He puts his arm around Johnny to lead him aside; Johnny 
               brushes him off angrily.

                                     HARRY
                              (continuing)
                         I want to talk to you, Johnny. Come 
                         here.

               As Harry moves out of the hubbub with Johnny and Chino, Johnny 
               posing indifferently.

                                     HARRY
                              (continuing)
                         Johnny, I've given you a couple of 
                         chances... Now, I don't know what 
                         you're after --

                                     CHINO
                         Let me tell you about Johnny, Daddy --

                                     HARRY
                         Shut up.

               Chino shuts up momentarily, but continues mugging and 
               posturing.

                                     HARRY
                              (continuing)
                         I'm in a spot -- You can make it 
                         easier for me -- You move on. You 
                         take your boys -- and this other 
                         bunch --

                                     CHINO
                         Can I go, too?

                                     HARRY
                         And he goes, too.

               Johnny is rigid, cynical.

                                     GRINGO
                         Hey, Johnny, don't fall for that 
                         corn --

               Harry gives Gringo an angry look, waits. A beat.

                                     JOHNNY
                         I made a deal with a cop once.

               He touches his finger to his nose. Several of the cyclists 
               give a choked laugh.

                                     CHINO
                         Let me tell you about Johnny, Daddy --

               Harry doesn't stop him this time.

                                     CHINO
                              (continuing)
                         He's okay, you just don't get on his 
                         back. He don't like anybody on his 
                         back. We had the same club once. The 
                         beetles got on his back all the time. 
                         He didn't like that...

               Harry is still looking steadily at Johnny, waiting for the 
               answer.

                                     HARRY
                         You don't want to do what I say, 
                         then...

               He shrugs.

                                     CHINO
                              (clasping his hands 
                              together)
                         Johnny, I'm going to the can! Save 
                         me!

               A beat.

                                     HARRY
                         Yes or no.

                                     JOHNNY
                         I don't make deals with cops no more. 
                         I learned better.

                                     CHINO
                         See?

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Harry waits an instant more, turns grimly to Chino.

                                     HARRY
                         Come on.

                                     CHINO
                              (calling back as Harry 
                              starts off with him)
                         Johnny! Write my mother and tell her 
                         I'm in the can! Write my mother to 
                         send me a case of beer! Oh, the shame 
                         of it all!

               His voice trails off.

               JOHNNY

               He jams a cigarette into his mouth. The other cyclists start 
               crowding around.

                                     GRINGO
                         Hey, Johnny, we going to let that 
                         phony cop get away with that?

               Mouse extends a light for Johnny, who reacts as he reacted 
               with Harry -- with the same sweeping don't-crowd-me-gesture, 
               pushing Mouse's hands away and taking the match.

                                     DEXTRO
                         Hey, let's give this joint the needle --

                                     RED
                         What are we going to do, Johnny?

                                     GRINGO
                         Hey, let's wait till dark -- then 
                         spring Chino!

               Johnny reacts to this, looks at him. Then, abruptly:

                                     JOHNNY
                         Hey, where's my gold? Where'd that 
                         beetle go Chino gave my gold to?

                                     DEXTRO
                         Was standing right there --

               As Johnny whirls, pushing off through the crowd in search of 
               Kathie, the CAMERA PANNING.

               INT. BLEEKER'S CAFE

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The cafe, emptied for the race, is still empty as Johnny 
               comes in, looking around. He strides toward the counter, 
               stops, looking off.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT THE TROPHY

               It is on the shelf behind the counter with the dishes and 
               cup

               WIDER ANGLE

               Johnny takes a stride toward the counter, as if to vault it, 
               stops as Kathie appears from behind the shelves. Without 
               looking at him, she walks to the shelves, takes down the 
               trophy, and puts it in front of him. She turns away -- then 
               turns back, as a sort of an after thought. Her manner toward 
               him is entirely changed; she is tense, and a little sardonic.

                                     KATHIE
                              (indicating trophy)
                         You're faster than I thought. That's 
                         for the race tomorrow...

               He glowers, stands there as if he were going to say something, 
               doesn't.

               Kathie busies herself with the coffee cups a moment. A few 
               cyclists enter from the street, glance at Johnny, move slowly, 
               restlessly off toward the bar.

                                     KATHIE
                              (tautly)
                         All right -- you've got your little 
                         toy back. What do you want now? Have 
                         you got any idea?

               He glances up, surly.

                                     KATHIE
                              (continuing)
                         Why don't you go someplace else and 
                         cause trouble?

               He sits, stubbornly. We hear people returning to bar on the 
               other side of the partition.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (with feeling; in 
                              general and to himself)
                         What a phony joint...
                              (mockingly sing-song)
                         Give me a break, I give you a break... 
                         Phony cop --

               Kathie nods.

                                     KATHIE
                         He's the town joke. And I'm stuck 
                         with him...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Johnny stares at her; this confuses him. She goes on, almost 
               softly, but with repressed bitterness.

                                     KATHIE
                         He's got about as much business being 
                         a cop as...
                              (indicating trophy)
                         ...as you have with that. He's a 
                         fake -- like you --

               Furious, he reaches out and grabs her wrist. She flinches. 
               It hurts, but she looks at him steadily.

                                     KATHIE
                              (continuing)
                         Go on, break it. I don't need it. 
                         You want to break something.

                                     JOHNNY
                         You're too good for me, you're a 
                         cop's daughter or something.

                                     KATHIE
                              (almost softly)
                         Go away, Johnny. Go away.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (a funny smile)
                         You're afraid of me...

               She nods slowly.

                                     KATHIE
                         I'm afraid of everything...

               He lets her wrist go suddenly.

                                     JOHNNY
                         I don't let anybody get away with 
                         anything like that. I know Chino a 
                         long time. He puts Chino in the can, 
                         whyn't he put that Frog-Face ran 
                         into Meatball in the can?

                                     KATHIE
                              (simply)
                         He's afraid of making a mistake. He 
                         needs the job, even if he doesn't 
                         like it.

               She starts to turn away. He grabs her wrist again.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Listen --

               Then whatever he was going to say fades into confusion; he 
               loses his resolve, lets her go just as suddenly, grabs up 
               the trophy and strides for the bar.

               INT. BAR - LATE AFTERNOON

               JOHNNY

               as he pushes his way angrily to the bar, which has started 
               to fill up again, bangs down his trophy.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Hey, beer --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BAR - EVENING

               JOHNNY

               At the other end of the bar now, glaring at his beer. The 
               CAMERA PULLS BACK QUICKLY. A light has been turned on. The 
               bar is about half full, but oddly quiet -- the atmosphere 
               heavy and ominous. Johnny turns abruptly from the bar, starts 
               cut.

               AT BOOTH - BRITCHES

               rises from where she is sitting with a cyclist, but Johnny 
               brushes rudely past her and out. She sits again, slowly.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               FULL SHOT

               It is dark now. Nothing, really, is happening. The street is 
               waiting. From somewhere a boy shouts, "Hey, Dextro!" Then 
               quiet again. Perhaps someone laughs.

               GROUP OF CYCLISTS

               They are shadows, sitting their machines quietly at the curb. 
               Two local girls come by on the sidewalk. They hesitate 
               slightly, hurry on past, uneasy. The boys just look.

               DRUGSTORE ENTRANCE

               Wilson, the druggist, coming out with a customer, locking 
               up. A cycle starts somewhere up the street, roars off. Both 
               men jump.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         What are they hanging around for? 
                         What are they doing?

               Wilson looks off, disturbed, doesn't answer.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Gives me the willies...

               STREET HARRY'S POV FROM JAIL DOOR

               The sound of the cycle dies away. Harry turns back into the 
               room, closing the door.

               INT. JAIL - NIGHT

               HARRY

               He glances toward the cell, sits at his desk. He fingers his 
               bunch of keys for a moment, toys with the phone.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               FULL SHOT

               Quiet. Two children move into the f.g. on bicycles. Then 
               very suddenly -- glass shattering. The children jump, whirl 
               at the sound.

               STORE FRONT - THE BROKEN GLASS

               As if this were a signal of some sort, a concert of noises 
               erupts on all sides: cycles starting up. exploding, roaring 
               off; yelling, men running and calling.

               INT. TELEPHONE OFFICE - NIGHT

               TELEPHONE OPERATOR

               The operator, DOROTHY, a middle-aged, nervous woman, has 
               reacted to this -- half rising to look through a window 
               beyond. We hear the gathering uproar.

                                     DOROTHY
                              (into receiver)
                         I'll see if I can get through, Harry --

               PAST DOROTHY

               to open door in b.g. Lover Boy appears there suddenly.

                                     LOVER BOY
                         Hey, look, in here!

               Five or six others appear, crowd in.

               FEATURING DOROTHY

               Closing a key, plugging in, she looks up, struck dumb with 
               terror. The cyclists are just crowding curiously around.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Hey, how does this work? Hey, can I 
                         get my mother on this? You're too 
                         dumb to have a mother! Let me, I saw 
                         somebody once -- Get your big hands 
                         off it!

               The cyclists have started pushing and scuffling among 
               themselves. Dorothy watches, absolutely petrified, comes to 
               suddenly, rises, yelps into the receiver:

                                     DOROTHY
                         Help! This is Dorothy!

               With that, she grabs her hat, forgetting her purse, bolts 
               for the door.

                                     MEATBALL
                              (into receiver)
                         Help! This is Dorothy's brother!

                                     CYCLIST
                              (CHINO'S GROUP)
                         Goodbye, Dorothy.

               She stops, turns back in panic.

                                     CYCLIST
                              (handing her the purse)
                         Take the day off, Dorothy!

               She snatches the purse, tears wildly for the door, the CAMERA 
               PANNING WITH her. o.s. the cyclists laugh, call after her: 
               "Goodbye, Dorothy," "You're through for the day," etc.

               INT. HARRY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               HARRY AT PHONE

               reacting to some kind of jabbering.

                                     HARRY
                         What? I want the Sheriff's office at 
                         Elsberg -- who is this? Get off the 
                         line! . . . Hello!

               The phone apparently goes dead. He drops the receiver, rises, 
               glances once more toward the cell. Then -- in a kind of panic -- 
               he hurries out.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               GROUP OF CYCLISTS

               Their machines backed into the curb, motors running, poised.

               CLOSER SHOT JOHNNY AND GRINGO

               in the center of this group. Johnny tensely twisting the 
               grips.

                                     GRINGO
                         Hey, Johnny, come on, let's spring 
                         Chino -- one phony cop --

                                     JOHNNY
                              (cutting him off)
                         Come on!

               He gives it the gun. The others roar out after him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THOMAS' HOUSE (RANCH) - NIGHT

               TOWARD HOUSE

               Some eight machines are ridden up onto the sidewalk -- motors 
               idling, headlights playing across the porch and steps. Thomas 
               appears there, angry, raises his hand to shield his eyes.

                                     THOMAS
                              (shouting over the 
                              motors)
                         What do you think you're doing here! 
                         Get off my lawn!

               He starts down the steps.

               MEDIUM SHOT THOMAS

               As he advances into the lights, blinded, we see two figures 
               approach him from opposite sides. The rest is confused and 
               obscured -- the headlights swinging away, leaving the center 
               of the action dark, the accelerating motors drowning out 
               anything that is said. Then suddenly, the whole group is 
               gone off up the street, just enveloping Thomas.

               TOWARD OPEN DOOR

               A woman's figure appears there.

                                     WOMAN
                         Charlie! What is it? What was --

               Silence. She turns and hurries back into the house.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. JAIL

               MEDIUM SHOT

               A group of Johnny's boys enter from the corridor with Thomas, 
               push toward cell. Johnny follows them in -- he has Harry's 
               keys.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Hey, here it is! Hey, look at Chino! 
                         Chino passed out!

               FROM CELL

               PAST CHINO, asleep on a bench in the f.g., in a ridiculous 
               position, almost falling off.

                                     GRINGO
                              (looking in)
                         Hey -- Chino! Wake up! Unlock the 
                         door!

               Johnny gets the door opened. Thomas is pushed in - the 
               cyclists crowding along.

                                     RED
                         Hey, Chino! You're sprung!

               ANOTHER ANGLE CELL

               The cyclists start to shake Chino, bellowing in his ear:

                                     AD LIBS
                         Chino, wake up! The fire went out! 
                         Chino!

               Chino wakes up suddenly, the peaceful expression on his face 
               replaced by a look of absolute fear. He rises, starts flailing 
               with his arms, knocking his rescuers in all directions. Then 
               he staggers back and collapses on the bench again.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               They try to haul him up again. Johnny yells at them, angrily:

                                     JOHNNY
                         Come on! Let him alone! Let him sleep!

               They drop Chino reluctantly, step back outside with Johnny, 
               who starts locking the door.

                                     THOMAS
                              (stepping to bars)
                         Look here, you --

                                     JOHNNY
                         Have yourself a time. Don't write on 
                         the walls.

               He throws the keys out of the scene, follows the others 
               already crowding out the door.

               THOMAS

               He stands there a moment, glances across at the sleeping 
               Chino, sits heavily on the opposite bench.

                         Hey, Johnny, what we going do now?

               Johnny ignores him.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Hey, where the beetles? Let's go 
                         find the beetles --

               Johnny slips unobtrusively aside. The CAMERA HOLDS ON the 
               group, milling around indecisively.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Hey, this is better than the ball we 
                         had at that place... What was the 
                         name of that joint?

               o.s. Johnny's cycle starts, roars off.

                                     AD LIBS
                         I need gas... This is a ball! Hey, 
                         let's get us some quail! Hey, where'd 
                         Johnny go?

               EXT. BLEEKER'S - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               When Johnny rides up, an uproar is issuing from the bar. He 
               ignores it, starts for the cafe door. Britches steps up to 
               him.

                                     BRITCHES
                         Hi, Johnny, where you been, Johnny?

               TWO SHOT JOHNNY AND BRITCHES

               He turns, stares at her. She is carrying a bottle of beer 
               and is a little drunk, her eyes very brilliant.

                                     JOHNNY
                         What do you want?

                                     BRITCHES
                         Talk to me, Johnny. Sing me a song --

               He gives her a look, starts through the door. She hangs on, 
               following.

               INT. CAFE - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The uproar from the bar is coming over as Kathie appears 
               from the short hall leading to the kitchen. She stops, looks 
               off toward the street door.

               JOHNNY AND BRITCHES

               She has stopped him again, just inside the door.

                                     BRITCHES
                         Buy me a beer --

                                     JOHNNY
                         You got a beer --

               IN HALL

               as Kathie steps back quickly out of sight. Jimmy is at the 
               phone on the wall in the b.g.

                                     JIMMY
                              (into phone)
                         Hello! Hello!

               He drops the phone just as Bleeker comes into the shot, angry 
               and rattled.

                                     JIMMY
                         Phone's dead. Better send somebody 
                         for the militia --

                                     BLEEKER
                              (to Kathie)
                         Go see if you can find Harry. Tell 
                         him I need him right away.

               He turns back. Jimmy urges Kathie through the door to the 
               kitchen.

                                     JIMMY
                         You go home and stay there --

               MEDIUM SHOT

               as Bleeker hurries back toward the disturbance in the bar. 
               Britches is still holding Johnny, near the center of the 
               cafe.

               BRITCHES AND JOHNNY

               He flinches angrily, pulls away.

                                     BRITCHES
                         I want to know how you been... I'm 
                         singing tonight, Johnny. I'm really 
                         singing. I'm on the Christmas tree.

               He jerks his arm away, takes the bottle of beer out of her 
               hand and drinks it himself.

                                     BRITCHES
                         You got a date?

                                     JOHNNY
                              (grim)
                         Yeh, I got a date --

                                     BRITCHES
                              (intensely; trying to 
                              hold him)
                         Johnny, remember the night -- the 
                         first time I went out scrambling 
                         with the Rebels? Remember?
                              (as he says nothing)
                         That was the first time I saw you. I 
                         haven't seen you since then. We really 
                         got hung on the Christmas tree, didn't 
                         we, Johnny?

               He glowers at the beer bottle, stubbornly refuses to say 
               anything. Britches continues with a sort of desperate, 
               transparent self-mockery:

                                     BRITCHES
                              (continuing)
                         Boy, was I green! Was I really green, 
                         Johnny? I thought I was really living 
                         it up! I had me a guy and we were 
                         really going to go!

               She laughs, but she is actually beginning to cry a little.

                                     BRITCHES
                              (continuing)
                         Was I green! We had a lot of yaks, 
                         anyway, didn't we? We really got 
                         ourselves hung on the Christmas tree!

               She breaks suddenly, revealing herself.

                                     BRITCHES
                              (continuing)
                         Well, say it, can't you? Won't you 
                         say something to me, Johnny? I won't 
                         get on your back. I wouldn't do that. 
                         But we had a lot of yaks, didn't we?

               Johnny just looks at her in impotent anger.

                                     JOHNNY
                         What do you want me to do -- send 
                         you some flowers?

               He takes the last swallow from the bottle -- hands her the 
               empty, starts for the bar. She stands there -- really crying 
               now, silently.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Jimmy appears behind the counter.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Hey, where's that girl? Where's that 
                         Kathie?

                                     JIMMY
                         Counter's closed. Bar's closed. 
                         Everything's closed.

               Johnny glares at him, starts through the archway.

               TRUCKING SHOT

               as Johnny enters. He just wades through, looking around. 
               Bleeker, completely helpless, reaches his side.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Can you stop this?

                                     JOHNNY
                         Where's Kathie? I want to see her.

                                     BLEEKER
                         I don't know... Look. I've treated 
                         you boys right... If you can stop 
                         this, Johnny -- I'll do whatever --

                                     JOHNNY
                         I don't stop anything.

               He continues on, looking around; Bleeker stays with him, 
               pleading.

                                     BLEEKER
                         They're wrecking my place. This is 
                         going to cost --

                                     JOHNNY
                         You're doing all right.

               Satisfied that Kathie is not here, Johnny continues quickly 
               on and out the door off the bar. Bleeker is left standing 
               there.

               EXT. STREET BEAUTY SHOP - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Kathie comes hurrying along. A cyclist who has been standing 
               in the doorway of the beauty shop steps out into the light.

                                     CYCLIST
                         Quail!

               Kathie stops, her way blocked, starts back. But it's too 
               late. Several more boys have stepped out.

                                     CYCLISTS
                              (chorus)
                         Quail!

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as they swoop down on her, surround her, before she has gotten 
               ten yards.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Hey, you know how to dance? Hey, 
                         it's Johnny's girl! So it's Johnny's 
                         girl -- she knows how to dance --

               She looks around wildly, but there is no escape. They start 
               taking her back toward the beauty shop. Radio music and 
               hilarity is coming over from inside Mildred's.

               INT. MILDRED'S BEAUTY SALON - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               A small radio on a makeup table -- the volume as high as it 
               will go. Empty beer bottles everywhere.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Mildred dances two or three drunken steps with a cyclist, 
               laughs hysterically as she is passed on to another partner, 
               and then another. A cyclist simpers up to her -- wearing a 
               hair-dryer on his head.

                                     CYCLIST
                         Hey, Mildred! Look at me!

                                     CYCLIST
                         Hey, Buck Rogers!

                                     MILDRED
                         No, don't! That's expensive! You'll 
                         break it!

               She pulls away from the boy she is dancing with, tries to 
               grab the dryer off the guy's head, but he grabs her in an 
               embrace and starts dancing around with her. Other cyclists, 
               delighted with this new game, grab other dryers and various 
               equipment.

               CLOSE SHOT MILDRED

               Frantic and frightened now, she struggles to get free, but 
               the cyclist hangs on to her.

                                     MILDRED
                         You're hurting me!

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as the other group enters with Kathie.

                                     CYCLISTS
                         Hey, Quail! New talent!

               Several boys descend on her, fighting for her, a couple fall 
               down.

               KATHIE

               Terrified, as she is grabbed by a boy who starts staggering 
               around the little room with her, holding her roughly. Another 
               boy grabs her away. The CAMERA FOLLOWS as she is passed, 
               grabbed or pushed from one boy to another.

               INT. JAIL - NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT

               The cell door being unlocked. CAMERA PULLS BACK. A dozen 
               men, including those we have seen before and several others, 
               start gathering around Thomas as he comes out.

                                     HANNEGAN
                         You all right, Charlie?

               Grim, angry, Thomas gives him a curt look.

                                     THOMAS
                         Let's get to work on these boys --
                              (to Sawyer)
                         You bring me one?

               Sawyer nods, hands him a gun; we see now that several of the 
               men have guns. Hannegan steps in, protesting:

                                     HANNEGAN
                         Now wait a minute, Charlie --

                                     THOMAS
                         What for? You want to wait till 
                         somebody is killed before we take 
                         action?

                              (to Hannegan)
                         I don't go all the way with Charlie, 
                         either, Bill. But we've got to do 
                         what we can to protect ourselves -- 
                         you've got to admit that --

                                     HANNEGAN
                         I admit that -- all I say is two 
                         wrongs never made anything right. If 
                         you start using guns on these boys --

                                     THOMAS
                         Well, I've got a gun and I'm going 
                         to use it -- one end or the other. 
                         Anybody wants to talk some more can 
                         stay here and have an ice cream social 
                         with Tom -- anybody don't can come 
                         with me --

               He starts out. There is a moment's hesitation, then about 
               half the group follows him out the door. The other half hangs 
               back with Hannegan.

                                     THOMAS
                         You find him, bring him to the back 
                         of the store -- we'll meet back there --

               The men nod.

               They watch the others go, then:

                                     HANNEGAN
                              (grim)
                         Well, we'll do what we can... Let's 
                         try and get hold of this boy Johnny, 
                         before Charlie and the others do --

               They exit.

               CHINO IN CELL

               Forgotten in all this, he opens one eye, rises cautiously, 
               tries the cell door. It isn't locked.

               INT. MILDRED'S BEAUTY SALON - NIGHT

               MILDRED

               crying hysterically and fighting off a boy trying to make 
               her dance. Cyclists staggering around wearing hair-dryers, 
               roaring at each other with laughter. Kathie in the b.g. being 
               passed from boy to boy.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Mildred fights free, flings open a side door and careens out 
               into an alley.

                                     CYCLISTS
                         Hey, she got away! Hey, catch Mildred! 
                         Don't let her get away!

               They pile out the door after her, running into each other 
               and into the door jamb, falling down, getting up.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The boy dancing with Kathie lets her go suddenly -- literally 
               dropping her -- to follow the others out the door. She sags.

               KATHIE

               huddled trembling on the floor, on one knee. The radio 
               blaring. She raises her head. She's alone. She rises quickly, 
               hurries past the partition to the front of the shop.

               FRONT ROOM OF SHOP

               Kathie stops in the darkened f.g., hearing cycles start up 
               outside.

                                     AD LIBS (O.S.)
                         Come on, get her! Tallyho, the fox!

               At a sound behind her, she glances back over her shoulder.

               KATHIE'S ANGLE TO REAR OF SHOP

               past the partition, a glimpse of Mildred -- being led back 
               in by two cyclists.

               CLOSE SHOT KATHIE

               horrified, trapped.

               PAST KATHIE TO STREET

               Hearing the last cycle leave, Kathie slips quickly out the 
               door.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               KATHIE

               hurrying along the sidewalk. Suddenly there are shouts behind 
               her.

                                     AD LIBS
                         Hey, there she goes! Hey, this way! 
                         It's the other one -- get her!

               Terrified, uncertain which way to go, Kathie breaks into a 
               run, cutting diagonally across the street.

               MEDIUM FULL SHOT STREET

               A cyclist brings his machine to a sudden stop directly in 
               Kathie's path. She stops, starts the opposite way, the CAMERA 
               PANNING. Another cycle stops, blocking her escape in this 
               direction. She whirls, finding herself completely surrounded 
               as several more cycles are brought up in quick succession, 
               forming a ring around her.

               FEATURING KATHIE

               as the cyclists start closing the ring. She is terrified. 
               Suddenly there is the sound of still another cycle descending 
               on her. She whirls.

               MEDIUM SHOT JOHNNY

               He rides into the shot, stops, looking around the circle at 
               the other cyclists, murderously.

               CLOSE SHOT KATHIE

               just staring at him numbly.

               GROUP SHOT FEATURING JOHNNY

               Poised, he looks from the cyclists to Kathie.

                                     CYCLIST
                              (weakly)
                         Hiya, Johnny.

               His eyes still on Kathie, Johnny nods -- indicating the 
               jumpseat behind him. Kathie hesitates just an instant, then 
               stumbles forward and clambers on behind him. He guns the 
               motor. She grabs him around the shoulders to keep from 
               falling. The other cyclists scatter back out of the way, the 
               CAMERA PANNING to FOLLOW Johnny's cycle off up the street.

               EXT. STREET AND PARK - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny, with Kathie on the back, rides through.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               JOHNNY'S CYCLE

               It roars past on the open highway, Kathie on the back.

               JOHNNY AND KATHIE (PROCESS)

               He is wide-open, staring straight ahead with a glazed 
               intensity. Kathie, torn and whipped by the wind, is holding 
               on -- there's nothing else she can do.

               MEDIUM SHOT (PROCESS)

               Without warning, Johnny gears down, skids around off the 
               pavement.

               KATHIE (PROCESS)

               Startled, confused, by this. Unable to call out as the cycle 
               bounces back onto the pavement. She just hangs on, closes 
               her eyes.

               HIGHWAY THE CAMERA HOLDS

               Johnny roaring away toward town again.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PARK AND STREET - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny rides through with Kathie (as in #315A but opposite 
               direction and slower).

               MEDIUM SHOT

               A secluded spot, large trees, shrubbery. For a moment the 
               scene is empty and quiet, except for motorcycles in the 
               distance. Then Johnny, with Kathie on behind, comes through 
               the bushes, stops. He cuts the motor.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ON KATHIE

               For a moment she sits there, still clinging to Johnny's 
               shoulders, her hair torn by the wind. Then she looks up 
               vacantly, lets her hands slip down, almost caressing the 
               leather jacket, gets off.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Kathie drifts off to one side. She leans for a moment against 
               a tree, then melts down into the shadow at the base. Not 
               until then does Johnny dismount, slowly, kicks down the foot. 
               Something about the cycle annoys him. He gives it intense 
               concentration, stares at it, pokes at it.

               AT TREE

               Kathie is just a figure slumped down in the shadow. Johnny 
               comes over slowly, stands there, his face a mask.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (abruptly)
                         Get up --

               She doesn't move. He reaches down angrily and pulls her up.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT

               She leans back against the tree for support, looks at him 
               emptily, without fear. As he makes a move to grab her:

                                     KATHIE
                              (quietly)
                         Do you have to be back at work 
                         someplace Monday morning?

               He stops, a look of surprise and confusion on his face for 
               an instant. Then:

                                     JOHNNY
                              (intensely)
                         Listen -- nobody's too good for me -- 
                         anybody thinks they're too good for 
                         me makes sure I knock them over 
                         sometime -- I can cut you up, show 
                         you how good you are -- tomorrow I'm 
                         someplace I don't know anything --

                                     KATHIE
                              (simply)
                         Do you want to?

               ANGLE ON JOHNNY

               His face contorts with fury. He looks trapped. His eyes leave 
               her; she reaches out, with a sort of instinctive gesture of 
               tenderness, touches his shoulder.

                                     KATHIE
                         Johnny...

               He flinches sharply, jerks away. Kathie looks down.

                                     KATHIE
                         That's crazy, isn't it? You're afraid 
                         of me... I don't know why, but I'm 
                         not afraid of you now... You're afraid 
                         of me...

               He grabs her with sudden, compulsive violence, forcing her 
               against him roughly, awkwardly, kisses her. There is no 
               resistance. Nothing.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               He releases her just as suddenly, with the same violence. 
               She leans back against the tree again.

                                     KATHIE
                         I'm sorry... I'm sorry I can't fight 
                         back... I'm too tired... That would 
                         be better, wouldn't it? Then you 
                         could hit me.

               He stands there in an impotent rage as she continues.

                                     KATHIE
                         Do you hate me because my father's a 
                         cop? Or do you hate everybody?
                              (pause; he doesn't 
                              answer)
                         Sometimes I hate everybody, too, I 
                         guess... I hate this whole place. I 
                         hate my father... I even hate 
                         myself...

               She leans away from the tree and moves slowly past him, close, 
               continues on a few steps. He stands there rigidly, his back 
               to her. She sinks down to the ground.

                                     KATHIE
                              (out of nowhere)
                         I've never ridden on a motorcycle 
                         before... It's fast... It scared me. 
                         But I forgot everything. It felt 
                         good... Is that what you do?

               He whirls to face her, menacing, shouting:

                                     JOHNNY
                         Stop asking me. I don't like them to 
                         ask me all the time! I don't like 
                         them getting on my back! I feel like 
                         it, I go! Okay? I feel like it, I 
                         stick around, you got ten fathers 
                         all phony cops -- they're going to 
                         work me over or something -- stick 
                         their big fat hands in my face! I 
                         been worked over! Nothing! They don't 
                         scare me!

               A pause. Kathie sinks slowly to the ground.

               LOW ANGLE PAST KATHIE

               resting her chin on her knee; Johnny still stands in the 
               b.g. his head and shoulders out of the frame.

                                     KATHIE
                         He just doesn't know how to be a 
                         cop... He wanted to raise dogs once. 
                         I don't know what he was going to do 
                         with them. Just raise them. He didn't 
                         like to hunt. He shot a rabbit once. 
                         It didn't die right away. He got 
                         sick...

               A slight pause. Johnny lowers himself slowly to the ground 
               where he is, some four feet away, in deep shadow.

                                     KATHIE
                         You know what I used to think about?

               No reply, of course.

                                     KATHIE
                              (continues)
                         I used to think about it a lot after 
                         my mother died... That somebody would 
                         come here, stop at Uncle Frank's for 
                         a cup of coffee and he would like me 
                         right away. He'd take me with him...

               She lifts her head, listens for a moment to the sound of 
               motorcycles somewhere beyond the park.

                                     KATHIE
                         Johnny, you were going to give it to 
                         me... Will you give me that statue 
                         now?

               There is a pause; then Johnny's voice, strange from the dark:

                                     JOHNNY
                         Why?

                                     KATHIE
                              (a vague shrug)
                         I'd like to look at it sometime... 
                         to remember...

                                     JOHNNY
                         What?

                                     KATHIE
                         This. It's crazy... but I saw a movie 
                         once. I forget, anyway a couple of 
                         people. They sat at a place -- like 
                         on a hill. There was a town burning. 
                         And it was all over.

               Another pause.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Where did you want this guy to take 
                         you? This guy had a cup of coffee?

               Kathie is thrown for an instant, then retrieves the thread, 
               smiles wryly.

                                     KATHIE
                         Oh, Wherever he was going...
                              (she sits up; a tremor 
                              runs through her 
                              body)
                         I'm shaky... I wish I was going 
                         someplace... I wish you were going 
                         someplace. We could go together...

               Another tremor runs through her body. She raises her hands 
               to her face. Then suddenly, she cracks, everything catching 
               up with her at once. She rises slightly, throws herself at 
               Johnny, grabbing him around the shoulders, sobbing 
               hysterically.

                                     KATHIE
                         Johnny! Johnny!

               Startled, angry, Johnny fights her off.

                                     KATHIE
                              (hanging on)
                         Johnny!

                                     JOHNNY
                              (furious)
                         Cut it out!

               He tears her violently away, pushes her off, and rises, all 
               in the same motion. She falls at his feet in a heap, sobbing.

               TWO SHOT JOHNNY AND KATHIE

               He stands over her, shouting at her in a crazy mixture of 
               fury and self-torment -- very close to breaking.

                                     JOHNNY
                         What's the matter with you? I didn't 
                         do anything to you. I didn't touch 
                         you! Listen -- What am I supposed to 
                         do? What do you want? Cut it out!

               She gets suddenly to her feet and plunges off through the 
               bushes still sobbing.

               CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY

               frozen there for a moment. Then he whirls back to his cycle, 
               jumps on, starts the motor, goes crashing through the bushes.

               STREET AND PARK - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Kathie comes running out of the park, stumbling and crying, 
               heading diagonally across the street. Johnny rounds the corner 
               in the b.g., after her.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Kathie running and stumbling down the street. Johnny overtakes 
               her, skids to a stop, cutting her off.

               CORNER OF BUILDING

               Art Kleiner, a short length of pipe in his hand, pulls up 
               suddenly as he rounds the corner, looking off. Another man 
               looks over his shoulder.

               KLEINER'S ANGLE

               Kathie tries to dodge around Johnny. He grabs one arm, almost 
               loses his balance on the machine.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Kathie -- listen -- what's the matter 
                         with you? I --

               She swings on him with crazy fury, strikes him solidly across 
               the face.

               ART KLEINER AND MAN

               They react, duck quickly back around the corner.

               TWO SHOT KATHIE AND JOHNNY

               She is staring up at Johnny -- appalled by what she has done. 
               She almost speaks, but can't -- whirling suddenly and racing 
               off. He just sits, his head slightly bowed.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               KATHIE

               hurrying along, close to the buildings, pulls up short at 
               the sound of glass breaking.

               KATHIE'S ANGLE

               Chino and several other cyclists are careening toward her.

               KATHIE

               She is about to cut diagonally across the street when she is 
               stopped again by the sound of a cycle.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               It's Johnny. Overtaking Kathie -- not seeing her in the 
               shadows, he cuts in at the curb just ahead of her, jumps 
               off.

               CHINO AND GROUP

               Chino is very drunk. He has a stick in one hand, a beer bottle 
               in the other. He is wearing -- over his other clothes -- a 
               full dress suit. Johnny hurries to him -- grabs him.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Hey, Chino -- how'd you get out of 
                         the can?

               Chino just leers at him.

                                     CHINO
                         Johnny, I love you! Let's you and me 
                         have a beer -- then I'll knock the 
                         living Christmas out of you --

               He swings ineffectually, almost falls. Johnny holds him.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Listen, Chino -- come on -- let's 
                         get everybody. Let's blow out of 
                         here.
                              (almost pleading)
                         Come on, Chino.

               Chino stares at him a moment, glazed, then raises his stick, 
               shouts:

                                     CHINO
                         Storm the Bastille!

               He almost falls. Johnny lets him go, just stands there as 
               the group careens on. He looks lost.

               KATHIE

               pressed back against the wall until Chino and the others are 
               past. At the same moment she starts for Johnny we hear his 
               motor start -- the machine roaring. She stops -- the cry 
               dying in her throat -- then hurries after him.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny goes perhaps a hundred yards, stops near an 
               intersection.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               He looks off down the side street. Someone shouts down there. 
               We hear someone running. On all sides, the vague, muffled 
               sounds of rioting. He looks confused, uncertain which way to 
               turn. Suddenly -- so quickly that it is upon him before he 
               realizes it -- a sedan comes to a stop, boxing him in at the 
               curb. Thomas and several other men swarm out.

                                     THOMAS
                         This is the one! Get him!

               Taken by surprise, Johnny can neither start the cycle nor 
               dismount fast enough to defend himself.

               KATHIE

               She has stopped, some fifty yards down the street, reacting 
               to this.

               LONG SHOT KATHIE'S ANGLE

               Johnny is quickly overwhelmed and dragged into the car, his 
               cycle left where it fell over at the curb.

               KATHIE

               frozen for a moment -- the sound of the car starting up and 
               skidding around. She whirls and dashes off around the corner.

               EXT. STREET (TOWN HALL) - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               As Kathie reappears, pulls up. A group of men, either locals 
               or cyclists, is moving toward her. She veers aside, runs 
               toward the jail.

               INT. JAIL - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT TOWARD DOOR

               The room is dark, illuminated only by whatever light enters 
               through the windows. We hear Kathie at the door. It opens 
               and she comes in quickly. She bolts the door, stands there 
               getting her breath, looks around.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               The room is empty. Kathie moves into the shot, slumps. Then 
               she looks up to Harry's locker against the wall in shadow. 
               She considers, decides, crosses quickly, starts searching in 
               the locker.

               CLOSE SHOT AT LOCKER

               Kathie's hand comes out with a gun she has found on the top 
               shelf. Harry's hand reaches in and closes on her wrist. She 
               jumps, turns.

               WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING HARRY

               One hand clamped on Kathie's wrist -- in the other an almost 
               empty glass. He is not drunk. He just looks at her -- his 
               expression and his whole manner completely vacant. Kathie 
               stares at him.

                                     KATHIE
                         They've got Johnny, I --

               Harry puts the glass down on the desk, slips the gun from 
               her fingers, turns with it and sits.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Kathie follows, looking down at him.

                                     KATHIE
                         Have you just been sitting here? 
                         Aren't you going to do anything?

                                     HARRY
                         There isn't anything to do, Kathie...

                                     KATHIE
                              (desperately)
                         I've got to help him. They took him -- 
                         in a car -- Mister Thomas and some 
                         mem -- He wasn't doing anything -- 
                         he was trying to stop it -- he was 
                         going to leave --

                                     HARRY
                              (vaguely)
                         How is it at Frank's?

                                     KATHIE
                         A fight started. I don't know -- I 
                         left to look for you. Uncle Frank --

                                     HARRY
                              (an odd smile)
                         Well, business before pleasure...

               He sips his drink. Kathie leans down, trying hard to penetrate 
               his detachment.

                                     KATHIE
                         Dad -- listen -- they've gone crazy. 
                         Everybody -- They got Johnny. You've 
                         got to help him. They're going to -- 
                         I don't know -- beat him up or 
                         something --

               He looks at her quickly, then away. Some of this is getting 
               to him. He would like to ignore it.

                                     HARRY
                         I tried to talk to him...

               He rises abruptly, turns his back, replacing the gun in the 
               locker.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT KATHIE AND HARRY

               Kathie presses him.

                                     KATHIE
                         Don't you even care? Whatever he's 
                         done -- it's still wrong --

               When Harry turns back to face her, he has a pint bottle of 
               whiskey in his hand. More important -- his poise has cracked. 
               He is suddenly tense, fighting himself, and his voice rises 
               slightly.

                                     HARRY
                         It's all wrong! Everybody's wrong! I 
                         saw it coming! What could I do? In a 
                         way, they brought it on themselves! 
                         Charlie Thomas? He's a bully! He was 
                         a bully in the second grade... What 
                         am I supposed to do -- shoot somebody?

               ANOTHER ANGLE KATHIE AND HARRY

               There is a pause. Kathie looks at her father bitterly, turns 
               her back.

                                     KATHIE
                         I don't know...

               He looks at her back, uncomfortable, glances at the locker 
               where the gun is, at the glass on the desk waiting for the 
               whiskey. He makes his decision. As he quickly pours himself 
               a drink:

                                     KATHIE
                         I don't know. Just nothing, I guess... 
                         You're worse than any of them...

               Harry's face works; he stares at the drink in his hand.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. STOCKROOM HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               FEATURING Ben, the garage man. He is installed comfortably 
               on a nail bin, looking off as he sips from a half-pint bottle 
               of whisky. On the wall behind him are farm tools and various 
               other items of hardware; rope, pipe, lanterns, etc., hanging 
               overhead, suspended from the low rafters, casting a pattern 
               of shadows. A blow is struck o.s.

                                     BEN
                              (getting off the bin)
                         Hold on there, save a piece of that 
                         for me --

               The CAMERA PANS WITH him as he crowds up to take his turn. 
               Johnny himself is party masked by Thomas, who has just hit 
               him.

               ANGLE FEATURING JOHNNY

               He has taken the blow with cynical arrogance.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Come on, what's the matter with you 
                         farmers? My old man was sick all the 
                         time, he clopped me harder than that --

               Ben starts to swing on Johnny. Hannegan grabs his arm.

                                     HANNEGAN
                         Ben, Charlie -- let me talk to him --

               Thomas pushes Hannegan angrily aside.

                                     THOMAS
                         Bill, I warned you --

               The two groups are poised for an instant. In that instant a 
               shot explodes, loud in the low-ceilinged room. The men jump, 
               whirling toward the rear of the stock room -- a lantern 
               crashing down from above, not far from Johnny's feet.

               PAST JOHNNY TO REAR DOOR

               Johnny has half-risen in the chair. The men who were grouped 
               around him have jumped back. Harry has burst through the 
               alley door, brandishing his gun.

                                     HARRY
                         Everybody get back -- away from that 
                         boy --

               JOHNNY

               He is staring at Harry, incredulously -- poised to leave the 
               chair.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Hannegan moves toward Harry. Misunderstanding, Harry pushes 
               him aside. Thomas plants himself between Harry and Johnny.

                                     THOMAS
                         This has got nothing to do with you, 
                         Harry -- we've got a little job that 
                         has to be done --

                                     HARRY
                         Come on, son --

               JOHNNY

               Poised, he looks past Harry, reacts.

               JOHNNY'S ANGLE

               Past Harry to Kathie standing in the alley door. Ben moves 
               in, insolent.

                                     BEN
                              (to Harry)
                         We're doing something should have 
                         been done a long time ago -- pounding 
                         a little respect for law and authority 
                         into this guy's thick skull --

                                     HANNEGAN
                         You won't do it that way --

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Harry looks at Hannegan, surprised.

                                     THOMAS
                         You got a better way -- either of 
                         you -- you had a long time to try 
                         it. This way, we make good and sure 
                         he don't try to pull anything like 
                         this right away soon --

               Harry gives him a glassy look, starts crowding past, gesturing 
               with the gun.

                                     HARRY
                         Come on, fellow --

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               It looks like an impasse. Sawyer moves to Harry.

                                     SAWYER
                              (patronizing)
                         All right, Harry... Let's take it 
                         easy. We're all old friends here, 
                         Harry... Let's keep calm -- talk 
                         this over --

               Harry turns his body slightly, about to reply; at the same 
               moment, Kathie screams:

                                     KATHIE'S VOICE
                         Dad!

               Before Harry can turn, one of the men who has gotten around 
               behind, jumps him, grabbing his arm to get at the gun. It 
               fires into the ceiling. Thomas tackles him low. Rushed from 
               all directions he goes down.

               ANOTHER ANGLE FIGHT

               The chair Johnny was sitting on is empty in the f. g. Stepping 
               back out of the scramble for an instant, Thomas reacts.

                                     THOMAS
                              (shouting furiously)
                         The boy got away -- get him!

               Several men look up, leave Harry to the others, starting 
               after Johnny. Hannegan throws himself in their path.

               KATHIE

               Pressed against the wall as Johnny comes by. She instinctively 
               reaches out to him. He sees her, hesitates just a fraction 
               of a second -- plunges on and out into the alley.

               EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Five or six men come out, stumbling up the dark alley after 
               Johnny.

               JOHNNY

               Momentarily confused, tired, he stops, uncertain which way 
               to go. Then he dives aside.

               FULL SHOT

               Having lost the trail, the men are milling around, muttering, 
               calling to each other:

                                     VOICE
                         Hey, Ben -- you see which way he 
                         went?

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               FULL SHOT

               Johnny runs through and off into the darkness, just a figure.

               EXT. STREET AND PARK

               LOW ANGLE

               Johnny's cycle lying on its side where he abandoned it, in 
               the f.g. Johnny comes into the b.g., stops, looking around, 
               very tired.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               He leans back against a tree. Very suddenly, he breaks 
               completely -- just goes to pieces, trembling convulsively, 
               tears streaming down his face.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               There is a beat before Johnny pushes himself away from the 
               tree with his shoulders, with great effort, crosses to the 
               cycle. He opens one saddlebag, takes out his Trophy, puts it 
               back. Then he rights the machine, kicks the starter. The 
               second time it catches. He rides off, the CAMERA PANNING and 
               HOLDING as he disappears around a corner.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               AT CORNER

               The two children on bicycles race around the corner, colliding 
               with Jimmy. He stares at them, recovers, then:

                                     JIMMY
                         You children seen Kathie Bleeker?

               They shake their heads. Jimmy starts on, stops, realizing 
               something is wrong here.

                                     JIMMY
                              (sternly)
                         What are you doing out, anyway? Why 
                         aren't you in bed?... I'll take you 
                         home --

               As he moves toward the children, they quickly retreat.

               EXT. INTERSECTION - NIGHT

               FULL SHOT HIGH ANGLE

               Johnny rides into the center of the intersection, pauses. He 
               turns one way, stops. A group of men are approaching quickly 
               He reverses, starts the other way. Two figures appear suddenly 
               in front of him. He stops again, looks back. The men jump 
               back into the shadows.

               TWO MEN AGAINST BUILDING

               The men are Art Kleiner and Bleeker.

                                     KLEINER
                         That's him -- that's the one I saw 
                         after Kathie ---

               Bleeker steps grimly forward, raising some sort of a weapon.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               He looks back. We hear the group of men running, closer. He 
               has to go forward past Bleeker and Kleiner. He throws the 
               cycle in gear.

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               GROUP OF MEN

               One of them emerges from the pack, stops, throwing a tire-
               iron like a boomerang.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT LOW ANGLE

               Johnny is about opposite Bleeker and Kleiner when it happen 
               It is impossible to see whether the tire-iron hits Johnny or 
               the cycle. But we see the result: the cycle goes out of 
               control, veering crazily for an instant -- then Johnny goes 
               off; the machine bucks, jumps forward, careens toward camera 
               under its own power.

               THE RIDERLESS CYCLE

               It wobbles, continues on, straight for the camera.

               SIDEWALK AROUND CORNER

               The three children with Jimmy in pursuit -- following them 
               around the corner. They ride into the path of Johnny's 
               machine. We hear the sound of the impact, the screams of the 
               children.

               MEDIUM SHOT JOHNNY

               thrown clear, onto the sidewalk, where he lies motionless. 
               o.s., we hear people yelling, running in from various 
               directions.

               SEVERAL QUICK CUTS

               Townspeople and cyclists running toward the scene.

               CLOSE SHOT TIRE-IRON

               lying in street. CAMERA PULLS BACK. Kleiner starts to pick 
               it up.

                                     BLEEKER
                              (pulling him back)
                         No, Art... Stay out of this --

               AT CORNER

               The small crowd that has already collected masks the scene. 
               Several people come pushing out, carrying the children, 
               hysterical but unhurt.

               LOW ANGLE PAST JOHNNY

               TOWARD scene of accident. He stirs, gets slowly to his feet 
               He starts forward as if to retrieve his cycle.

               MEDIUM SHOT CROWD

               People pressing up to look down.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Old Jimmy from Bleeker's --

               JOHNNY

               He stops suddenly in a CLOSE SHOT, staring off, stunned and 
               dazed. His mouth works.

               REVERSE FROM CROWD TO JOHNNY

               who is still standing there, weaving slightly.

                                     MAN
                         I just come out of Wilson's -- I saw 
                         one of these guys let go a cycle and 
                         head it straight for the kids --

               He breaks off, pointing toward Johnny in the b.g.

                                     MAN
                         There he is! That's him!

               Three or four of the men start for Johnny.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               He takes just one step back, stands there. As the men grab 
               him:

                                     JOHNNY
                              (bewildered, dazed)
                         What happened?

               Simultaneously, o.s., we hear the whine of sirens.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               FULL SHOT

               Several squad cars turn into the street, their sirens whining, 
               the CAMERA PANNING with them.

               CLOSE PAN SHOT

               following lead car, the Sheriff's insignia on the door.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               As the last car passes, Harry and Kathie step off the curb, 
               follow the cars up the street.

               EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT

               MEDIUM SHOT

               A group of deputies has dived in, pulling off the men who 
               went for Johnny. Two deputies grab Johnny's arms. In a sudden 
               crazy kind of panic, he fights free, whirls and stumbles 
               back toward the spot where he was thrown.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The deputies are right after him, surrounding him. He thrusts 
               them away, searching in the street. Then suddenly he stops, 
               picks up something from the gutter.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               It's the trophy. He stares at it. Several men grab him 
               quickly. He makes no effort to resist. They start off with 
               him, through the crowd.

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               FEATURING SINGER, THE SHERIFF

               standing by his car. He is a big, businesslike man, extremely 
               competent. He turns now as he sees Harry come up.

                                     SINGER
                         How did this get started, anyway?

               Harry just wets his lips. Before he can answer, Thomas barges 
               up, grabs Singer's arm.

                                     THOMAS
                              (hotly)
                         Sheriff, we had this boy, we had the 
                         whole thing stopped --
                              (indicating Harry)
                         -- when he stuck his nose in and --

                                     HANNEGAN
                              (stepping in)
                         There's a little more to it than 
                         that --

               Singer pushes them both back.

                                     SINGER
                         All right. All right. We'll find out 
                         what happened.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               as Singer turns to address a couple of his deputies.

                                     SINGER
                         Round up everybody on a sickle -- 
                         all the witnesses you can --

               They nod, start off into the crowd. Another deputy steps 
               quickly to his side.

                                     DEPUTY
                              (matter-of-fact)
                         Old man's dead. Dishwasher in a place 
                         up the street --

               Johnny, being brought through the scene by the deputies, 
               pulls up short.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               holding back for an instant as the man try to pull him on. 
               There is a look of blank fear on his face.

                                     THOMAS' VOICE
                         That makes it a manslaughter charge, 
                         doesn't it, Sheriff?

                                     SINGER'S VOICE
                         We'll see, we'll see. Let's get this 
                         off the street, Harry, and sort it 
                         out --

               The deputies have already pulled Johnny on.

               KATHIE

               following Johnny a moment with her eyes; then she glances at 
               her father.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Harry and Singer follow the men with Johnny. The CAMERA PAN 
               and HOLDS, FRAMING the Town Hall in the b.g. as the whole 
               group flows in that direction.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STREET AND TOWN HALL - EARLY MORNING

               FULL SHOT

               From the scene of the accident, across the crowd to Town 
               Hall. In the pale, half-light of very early morning, people 
               are standing around in silent little groups.

               In contrast to everything that has gone before, there is an 
               absolute, expectant hush.

               THE FACES OF THE CROWD

               Some of these are faces we have seen and known earlier. The 
               expressions are weary, grim. These are the faces of people 
               who have been through a shocking, sobering experience.

               THE CYCLISTS

               They are miserable looking lot now -- slumped on the ground, 
               sprawled in various attitudes near the Town Hall steps. Their 
               air of braggadocio has slumped completely. Under the eyes of 
               the several deputies standing over them with riot guns, they 
               look much younger, very un-dangerous.

               INT. TOWN HALL - COUNCIL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               in a chair, staring bleakly at nothing. He looks up, down 
               again.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               to include Singer. The big man is standing, looking down at 
               him with weary distaste. In the b.g., against the wall, sits 
               anonymous deputy with a notebook, just part of the room.

                                     SINGER
                              (abruptly; hard)
                         Well, you've done it. Real good job. 
                         Got yourself some real big trouble. 
                         Shows what you can do if you work at 
                         it long enough --

               Johnny attempts a cynical smirk that doesn't quite come off; 
               the fear shows through.

                                     SINGER
                              (continuing 
                              sarcastically)
                         All right, you're a big important 
                         fellow now. Everybody's listening. 
                         What do you want to say?

               No answer.

                                     SINGER
                              (continuing)
                         You know what you're going to get 
                         for manslaughter -- forgetting the 
                         count on the girl?

               Johnny flares suddenly, in desperate imitation of his previous 
               arrogance.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Somebody jumpy's yelling they got 
                         hurt, where is she? What's the beef?

               A door opens o.s. Singer snaps his head.

               PAST JOHNNY AND SINGER

               Harry has stepped through the door in the b.g., closed it 
               behind him. He stands there, drooping wearily in the shadows.

                                     HARRY
                              (very flat)
                         I got hold of my daughter, Stu... 
                         She's out here. She went home, and 
                         came back again...

               Singer turns toward him. The deputy with the notebook rises 
               and follows him like a shadow.

               JOHNNY

               watching Singer go, his expression wavering from cynical 
               contempt to fear. Another deputy appears from nowhere and 
               stands near him.

               INT. ADJOINING ROOM

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Kathie is standing forlornly in the middle of this smaller 
               room. Harry has re-entered and moved to her side.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Singer and his deputy follow Harry in, there is a sudden 
               commotion at another door in the b.g. Bleeker appears, trying 
               to bluster his way past a deputy there.

                                     BLEEKER
                         This girl's my niece! I have a right 
                         to be with her! There's no telling 
                         where her father --

               He sees Harry and stops. Singer nods to the deputy barring 
               his entrance.

                                     SINGER
                         All right. But sit down and be quiet. 
                         I want to wind this up and get to 
                         bed.

               Bleeker slips under the deputy's arm and sinks into a chair 
               near the door, avoiding Harry's eyes.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Singer indicates a chair for Kathie. As she sits 
               apprehensively, not sure what is going to be expected of 
               her, the Sheriff pulls up a chair for himself, takes a big 
               breath.

                                     SINGER
                              (gently)
                         All right, can you tell me about 
                         this now?

               Kathie hesitates, appeals to Harry with her eyes.

                                     HARRY
                         Just what you told me, Kathie...

                                     SINGER
                              (seeing Kathie's 
                              confusion)
                         It's all right if you want to wait, 
                         but the sooner I get the facts the 
                         better... Where did he take you?

                                     KATHIE
                         I don't know. We just rode, real 
                         fast...

                                     SINGER
                              (nodding)
                         It doesn't matter... Then he attacked 
                         you, or tried to...

               Kathie shakes her head. Not immediately understanding, Singer 
               stares at her.

                                     KATHIE
                         We just talked.

               ANGLE SHOT FEATURING BLEEKER

               He is on his feet.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Kathie -- don't be foolish. Don't 
                         try to protect this boy. He deserves 
                         everything he gets...

                                     SINGER
                              (sharply)
                         Sit down!

               As Singer turns back to Kathie, she is suddenly on her feet, 
               too, breaking under the strain.

                                     KATHIE
                         I'm not trying to protect anybody! I 
                         don't even know what you're talking 
                         about! You're all crazy! Leave him 
                         alone!

                                     BLEEKER
                         Kathie!

                                     HARRY
                         Sit down, Frank, and shut up!

               Startled, Bleeker sits.

               ANOTHER ANGLE SHOT

               A pause. A little confused, Singer turns to Kathie again. 
               She has started to cry.

                                     SINGER
                         All right... Take your time. How did 
                         you happen to go for a ride with 
                         him?

                                     KATHIE
                              (after a moment)
                         I was looking for Dad... A lot of 
                         them on motorcycles were after me...

               ANGLE SHOT FEATURING KATHIE

               She looks up, not crying now, remembering her terror.

                                     KATHIE
                         Johnny stopped them. I just got on 
                         with him. It was all I could do...

               ANOTHER ANGLE SHOT SINGER

               He glances thoughtfully from Kathie to Harry, who is just 
               standing there at her shoulder, studying his hands.

               KATHIE

               as she continues.

                                     KATHIE
                         I was afraid at first. Then I wasn't. 
                         We just rode... I don't remember. I 
                         know why he likes to go fast...
                              (bringing herself 
                              back)
                         He brought me back. We stopped in 
                         the park awhile... and talked, that's 
                         all.

               Bleeker has risen again, despite himself, moved into the 
               scene. Singer doesn't stop him this time.

                                     BLEEKER
                         Kathie, Art saw you struggling with 
                         him -- crying -- trying to get away 
                         from him -- weren't you?

               She shakes her head.

                                     KATHIE
                              (softly)
                         No... I was just trying to get away, 
                         not from him...

               Bleeker looks at her a moment, as if trying to understand, 
               moves back out of the scene.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Singer looks thoughtfully from Kathie to Harry and back again.

                                     SINGER
                              (quietly)
                         You in love with him, Kathie?

                                     KATHIE
                              (simply; no hesitation)
                         No... I never could be... He's wrong -- 
                         about everything... I'm sorry for 
                         him.

                                     SINGER
                         Why?
                              (as she doesn't answer)
                         You liked the old man, Jimmy?... 
                         Johnny killed him -- with a sickle, 
                         instead of a gun, that's all.

                                     KATHIE
                              (erupting)
                         They beat him! I saw them beat him! 
                         And he wasn't doing anything! Not 
                         then! He was trying to stop the 
                         others! He was trying to do what I 
                         wanted him to do!

                                     SINGER
                         That's fine. But Jimmy's still dead. 
                         And Johnny's going to jail for that, 
                         for a long time.

               ANOTHER ANGLE PAST KATHIE

               She looks down, covers her face with her hands. In the b.g., 
               the chair Bleeker was sitting in is empty.

               EXT. TOWN HALL - EARLY MORNING

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Bleeker comes pushing his way up the steps with a very 
               frightened Art Kleiner in tow.

                                     BLEEKER
                              (to deputies; with 
                              authority)
                         The Sheriff wants to see this man...

               The deputies let him through.

               INT. COUNCIL ROOM

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny's trophy is in the f.g. on the desk, scattered with 
               papers. In the b.g. Johnny himself is still sitting more or 
               less in the same attitude of miserable dejection. The deputy 
               moves around. The floor boards squeak. The voices from the 
               other room are suddenly louder, more excited, doors are being 
               hurriedly opened and closed.

               THE DEPUTY

               He looks up, listens. Johnny doesn't move.

               INT. ADJOINING ROOM

                                     GROUP
                         Singer, Harry, Kathie, Bleeker, Art 
                         Kleiner, and several deputies. 
                         Everybody is trying to talk at once.

                                     SINGER
                              (shouting over them)
                         All right! All right!
                              (as they stop; to 
                              Kleiner)
                         You saw this man, whoever he was, 
                         come out of the alley, and throw 
                         something?

               Kleiner nods, frightened.

                                     SINGER
                         What was the boy doing?

               As Kleiner looks vague.

                                     SINGER
                         Okay, nothing... You don't know who 
                         this man was?

                                     KLEINER
                         No, sir.

                                     SINGER
                         What were you doing there?

                                     KLEINER
                              (with an uneasy look 
                              at Bleeker)
                         We were after him.

                                     BLEEKER
                              (a quick, guilty look 
                              at Kathie)
                         We had the wrong idea about... what 
                         had happened.

               A pause, Singer frowns.

                                     SINGER
                         Kathie...

               He puts his arm around her shoulder, starts leading her out. 
               She goes, puzzled.

               INT. CORRIDOR - TOWN HALL

               MEDIUM SHOT

               as Singer brings Kathie out into the semi-dark corridor. In 
               the b.g., vaguely, we are aware of a group of local citizens, 
               held back by one of Singer's men. Slowly, his arm still around 
               Kathie, Singer starts walking with her. Up the corridor, 
               then back again, pausing now and then, their footsteps hollow 
               on the marble floor.

                                     SINGER
                              (quietly serious)
                         Kathie... I want your advice... This 
                         has been a pretty mixed up business 
                         here... You know a little, I guess, 
                         about what it means to be a 
                         policeman...
                              (he pauses thoughtfully)
                         Well, I think you were a little closer 
                         to this boy tonight than anybody 
                         else... Maybe a lot closer than 
                         anybody has ever gotten to him. You're 
                         a decent girl... what do you think?

               She raises her eyes, looks at Singer. He goes on:

                                     SINGER
                         I mean, what happens to him now. He 
                         pulled a lot of rough stuff here -- 
                         anyway his gang did. And I can hold 
                         him. I will, too, if I decide he's 
                         too far gone -- just to see he doesn't 
                         pull it again, someplace else... But 
                         I've got a feeling he never met a 
                         girl like you before... and he may 
                         have learned something. If he has, 
                         there's a chance of saving him, if 
                         he's treated right... What do you 
                         think?

               Kathie looks up again, hesitates before answering -- moved 
               and troubled.

               EXT. TOWN HALL

               THE CYCLISTS

               A sudden, nervous restlessness sweeps through the group. 
               Several of them rise from the ground. Alert, the deputies 
               straighten up, ready.

               INT. COUNCIL ROOM

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               Lost in his own miserable reverie, he is unaware that Singer 
               has entered and doesn't react until the Sheriff is standing 
               over him. Then he pulls back, half raises his arm as if to 
               ward off a blow.

               TWO SHOT

               Singer just stands there a moment looking at him. Then he 
               turns back to the desk and picks up a driver's license from 
               beside the trophy.

                                     SINGER
                         Johnny Donato...
                              (after a pause)
                         You ever had any friends, Johnny?

               Johnny reacts cautiously; what gives here?

                                     SINGER
                         Well, you picked up a few around 
                         here tonight. Strange as it may sound. 
                         Not many, but a couple. They've got 
                         you off the hook a little.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Johnny blinks. His face works. He picks a spot on the floor 
               and stares at that. In the b.g. is the door to the adjoining 
               room. Singer has left it open. And now Kathie appears there. 
               Harry and Bleeker move up behind her. If Johnny hears them, 
               he doesn't turn his head.

                                     SINGER
                         Now, look, get this straight. I'm 
                         not soft. And I may be making a big 
                         mistake. Whatever your boys think of 
                         you, you're no hero to me. But you 
                         didn't kill anybody. You didn't 
                         actually hurt anybody. I'm going to 
                         take a big chance and put you on 
                         your way.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               His careful expression collapses and is replaced by a mixture 
               of fear and confusion. His eyes stray ever so slightly toward 
               Kathie, standing just inside the door.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Singer addresses one of the deputies.

                                     SINGER
                         Get that other bunch of goons loaded 
                         up --

               The deputy nods, exits, as Singer steps to Johnny, hands him 
               his driver's license.

                                     SINGER
                         There'll be some straightening out 
                         to do. You'll get a summons for an 
                         inquest.
                              (very hard)
                         And you'd better show up for it, or 
                         else.

               Johnny stares at the license.

                                     SINGER
                              (nodding to the trophy)
                         Is that yours?

               Johnny starts guiltily, glances at the trophy, then toward 
               Kathie. He hesitates an instant, then quickly picks up the 
               trophy and puts it carelessly under his arm.

                                     SINGER
                              (to deputies)
                         Put him on the road.

               Johnny starts out between two deputies.

                                     SINGER
                              (nodding to Kathie 
                              and others)
                         Haven't you got something to say to 
                         these people?

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny stops, meets Kathie's eyes for a moment, then has to 
               look away, just stands there stubbornly.

                                     SINGER
                              (angrily)
                         Oh, tough boy. What's the matter 
                         with you? You been beat over the 
                         head so much you don't know when 
                         somebody gives you a break? Nobody 
                         ever taught you any way to say thank 
                         you?

               Johnny looks as if he would like to say something, but nothing 
               comes out. Singer waves him off, and he continues on out 
               with the deputies, past Kathie, Harry and Bleeker.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Singer turns wearily, scoops up his papers from the desk and 
               follows.

               EXT. TOWN HALL - EARLY MORNING

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Several deputies come out, herding a bunch of cyclists down 
               the steps. Most of them are from Chino's group, the extremists 
               who have participated in the early scenes, caused actual 
               damage, etc... There is a slight murmur from the crowd as 
               they are hurried toward the Sheriff's cars.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As the rest of the cyclists, mostly Johnny's group, look up, 
               react. Sensing the end, some of them rise. One of them glances 
               back toward the steps of the Town Hall.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny appears with the two deputies, who turn him loose at 
               the head of the steps. He comes on down. Gringo steps out to 
               meet him.

                                     GRINGO
                         Hey, Johnny, you sprung?

               Johnny looks at him as if he had never seen him before, 
               glances off.

               JOHNNY'S ANGLE

               The other cyclists being herded into cars, their cycles being 
               loaded onto a truck.

               BACK TO JOHNNY

               As he looks around vaguely.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (emptily; to nobody)
                         Where's Chino? What happened to Chino?

                                     DEXTRO
                              (very flat)
                         They said he was dragging, real 
                         stinko. Real Brodie. They found some 
                         doctor was trying to stick his brains 
                         back in...

               Johnny blinks, looking around.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Where's my sickle?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Singer appears on the steps, addressing the cyclists who are 
               left.

                                     SINGER
                              (hard; forceful)
                         Okay, the rest of you crumbs, let's 
                         get going. I want you out of here -- 
                         right away. And don't get the idea 
                         you're getting away with anything, 
                         because you aren't. I don't think 
                         you're funny, or cute, or anything 
                         like that. I think you're stupid. 
                         I'd lock the whole bunch of you up, 
                         except I don't want to get the jail 
                         dirty. Any of you stick your nose in 
                         this county again without a good 
                         reason -- and the right reason -- 
                         I'll take your sickles away from you 
                         for a year.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

               reacting, standing there in a sort of a daze, glances at the 
               trophy under his arm. One of the others nudges him and he 
               moves with the group toward the cycles.

               TOWARD STEPS

               Kathie, Harry, Bleeker and Kleiner start down the steps. 
               Kathie looks up at the sound of the cycles starting, 
               exploding. Harry takes her hand.

               ANGLE FEATURING JOHNNY

               The deputies standing by with riot guns supervising the 
               departure.

               Johnny looks back once, guns his machine -- and looks off, 
               the others roaring out behind him. The CAMERA PANS TO FRAME 
               the troop until it disappears and the noise of the motors 
               dies away.

               MEDIUM SHOT BLEEKER, KATHIE, HARRY

               They stand there a moment. It is suddenly quiet.

                                     BLEEKER
                              (strangely embarrassed)
                         I'll go ahead and put on some 
                         coffee...

               He starts off.

               HARRY AND KATHIE

               With a sudden, impulsive movement, she goes into her father's 
               arms. He holds her tight. She is shaking.

                                                         QUICK DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BLEEKER'S CAFE - EARLY MORNING

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Bleeker is behind the counter, staring abstractedly at the 
               water burbling in the silex. The door opens o.s.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Kathie and Harry come in slowly, moving toward the counter. 
               The place is a wreck.

                                     BLEEKER
                         What a mess ---
                              (a flash of irritation)
                         Where's Jimmy --

               He catches himself, frowns. The others sit at the counter, 
               silently, waiting for the coffee. Harry takes a deep, audible 
               breath. Kathie takes his hand. Bleeker puts four cups on the 
               counter. From the street there is sudden popping and 
               exploding. The whole group tenses, turns to look.

               THROUGH WINDOW

               It's Art Kleiner's car passing. It goes by.

               GROUP AT COUNTER

               They turn back, relax. Bleeker starts pouring coffee. Harry 
               takes his and cups it in his hands. Reaching for the sugar, 
               Kathie looks up and sees that Bleeker is staring past her 
               toward the door.

               KATHIE'S ANGLE

               Johnny is standing framed in the door.

               KATHIE

               She catches her breath.

               JOHNNY

               Slowly, with a suggestion of the insolent swagger of his 
               first entrance, he comes on in, swinging the trophy limply 
               at his side. He stops, midway, unwilling to meet their eyes.

               SHOT AT COUNTER

               They exchange looks. Harry starts to get up. Kathie stops 
               him.

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny saunters over, still avoiding their eyes, takes a 
               seat around the corner by himself, places the trophy carefully 
               beside him.

                                     JOHNNY
                              (not looking up)
                         Got any coffee?

               Bleeker nods, turns, fills the cup, puts it before Johnny. 
               Johnny pushes forward a coin.

                                     BLEEKER
                         That's all right.

               PAST KATHIE AND HARRY TO JOHNNY

               who leaves the coin there, takes two scalding swallows of 
               coffee.

               HARRY AND KATHIE

               Moved, Kathie lowers her eyes, then looks up again quickly, 
               instinctively alarmed at the sound of a car outside.

               ANGLE PAST GROUP TO STREET

               It's one of the Sheriff's cars. Someone is starting to get 
               out. With a quick look at Johnny, Harry rises and starts for 
               the door.

               JOHNNY

               staring rigidly into the coffee cup.

               EXT. BLEEKER'S CAFE - EARLY MORNING

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Two deputies, followed by Thomas and Wilson, have gotten 
               out. Harry arrives just in time to intercept them.

                                     DEPUTY
                         That boy in there?

                                     THOMAS
                              (angry)
                         We saw him turn back --

                                     HARRY
                         Give him a couple of minutes. He's 
                         got something he wants to say before 
                         he leaves --

                                     WILSON
                         A couple of minutes is all that boy 
                         needs to start a whole new riot --

                                     HARRY
                              (appealing to the 
                              deputies)
                         Give him a couple of minutes -- he'll 
                         be right out.

               INT. BLEEKER'S CAFE - EARLY MORNING

               ANGLE FEATURING JOHNNY

               He is still just sitting there, obviously struggling with 
               something. Bleeker moves to him, stands there awkwardly.

                                     BLEEKER
                         How you fixed? You got any change in 
                         your pocket. If...

               He stalls. Johnny sits there a moment longer, downs one more 
               swig of coffee and rises, all in the same motion, picking up -
               his trophy. He takes about three steps with it, stops, turns 
               back. Never meeting Kathie's eyes, he returns and places it 
               carefully on the counter where he was sitting. Then turns 
               and stalks out. Bleeker looks from the trophy to Kathie. She 
               is looking into space. The door slams.

               EXT. BLEEKER'S CAFE - EARLY MORNING

               MEDIUM SHOT

               Johnny stops, looks from Harry to the deputies to the other 
               men, then back to Harry. He steps toward Harry, jamming a 
               cigarette into his mouth.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Got a match?

               Harry nods, fumbles out a box of matches, strikes one.

               FEATURING HARRY AND JOHNNY

               Johnny reaches out, takes Harry's cupped hands, brings them 
               close, lights his cigarette, brushes past the other men to 
               the cycle, kicks the starter, and roars off up the street.

               EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING ON JOHNNY

               A dog dashes out into the street ahead of the cycle. Johnny 
               swerves, brakes hard to avoid hitting it, stalls.

               CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY

               He swears under his breath, kicks the starter viciously; he 
               kicks it again and it catches -- the machine leaping forward 
               again. The CAMERA PANS, FRAMING him as he rides off up the 
               street, disappears into the darkness beyond.

               As the sound of the cycle dies away,

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
