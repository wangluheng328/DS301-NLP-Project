The year is 1916.
In St. Petersburg, Russia, Tsar Nicholas II is throwing a grand ball to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Romanov rule, while his mother, Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna, gives her favorite granddaughter, 8-year-old Grand Duchess named Anastasia, a music box and a necklace reading "Together in Paris" which serves as its key.
The ball is interrupted by the arrival of the villainous undead corpse Grigori Rasputin, a monk once trusted by the Russian Imperial Family, having since been cast out by Nicholas as a "traitor".
He enacts his revenge through a demonic green reliquary, summoning a curse that sparks the Russian Revolution.
Anastasia is reunited with her grandmother ten years later with the help of two con men, Dimitri and Vladmir.
Then, just as all obstacles and plot complications are out of the way of romance, the final showdown with Rasputin occurs.
