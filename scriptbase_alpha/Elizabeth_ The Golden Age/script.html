<b>                 ELIZABETH: THE GOLDEN AGE
</b>



                        Written by

             William Nicholson &amp; Michael Hirst
<b>                  
</b>




                                                     5th July 2006
<b>                          
</b>
<b>
</b>    (Dialogue printed in brackets to be translated and spoken
    in Spanish or German as appropriate, and sub-titled.)


<b>    EXT. TITLE SEQUENCE P                                         1
</b>    Painted images of the Elizabethan age -

<b>                         CAPTION
</b>
              A world divided by religious
              hatred.

              The new Protestant faith is
              spreading.

    Bodies burned on a pyre - men writhing under torture - a
    momentary half-recognisable face, gaunt and staring -
<b>    FATHER ROBERT RESTON.
</b>
<b>                        CAPTION
</b>              The most powerful ruler in
              Christendom, Philip of Spain, has
              sworn to return all Europe to the
              Catholic faith.

    Images of rival monarchs Philip and Elizabeth in court
    paintings: stiff, formal, imperious.

<b>                          CAPTION
</b>              Only England stands in his way: a
              weak impoverished nation ruled by
              a woman.

    Finally images of God in judgement, as if speaking to his
    chosen servant.

<b>                          CAPTION
</b>              Philip prepares to obey the will
2             of his God.


<b>    INT. PRIVATE CHAPEL, ESCORIAL PALACE, SPAIN - DAY             2
</b>
    Bn ascetic-looking man dressed in black kneels in a small
    plain chapel, in virtual darkness. PHILIP II, King of Spain
    bows his head low, abasing himself before his God.
<b>              T
</b><b>    S/I CAPTION:
</b>
               scorial Palace, Spain, 1585.

    Now, slowly, he raises his head. His eyes open, and we see
    there the glow of a new certainty. God has spoken to him.

<b>                         PHILIP
</b>              (I hear. I obey. My Lord and my
<b>1
</b>              God.)
<b>
</b>                                          May 1 Blue Draft--p.2


<b>    INT. HALLWAY/SALON, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY
</b><b>3                                                                 3
</b>    Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out
    into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the
    chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. On
    his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his
    mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as
    he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS
    fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest
    salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered;
    among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he
    enters, all kneel.

    His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling,
    heads bowed before him. His gaze falls on one who wears the
    plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the
    face we glimpsed in the opening montage. He speaks to all.

<b>                        PHILIP
</b>              (God has made his will known to
              me. The time for our great
              enterprise has come.)

    The Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but
    disciplined satisfaction. He murmurs softly to himself.

<b>                        RESTON
</b>              At last.

    Cathedral bells ring out. The cheers of a crowd are heard
    through the open windows.

    The king passes out onto the salon's first-floor balcony.


<b>    EXT. BALCONY, ESCORIAL PALACE - DAY
</b><b>4                                                                 4
</b>    Hot sunlight. Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the
    great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and
    the CROWD in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer. The
    Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him.
    Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns
    of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's
    power.

    Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the
    crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's
    eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his
    people's adoration.


<b>    EXT. THAMES - DAY
</b><b>5                                                                 5
</b>    A ripple of light on the water. A blur of approaching
    colour.
<b>
</b>                                   May 1 Blue Draft--p.3
The ROYAL BARGE is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape:
its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful
fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting
bright shards of shining water in the sunlight.
<b>P
</b> eople passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling,
cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out.

Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than
any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something
chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the
Queen.

They are BABINGTON and SAVAGE.

Over this an insistent voice:

<b>                    HOWARD (V.O.)
</b>          Why do you go among the people,
          majesty? I tell you plainly, you
          will be murdered! Every Catholic
          in England is a potential
          assassin!
<b>
</b><b>                                                                       
</b>



<b>                                                                       
</b>



<b>                                    4
</b>

<b>    INT. PRIVY CHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
</b><b>6                                                                 6    
</b>    An agitated group is gathered in this room where the
    business of state is transacted. We catch glimpses of the
    Queen in their midst, preparing to leave, as her ministers
    try to persuade her of the seriousness of the situation:
    SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON, 30s, an ambitious courtier; LORD
    HOWARD, 50s, a weathered old campaigner; and standing back
    from the rest, watching from the side lines, SIR FRANCIS
    WALSINGHAM, the Queen's veteran friend and adviser.     
<b>           
</b><b>                        HATTON
</b>              Be warned by the atrocities in
              France! God-fearing Christians                                                                       
              murdered by Papist cut-throats
              inflamed by hatred of the truth!

</b><b>                        HOWARD
</b>              We know the Catholics take their                         
              orders from Spain. The Spanish                           
              speak openly of Mary Stuart as

baby, smiling, putting out her hand to touch the baby's         
head. The mother bobs a curtsey. The Queen moves on, with

revealing as it passes the handsome smiling face of

Elizabeth signs to the guards to stay calm. She stares at
Raleigh, then she looks down at the cloak. No sign of any
puddles. Bess Throckmorton watches, suppressing a smile.

      her head.

Elizabeth gazes at the natives. She holds out her hand.
Unaware that he's meant to kiss the Queen's hand, Manteo,
takes it and shakes it. A gasp from the watching courtiers.
But Elizabeth accepts the courtesy.

          that they're treated well.

inside suspiciously. It does indeed seem to be filled with
mud.

Raleigh takes out a potato beneath the Ambassador's nose.

out a tobacco leaf. R

Now Don Guerau realises he's being laughed at on all sides.
He draws himself up with angry pride, wrinkling his nose.

          air has become stale. I am

A glare at Raleigh, a bow for the Queen, and Don Guerau
leads his Spaniards out.

With a broad smile, Raleigh gestures forward the third
basket. This one really is full of gold. He takes out a
gold coin and presents it to Elizabeth.

</b>          Gold. You spend it. Very
          satisfying.

Elizabeth examines the fat gold coin, with its image of
Philip of Spain. She tries not to smile.

     Raleigh's eyes fall on Don Guerau, the Spanish Ambassador,
     passing near with his fellow Spaniards and a few English           
     courtiers and ministers, including Hatton. Don Guerau              
     stares at him.                                                     
     The doors to the privy chamber open and the Queen's ladies
     come swishing out in a tight chattering group, Bess beside
     her friend MARGARET.

     They see Raleigh now, and the chatter ceases. The ladies
     come to a stop and curtsey. Raleigh gives a bow, his eyes
     singling out Bess.

     Raleigh. No one pays attention to a figure in the shadows,
     another of Walsingham's men, AGENT 3.

     In a clearing nearby three men sit round a fire. They are
     young Catholic fanatics - Babington, Ramsay, and FRANCIS

     us, watching Savage. At first we don't see who he is.

          leave him behind.

Now the man turns and looks intently at Babington, and we      
see he is Robert Reston; no longer in the clothes of a
priest.

<b>                    RESTON

Babington rises. Reston nods his approval. Babington goes      
off through the trees. Reston and the others follow a
little behind.

to know what's happening. Babington takes the pistol from
his hand.

Savage stares, and suddenly realises what Babington means
to do. Terror overwhelms him.

</b>          No, Tom! Don't kill me! I don't

Now he's blubbering with fear. Babington is shaken by this,
and can't shoot.

Reston begins to pray aloud.

Babington too joins in, now weeping.

     They're listening to a young Austrian make a formal speech
     of love. The AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR stands to one side,

     The ARCHDUKE CHARLES is still a boy: sixteen years old,

     Raleigh enters the Great Hall, trailed by Calley, as the
     dinner gets under way. They join the much larger group who         
     simply stand and watch. Royal meals are in part a spectacle
     for the court. A JESTER moves from group to group, playing
     pranks on the guests.

Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very
well; as the glances of several court ladies show. He
catches Bess's eye and they share a smile.

Calley, listening, rolls his eyes.

Elizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side,
glances towards Raleigh, and sees him flirting with the
court ladies. Then back to the young Archduke, who has
hardly touched his food.

pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at
someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the

The young Archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring
before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply.

               Lost! Imagine it. Day after day,                        
               staring west, the rising sun on                         
               your back, the setting sun in                           
               your eyes, hoping, hoping -                             
     Sir Christopher Hatton enters.

               Go on, Mr Raleigh. You were
               hoping.

     Hatton bows and leaves, frowning.

<b>                         RALEIGH
</b>               At first it's no more than a haze
               on the horizon, the ghost of a
               haze, the pure line corrupted.
               But clouds do that, and storms.
               So you watch, you watch.

     Elizabeth dances with Raleigh. As they dance, his voice
     continues over; and Elizabeth seems to be listening to him.

<b>                         RALEIGH (V.O.)
</b>               Then it's a smudge, a shadow on
               the far water. For a day, for
               another day, the stain slowly
               spreads along the horizon, and
               takes form - until on the third
               day you let yourself believe. You
               dare to whisper the word - land!

     The music ends, and the dance finishes.

     Elizabeth is seated now - it's later in time. Raleigh is
     speaking intently to her, and she is captivated.

     A short silence. Elizabeth is absorbing what he has told
     her.

<b>                         ELIZABETH (V.O.)
</b>               The Queen does not have a private

</b>     Elizabeth is on the throne. The Archduke Charles and his
     entourage face her. The court fills the room. Elizabeth
     makes her formal response to the young Archduke.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               The Queen lives for her people.
               You will therefore forgive me,
               sir, if after much thought and
               prayer I decline your offer of
               marriage.

     The Archduke, barely able to conceal his relief, turns to
     the Austrian ambassador.

<b>                         ARCHDUKE CHARLES
</b>               (Can I go home now?)

     Elizabeth inclines her head, trying not to smile.

<b>                         ELIZABETH
</b>               (Go home, my friend. Don't be in
               a hurry to grow old. Youth is so
               very precious.)

     Elizabeth rises and takes the Archduke's arm as they start
     to leave the chamber. Bess, in her wake, finds an                  
     opportunity to speak softly to Raleigh.

<b>                         BESS
</b>               Well? Are you satisfied with the

<b>                         RALEIGH

               me.

<b>                            ESS
</b>               Then I shall expect some

<b>                          ALEIGH

     Their eyes meet, both aware of the current of mutual
     attraction.

      Bess hurries after the Queen. The Austrian entourage is
      just leaving as the Queen turns.

</b>      Elizabeth and Raleigh walk together around the perimeter
      hallway, dwarfed by vast murals.

<b>                          ELIZABETH

                ocean is an image of eternity, I

                small. Do we discover the New
                World, Mr Raleigh, or does the
                New World discover us?

<b>                          RALEIGH

      She stops and turns to meet Raleigh's eyes. She's not used
      to such direct replies. Bess is watching them.

<b>                          ELIZABETH
</b>                You know, of course, that when I
                like a man, I reward him.

<b>                           ALEIGH

                herself.

      Elizabeth stares. This is a little too close to the truth.

      Horses racing, hoofs pounding over the grass, manes flying -
      Two riders hurtle between the trees, down a woodland ride,
      neck and neck-

      Elizabeth and Raleigh are racing against each other, faces
      glowing, laughing, abandoned to the breakneck speed of the
      moment.

      Raleigh is winning now, first by a head, then by a length.
      At the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk.

<b>                          RALEIGH

      Elizabeth shakes her head, unable to speak.

      Raleigh stops his horse. Elizabeth rides on up to him and         
      then past him. Raleigh secretly spurs his horse. The horse        
      springs forward, ahead of her.

     A man who looks like a shop assistant sits grabbing a quick
     lunch. He's the TORTURER. Nearby on a blood-stained bench
     lies a huddled half-naked figure, trembling uncontrollably.
     It's Francis Throckmorton. He's neither manacled nor
     guarded. His body is so broken it's not necessary.

     Walsingham enters. The torturer jumps to his feet.
     Walsingham goes to Throckmorton. He gazes at him, shaking
     his head. He's getting too old for this dirty business.

<b>                         WALSINGHAM
</b>               Still nothing to tell me, Mr
               Throckmorton?

     Throckmorton struggles to lift his head.

               need names. But if you won't help
               me, perhaps your father will.

     He signs to the torturer. The torturer goes into an
     adjoining cell.

      The torturer and a guard enter, dragging between them the
      broken but living body of OLD THROCKMORTON.

<b>                          THROCKMORTON

      Old Throckmorton looks up, eyes blank with suffering.

      Walsingham comes close to hear. Throckmorton chokes out
      something we don't hear, but the torturer hears, and his
      eyes open wide.

Elizabeth listens, a faraway look in her eyes. She knows
nothing of the planets, but she feels it deep within
herself: her moment of destiny is near.

<b>                    ELIZABETH

     On the floor - a dagger.

     Walsingham raps twice on his desk. The door opens, and
     Agents 4 and 5 enter.

been playing his own game all along.

     passage, bowed down by a sense of failure.

     He directs the light of his lamp through cell bars onto a
     face. The Jesuit. Reston looks back, unafraid.

     Reston doesn't answer. Walsingham gazes at him a moment
     longer. Then he moves the lamp along. There, shackled and
     white-faced, sit Babington and Ramsay. Walsingham studies
     their faces.

     Walsingham carries his lamp down the passage and shines it
     into the next cell. Here lies a man in chains, huddled on
     the floor. He looks up as the light falls on him. William.

     Walsingham looks down on the pitiful sight.

     Walsingham turns away. As he goes we see what he won't show
     William: that the hurt of the betrayal is almost more than
     he can bear.

     He goes back up the passage. As he passes Reston, the
     Jesuit calls out softly.

</b>       Walsingham lies in bed, his eyes closed. His wife Ursula
       and daughter Mary in the background. He's dying.
<b>       E
</b>        lizabeth has come to him. She looks down on him with deep
       concern.

<b>                           ELIZABETH

</b>       An anonymous man - Agent 3 - walks down a shabby Paris
       street. Stops before a small anonymous house. Knocks.


<b>       INT. PARIS HOUSE - DAY
</b><b>159                                                                159
</b>       The anonymous man is let into the house by a figure we
       don't yet see. He looks round the room. A fire burning in
       the grate. English books on the table. A half-eaten meal.

<b>                           AGENT 3
</b>                 I come from your brother.

       Now we see who he speaks to: William.

<b>                          WILLIAM
</b>                What does he want?

<b>                          AGENT 3
</b>                He asks your forgiveness.

<b>                          WILLIAM
</b>                My forgiveness?

      On William: he stares. Then he understands. Fear brings
      sudden tears to his eyes.

      A gasp. Walsingham's man has plunged a knife into his
      heart.

</b>      Walsingham speaks to his Queen with difficulty.

<b>                          WALSINGHAM
</b>                I have served your majesty - in
                all things...

<b>                          ELIZABETH
</b>                I know it, old friend. Don't
                leave me now.

      Walsingham's eyes open. A weak smile.

<b>                          WALSINGHAM
</b><b>                Y
</b>                 ou don't need me any more.
                Permission - to go -

      Elizabeth looks tenderly down on him, shaking her head.

<b>                          ELIZABETH
</b>                You always did do as you pleased,
                whether I wanted it or not. I've
                no doubt you'll do as you please
                now.

      He lets his eyes close. She stoops down and kisses his
      cheek.

</b>      We see Raleigh from behind. He's holding something, and
      dancing slowly about, and crooning a low song, in the
      oddest way.

      Beyond him, half-glimpsed, an inner room, where Bess is
      resting on a bed.

<b>                             107

Now in his solitary dance Raleigh turns, and we see he's
holding a new-born BABY BOY. He kisses the baby's little
bald head, and sings his wordless song.

Footsteps outside. The door opens, and a royal servant
enters, followed by other servants and guards.

<b>                     OYAL SERVANT
</b>          Her majesty the Queen!

Elizabeth enters, in formal style. She stands and takes in
the scene - Raleigh holding his baby son - the room beyond -
Bess rises at once and comes through to make her curtsey to     
the Queen. Elizabeth seems not to see her.                      
A regal wave at the servants and guards. They withdraw.

Elizabeth stalks round the room. No reason to suppose her
displeasure has passed.

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          When was the birth?

<b>                    RALEIGH

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          The mother is well?

<b>                       RALEIGH
</b>          Thank God.

Now Elizabeth turns to Bess, and their eyes meet. The Queen     
puts out her hand and touches Bess lightly on one cheek. A      
<b>                                                                
</b>silent forgiveness.

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          And the child?

<b>                    RALEIGH
</b>          My son is well.

Now for the first time she looks at the baby.

<b>                    ELIZABETH
</b>          Your Elizabeth has a child. You                       
          must be proud.

<b>                       RALEIGH
</b>          Yes.

Elizabeth moves away, unable to bear seeing the baby.

</b>             As any man can be.                                
Elizabeth looks at him in silence for a long moment.           
<b>                       ELIZABETH
</b>             And do you still dream of your

</b>             More than ever.                                   
She turns to go. But before she reaches the door, she
stops.

<b>                        LIZABETH
</b>             I'd like to give your son my
             blessing.

<b>                       RALEIGH
</b>             I would be honoured.

Elizabeth takes the baby in her arms. She holds him
carefully. She finds herself more moved than she had
expected. She bends her head over him, and turns her back
on Raleigh.

Raleigh watches and waits. And waits.

ON ELIZABETH: her cheek pressed to the baby's head. Her
eyes closed.
