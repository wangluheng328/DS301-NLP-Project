Roy McAvoy is a failed pro golfer who lives in a Winnebago at a crummy driving range which he owns in the West Texas town of Salome.
One day, a beautiful woman, Dr. Molly Griswold, appears at his driving range for golf lessons.
She turns out to be the new girlfriend of McAvoy's longtime nemesis, the smarmy PGA superstar David Simms.
Molly inspires Roy to start taking himself seriously again, and he decides to try to qualify for the US Open.
