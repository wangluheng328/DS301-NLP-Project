After centuries of war between men and vampires, the Church assigns warrior-priests to vanquish the vampires.
The survivors are kept in reserves and hives and the humans live in chaotic cities ruled by the Church.
The priests are outcast by the Church, afraid of the power of their fighting skill.
When Shannon and Owen Pace, who live in an outpost, are slaughtered by vampires and their niece Lucy is abducted by the vampires, the local sheriff Hicks seeks out Owen's brother, the Priest, to search for Lucy.
The Priest asks permission to Monsignor Orelas but he denies.
So the Priest breaks his vows and travels with Hicks to track down the vampires and rescue Lucy before they turn her into a familiar.
Sooner the warrior Priestess joins the Priest and Hicks in their quest.
