                              Screenplay
                                  by
                             Bill Condon



                          Based on the novel

                       "Father of Frankenstein"
                                  by

                             May 30, 1997

<b>                            SHOOTING DRAFT
</b>






<b>     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
</b><b>     AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR
</b><b>     THIS SOFT COPY.
</b>



<b>     FADE IN:
</b>
<b>     MAIN TITLES BEGIN
</b>
     Writhing pools of light and dark, out of which emerge images
     from "The Bride of Frankenstein," directed by James Whale.
     Elsa Lanchester, as the Monster's Bride, looks up, down,
     left, right, startled to be alive.  The Monster stares at
     her.  "Friend?" he asks, tenderly, desperately.

<b>     EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT (B &amp; W)
</b>
     Lightning splits the black-and-white sky, revealing a single
     shattered oak in a desolate landscape.  Below, a HUMAN
     SILHOUETTE stumbles through the darkness, the top of his
     head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with
     mud.

     Suddenly the storm fades.  Light creeps into the scene, and
     color, as we DISSOLVE TO:

<b>     THE PACIFIC OCEAN
</b>
     melting into a hazy morning sky.  In a box canyon off the
     coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a
     makeshift village for beach bums.

<b>     INT. TRAILER - DAY
</b>
     CLAYTON BOONE opens his eyes.  He is 26, handsome in a
     rough-hewn, Chet Baker-like way, with broad shoulders and a
     flattop haircut.  He grabs a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes,
     lights a bent cigarette.

     Clay stands and walks bare-assed across the single tin room,
     his head almost touching the ceiling.

<b>     EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY
</b>
     Clay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag
     that's set up behind his trailer.

<b>     INT. TRAILER - DAY
</b>
     Clay towels off, glances at the morning paper.  He moves
     aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a
     calendar.  His finger targets today's first appointment.
     "10 A.M. - 788 Amalfi Drive."

<b>     EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY
</b>
     Clay steps out of the trailer, clean-shaven and dressed in
     dungarees, a T-shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped
     into one sleeve.  He weight-lifts a secondhand mower onto
     the bed of his rusty pick-up.

     Clay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the
     ignition.  It takes a few tries but the engine finally turns
     over.

<b>     EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY
</b>
     Clay's truck sails down the road, "Hound Dog" blaring on the
     radio.  MAIN TITLES END.

<b>     EXT. COLONIAL-STYLE HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Sprinklers twirl on a grassy slope outside a rambling
     clapboard house.  Below, a swimming pool forms a perfect
     rectangle of still water.  A title reads: SANTA MONICA
<b>     CANYON.  1957.
</b>
     The pick-up drives past.  Clay parks in the back, hops out.

<b>     ANGLE - HOUSE
</b>
     A SHADOWY FIGURE stands at a window, watching Clay unload
     his red power mower.

<b>     INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
     The shadow is a man with dove white hair, wearing a dress
     shirt and seersucker jacket.  This is JAMES WHALE, age 67.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    I'd have more peace of mind if the
                    live-in nurse were still here.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    She was nothing but bother.  I not
                    like her, Mr. Jimmy not like her.
                    We do better if you live-in again,
                    Mr. David.

     In the dining room, visible through open double doors, DAVID
     LEWIS, 55, speaks softly with the housekeeper, HANNA.  She
     is a squat, muffin-faced Hungarian woman in her late 50s,
     dressed in black, her hair cinched in a tight bun.  She
     speaks with a thick accent.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    You'll contact me if there's an
                    emergency?

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Yes, I call you at this number.
                         (calls out)
                    Mr. Jimmy?  More coffee?

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    What?  Oh yes.  Why not?

     He moves into the dining room, sits opposite David.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Isn't Hanna a peach?

     Hanna ignores him, returns to the kitchen.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    She tells me you haven't been
                    sleeping well.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    It's the ridiculous pills they
                    prescribe.  If I take them, I spend
                    the next day stupid as a stone.
                    If I don't, my mind seems to go off
                    in a hundred directions at once --

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    Then take the pills.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    I wanted to be alert for your visit
                    today.  Especially since I saw so
                    little of you in the hospital.

     The remark hits its target.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this
                    movie and two difficult stars --

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    "The fault, dear David, is not in
                    ourselves but in our stars."

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         (too anxious to laugh)
                    You remember how a production eats
                    up one's life.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in
                    making you feel guilty.
                         (stands)
                    You better go, my boy.  You'll be
                    late for that aeroplane.

     David extends his hand, but Whale draws him into a hug.  As
     he starts out, David points to a framed painting.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    By the way, I like the Renoir.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Thank you.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                         (calls out)
                    Goodbye, Hanna.

     Hanna runs out of the kitchen to escort David to the door.
     Whale drifts back to the window, watches as Clay revs up the
     lawnmower, creating a cloud of white smoke.  We CUT TO:

<b>     EXT. STREETS OF DUDLEY - DAY (1900)
</b>
     A bean-pole child with flaming red hair (WHALE at age 12)
     stares up at the coal smoke pouring from a seemingly endless
     row of chimneys.  We're in Dudley, a factory town in the
     English Midlands region known as the Black Country.

<b>                                     SARAH WHALE (O.S.)
</b>                    Stop lagging behind, Jimmy.  We'll
                    be late for church.

<b>                                     YOUNG WHALE
</b>                    Yes, Mum.

     Whale runs to catch up to his six brothers and sisters.  His
     father, WILLIAM WHALE, frowns at the boy's prissy trot.

<b>                                     WILLIAM WHALE
</b>                    Straighten up, son.

     Young Whale's movements thicken into a dim imitation of
     manly reserve.  The Whale family marches up a steeply
     mounting street to Dixon's Green Methodist Church.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Whale's eyes tighten.  He focuses on Clay Boone as he peels
     off his T-shirt, revealing a tattoo on his upper right
     forearm.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Hanna?  Who's the new yardman?

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Bone?  Boom?  Something Bee.  I
                    hire him while you were in the
                    hospital.  He came cheap.

     Whale nods, chooses a walking stick.  He emerges into the
     sunlight.

<b>     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Whale moves jauntily onto the front lawn, singing to
     himself:

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    The bells of hell go ting-a-ling
                    For you but not for me.
                    Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?

     Whale heads off, smiling to himself.  Pleased to be naughty
     again.

     The room is filled with unframed canvasses, many of them
     copies of paintings by the Old Masters.

     Whale rolls out the easel, lifts a half-painted canvas into
     position.  He stares at the blotches of color, trying to
     remember what he intended to paint.

     Whale pulls out a heavy volume on Rembrandt, opens to a
     black-and-white plate of "The Polish Rider."  We CUT TO:

</b>
     A rough pencil outline of the same painting.  Whale, age 16,
     sits on his bed, ignoring the roughhousing of the three
     younger BROTHERS who share the room.  The door opens and
     Whale's mother SARAH enters.

     Both have Midlands accents, like head colds that flatten
     their speech.  Whale holds up the sketch to show his mother.

                    Leave the drawring to the artists.

     Whale squeezes the pad behind the bed, jumps up.

     And he heads cheerfully out of the room.  His mother shakes
     her head.

     Whale studies his face in the mirror.  He gives his white
     hair a few final licks with his silver-backed brush.

     The doorbell rings.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

     Whale settles into his club chair and opens a book,
     pretending to read until Hanna ushers in the visitor.

                    Yes?

     Whale looks up at EDMUND KAY, 22, a slim boy who rests his
     weight on one slouched hip, his arms twined behind him.
     There is a look of mild disappointment on Whale's face as he
     realizes that Kay is a baby poof.

     Whale stands and holds out his hand.

                         (looks around)
                    I thought you'd live in a spooky
                    old mansion or villa.

     Kay laughs, a high, girlish giggle.  Whale fights a cringe
     with a polite smile.

<b>                                     KAY
</b>                    That's my favorite line in my

                    take our tea down by the swimming
                    pool.

     It's clear from Hanna's frown that she doesn't approve of
     the idea.  Whale ignores her, turns back to Kay.

<b>                                     WHALE

     Whale inspects the boy from behind, noticing his wide hips
     and plumpish posterior.

     Kay's hands flap animatedly as Whale leads him down to the
     pool.

     Clay Boone gulps some water from the garden hose.  He
     glances down at the pool, where Kay and Whale sit in
     cast-iron chairs.

     Whale's tongue trips on the word, his voice suddenly drowned
     out by the blast of a factory whistle.  We CUT TO:

     Fiery melt is poured into molds on the shop floor of a
     machine parts factory.  WHALE, 16, grips the hot casting
     with tongs.  His father WILLIAM, his face blackened with
     grime, hammers away at the flaws.  A heavy blow causes young
     Whale to drop the mold, prompting catcalls and sneers on the
     floor.  There is a look of genuine fear in Whale's eyes as
     he looks up at his singed, beast-like father.  We CUT TO:

     Whale smiles politely to cover his momentary disorientation.

</b>                    Of course.  I attended Eton -- it
                    wouldn't do for a master's son to
                    attend where his father taught.  I
                    was to go up to Oxford but the war
                    broke out and I never made it.  The
                    Great War, you know.  You had a

                    like after the Armistice.  The
                    twenties in London were one long
                    bank holiday, a break from
                    everything dour and respectable.  I
                    had a knack with pencil and paper,
                    so I was hired to design sets for

                    beautiful, grim study of war called
                    "Journey's End".  Every experienced
                    director turned it down, so I
                    offered myself, bullying and
                    begging for the job.  "Journey's
                    End" made the careers of everyone
                    associated with it.  It was only a

     Kay's mouth pops open.

     Whale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment.  Kay
     kicks off his penny loafers, bends over to remove his socks.

     Two pale feet emerge.  Whale leans forward to examine them.
     He leans back again.

     And he reaches into his coat for a cigar.  Whale's hand
     trembles as he slices a hole at the base, then lights the
     cigar with a wooden match, sucking and rotating until the
     tip is roundly lit.

     Kay hesitates a moment, then sets his pen aside to pull the
     sweater over his head, revealing a sleeveless T-shirt.

     Kay plucks at his T-shirt, glancing toward the house.

     Kay peels off the shirt and tosses it on his shoes and
     sweater.

                    elbows with Hollywood royalty.  But

                    people know about the Sunday

                    by some strenuous fun and frolic in

                    raised very few eyebrows.

     flips to a blank page.

     Kay stands to unbuckle his belt, glancing around the yard
     again.  He unzips and steps out of his sharply creased
     flannel legs.  His thighs are thin and pale.

     She empties a pill into her palm.  Whale places it into his

     shoulder.  Whale swallows the pill, then glances up at Kay,

     The noise is deafening -- the clank of chains, the screech

     Daisy smiles at her own joke.  Clay frowns.

     Whale ponders the half-painted canvas, clearly distressed by
     his lack of progress.  The stillness is punctured by the
     sound of Clay's lawnmower being dragged up the brick steps.
     Whale smiles, puts down his brush.

     Clay stops, turns around, feeling someone's eyes watching
     him.

                    The bells of hell go ting-a-ling...

     The mower slips out of Clay's hands momentarily.  he looks
     around, spots Whale inside the studio.

     The screen door squeaks open, clatters shut.  A leather
     slipper and rubber-tipped cane appear.  Whale strolls into
     view, smiling.

     Whale's cane trembles in his skeletal hand.  His frailty
     chips away at Clay's resolve.

     Clay hoses the crumbs of grass off his arms.  He dries his
     hands and arms with his hat, then wads it up and stuffs it
     into his shirt to wipe out his armpits.

     Whale sits on a daybed, next to a pile of newspapers.  He
     gestures at a wooden armchair across from him.

     Clay glances at the unframed canvases on the wall and
     stacked in the corners.

     once.

     Clay jumps up to open the screen door.  Hanna walks past,
     refusing to look at him.  She sets the tray on a table very
     hard, ringing the glasses and silverware.

     finds the old man watching him.

</b>                    The central nervous system selects
                    items from a constant storm of
                    sensations.  Whatever was killed in
                    your stroke appears to have
                    short-circuited this mechanism.
                    Parts of your brain now seem to be
                    firing at random.

                    thinking a hundred things at once.
                    It's all nothing more than bad

                    never encountered the olfactory
                    hallucinations, but I'm sure
                    they're related.

     The doctor responds with a sympathetic gaze.  Whale nods
     solemnly.

<b>     INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Whale makes his way toward the stairs.  He passes a
     stoop-shouldered ELDERLY WOMAN who leans on the arm of her
     middle-aged DAUGHTER.  Then an OLD MAN in a wheelchair, his
     eyes brimming with bewilderment and despair.

     Clay opens the squeaking door and enters behind Hanna.
     Whale stands at a drafting table, sharpening a pencil.
     Hanna sets the tray down.

     Whale opens a bottle of beer, pours it into a glass, hands
     it to Clay.  He gestures to a chair.

                    Perhaps we can find something else
                    for you to wear.

     He lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker, revealing a stack
     of "Physique" magazines.  Whale casually covers them with a
     newspaper.

<b>                                     WHALE

                         (steps forward)
                    Here.

     Clay adjusts his belt buckle as Whale hangs the shirt on a
     wall peg.  He moves back to the easel again.

<b>                                     WHALE

                    Just so.

     The arm with the tattoo faces the easel.  Clay smirks.

     A clatter of pencils in the easel's tray, followed by a
     moment of silence.  Finally, a low, whistly scratch.  Clay
     concentrates on keeping still, focusing on an open window.

                    fits your skull.

     Clay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist.

     Whale suddenly sniffs, as if smelling something.  He sniffs
     several times more but continues to draw.

     Whale peers out from behind the square of paper.  He pales
     when he sees his father William, his face covered with

     behind the pad, takes a breath.

     The place is dead.  There's only Clay and Dwight sitting at
     the bar with the owner, HARRY, a balding hep cat with a

     Harry reaches up, turns on a battered Motorola.  On the tv,
     a voice announces: "Tonight, Boris Karloff in 'The Bride of
     Frankenstein.'"  The titles come on.  Ending with the phrase
     "Directed by", which floats over a white blob.  The blob
     jumps forward to form letters: "James Whale."

     flaming wreckage of a mill.

     In a flooded crater under the mill, the Monster kills an old
     man.  He climbs up, flips the man's wife into the pit below.
     An owl blinks impassively.

     now alone with the Monster.

     Whale and Hanna are in bathrobes and slippers, and there is
     a glass of milk and a plate of cookies on Whale's TV tray.
     On the tv, Minnie (played by UNA O'CONNOR) squeaks and

     again.

                    You don't mix them.

     Suddenly the tinny tv soundtrack is drowned out by the voice
     of Elvis Presley.  Kid Saylor bends over the jukebox,
     wagging his denim butt and tapping a high-top sneaker.

     Clay slams the heel of his hand against Saylor's chest.  The
     boy staggers backward.  Clay grabs the corner of the jukebox
     and jerks it from the wall; the needle scratches across the
     song.  Saylor holds up both hands in a nervous surrender.

     In a crypt, the Monster meets Dr. Pretorius, who is having a
     midnight snack on top of a closed coffin.  "Friend?" the
     monster asks.  "Yes, I hope so," answers Pretorius, without
     batting an eyelash.  He offers the Monster a drink, then
     adds: "Have a cigar.  They're my only weakness."

     discussion of death.

     Dr. Frankenstein and Pretorius make their final

     Finally, the Bride comes to life.  She looks up, down, left,

     screams.

     The Monster's pain turns to anger.  He tears through the
     lab, orders Frankenstein to escape with his wife.  But he
     wants Pretorius and the Bride to stay.  "We belong dead."
     Whale reacts sharply to the line.

     The Monster blows up the laboratory and the movie ends.
     Hanna shivers as she stands.

     He waits to see how Betty reacts.  She shrugs.  Harry takes
     his book and cash drawer to the back door.

     He gives Clay one last look and goes out to the breezeway
     and his apartment.

</b>                    If he were that famous, he probably
                    wouldn't give me the time of day.
                    This way, he's like <u>my</u> famous

     She snaps her mouth open and imitates the Bride's
     furious cat hiss.

     waving Clay outside with her hand.

     Betty pulls the door shut and bends over to lock it.  Clay

     Clay glares at her, his jaw working forward in anger.

                    But how long before you're just
                    alone?  Pathetic and alone.

     Clay's anger jumps from his jaw into his shoulders and arms.
     He grabs the door handle.

                    games.

     Betty quickly gets into the car.  before she can pull the
     door shut, Clay slams it on her, hard.  Her hands leap in
     front of her face, as if he'd hit her.  The look of fear in
     her eyes startles Clay out of his rage.

                    all wrong --

     She frantically turns the key in the ignition and the Chevy
     pulls out.

     The car screeches away.  Clay stumbles across the highway.

     Clay comes to the dump at the end of the canyon.  He climbs

     Whale takes the pills, one by one, until he comes to the
     bottle of Luminal.  He opens the pheno bottle to shake out a
     capsule and a dozen spill into his palm.  He stares at them.

     Whale snorts at the imagined scene.  One by one, he returns
     the capsules to their bottle, until a single pill remains.
     He places it on the table, then turns out the lamp and lies
     on his back in the dark, waiting for sleep.

     The distant sound of laughter invades the darkness.  Whale
     sits up, straining to identify the voices.  The bedroom wall
     opposite him melts away, revealing:

     back.  JACK PIERCE, the makeup artist, is patting the hair
     drawn over a cage on Elsa's head.  He looks up, sees Whale,
     and breaks into a conspiratorial grin.  Elsa's eyes are

     another coat of green sizing to the still incomplete

     regally beside him, the train of her long white robe thrown

                    Yes, Colin.  Come see what they've
                    done to our Elsa.

     Clive walks over, glumly.

                    A touch of flu, you know.

     Whale sees through the excuse, rests an arm on Clive's
     shoulder.

<b>                                     WHALE

                    scene in your sleep.

     Clive grits his teeth and nods.  Whale positions them in
     front of the upended table, Clive and Thesiger holding
     Elsa's robe out by the hems.  The shadow of the sound boom
     passes back and forth while they rehearse.

     Elsa giggles.  Clive looks distraught -- which brings some
     life to his stiffness.  Whale sees this, decides to tune it
     higher.

<b>                                     WHALE

                    And Pretorius is a little in love
                    with Dr. Frankenstein, you know.

     Clive's distress reads clearly now.  He is twitchy and
     alive.

                    Shall we have a go?

     He sits in the canvas director's chair, nods to the
     assistant director.

     The Bride snaps her head in various directions.  Thesiger
     slopes back, fingers splayed, intoxicated by his creation:

<b>                                     ERNEST THESIGER
</b>                    The Bride of Frankenstein!

     Whale sits with his legs crossed, jogging his raised foot as
     if conducting the scene with his show.  Fully engaged,
     intensely alive.  We CUT TO:

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Whale glances at the clock, sees that it is 3:15.  He is
     wide awake.  He reaches over, picks up the Luminal.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Luminal.  Illumine all.

     Whale reluctantly places the pill on his tongue and
     swallows.  He rests his head on the pillow and stares at the
     ceiling, where the reflection of the window sheers casts an
     ever-shifting pattern of light and dark.  We move down to
     reveal:

<b>     INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT (BLACK &amp; WHITE)
</b>
     It's a cobblestone cell, a plaster set from "Bride of
     Frankenstein."  Whale sits in a massive chair, straining
     against thick iron chains, as a lightning storm rages
     outside.  In the distance, heavy footsteps, coming closer,
     until the cell door is filled with the silhouette of the
     Monster.  Whale hardly dares to breathe as the Monster rips
     off the door and enters the cell.

     The Monster steps into the light, allowing us to see his
     face for the first time.  It is Clay Boone, dressed in a
     Marine parade uniform.  He uses his hedge clippers to cut
     the chains from around Whale's chest.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Thank you.  Thank you so much.

     Clay leans down and takes Whale in his arms, cradling him
     like a child.  They move across the sound stage -- Clay
     carefully sidestepping the lights and cables on the floor --
     until they reach the next set:

<b>     EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT
</b>
     Clay carries Whale past a painted backdrop of a stormy
     English countryside.

<b>     INT. FRANKENSTEIN'S LAB - NIGHT
</b>
     Whale lies on the Bride's table.  Clay pulls on a doctor's
     smock, picks up a scalpel from a table covered with various
     medical instruments.  he carves a thin circle around the top
     of Whale's forehead.  Then, with one deft movement, he pops
     off Whale's scalp and pulls out the brain.  It is
     soot-covered, charred, used up.

     Whale watches with detached fascination as Clay tosses it on
     the floor, then takes a throbbing, luminous mass from a
     tray.

     Clay inserts the new brain into Whale's skull, sutures the
     scalp back into place.  he fastens the conducting clamps
     around Whale's temples, then throws the heavy circuit
     breaker.  Lights throb with bursts of energy...loose sparks
     crackle...rotary sparks create snapping circles of fire...as
     the energy of the raging storm is harnessed into the
     machinery.

     Clay steps back to take in his handiwork.  A sudden look of
     panic fills Whale's face.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    It isn't working.  The experiment
                    is a failure.

     Clay glances down at Whale, whose breathing is slowing.
     Realizing that the new brain hasn't taken:

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Just go to sleep.

     A serenity suffuses Whale's features as he stares up at the
     pale flicker of lightning.  His breathing finally stops, his
     face a tranquil mask of death.  We CUT TO:

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Whale wakes with a start.  He checks the clock, sees that
     it's past nine.  He presses an intercom button on the
     bedside table.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    I'm up, Hanna.

     Whale sits up, drinks in the sunlight.  He notices some
     grass clippings and leaves scattered on the bedspread.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    What in God's name --

     Whale turns and sees Clay lying next to him.  He gasps.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                         (angrily)
                    I told you to sleep.

     Clay's hands close around Whale's neck.  We CUT TO:

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Whale opens his eyes groggily.  He scans the room in panic,
     clearly unable to get his bearings.

     Whale tries to stand but his legs give way beneath him.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY (LATER)
</b>
     Whale and Hanna stare straight out as she reaches down and
     unbuttons the tiny buttons on his pajama fly.  Whale
     supports himself with one hand on Hanna's shoulder as he
     relieves himself with the other.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY (LATER)
</b>
     Whale sits up in bed, staring dumbly at the morning paper.
     Hanna reaches in to take away the breakfast tray.

     A thin smile forms on Whale's face.

<b>     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Clay prunes the roses on the front lawn.  Hanna appears,
     frowning.

<b>                                     CLAY

</b>                    The Master wants to know if you are
                    free for lunch.  I tell him you
                    will be having other plans, but he
                    insists I ask.

     Hanna goes inside.  Clay rolls the mower down the path.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

     Clay knocks on the bottom of the Dutch door as he lifts the
     latch and walks in.  He is wearing a fresh madras shirt.

     He sits at the kitchen table.

</b>                    No.  You are a guest now.  You go

                    comfortable in here.  It is Hanna,
                    isn't it?

     She eyes him suspiciously, shrugs, pours a glass of tea.
     Clay notices a Bible on the counter.

     Hanna twists her head around with such an indignant look

     Whale takes a step back.  His eyes are locked on Clay,
     fascinated by his temper.

     Whale glides behind the easel.  The pencils rattle in the

                    I like that.  But take care, Mr.

                    like any other.  Too much can be a
                    very bad thing.

     Clay glances out the window.  Feigning a merely casual
     interest:

     Whale backs away from the easel and stares at the paper with
     a sour frown.

                    me now, but there was a time when I
                    was at the very pinnacle of my
                    profession.  The horror movies were
                    behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat."
                    Major success.  Great box office.
                    Now I was to do something
                    important.  "The Road Back."  An
                    indictment of the Great War and
                    what it did to Germany.  It was to
                    be my masterpiece.

</b>                    The fucking studio butchered it.
                    It was 1937, Hitler's armies were
                    already massing -- and still the
                    New York bankers stood in line to
                    curry his favor.  Anything to avoid
                    losing the German market.  They cut
                    away the guts and brought in
                    another director to add slapstick.
                    The picture laid an egg, a great
                    expensive bomb.  For which I was
                    blamed.

     A shadow passes over Whale's eyes.  He presses two fingers
     against his temple.

                    I was no longer able to command

                    away.  Why should I spend my time
                    working in such a dreadful business?

                    friend."  The dirty little secret
                    of a nervous producer.

                    So I finally decided to close down
                    the show.

     Whale places a pill on his tongue and swallows.  He fixes
     Clay with a pinched smile.

     Clay sits uncomfortably in his chair.  His face flushes.

     Clay explodes out of his chair, knocking over a small side
     table.

</b>                    Fuck it.  I can't do this anymore.

     He looms over Whale, whose breathing starts to quicken.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Isn't it enough you told me you're

                    grass and that's it.  Understand?

     Before Whale can respond Clay storms out, nearly ripping the
     screen door off its hinges.  Whale sits on the daybed, takes
     a few quick breaths.  Suddenly the air is filled with the
     sounds of people cavorting in the pool.

     Whale looks up, sees a young man standing outside the screen
     door.  It is now dark outside.

                    moment.

     The man shrugs, disappears into the shadows.  We move
     across the room and through the door...

<b>     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

     Whale sits in a director's chair, a martini in one hand, a
     cigar in the other, a harmless old uncle watching young men
     swagger and splash in the pool.

</b>                    I think we're ready to go.

     He glances over, sees Clay in plaid bathing trunks, sitting
     apart from the others.  He is puffing on a Camel.

     Clay ignores him.  Whale puts down his martini and cigar,
     picks up a Polaroid camera.  He moves over to clay.

     Whale removes Clay's cigarette, crushes it with his shoe.
     Behind him, the pool is now a pit full of naked shadows.

     Whale touches Clay's bare chest.  Clay grabs hold of his
     wrist, causing the old man to yelp in pain.  In the pool,
     the extras shriek in alarm.

     Clay's hands close tightly around Whale's throat.

     Whale's hands fly to his throat.  He opens his eyes and
     gasps greedily for air, the young men's screams lingering
     in the room.  There is a look of genuine terror on his
     face.

     Dwight's WIFE, a pert, steely-eyed brunette, places a firm
     hand on his shoulder.  Dwight shrugs, heads toward the door.

     Clay turns.  A pretty, too-tan BLONDE WOMAN in her early 30s
     is standing at the end of the bar, eyeing Clay.  He lifts
     his glass and she responds with an open smile.

<b>     EXT. CLAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT

     Clay and the woman go at it, their shadows visible through
     the glass louvers.

     Clay tugs on a cord and the harsh overhead fluorescent
     buzzes to life.  He splashes his face with water, then
     catches his reflection in the mirror.

     Clay parks outside the local branch of the public library.

<b>     INT. READING ROOM - DAY

     Clay leafs through an oversized folio, bound copies of <u>The</u>
     <u>New York Times</u>.  He glances at an article from
     1936.  "Interview With a Passing Whale."  There is a picture
     of Whale, captioned "Famous British Director."  A LIBRARIAN
     approaches with more leatherbound books.

     Whale eats lunch off a TV tray.  His attention remains
     focused on "Queen for a Day" as Hanna clomps into the room

                    showed him the sights of no-man's
                    land, through the periscope.  It

     out at couples strolling up the promenade.  An operator
     interrupts, says: "One dollar for the next three minutes."
     Clay deposits two quarters before his mother returns.
     "He's busy, Clay."

                    these days?

     The naughty remark is met with a solemn stare.  Whale
     reaches up, chooses a lightweight blue suit.

</b>                    It needs a hat.  There was a
                    wide-brimmed cream fedora...

<b>                                     HANNA

                    will look.

     The phone rings.  Hanna hurries to answer it.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MAIN HALL - DAY

     Hanna speaks softly in Hungarian.  Whale points upstairs to
     let her know he will look for the hat himself.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Whale opens the closet door and takes down a stack of
     hatboxes from the overhead shelf.  He opens the first box,
     takes out a rubbery wad of heavy fabric with two round
     windows like eyes.  It's a gas mask.  We CUT TO:

<b>     INT. TRENCHES - NIGHT (1917)
</b>
     The night sky explodes with light and smoke.  Whale moves
     calmly through the chaos, trying to maintain a modicum of
     order among the troops.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Gas masks on.  Gas masks on.

     At the end of the line, young Barnett is struggling with his
     straps.  Mustard gas is starting to stream into the trench.

<b>                                     BARNETT
</b>                    Don't mind me, Lieutenant.  Save
                    yourself.

     Whale slips the mask over Barnett's face, fastens it.  He
     slides his own mask into position moments before the trench
     is obliterated by the yellowish smoke.  We CUT TO:

     Hanna stands in the door with a forlorn frown.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Oh, Mr. Jimmy.  You make a mess of
                    it.  Here.

     Hanna lifts the lid of an unopened box to show him the
     missing fedora.

<b>                                     HANNA

                    and her husband are coming to town
                    this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr.
                    Jimmy.  I will make it short.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    No.  I do not cook for them.  My
                    daughter's no-good husband will not
                    take one bite of our food.

     Hanna holds out the box for the gas mask.  Whale gives it a
     long, final look, then drops it in the box.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    You can toss this one in the trash.

     Hanna clamps the lid on the box.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - FOYER - DAY
</b>
     Hanna has opened the door.  At the end of the hall,
     silhouetted against the bright afternoon sky, is Clay.  His
     shoulders fill the doorway.  The top of his head is
     perfectly flat.

<b>                                     WHALE

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Do I look okay?

     Clay steps into the light.  His khaki pants are clean and
     pressed.  A blue knit shirt fits his muscles snugly.

<b>                                     WHALE

                    splendid.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY
</b>
     Whale crosses to the passenger side of the Chrysler.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    I suppose you'd like the top down.

</b>                    Nothing would please me more.

     Clay squeezes behind the wheel, shifts the seat back,
     explores switches.  The vinyl top pops up and folds
     backward.

     Whale gets in.  Clay starts the engine and backs out.

<b>     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Hanna stands at the front door, hands tangled in her apron.
     Whale tugs his hat brim at her as the car swings around the
     driveway.

     Whale smiles at the wide open sky overhead.  Clay steps on
     the gas and the Chrysler takes off.

<b>     EXT. CUKOR HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     The party is clearly audible from the road, where Clay has
     squeezed the Chrysler into a long row of shiny cars nuzzling
     the high brick wall.  Whale puts his dark glasses on.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Stars, you know.  The suns of other
                    galaxies.

     They walk up the steep road to the gatehouse.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Good old George.  He loves to put
                    on the dog.  Only his dogs tend to
                    have a bit of mutt.

     A WOMAN at the gate inspects the invitation, waves them
     through.

<b>     EXT. CUKOR HOUSE - LAWN - DAY
</b>
     A sunny patio with hedges and statues.  Wickets and stakes
     have been set up for a game of croquet, but only a handful
     of very tanned children strut around with mallets.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    What did I tell you?  Listen.

<b>                                     CLAY

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to
                    hire music.  There's nothing but
                    chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard
                    of English chin-wag.

     Whale scans the crowd.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Slim pickings.  Well, it's early
                    yet.  Perhaps this is a good time
                    to pay our respects.

     Clay follows Whale toward a trellis alcove covered in ivy.
     A handful of people grin at the mismatched couple who stand
     in the shade: a homely older man in glasses and a pretty
     woman in a white dress with polka dots.  GEORGE CUKOR and
<b>     PRINCESS MARGARET.
</b>
<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Let's get this over with quickly.

     Whale forgets to remove his hat when he comes forward.
     Before he can give Cukor their names Princess Margaret's
     polite smile bursts open in a joyful display of teeth.

<b>                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
</b>                    I had no idea you'd be here.

     She seizes Whale's hand in her little white gloves.

<b>                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
</b>                    How are you?

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                         (taken aback)
                    Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal
                    Highness?

<b>                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
</b>                    Splendid.  Now that I know you're
                    around.

     Standing beside him, Clay is clearly impressed that Whale
     knows a princess.

<b>                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
</b>                    Can we get together while I'm in
                    town?  I so badly want to sit for
                    you again.

</b>                    I've changed my hair, you see.
                    Since our last session.  Those old
                    snaps look rather dowdy now.

     Whale realizes she's mistaken him for someone else.  He tugs
     his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes.

<b>                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
</b>                    Oh dear.  Have I made a blunder?

</b>                    Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James
                    Whale.

<b>                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
</b>                         (laughs)
                    I am such a goose.  I mistook you
                    for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat.
                    You're wearing one of Cecil's hats,
                    you know.

     Whale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of
     humiliation.  He turns to Cukor for help.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Hello, George.  James Whale.  David
                    Lewis's friend.  I once made

<b>                                     GEORGE CUKOR
</b>                    Yes.  Of course.  One can't throw a
                    rock in this town without hitting
                    one of us old movie directors.

     Whale feels the sting.  He turns to Clay.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Ma'am, may I present Mr. Clayton
                    Boone?

     Clay steps forward to shake hands.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    My gardener, who insisted I bring
                    him today.  He so wanted to meet
                    royalty.

     Cukor's face goes blank with indignation.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Pleased to meet you.

<b>                                     PRINCESS MARGARET
</b>                    Quite.  I adore gardens.

     Whale narrows his eyes at Cukor and sharpens his smile.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    He's never met a princess.  Only
                    queens.

     Cukor puffs out his chest, quivers a bulbous lower lip at
     Whale.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    George, Ma'am, this has been an
                    honor.  An occasion to remember for
                    the rest of my days.

     He leads Clay away and an American couple promptly crowd in
     to take their place.  Striding through the garden, Whale is
     obviously pleased with himself.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    What was that about?

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Nothing of importance.  Just two
                    old men slapping each other with
                    lilies.  Shall we have a drink?

     Whale leads Clay to a tented bar.  Across the way, David
     Lewis has come through the gate with a WOMAN on his arm.
     People look discreetly, not at David but at the woman,
     lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Who's that?

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    David.  The friend I thought was in
                    New York.

<b>                                     CLAY

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.

     Clay watches in amazement as ELIZABETH TAYLOR waves to
     someone and pipes out a happy hello.  She hurriedly unties
     her scarf, thrusts it at David and runs off on tiptoes to
     embrace a woman.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Is that really her?

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    David produced her last picture.

     David glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat
     pocket.  He sees Whale looking at him.  He puts on a tight
     smile and strolls across the patio.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    What are you doing here?

                    asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for

     The waiter arrives with their drinks.  Only when Clay takes
     his glass of beer does David see that Whale is not alone.

<b>                                     DAVID

     David freezes.  Whale lifts his martini glass at Clay and
     takes a sip.

                    regret having had the invitation
                    sent.

     David is looking over Whale's shoulder.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    I didn't ask George to invite you.

</b>                    Then who did?

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    Jimmy, there are people here I need
                    to speak to.  You'll be fine on
                    your own?

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Yes.  Perfectly.

<b>                                     DAVID
</b>                    All right, then.  I'll come by tomorrow
                    for breakfast.

     Whale nods, watches David stroll over to the pool and greet
     a gaggle of executives.  Whale drifts toward some deck
     chairs at the far end of the croquet lawn.  He sits, takes a
     sip of his drink.  Suddenly a high-pitched giggle pierces
     the air.

</b>                    Mr. Whale!

     Whale looks out to see Edmund Kay, his interviewer from
     several weeks ago, marching across the lawn.

                    love your movies.  That's why I
                    wanted you to come to this.  So I
                    could see you with your monsters.

     Whale tries to do just that, but finds himself caught in the
     chair.  He is stumbling to his feet when Kay returns with
     Elsa Lanchester, 55, at his side.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                    Jimmy.  How are you?

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Elsa?

     She takes Whale's hand, with a look of deep concern and
     sympathy.  Kay races off again.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                    I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago.
                    She said you'd been under the

</b>                    But you appear quite fresh, my
                    dear.

     She swats aside the compliment and gestures at the chair.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                    Please.  You shouldn't stand on my

</b>                    What's our pesky friend up to now?

     Kay returns, accompanied by a stopped, gray-haired man with
     a long rectangular face and wary, heavy-lidded eyes.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                    Is that Boris?  Our little chum
                    appears to be arranging a reunion.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Oh dear.

     Karloff, age 70, comes reluctantly, followed by his niece
     ALICE, a bashful young woman who carried a blanket-wrapped
     bundle.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                    Boris, darling.  I didn't know you
                    were here.  These public revels are
                    hardly up your alley.

<b>                                     BORIS KARLOFF
</b>                    I came for the sake of my visiting
                    niece.  Alice.  And Miranda, my
                    great-niece.

     His huge hand lifts the blanket in Alice's arms, revealing a
     bald infant with enormous blue eyes.  Karloff gurgles and
     coos at the child.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                    And what do you make of our royal
                    visitant?

<b>                                     BORIS KARLOFF
</b>                    Perfectly charming.  A real lady.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                    Of course she's a lady.  What did
                    you expect?  A hussy in tennis
                    shoes?

     Whale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind
     Karloff.  He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are
     listening intently to the monocled British consul.

     Whale's eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together, his
     once and future monsters.  Kay shouts to a passing
     photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic.

<b>                                     KAY
</b>                    Hey, you!  With the camera!  We got
                    a historical moment here.  Come get
                    a picture of it.

     The man scans the scene for a famous face.

<b>                                     KAY
</b>                    This is Mr. James Whale, who made
                    "Frankenstein" and "Bride of
                    Frankenstein."  and this is the
                    Monster and his Bride.

     Clay looks up when he hears Kay identify Karloff.

<b>                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
</b>                    Oh, Karloff.  Right.

     Karloff and Elsa drift into position next to Whale.  The
     flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light.  Whale cringes
     in pain.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                         (through clenched teeth)
                    Don't you just love being famous?

     Another flash.  From Whale's perspective, the bulb resembles
     nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical
     current from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory.  Whale
     concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his
     brain.  He clutches Elsa Lanchester's hand.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                    Are you all right, Jimmy?

     A sharp nod from Whale.  The photographer motions to
     Karloff's niece.

<b>                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
</b>                    Let me get one with Frankenstein
                    holding the kid.

     Alice hands over the baby.  Karloff gently cradles the
     child.  Whale stands on his left, Elsa on his right.  They
     all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up.  Whale
     follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks
     and strains in a furious electrical storm.

     The camera flashes once, then again.

<b>                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
</b>                    Got it!

     Whale glances up -- the kite is gone.  Thunder rumbles as
     the group starts to disperse.  Whale nods to the faces
     exchanging good-byes.

<b>                                     BORIS KARLOFF
</b>                    So good to see you again, James.

     He strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby.

<b>                                     KAY
</b>                    Catch you before you go, Mr. Whale.
                    I'll make sure everybody gets sent
                    a print.

     He goes off with the photographer.  Elsa kisses Whale on the
     cheek.

<b>                                     ELSA LANCHESTER
</b>                    We'll be in touch, Jimmy.

</b>                    Good-bye.  So nice to see you...

     Finally Whale is alone.  He staggers to the deck chair and
     lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    You okay?

     Whale gazes up at Clay.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Tired.  A bit tired.

     Clay nods.  Whale smiles at him.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Are you enjoying yourself?

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Actually, no.  I feel a little out

                    Seeing your monsters again.

</b>                    Monsters?  The only monsters...
                         (closes his eyes)
                    ...are here.

     Across the lawn, conversation has stopped.  Birdlike shrieks
     come from all directions.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Oh fuck.  And we left the top down.
                    You want to run for it?

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Run for what?

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Can't you see?  It's raining!

     The rain is only a flickering of air, but people are jumping
     and shrieking, throwing coats over their heads as they dash
     toward the house.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Here.

     He takes Whale under the arm, helps him up and escorts him
     to a small tent.  On the patio, everyone shoves and squeezes
     to get through the one open door.

     Whale stares out, hypnotized by the deluge.  From his POV,
     we see a young man step into the rain.  Whale squints, is
     finally able to identify the man as Leonard Barnett.

     Whale's eyes follow Barnett as he emerges onto a new
     landscape, a scarred and barren battlefield.  As the storm
     continues to rage:

<b>                                     CLAY (O.S.)
</b>                    Mr. Whale?

     Whale shifts his gaze to Clay.  He takes a moment to orient
     himself.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Let's get out of this funk hole

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    You don't want to wait it out?
                    Rain should let up soon.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    We're not sugar.  We won't melt.

     Whale adjusts the brim of his hat and steps into the
     downpour.  Clay has no choice except to follow.  They walk
     briskly, the minute splashes on Whale's hat forming a
     ghostly aura of spray.

<b>     INT. CAR - DAY
</b>
     Whale opens the door and climbs in next to Clay.  The roof
     slowly closes over them.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    I better get you home before you
                    catch your death from pneumonia.

</b>                    Catch my death.

     Clay glances over, sees Whale sitting very wet and rigid,
     staring straight ahead.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    You all right, Mr. Whale?

     Whale blinks, slowly turns.  There is a cracked look in his
     eyes.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Jimmy.  Please.  Call me Jimmy.

     Clay smiles, starts to back the car out.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - FOYER - DUSK
</b>
     The hallway is pitch-dark as Whale and Clay enter.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Hanna!  Bring us some towels.

                    floor, it's her own damn fault.

     Whale goes squashing down the hall.  Clay remains just
     inside the open door, prying off his shoes and peeling off
     his socks.  He follows Whale into:

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

     Whale stands over the table with his jaw open.

     He slides a note to Clay.

<b>                                     WHALE

     Whale stands just inside the closet, buttoning a crisp white
     shirt.  He reaches for a red bow tie, closes the closet
     door.  In the mirror, Leonard Barnett stands behind him, in
     uniform.  Whale's eyes twinkle in surprise.  He drapes the
     tie around his collar.

     Barnett smiles his approval.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

     Clay opens the bathroom door, calls out.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Mr. Whale?

     No answer.  He goes to the top of the stairs and calls out.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Where's those clothes you promised?

     Again, nothing.  Rain ticks against the windows.  Clay goes
     down the stairs.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Whale fiddles with the knot of his tie.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    He trusts me, you know.

     Barnett sits on the edge of the bed now.  He smiles, a bit
     sadly.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</b>
     There's glow coming from the bedroom, and the sound of
     Whale's voice.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Mr. Whale?  Jimmy?

     Clay steps slowly toward the door, pushes it open.  He peers
     in.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Whale pulls on a blazer.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Mr. Whale?

     Whale jumps.  He slaps a hand over his chest, twists around,
     sees Clay.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You
                    finished your shower already?

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear
                    me calling?

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
                         (stands)
                    I believe I promised you some
                    clothes.

     Whale crosses to the closet.  Barnett is nowhere to be seen.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    You're much wider than I am.  You
                    won't want to attempt to get into
                    my pants.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    No.  Definitely not.

     Clay chuckles.  Whale smiles.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Very good, Clayton.

     He takes a robe from a hook on the closet door.  Clay tries
     it on but it won't close over the towel.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    I know.

     Whale opens a drawer, takes out a crewneck sweater.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Absolutely swims on me, but should
                    take care of your upper half.

     Clay pulls the sweater over his head.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    That only leaves the rest.

                    Pajama bottoms?

</b>                    Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored.
                    Would it be too distressing to
                    continue with the towel?  No more
                    immodest than a kilt, you know.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Do I have any other choice?

<b>                                     WHALE

     Clay notices a framed drawing on the desk.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Is that --?

                    The only memento I ever kept.  My
                    original sketch for the Monster.

     He hands the sketch to Clay, who stares down at the famous
     flat head, hooded eyes, bolted neck of the Monster.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Shall we?

     Clay puts down the sketch, starts into the hall.  Whale
     turns back, sees Barnett standing by the window.  Whale
     flips off the light and closes the door.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
     Clay sits at the kitchen table.  Whale opens the
     refrigerator and brings out two plates wrapped in wax paper,
     and a bottle of beer for Clay.  He pours himself a shot of
     Scotch from a decanter and sits down.

</b>                    Why not?  Give us something to do
                    while we wait.

     Clay munches on his sandwich.  Whale pours himself another
     Scotch, takes a sip.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Tell me something, Clayton.  Do
                    you believe in mercy killing?

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Never gave it much thought.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Come now.  I'm sure you came across
                    such situations in Korea.  A
                    wounded comrade, or perhaps one of
                    the enemy?  Someone for whom death
                    would be a blessing.

     Clay stops chewing.  He stares down at his plate.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    I never went.

     He takes a deep breath, looks up at Whale.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    I never made it to Korea.

<b>                                     WHALE

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    -- that I was a Marine.  Which is
                    true.  You filled in the rest.

</b>                    I see.

     Clay downs his beer, refills the glass.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    My old man was a Marine.  He
                    enlisted the day he turned
                    seventeen.

                    By the time he was ready to ship
                    out, the fighting was over.  He
                    missed out.

<b>                                     WHALE

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    That's not the way he saw it.  To
                    him, it was like his life never got
                    started.  Nothing else really
                    mattered.  Definitely not his
                    family.

     Whale gazes sympathetically at Clay.

                    drove down to St. Louis to
                    reenlist.  He was so damn excited.
                    World War II was going to be his
                    second chance.
                         (sighs)
                    They told him he was too old...fat
                    ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more
                    use to his country if he stayed
                    home and looked after his family.

<b>                                     WHALE

                    it was the next best thing.  Hey, I
                    loved it too.  A chance to be a
                    part of something important.
                    Something bigger than yourself.

<b>                                     WHALE

     A look of surprise crosses Whale's face.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    I mean, literally.  My body
                    screwed me up.  Burst appendix.
                    They gave me a medical discharge.
                    All I thought about was, how am I
                    going to tell the old man.

     He breaks into a crooked smile.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    You know what he did when I called
                    him?  He laughed.  He laughed so
                    hard he practically burst a blood
                    vessel.  Said it was a good lesson
                    for me.  Not to try to fill his
                    shoes.

<b>                                     WHALE

                    You've just told one.  A very good
                    story indeed.

     Whale lifts his glass in a toast.  Clay empties his glass of
     beer.  He motions toward the decanter.

<b>                                     CLAY

     Whale's gaze remains dreamy and preoccupied as SOUNDS of
     battle fill the room.  A relentless rat-a-tat of gunfire.
     The whistling of bombs.  The tortured wailing of dying men.
     Whale stands, moves over to the window.

     Whale gazes out at the storm.  From his POV, we see a
     scarred and barren landscape, illuminated by occasional
     flashes of lightning.

                    to give the lad a taste.  They were

                    fire.

<b>     EXT. TRENCHES - NIGHT (1917)

     We race along the open trench with Whale, the darkened sky
     intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire.  He reaches
     the periscope, pulls an enlisted man off it.  From his POV,
     we see Barnett and McGill dodging bullets as they attempt to
     make their way back.

     McGill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench.
     Barnett follows.  Just as his feet leave the ground his
     chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire.  Whale's eyes
     snap closed, trying to obliterate what they've just seen.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Whale stares out impassively.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    We saw him at morning stand-to and
                    evening stand-to.  "Good morning,
                    Barnett," we'd say each day.
                    "How's ole Barnett looking this
                    morning?"  "Seems a little peaky.
                    Looks a little plumper."  His
                    wounds faced the other way and his
                    hat shielded his eyes, so one could
                    imagine he was napping on
                    bedsprings.  He hung there until we
                    were relieved.  We introduced him
                    to the new unit before we marched
                    out, speaking highly of his
                    companionship.

     Clay's eyes are filled with pity.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Oh, but we were a witty lot.
                    Laughing at our dead.  Telling
                    ourselves it was our death too.
                    But with each man who died, I
                    thought, "Better you than me, poor
                    sod."
                         (bitterly)
                    A whole generation was wiped out by
                    that war.  Millions and millions of
                    young men.

     Whale begins to hum, a tune we have heard before:

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling?
                    Grave where thy victory?

</b>                    You survived it.  It can't hurt you
                    now.  It's no good to dig it up.

</b>                    Oh no, my friend.  It's digging
                    itself up.  There is nothing in the
                    here and now to take my mind off
                    it.  All my diversions have
                    abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading.
                    Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone
                    to me now.

     Whale remains perfectly still, staring out the window.  Clay
     deliberates a moment, then puts down his drink next to the 
     decanter of Scotch.  He stands and yanks the neck of the 
     sweater over his face, then tosses it on the sofa.  Whale 
     blinks at the reflection in the glass, not yet 
     understanding.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    You wanted to draw me like a Greek
                    statue.  All right, then.

     Clay pulls at the knot, lets go of the towel.  He defiantly
     parks his hands on his hips.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    There.  Not so bad.

     Whale continues to stare at the reflection, his back to
     Clay, his eyes wide and expressionless.  He turns slowly,
     fully expecting the vision to evaporate.  When he sees that
     Clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    So it is going to happen after all.

     Whale doesn't respond.  Finally he opens his mouth to take a
     breath.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    No.  It won't do.

     Whale moves abruptly across the room.  He walks past Clay.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Whale passes quickly through the dining room and out to the
     kitchen.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
     Whale reaches for the hatbox, which sits on top of a garbage
     can.  Suddenly a large hand appears on the box.  Whale gasps
     when a flash of lightning reveals the face of the Monster.

     The Monster growls out an inarticulate greeting.  He picks
     up the box and hands it to Whale.

<b>     INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

     Whale removes the lid, sets the hatbox on the sofa.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    I would like you to wear this?

     Whale steps back.  Clay takes the box and covers his lap
     with it.  He lifts out the gas mask.

<b>                                     CLAY

                    striking.

                    minute.  Long enough for me to see

<b>                                     CLAY

                    There are straps in back.

     Clay fits the mask on the top of his head and draws it down.
     The living room turns brownish yellow in the thick glass
     goggles.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Let me help you.

     Whale is suddenly behind him.  Clay's vision is enclosed in
     two round windows, so he can't see Whale buckling the second
     strap.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Now what?

     Mouth muffled by the inhalator, Clay hears his voice from
     inside his head.  Whale comes around to stand in front of
     him.  He grins as he steps back to examine Clay.  Clay
     nervously taps his knees with his hands.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    All right.  Let's take it off now.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    What was that?

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    It's too tight.

     Clay raises his voice to make himself heard.  He reaches
     back to undo the buckles.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Allow me.

     Whale steps in past the goggles.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    We don't want to tear the straps.

     Clay drops his hands so Whale can undo the buckles.  But
     nothing happens.  Clay turns left and right.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Oh yes.  I am still here.

     Two hands grip Clay's shoulders.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    What steely muscles, Clayton.

     Whale's hands squeeze.  Clay grabs the frame of his seat, to
     stop his arms from automatically swinging a fist.  Whale's
     hand slides over Clay's shoulder to his arm, caressing the
     tattoo.  Clay jerks his shoulder to shake Whale off.

<b>                                     CLAY

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you.
                    I can't hear a word.

     Whale presses his lips to Clay's tattoo.  Clay's muscles
     tense from head to toe.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    What a solid brute you are.

     Whale's tongue moves down Clay's arm.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    No?  Maybe this, then?

     The hand slides over Clay's stomach toward his lap.  The
     tattooed arm swings backward, slamming an elbow against
     Whale's skull.  Clay jumps from the chair, knocking into an
     end table.  The glass and crystal decanter fall to the
     floor.  The lamp spills over and the room goes dark.

     Clay's ankle is caught by the sofa leg and he hits the
     floor, jamming the inhalator against his mouth.  He quickly
     gets up, on his knees and elbows, pulling at the mask.
     Flashes of lightning strobe the room as Whale collapses over
     Clay's back and holds on.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Oh yes.  I have you now.

     A strap breaks.  Clay rips the mask off.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Get the fuck off!

     Whale's hand squeezes between Clay's legs.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    What will you do to get yourself
                    back?

     Clay jabs with his elbow, flipping Whale on his back.  His
     body straddles Whale's and pins him, face to face.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    I'm not that way.  Get it through
                    your fucking head.  I don't want to
                    mess with you.

</b>                    Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.

     His hands clasp Clay's hips.  Clay's fist opens as it comes
     down; he slaps Whale across the face.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    That didn't even sting.  You're not
                    such a real man after all.  Are
                    you?

     Clay whacks Whale's face again.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Wait until I tell my friends I had
                    you naked in my arms.  Won't they
                    be surprised?

<b>                                     CLAY

                    you!

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Oh, but you have.  You undressed
                    for me.  I kissed you.  I even
                    touched your prick.  How will you
                    be able to live with yourself?

     Clay snatches Whale's wrist before it can touch his crotch.
     With his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter.

<b>                                     CLAY

     Whale tilts his face up for another blow.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    <u>I want you to kill me</u>.

     Clay freezes.  He stares down at the old man with white hair
     and wild eyes lying beneath him.

<b>                                     WHALE

                    life out of me.  Please, Clayton.
                    We've come this far.

     Whale's eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning.

<b>                                     WHALE
</b>                    Exactly, I'm losing my mind.

                    Soon there will be nothing left.
                    Look at the sketch I made of you.

     Clay turns to the sketch pad, which lies on the floor next
     to Whale.  The page is filled with nothing but doodles and
     scrawls.

<b>                                     CLAY

</b>                    No, I don't want to die alone.  But
                    to be killed by you -- that would

                    never see the one with your name on
                    it.  But I want to see death coming
                    at me.  I want it to be sharp and
                    hard, with a human face.  Your
                    face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my
                    second Monster.  Almost as famous
                    as the first.  It would be the
                    great adventure you've yearned for.
                    A war story for both of us to
                    share.

     Clay's breathing comes in quick, panicked bursts.

</b>                    You'd be fully exonerated, I've

                    house, the car...

     Clay's body starts to tremble.

     Clay lets out a howl -- his shoulders heave and shake.

     He climbs off Whale, crawls away, his body collapsing in
     wracking, anguished sobs.  Whale opens his eyes, gazes at
     Clay.

     Whale picks up the towel and moves over to Clay.

     Whale places the towel around Clay's shoulders.

     Whale starts slowly down the hall.

     Whale sits on the edge of the bed, tugs the bowtie from his

     He lifts his chin and points to his collar.

                    tired.

     Clay leans in to open the button.  His face is only six
     inches from Whale's.

<b>                                     WHALE

                    lives for a reason?

     Clay doesn't answer.  Whale turns, breaking their shared
     gaze.

                    All right.

     Whale hauls his legs up and stretches out on the bed.

     Clay pulls the door shut and it clicks.  He stands there a
     moment.

     Clay shakes open a bedsheet and wraps himself in it.

     Clay finds a pack of cigarettes on the floor and lights one,
     then sets the furniture back up.  He picks up the gas mask
     from beside the sofa, shoves it into its box.

     Clay sits in the wing-back chair, props his feet on the
     hassock, adjusting the sheet around his shoulders.  We CUT

     Whale bolts up in bed.  An electrical storm flashes and
     cracks in the window.

     Whale gets out of bed, stares outside.  From his POV, the
     lawn is a barren slope covered with stumps.

     Whale turns on the desk lamp, sits.  He pulls out a piece
     of paper.

<b>     EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT
</b>
     We're back to the scene that opened the movie, a flat-topped
     creature stumbling through the mud.  A flash of lightning
     reveals Clay's face.  He turns, signals for Whale to follow
     him.  Whale joins Clay on a slight rise of ground, the rim
     of a crater.  Clay points down into it.

<b>     EXT. CRATER - NIGHT
</b>
     The crater is full of bodies gathered around a pool of
     water.  Whale stumbles down, reaches the bottom and bends
     over the nearest corpse in khaki.  It is Leonard Barnett.
     There are no wounds on his body, no rips or gaping holes.
     His eyes are closed in dreamless sleep.

     Whale looks up and sees that Clay is gone.  The only other
     living creature is an owl, which blinks wearily at him.

     Whale lies down, finding a spot next to Barnett.  He takes a
     last breath and closes his eyes.  We CUT TO:

     A roar of bells blasts Clay awake.  The telephone is
     ringing.  A hard pair of shoes thunder out to answer it.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Hello?  Oh, Mr. David!

     Clay blinks at the sight of Hanna in black dress and white
     apron, chattering on the phone by the far wall.

<b>                                     HANNA

     She scoldingly cuts her eyes at Clay.

     She hangs up and faces Clay with a stern frown.

                    him a new stroke.

     She stomps into the kitchen.  Clay gets up, slips on his
     undershorts.  He's zipping up his chinos when she comes out
     again with a breakfast tray.  She hands him a cup of coffee.

<b>                                     CLAY

     She marches around the corner towards Whale's bedroom.  Clay
     hears her knocking on a door.

</b>                    Mr. Jimmy?  Morning, Mr. Jimmy.

     Clay pulls on his shirt.  Hanna comes back around the
     corner.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    What have you done with him?

</b>                    I put him to bed.  He's not there?

     She goes to the foot of the stairs and shouts:

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Mr. Jimmy!  Mr. Jimmy!

     Hanna starts up the stairs.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Look for him!

     Clay reaches for his socks when he notices an envelope on
     the floor next to the chair.  He picks it up.  On the front
     is scrawled the word 'CLAYTON'.  Clay opens the envelope.
     Inside is Whale's original sketch of the Monster's head.  He
     turns it over.  There is a message written on the back.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    No.

     Clay drops the sketch, looks out.  He sees something.

<b>     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
</b>
     Clay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope.

<b>     EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - POOL - DAY
</b>
     Clay leaps headfirst into the water.  Whale rests lightly on
     his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair.  Clay
     hauls the body toward the side.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Almost there.  Almost there.

     He gets an arm around Whale's chest and heaves the body over
     the curb.  he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in
     the grass.  He grabs the wrist.  Nothing.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Son of a bitch.  You crazy son of a
                    bitch.

     Clay straddles Whale's thighs and applies pressure on his
     rib cage.  But it's no use.  Clay sits up and takes a deep
     breath.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Ohhh!

     Hanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk.  She
     stares at Clay.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Oh, Mr. Jimmy.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    He wanted me to kill him, but I
                    didn't.  He did it himself.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    He says here good-bye.  I find it
                    in his room.  He is sorry, he says.
                    He has had a wonderful life.

     She waves a folded piece of paper.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    You poor, foolish man.  You
                    couldn't wait for God to take you
                    in his time?

     Clay slowly stands up.  Hanna looks around in panic.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    You must leave.  You were not here
                    this morning.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    But I didn't do this!

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    The police will not know that.
                    They will want to investigate.

<b>                                     CLAY

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Do you want to be questioned about
                    you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please,
                    Clayton.  It will be better if I
                    find the body alone.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    But how're you going to explain
                    this?
                         (points at the body)
                    How did you get him out of the
                    pool?

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    You are right.  Yes.  We must put
                    him back.

     They both hesitate, looking down at Whale.  Then Clay drags
     the body parallel with the pool.  Hanna stoops over to
     adjust the collar of Whale's shirt.

<b>                                     HANNA
</b>                    Poor Mr. Jimmy.  We do not mean
                    disrespect.  You will keep better
                    in water.

     She nods to Clay.  He rolls the body over and it splashes on
     its belly.  It bounces a moment in the waves of the splash,
     then begins to sink.  As it drops, the air in the chest
     slowly flips the body around.

     Looking up at them with open eyes, Whale sinks backward into
     the thickening light.  His arms trail upward and the hands
     lightly flutter as if waving good-bye.  The melancholy sound
     of a solo violin pierces the silence as we CUT TO:

     A black-and-white scene from "Bride of Frankenstein."  The
     old BLIND MAN plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while
     the MONSTER listens outside, moved by the music.  He smashes
     open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the
     soul-soothing sound.  The blind man stops playing, looks up.

     The Monster attempts to communicate, manages only a
     plaintive moan.  The blind man stands.

     The old man touches the Monster, who recoils with a
     defensive growl.

     MICHAEL BOONE, 10, lies on the living room carpet, staring
     raptly at the movie playing on the large Zenith console.
     The house is small but tidy and comfortable.

                    comfort me.

     On the tv screen, the old man starts to cry, then collapses
     onto the Monster's chest.  A thick tear rolls down the
     Monster's cheek.

     Clay Boone sits on the sofa, a baby on his lap.  He's 40
     now, his hair starting to thin but still closely cropped at
     the top and sides.

     On the tv, daylight fills the hut.  The blind man and the
     Monster share a meal.

</b>                    Come on, Dad.  Is this another one
                    of your stories?

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Here.

     Clay unfolds Whale's sketch of the Monster, hands it to his
     son.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    It's his original sketch of the
                    Monster.

     Michael turns over the sketch.  On the back, scrawled in
     block letters: "TO CLAYTON BOONE -- FRIEND?"

<b>                                     MICHAEL
</b>                    This is for real?

     Clay nods.  At the same time, his wife DANA appears in the
     doorway.  A pretty, cheerful woman in her mid-30s.

<b>                                     DANA
</b>                    The trash, Clay.  Before it rains.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Okay.

     Clay kisses the top of his son's head.

<b>                                     CLAY
</b>                    Off to bed.

<b>     EXT. CLAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn.  The sky
     momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning.

     Clay gazes up at the electrical storm.  He glances back at
     his house, sees Dana cradling the baby in an upstairs
     window.

     The skies open with a shattering crash of thunder.  Clay
     tilts up his face, drinks in the cool rain.  Then he extends
     his arms and staggers along the sidewalk, imitating the
     Monster's famous lurch.

     We PULL BACK, revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small
     houses and neat lawns, until Clay is only a small dot in the
     landscape.

<b>     FADE OUT.
</b>
