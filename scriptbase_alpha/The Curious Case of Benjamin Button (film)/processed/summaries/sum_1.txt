As she lay dying in a hospital bed on the eve of Hurricane Katrina hitting New Orleans, an elderly woman asks her daughter Caroline to read from a diary left to her by a man named Benjamin.
Born on the same day World War I ended, Benjamin Button's mother died giving birth to him.
As a newborn, he was old and wrinkled and his horrified father Thomas Button leaves him on the doorstep of an old folk's home.
Benjamin fits in well for, despite his young age, he looked as old as most of the residents.
Benjamin soon realizes that he is growing younger, not older however.
Early on, he meets the love of his life, Daisy, a beautiful red-haired, green-eyed child who grows into a beautiful woman while Benjamin grows into a handsome young man.
Their lives take many different turns and making a life together is long in coming.
It also is of limited duration given their ultimately different fates.
