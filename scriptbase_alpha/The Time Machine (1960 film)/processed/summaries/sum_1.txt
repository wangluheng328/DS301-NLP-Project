From the book by H.G.
Wells, a scientist and tinkerer builds a time machine and uses it to explore the distant future where there are two races, a mild gentle race, and a cannibalistic one living underground.
His machine is stolen by the underground race and he must risk being captured (and eaten) to return to his own time.
