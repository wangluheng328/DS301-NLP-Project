Adam Stanheight (Leigh Whannell), a photographer, awakens in a water-filled bathtub in an industrial bathroom.
Across the room from him is Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes), an oncologist.
Both men are chained at the ankle to pipes, and a corpse is lying face-down in a pool of blood between them, holding a microcassette recorder and a revolver.
They find tapes in their pockets, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder.
Adam's tape instructs him to escape, while Lawrence's tape instructs him to kill Adam before six o'clock, or Alison and Diana (Monica Potter and Makenzie Vega), his wife and daughter, will be killed and he will be left to die.
Using a clue at the end of the message, Adam finds a bag in the toilet tank containing two hacksaws, which they use to try cutting through the chains.
Adam breaks his, and throws it at the mirror in frustration.
Lawrence realizes that the saws are actually meant for their feet.
He tells Adam that they were captured by the Jigsaw Killer, who Lawrence is aware of because he was once a suspect.
