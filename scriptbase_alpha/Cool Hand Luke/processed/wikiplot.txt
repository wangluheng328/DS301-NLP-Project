In the 1940s, Lucas "Luke" Jackson (Paul Newman), a decorated war veteran, is arrested for cutting the "heads" off parking meters one drunken night.
He is sentenced to two years in prison and sent to a Florida chain gang prison run by a sadistic warden, the Captain (Strother Martin).

Luke fails to observe the established pecking order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of the prisoners' leader, Dragline (George Kennedy).
When the pair have a boxing match, the prisoners and guards watch with interest.
Although Luke is severely outmatched by his larger opponent, he won't stay down.
Eventually, Dragline refuses to continue the fight.
Luke's tenacity earns the prisoners' respect.
Later, Luke wins a poker game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing.
Luke comments that "sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand," and Dragline nicknames him “Cool Hand Luke.”
