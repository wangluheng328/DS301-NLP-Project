He's Tom, from New Jersey, working in L.A. writing greeting cards even through he's an architect by training.
She's Summer, in from Michigan.
Day one is her first day as an AA in Tom's office.
We jump back and forth in time: by day 67, they've become an item when she decides to put aside the lovemaking and just be friends.
Tom, a romantic who's sure Summer is the one for him, wallows in self pity.
We go back to the early days and see the relationship begin.
Summer tells him right away that she doesn't believe in love.
He mopes well past day 100.
Then, as day 500 approaches, they find themselves at a wedding together.
Does the old flame rekindle?
Is Tom right that destiny controls love?
