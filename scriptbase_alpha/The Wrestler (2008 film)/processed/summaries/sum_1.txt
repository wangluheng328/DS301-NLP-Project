Twenty years ago, Randy 'The Ram' Robinson was a successful wrestler; now he is decadent, living alone in a trailer, working part time in a supermarket and wrestling in the weekends.
After a wrestling match, Randy has a heart attack in the dressing room and has heart by-pass surgery; his doctor forbids him to use steroids or wrestle again.
Randy decides to retire and proposes that the stripper and lap dancer Pam "Cassidy" move in with him.
However she does not accept and suggests that he approach his daughter Stephanie to resolve their differences.
Randy gets a full-time job in the supermarket, but he does not deal well with the world outside the arena and decides to return to the sport where he is recognized by his fans.
