Rachel and Sidney decide to get married, and Rachel's friend, Emma, is to be the maid of honor.
Arrangements for a traditional Indian service are made.
However, much to Emma's chagrin, she is replaced by Kym, Rachel's substance-abusing sister who appears shortly before the engagement.
It is on the day of the formal engagement that Rachel and the rest of the family will realize that involving Kym may have been a huge mistake, the past will be re-visited and skeletons will start surfacing from hitherto closed and forgotten closets.
