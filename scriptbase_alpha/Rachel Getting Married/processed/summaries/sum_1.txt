Kym is released from rehab for a few days so she can go home to attend her sister Rachel's wedding.
The home environment is always challenging for a recovering addict, no less so when the visit if only for a few days.
While the sisters feel genuine affection for one another, there is tension in their relationship.
Rachel feels that her father dotes on Kym far too much and Kym is upset to learn that Rachel has selected a friend to be her maid of honor.
Their father is genuinely concerned about Kym's well-being but doesn't see the stress the relationship is causing.
Both women also have to deal with their selfish mother who is clearly more concerned with her own well-being ahead of that of her children.
Underlying the family's dynamic is a tragedy that occurred many years previously and for which Kym is held by some to be responsible.
