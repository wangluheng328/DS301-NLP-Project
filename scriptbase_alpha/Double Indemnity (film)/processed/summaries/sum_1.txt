Walter Neff, the Pacific All Risk Insurance Company's top salesman, returns to his office late one evening, bleeding from a gunshot wound, and dictates a memo to colleague Barton Keyes.
It all started the previous May, when he stopped at a client's home for a routine renewal inquiry and instead met the client's wife, Phyllis Dietrichson.
She asked about buying accident insurance for her husband without his knowledge, and Neff understood that she intended to kill him.
Neff and Phyllis were soon lovers, with Neff taking charge of the killing.
Initially their plan went off without a hitch, but then Neff realized that he had been played and decided to do something about it.
