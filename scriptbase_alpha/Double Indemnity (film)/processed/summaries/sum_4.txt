Insurance agent Walter Neff plots with attractive Phyllis Dietrichson to murder her husband.
After the husband has been tricked into signing a double-indemnity accident policy, they kill him and make it look like an accident.
But Barton Keyes, an insurance investigator and a friend of Neff's, doesn't believe that it was and he pursues the case, linking Phyllis with everyone but his friend.
Neff, meanwhile, is told by Dietrichson's daughter from a previous marriage that she believes Phyllis killed her mother in order to marry her father.
Neff suspects Phyllis of a double cross and confronts her.
