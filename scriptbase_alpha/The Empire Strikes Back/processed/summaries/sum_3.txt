The story of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and the others did not end with the destruction of the Death Star - it continues in "The Empire Strikes Back".
Imperial forces have since driven the Rebels to hide on the ice world Hoth.
But even on such an icy, backwater world, they cannot escape the evil Darth Vader's eyes for long, and he devastates the Rebel base in an assault with the Imperial AT-AT walkers.
Luke flees to Dagobah to begin Jedi training with Master Yoda, while Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia and C-3PO run the blockade of Imperial Star Destroyers in the Millennium Falcon.
The Imperials pursue them across the galaxy and eventually catch up with them on Bespin.
Now Darth Vader plans to use them as bait to lure Luke Skywalker to him, and turns Han Solo over to Boba Fett as a prize to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt.
Luke learns a terrible family secret after losing a swordfight with the Dark Lord.
Will he - and the others - escape the Empire's clutches?
