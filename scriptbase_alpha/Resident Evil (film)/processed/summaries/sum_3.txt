A crack team is sent to the 'Hive', the mighty Umbrella Corporation's secret underground lab complex, which was locked-down by it central computer 'Red Queen', after its staff of 5000 fell victim to nerve gas.
They pick up the secret entrance-resident underground security couple, both suffering from amnesia because of the gas.
The computer's crafty defense soon kills half of the team before whiz kid Chad Kaplan outsmarts it.
Then they find the staff has been turned into cannibalistic zombies, while experimentally miss-bred hell-hounds complete the bloody inferno.
The auto-destruct is programmed in two hours, to prevent out-world infection.
And at least one member has a criminal secret.
