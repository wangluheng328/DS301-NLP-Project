This movie is concerned with intelligence as the division between animal and human, then asks a question: what is the next division?
Technology is treated as irrelevant to the quest--literally serving as mere vehicles for the human crew and as a shell for the immature HAL entity.
Story told as a montage of impressions, music, and impressive and careful attention to subliminal detail.
A very influential film and still a class act, even after 25 years.
