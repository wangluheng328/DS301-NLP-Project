Along one hundred year, mankind lives a long period of war from 1940 to 1966; then a plague destroys half of the worldwide population; and finally a group of scientists reconstruct the society bringing progress.
Each one of these eras is disclosed in the city of Everytown, in England: during the war, the city is completely destroyed.
Then with the plague, the ill people called wanderings are killed by the survivors.
One day, a weird airplane lands and the pilot tells that he belongs to a scientific community called Wings Over the World and their mission is to rebuild the societies, using a gas to make people peaceful.
In 2036, in a modern Everytown, an opponent of the progress raises the population against the system.
