This time, the Man of Steel has his hands full with a trio of super-powered villains who escape from their Phantom Zone prison (remember the weird flying diamond-shaped mirror that scooped them up from the planet Krypton?)
and land on Earth, where all three have powers to rival Superman's own.
How does it all come out?
With a fabulous duel above the streets of Metropolis, and a startling plot twist that neatly ties in Superman's explosive past.
Arch-criminal Lex Luthor plays both ends gleefully against the middle in hopes of a modest reward: Australia.
