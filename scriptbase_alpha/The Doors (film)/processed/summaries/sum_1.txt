Meeting each other in UCLA Film School in 1965, Ray Manzarek, "the musician", suggests to Jim Morrison, "the poet", that they form a band.
With Robby Krieger and John Densmore, that band would become The Doors.
Although the foundation of the group was based on consensus, Robby and John in particular increasingly see front man Jim's on-stage performances self-indulgent - albeit undeniably charismatic - to his controversial lyrics.
His on-stage antics are fueled in large part by excessive drug use.
Outsiders begin seeing Jim as The Doors.
It is that charisma that gets them a record deal with Elektra, and resulting fame.
Despite his popularity with the record buying public, Jim continually has run-ins with those in authority for his anti-establishment behavior.
With him and the band through it all is Jim's longtime girlfriend, Pamela Courson.
Theirs is a rocky relationship, primarily over Jim's open infidelity - including with reporter Patricia Kennealy - and drug-induced erratic behavior.
