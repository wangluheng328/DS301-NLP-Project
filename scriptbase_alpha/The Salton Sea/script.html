                                Tony Gayton

<b>                                                          FADE IN:
</b>
<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
A MAN recumbent on the bed, playing a TRUMPET, his white dress shirt 
defaced by a flower of blood.  The room is ON FIRE all around him.

He is playing Miles Davis' moody, Spanish-influenced SAETA, a haunting 
and lonely piece.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  My name is Tom Van Allen ...
                       (beat)
                  or Danny Flynne ...

A DUFFLE BAG FULL OF MONEY ON THE BED.  The money burning, tiny flaming 
pieces floating around the room.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... I don't know anymore.
                       (beat)
                  Maybe I'll let you decide.  Maybe you
                  can help me, friend.  As you can see,
                  I don't have a hell of a lot of time left.

A PHOTOGRAPH of a woman taped to the inside of a trumpet case. The 
photo is on fire.  Only her smile remains.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Avenging angel ... Judas Iscariot ...
                  Loving husband ... Prodigal Son ...
                  The prince of Denmark ...?

A GREETING CARD on the floor, a teddy bear and the word, 
CONGRATULATIONS! on the front.  The wind from the fire blows the card 
open.  Inside, a BLACKENED BLOOD STAIN.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  All of these? None of these? You
                  decide, friend.  You decide. Trumpet
                  player? Speed freak?
                       (beat)
                  Speed freak.
                       (beat)
                  That's as good a place as any.
                       (beat)
                  But first, a little background on the
                  mad world of the tweaker ..


<b>                                                          FADE OUT.
</b>
<b>                                                          FADE IN.
</b>

<b>INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</b>
EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a glass pipette dripping a clear liquid into a 
glass beaker.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  Methedrene was first distilled by a
                  Japanese scientist before WWII.
                  Hand it to the Japanese, they knew a
                  good thing when they saw it.

<b>INT. JAPANESE ZERO - DAY
</b>
A wide-eyed, jaw-grinding KAMIKAZE PILOT with a death-grip on the 
controls.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  This guy's so tweaked, he probably thinks
                  he can survive this without a scratch.

STOCK BATTLE FOOTAGE - a Japanese Zero crashes into a battleship, 
bursting into a ball of flames.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  Maybe not.
                       (beat)
                  By some estimates, 2% of the Japanese
                  population had a meth problem after
                  the war: factory workers, soldiers,
                  pilots.  Maybe that's why it took two
                  bombs to get 'em to surrender.  A
                  nuclear blast is just a minor
                  nuisance to a determined tweaker.

<b>INT. HOUSE - DAY
</b>
A wide-eyed, June Cleaveresque housewife in a picture-perfect white 
dress vacuums the floor of a picture-perfect house.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O)
</b>                  In the fifties, the housewives got
                  ahold of it.  Dexedrine. Benzedrine.
                  Methedrene ...

She attacks the same spot over and over again, one hand clutching the 
vacuum, the other stiffly holding a cigarette.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Now that's a classic speed freak for
                  you, skinny and cleaning the house.  I'll
                  bet her poor husband never knew what
                  hit him in the sack either.

<b>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
THE LEG OF THE BED rattling and bouncing loudly off the floor.

STOCK FOOTAGE - J.F.K. pumping the hand of NIKITA KRUSCHEV.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  There were even rumors that one of
                  our presidents dabbled with
                  mysterious "energy shots".  Imagine
                  that: a slammer in the White House.

Kennedy talking animatedly.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  If it's true, I'll bet ol' Krushchev
                  never got a word in edgewise.

<b>EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</b>
A sleepy-eyed TRUCKER emerges from his tractor-trailer and approaches a 
loitering HELL'S ANGELS-type.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  By the late 60's the government
                  finally cracked down and sent the
                  whole thing underground.  Bikers
                  controlled the market for a while.

<b>INT.  TRACTOR-TRAILER - NIGHT
</b>
The trucker gripping the wheel with the same death-grip as the 
Kamikaze.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  But now anyone with a basic chemistry
                  kit and the right ingredients can
                  cook it up at home.

<b>INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT
</b>
A CASHIER scanning container after container of COLD MEDICATION.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  Ever see a long-haired tattooed freak
                  buying up all the cold medicine he
                  can lay his hands on at three in the morning.

The cashier looks up at the aforementioned FREAK, a frozen grin 
plastered on his face.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Take it from me, he ain't got no
                  cold.  He's a cook.  Look in his
                  kitchen and you'll find a whole
                  grocery list of unsavory ingredients.

<b>INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
TRACK DOWN the kitchen counter on various containers.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  Drain cleaner, hydrochloric acid,
                  match heads for red phosphorus,
                  ether and of course the cold
                  medicine .. that's for Ephedrene,
                  soon to become Methedrene

CONTINUE TRACKING to a series of BURNERS, BEAKERS and TUBING

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  This guy's a regular Julia Child.
                  Problem is, I'll be even Miss Julia
                  fucks up the bouillabaisse from time to time.

The freaky cook sees something he doesn't like. His eyes widen.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Oh-oh.

<b>EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT
</b>
As the structure explodes.

<b>INT. PARTY HOUSE - UNKNOWN
</b>
Thick blankets and tinfoil taped over the windows.

A huge container of empty beer cans, washed and neatly arranged.

Lines of crystal meth on a mirror as precisely arranged as Nails as the 
Nuremberg rally.

A GROUP OF TWEAKERS in the middle of a binge.

Two skinny women, NANCY and Teresa bent over a drawer-full of neatly 
folded socks on the living room floor.  They stare at the drawer as if 
they were pondering a Rembrandt.

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  It ain't right

<b>                             TERESA
</b>                  You think?

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  Something's off.

<b>                             TERESA
</b>                  We can do better.

They take the socks out and being rearranging them again.

Three guys squeezed onto a couch together: KUJO, JIMMY THE FINN and 
CREEPER.  Kujo is talking a blue-streak.  He makes Dennis Leary took 
mealy-mouthed.

Creeper and Jimmy stare straight ahead, clearly bugging.

<b>                             KUJO
</b>                  So the alphabet, I mean look at it,
                  there's 26 letters.  Why not 27 or 28
                  or 106?  And the vowels: a, e, i, o, u.
                  What the hell is up with that?


<b>                             CREEPER
</b>                  And sometimes y.

<b>                             KUJO
</b>                  What I'm saying is that I love it!
                  It's great. I could go on all night about it.

And he does.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Let's take every letter individually.
                  I mean, let's really break the
                  mother's down.

DANNY is sitting in an armchair.  He is the only one who looks tired.  
He sits there, taking the scene in.

<b>ALL SOUNDS FADE OUT
</b>
<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  And so this is where I find myself.
                  No. I should choose my words more
                  wisely: this is the world I sought
                  out.  The land of the perpetual night-
                  party.  Day swallowing night and
                  night swallowing day.  The crank
                  compressing time like some divine
                  piston on its awesome downstroke.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - SCANNING THE ROOM.  NO SOUND.  The girl's folding the 
socks ... Kujo ranting on ... Creeper and Jimmy the Finn grinding their 
jaws ... the BLANKETS AND TINFOIL ON THE WINDOWS.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  We've been at this for three days ...
                  or is it four?  Tweakerrs, lokers,
                  slammers coming and going, swearing
                  eternal allegiance and undying love
                  for one another, only to wake up
                  after the binge and realize you
                  wouldn't walk across the street to
                  piss on one of 'em if their head was on fire.
                       (beat)
                  Is it three days or is it four?

BACK ON DANNY. He blinks lethargically.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I know what you're thinking. But
                  don't give up on me just yet.  And
                  for God's sake, don't pity me. Don't
                  make any judgments until you've seen
                  my whole story.
                       (beat)
                  And keep your eyes open.
                       (beat)
                  Nothing is what it seems.

Suddenly ...

<b>                             KUJO (O.S.)

Danny and Jimmy the Finn walking towards the front door.

Danny nods.

</b>                  Midnight?

<b>EXT. PARTY HOUSE - DAY 
</b>
As the door opens, Danny discovers that it is TWELVE NOON and the sun 
is blazing.

The party house is revealed as a cheap stucco apartment building 
crammed in the middle of BUSY BUSINESS DISTRICT at a major 
intersection.

Jimmy and Danny slip on sunglasses and brave the light.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Where to?

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  I know a guy.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Lead the way.

They slink along like two albino rat vampires with sunglasses.

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Nice day

<b>                             DANNY

                  I've seen you around.  What's your name?

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Jimmy.  Everyone calls me Jimmy the Finn.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Why's that?

<b>                             JIMMY

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  You don't say.

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Finland is a country.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Well, Jimmy the Finn, let's go score some gack.

<b>INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Danny and Jimmy standing there looking at something OFF SCREEN.  Danny 
and Jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking 
at.

A GUY sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm 
and holding a can of BUG SPRAY at the ready in his right hand.

He is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity.

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Bobby?

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  Shhh.

Bobby never takes his eyes off his arm.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                       (whispering)
                  They're coming.

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                       (likewise whispering)
                  What?

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  The spiders.

Bobby readies the can of bug spray, his eyes widening.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                       (sing-song)
                  I'm ready for you this time.

Bobby lets loose with the spray, dousing his arm.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  Aha! Yeah!
                       (super rapid-fire)
                  You thought you could fuck with
                  Bobby, you thought you could fuck
                  with Bobby, you thought you could
                  fuck with Bobby!

Bobby's mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with 
bug spray.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  With Bobby you thought you could fuck?

Danny and Jimmy wait silently.  Bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied 
he has killed the imaginary spiders.

He looks up at Jimmy and Danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug-
addled confusion.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  Who the fuck are you?

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  It's me ... Jimmy

Bobby squints.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Yeah.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  What can I do for you?

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.

Danny and Jimmy notice something simultaneously.

There is something under the mattress - A HUGE BULGE.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  Don't pay her no mind.

A MUFFLED MOAN from under Bobby.  She is between the mattress and the 
box springs. 

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  Shut the hell up, goddamit!

Bobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand.  New 
MUFFLED SCREAMS from underneath.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  I got no vocation skills!  What the
                  fuck you want from me?
                       (keeps slapping)
                  I got no vocation skills!

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Hey man, take it easy.

Bobby immediately stops.  Looks at Jimmy with incredulity.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  What?

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Come on.  Ease off the girl.

Bobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises.

Danny and Jimmy suddenly staring at a SPEARGUN which is loaded with two 
stainless steel spears.

Bobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at Jimmy, then 
Danny.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  Did you bring the plastic men?

Bobby nods towards something behind Danny.  Danny and Jimmy don't move 
or speak.

                             BOBBY (cont'd)
                  Did you bring the plastic men?
                       (beat)
                  Did you bring the plastic men?

Bobby rubs his nose.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  Did ... you ... bring ... the ... plastic ... men?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Nah, we didn't bring 'em.  That's
                  just your good crank talking, brother.

Bobby tilts his head.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  We were hoping to catch a few ourselves
                  if you'll hook us up.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                       (calmer)
                  You bring the plastic men?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Like I said.

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Fuck man. Come on, Bobby.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  Bobby, Bobby, Bobby.  Rhymes with ...
                       (he draws a blank)

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Hobby?

Bobby twists a smile, revealing speed-blackened teeth.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  That's a good man. I like that.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                       (calmly)
                  Hey, Bobby, look .. What you got
                  going with your old lay, it's none
                  of our business. We're just a couple
                  of dope fiends trying to score.

Bobby lowers his speargun.

<b>                             BOBBY
</b>                  Two eight balls?

Jimmy breaths a sigh of relief.

<b>EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
Danny and Jimmy exit the room, closing the door behind them.  Danny 
looks at Jimmy.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced.
                  He wouldn't have did nothin'

WHAP, WHAP! Two spears plunge through the cheap door, stopping inches 
from Danny's head.

They run like hell.

<b>EXT. SKY - DAY
</b>
TIME LAPSE.  The sun plunges down.  The sky turns black.  The moon 
races up and down.  The sky lightens.  The sun races up and down.  
Night comes again.

<b>INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Everyone crashing.  Jonestown, post Kool-Aid.  It looks like they have 
all simultaneously fallen asleep where they were standing or sitting.

Danny stirs awake.  Looks around.  He stretches.  KNOCKING OVER A 
<b>BOTTLE OF BEER.
</b>
ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS the beer SPLATTER to the floor.  IT IS 
<b>UNNATURALLY LOUD.
</b>
DANNY staring intently at the spilling liquid.

The beer pools up on the floor.

Danny transfixed by the image.

The last few drops of beer LOUDLY splashing down.

<b>EXT PAYPHONE - NIGHT
</b>
Danny on the phone.



<b>                             DANNY

                  Tanner and Garcetti

He hangs up.

<b>EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</b>
Danny waiting in the shadows.

A car, sans headlights, pulls into the alley and stops.

Danny emerges from the shadows, opens the back door and lays on the 
back seat.

<b>INT. CAR - SAME
</b>
Two guys in suits in the front, TANNER and GARCETTI.  Tanner. blue eyes 
and SHAVED HEAD, an air of ex-military around him.  Garcetti: swarthly 
and serious, a MIASMA OF BAD-ASS ATTITUDE.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                       (lying on the back seat)
                  I've got a hot one.

<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  You go, boy.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  If it's all the same to you, I'd
                  rather not dish right here in the
                  middle of Crankville.

Tanner drives out of the alley.

<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Well, you know what they say, just
                  because you're paranoid, doesn't mean
                  everyone's not out to slice your
                  balls off and shove 'em down your throat.

<b>EXT. PART - NIGHT
</b>
Danny, Tanner and Garcetti outside the car in a deserted park. Danny 
pacing.

<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  You got a name?

<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  What?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of

<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  No last name?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  It was all pretty informal.  Didn't
                  have a lot of time to exchange
                  pleasantries.

Garcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges 
over.

<b>                             GARCETTI
</b>                  This the guy?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  It speaks!

The humorless Garcetti hands Danny a "WANTED POSTER".  Bobby's mug shot 
glaring.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  That's him.  He's a lot prettier in
                  person though.

<b>                             GARCETTI

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Dude is bugging.  Transparent
                  spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.

<b>                             GARCETTI

<b>FLASHBACK - INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Garcetti looks at Danny with contempt.  They head back to the car.


                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey Tanner ... you be careful, okay?

<b>                             TANNER

<b>                             GARCETTI

</b>                  Hey, you want me to do all your work

Garcetti throws Danny up against the car.  Nose-to-nose.

<b>                             GARCETTI
</b>                  I'll tell you why you didn't help -

                  snitch.  You're a bottom feader,

Garcetti lets Danny go. Stomps off.

<b>EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
A GAGGLE OF ONLOOKERS, including a NEWS CREW, watching from the parking 
lot.

BOBBY'S WOMAN screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a 
Bobby's sheet-covered body.

A SWAT TEAM packing up nearby.  One of them suddenly does a graceful 
little Tai-Chi gesture.

A LITTLE GIRL clutches at the screaming woman's legs.

REVEAL DANNY, amongst the onlookers.  His expression gives nothing 
away.

A ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb 
and runs into a storm drain.

As the blood SPLATTERS to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy 
water. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.

<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - GARDENA - NIGHT.
</b>
The place cries out "YOU HAVE FINALLY HIT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM!"

Danny exist the stairwell and approaches his door.

A WOMAN ONE DOOR DOWN FROM DANNY'S ROOM struggles with her groceries.  
When she goes to open the door, one of the  bags breaks, spilling its 
contents onto the floor.

Danny walks over.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                       (approaching)
                  Let me help you with those.

She scoops up the groceries and hurries into her room.  Slamming the 
door behind her.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (loud through the door)
                  And to think Miss Manner was
                  living down the hall from me and I
                  didn't even know it!

There is a can on the floor.  Danny bends down to pick it up.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Hey, you left a can of ...

He looks at the can.

<b>INSERT - CAN 
</b>
The label is in CHINESE.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... some Chinese looking shit out here.

No reaction.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I'll just leave it by the door here.
                       (beat)
                  I'm going now!

After a moment, the door swings open.  Danny is holding the can out 
with a big smile on  his face.
                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  You really oughta be more careful.
                  This is not a good neighborhood.

The woman smiles.  A pretty smile.  Sad too.

<b>                             WOMAN

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  You did the right thing.
                       (handing the can over)
                  What is this stuff anyway?

<b>                             WOMAN

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Yummy.

She smiles again. World-weary.  Sweet. Those eyes.  Sad.  Sexy.  Sad 
and sexy.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  My name is Danny Flynne.
                       (off her silence)
                  And you are?

<b>                             WOMAN
</b>                  Colette Aragon. Thank you, Danny.

She closes the door abruptly.

<b>INT. RESIDENTAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
The burning room from the opening scene.  Danny's dirty clothes on the 
bed.

He emerges from the shower, a towel wrapped around his waist.  There is 
a BIG STAR-SHAPED SCAR on Danny's shoulder.

He walks over to the closet, takes a METAL LOCKBOX from the top shelf 
and puts it on the bed.

Pulls a key from his pocket and unlocks the box. He sits there staring 
at the contents for a moment, then gingerly takes them out ...

... CLOTHES.  A white dress shirt, black slacks and wingtips.

<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Danny dresses in his clothes, combing his hair.  He goes back in the 
lock box and pulls something else out ...

... A TRUMPET CASE.  He walks over to the cheap vanity and sits down in 
front of the mirror and stars for a very long time.

<b>                             DANNY

                       (beat)
                  I play the trumpet.

He slowly opens the trumpet case revealing a GLEAMING HORN inside.  
Runs his fingers along the length of it and up to ...

... A PHOTO OF A WOMAN taped to the inside of the lid.  A self-
conscious smile on her face like she's uncomfortable with having her 
picture taken.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (distant)
                  My name is Tom Van Allen. I play the trumpet.

He takes the trumpet from the case - A CHECK from a LIFE INSURANCE 
COMPANY and a DRIVER'S LICENSE with Danny's picture and the name TOM 
<b>VAN ALLEN.
</b>
                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  My name is Tom Van Allen and I play the trumpet.

He starts to play.  "Saeta" again.

AN IMAGE appears on THE BLANK WALL BESIDE HIM.  MOVE OFF DANNY AND UP 
<b>TO THE IMAGE.
</b>
IN THE IMAGE - A HUGE LAKE in the middle of the DESERT.  CONTINUE 
<b>MOVING IN ON IMAGE AS WE CUT TO ...
</b>
<b>EXT. SALTON SEA - SUNSET (FLASHBACK)
</b>
Danny and THE WOMAN FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH sitting on the shore.  Watching 
the sunset. She is his wife, LIZ.

Danny playing "SAETA" on his trumpet.

Danny and Liz are alone, except for the myriad birds, silhouetted by 
the falling sun.

A gust of wind rushes across the lake, blowing Liz's hair all around 
her face.

A dying fish on the waterline, gills pumping for oxygen.

Danny finishes playing.

Silence.

<b>IMPORTANT: DANNY WILL BE KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.

<b>                             LIZ
</b>                  That's so ...

<b>                             DANNY / TOM

<b>                             LIZ

<b>                             LIZ

                  A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN
                  is nothing short of dazzling in his
                  interpretation of Miles Davis'
                  haunting, moody piece.

<b>                             DANNY/TOM

<b>                             DANNY/TOM

<b>                             LIZ
</b>                  I was talking about Miles.

Danny playfully tackles her to the ground.

<b>                             DANNY/TOM
</b>                  You, madam, are a heartless wench.

<b>                             LIZ

<b>                             LIZ
</b>                  It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.

Danny starts kissing her over and over again.

<b>                             LIZ
</b>                       (laughing)
                  Tom! Gross!

She finally pushes him off.  He rolls off of her and snuggles up next 
to her, spooning her in the sand.

<b>                             DANNY/TOM
</b>                  You know how I make that song

                  I think of what my life would be like
                  without you.

Liz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny.

<b>                             LIZ
</b>                  Tom, let's spend the night here.

BACK ON THE IMAGE as Danny and Liz walk away from the shore.

The sun sinks completely below the horizon.

A long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals.

The dying fish breaths its last.

Danny (at the vanity) closes his eyes.

<b>SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
</b>
The trumpet goes back in the case.

The lid is closed.

The case goes back in the box.

The neatly folded clothes are laid on top.

The box goes back to the shelf.

The light in the closet is turned off.

<b>EXT. DESERTED PARK - NIGHT

Danny and Tanner sitting across from one another at a picnic table.

Tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out SEVERAL HUNDRED 
<b>DOLLAR BILLS.
</b>
Danny watching silently.

Tanner puts the bills in an envelope, licks the flap, seals it and 
slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it.

The envelope lays there between them for the following conversation.

<b>                             DANNY

</b>                  Hard to compare the people you're

<b>                             DANNY

</b>                  Garcetti thinks everything is shit.
                  He doesn't even like dolphins.

Danny smiles.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  I'm serious.  He hates 'em.  You ever
                  hear of anyone who didn't like dolphins?

Tanner shakes his head and smiles.


<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself

<b>                             TANNER

<b>                             GARCETTI
</b>                  He knows somebody ratted him.

<b>                             GARCETTI

                  having his homies hang a Colombian
                  necktie on whoever it was.

Garcetti leans in close

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  You know that thing where they slit
                  your throat and pull your tongue out

Danny knocks Garcetti's hand away and stands up.  Garcetti stalks him.

                  Apparently they call it a necktie
                  because it hangs down about yay long
                  and looks very similar to a tie.
                  Isn't that weird, Danny?  Isn't that
                  weird?

<b>                             DANNY

Danny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone.

A PICKUP TRUCK slowly winds its way up the access road towards Danny.

Danny stands up.  Dusts his pants off.

The truck stops nearby.  The strains of GARTH BROOKS from inside.

Danny approaches.  The passenger's side window rolls down revealing ...

... A BAD-ASSED ASIAN DUDE behind the wheel. He wears a cowboy hat and 
a rodeo belt.  He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man.  This is BUBBA.

An AIRBRUSH painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba 
astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela 
Anderson-type on the saddle behind him.

darting around for potential assassins.

He has nothing to worry about with this crowd, harmless alcoholics all.

Jimmy The Finn enters and approaches Danny.  Danny signals for Jimmy to 
go to the back, then gets up and follows him, carrying two beers.

<b>EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Danny walking home.  Sparse traffic on the street. He walks with his 
head down and his hands thrust in his pockets.

A RED CAR approaches from the opposite direction. It SLOWS as it passes 
Danny.

Danny looks over.

The DRIVER is obscured by the reflected glare of a streetlight, but it 
is obvious that he is staring right at Danny.

Danny plays it cool. Keeps walking.

The red car pulls a SLOW U-TURN.

Danny hauls ass.

The red car catching up.

7Danny runs down a service street which runs through the back of a 
series of apartment complexes.

The red car follows, slowly prowling the street.

Danny squeezed behind a dumpster, watching.

It is now too dark to see the driver.  The car comes to a stop.

Danny hugging the dumpster tight.

Another car pulls into the tight street, behind the red car.  The 
driver of the other car SOUNDS HIS HORN.  The red car speeds off.

Danny walks quickly the other way.

<b>INT. BARE APARTMENT - NIGHT

A WAY-TOO-YOUNG BLACK KID stares DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, an ARRAY OF

gold jewelry, his hair all wet jerry-curl.

<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT

A TRASHY LOOKING DUDE banging on Colette's door.

Danny at his door, fumbling with his keys, watching the dude.

<b>                             DUDE

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Goodbye now. Nice meeting you.

<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny enters.  AN ARGUMENT ENSUES NEXT DOOR between the dude and 
Colette.

The sounds of a struggle.  Colette screams.  The dude yelling at the 
top of his lungs.  A LOUD SMACK. SILENCE.

Colette sobbing. The dude talking in hushed tones, contrite.

<b>EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

A spray painted rusty Chevy Vega belching black smoke.  All of the 
lights are broken.

Jimmy driving.  Danny in the passenger's seat, looking down at ...

                  crank, they had to cut his nose off.
                  He's got a plastic one though.

Danny wonders what he's getting himself into.

<b>EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - DAY
</b>
A sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert.

A GUY passes out in the front yard.  A DOG sniffs at him, then starts 
pissing on him.  He never moves.

A PILE OF DEAD PIGEONS near the driveway.

CLOSE ON POOH-BEAR - he does indeed have a prosthetic nose.  It almost 
blends in with his face but not quite, making it that much more 
disconcerting.

He takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe, holds it, then blows a 
long exhale.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Okay, here we go gentlemen ...

A REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR trundles out of the garage and along the 
driveway. Inside the car, FOUR PIEGEONS, their bodies wrapped in tape.

Pooh-Bear working the remote control device.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Zapruder?

A GUY filming the whole thing with a super-8 camera.

<b>THIRD SHOOTER

The three men open up simultaneously.

Pooh-Bear takes the camera from "Zapruder".

Pooh-Bear picks at a plate of SCRAMBLED EGGS on his lap.



<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's

<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             POOH-BEAR

Not wanting to offend him, Danny concedes.  Pooh-Bear shovels some eggs 
into Danny's mouth.

                  Hell, I make better use out of it

                       (beat)
                  Oh, by the way ...

Pooh-Bear takes something from the kitchen counter and tosses it on the 
table ...

... a store-bought package of COW BRAINS.

QUICK FLASH BACK: REVEAL that Pooh-Bear has been standing at the meat 
section in a GROCERY STORE. He is looking down at the package of COW 
BRAINS in his hand.

                  Hmm. Good price.

Pooh-Bear tosses the package in his cart and walks away, whistling.

A DAPPER OLD MAN in a wheelchair crooning a Muzak-like version of Lou 
Reed's WALK ON THE WILD SIDE on a cheapo Karaoke set-up in the back of 
the bar.

                  Sugar Plum Fairy never once gave it away.
                  Everybody had to pay and pay ...

Danny, Jimmy, Kujo and Creeper sitting in a booth.

Jimmy and Creeper are amped, jaws grinding, eyes bugging.

Kujo rambles on but Danny isn't listening. He looks exhausted, his face 
is pinched, there are bags under his eyes.  He scans the bar, stopping 
on ...

... Colette AND HER TRASHY DUDE BOYFRIEND

Colette sees Danny looking.  Smiles at him.  Danny returns the smile 
until the trashy dude looks over.  Danny looks away.

<b>                             KUJO

                  my wife's pimp knows a guy who works
                  at Cedars Sinai medical lab.  They're
                  getting a very special delivery a
                  week from this Friday.

<b>                             JIMMY

<b>                             KUJO
</b>                  Better than drugs.

Kujo leans in and lowers his voice

<b>                             KUJO
</b>                  Bob Hope's stool specimen

                  We're gonna boost it.


<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Why in God's name would we want
                  to do that?

<b>                             KUJO
</b>                  So we can sell it.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  To who?

<b>                             KUJO
</b>                  I don't know.  A collector.  Fuck

<b>                             CREEPER
</b>                  He is a national treasure.

Danny shakes his head in amazement, then looks back at Colette again.  
She sneaks another look at him.

ON THE TABLE - Kujo slides a drink glass in front of him.

<b>                             KUJO
</b>                  Check it out.  This is the lab.

<b>                             KUJO
</b>                  Don't worry about it.

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  I just want to be straight on the
                  details.  Can I taste it?

<b>                             KUJO
</b>                  No, you can't taste it.  It's the fucking
                  lab! Now shut up.

Danny amused by the conversation.  He sees something out of the corner 
of his eye ...

The boyfriend kissing Colette roughly.  She obviously isn't enjoying 
it.

Danny watching intently.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Danny, come on. If I'm gonna let you
                  in on the opportunity of a lifetime,
                  the least you can do is pay
                  attention.

Danny turns back to the table. Kujo slides another glass over.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  This is the courier

<b>                             CREEPER

                  He's the same size as the office. It
                  doesn't ring true.

Kujo rolls his eyes.  He uses a peanut instead.

<b>                             OLD MAN (O.S.)
</b>                  And the colored girls sing doot-de-doot ....

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

A courier exits from the elevator carrying a medical sample case.



<b>                             KUJO (O.S.)
</b>                  He delivers at four o'clock on the
                  nose every Friday.  Alpha team will
                  be in the elevator with the courier.
                  That'll be Danny and Creeper.

MOVE INTO THE ELEVATOR - Creeper standing in the corner alone, asleep 
on his feet, drool trickling down his mouth.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Every member of the team will be
                  equipped with night vision goggles, a
                  police scanner and two-way radios.

The elevator door closes on the dosing Creeper.

<b>INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

He slides over two peanuts behind the courier peanut.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  ... number two team, which will be
                  me and Jimmy, will be positioned in
                  the stairwell at the other end of the hall.

Kujo slides over two more peanuts.

The trashy dude heads into the bathroom.  Danny sneaks another look at 
Colette.  This time, she gives him a big smile.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)
</b>
Kujo emerges from the stairwell, also alone, approaching the courier.

He is wearing shorts, a tank top and after-ski boots.  He has a big 
powdery crank donut around his nostrils.
                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  With alpha team following from the
                  elevator, number two team will
                  approach from the stairwell, cutting
                  the courier off before he reaches the lab.

Creeper still fast asleep inside the elevator.   He wakes with a start, 
breaking down into a karate stance.

<b>INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT
</b>
The courier peanut is now surrounded by the other peanuts and the 
cashew.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Facing superior numbers and an array of high-tech weapons, 
                  the courier will have no choice but to comply with our demands.

<b>INT. HALLWAY - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)
</b>
Kujo and the courier playing tug-of-war with the case.  Kujo points a 
dustbuster vacuum at the courier like it was a gun.

<b>INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

Jimmy listening intently, takes some of the peanuts.

<b>                             KUJO

<b>                             JIMMY
</b>                  I thought you were done.

Jimmy pulls peanut paste from his mouth and mounds them up on the 
table.

                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Now here's the beautiful part.  The
                  getaway.  Both teams will rappel
                  right down the center of the
                  stairwell, change clothes and walk
                  right out the front door like nothing
                  happened.

<b>INT. HOSPITAL - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo tumbling head-over-heals down the metal steps.  He gets to his 
feet, a bloody mess.

The kit has sprung open, sending shit samples everywhere.

Kujo quickly scrapes as much as he can back into a container and runs 
off.

<b>EXT. CEDARS SINAI - DAY (FLASH FORWARD)

Kujo bolts out the front door, into the street and directly into the 
path of ...

Trashy dude goes to Colette.  It looks like he wants to leave and she 
doesn't.


                             KUJO (cont'd)
                  Danny!

Trashy dude grabs her by the back of the neck, lifts her off the stool 
and pushes her out the front door.

Danny watches her exit.

<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT (LATER)

Danny approaches his door. Stops. 

Colette is sitting in the hall, head in hands, sobbing. 

Danny starts to say something. Stops. Goes to this door. Stops again.

                  She nods.

                  Well...good night then.

She looks up. That face. Those eyes. Everything about her says "Get 
involved."

                  See. No matter how bad things are,

                  Problem is, it's usually half-full of

Bubba takes a plastic-wrapped bundle of money from his pocket.  Tosses 
it on the table.

Tanner and Garcetti ensconced in an alley diagonally across the street.

Garcetti pointing a LONG-RANGE PARABOLIC MICROPHONE at the burned out 
building.  He and Tanner wear earpieces, which are attached to the

Bubba exits the building and disappears around the corner.

Danny now alone. He picks up the bundle of cash.  Turns to leave when

... Tanner and Garcetti enter the building.  Danny turns and runs the 
other way.

Tanner approaches him.  Danny backs into a corner.

                  This is a joke, right?  You put him

Garcetti is mum.  Tanner raises his fists.  Danny covers his face.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Come on Tanner ... don't ...

Tanner starts swinging but SOMETHING UNEXPECTED ...

<b>TANNER HITS LIKE A WIMP.
</b>
The punches have absolutely no effect.

Danny can't help it.  HE STARTS LAUGHING.  Tanner throws some more 
creampuffs.

Garcetti shakes his head with shame.

<b>                             TANNER

                  I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like

This makes Tanner even madder. His punches become wilder and even less 
effective.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Garcetti, do something.

Garcetti tires of the whole show.  He pulls a small SHOCK GUN from his 
pocket, switches it on and sticks Danny behind the neck with it.

Danny crumples to the floor.  Tanner kicks him in the face.

Garecetti squats down next to Danny.

<b>                             GARCETTI

                  talking about.

Garcetti jams the stun-gun into Danny's crotch.  DANNY HOWLS.  Garcetti 
lays off.  Danny lays there whimpering.

                  We just listened to the whole thing.

Danny gaped-mouthed. He can't believe it.

</b>                  You think you're so god damned smart,
                  don't you?

The dynamic has suddenly changed in the trio's relationship.  Tanner is 
now the bad cop.

                             TANNER (cont'd)
                  Well, you played the wrong mark this
                  time, asshole.

<b>EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - NIGHT

Danny approaching the building, we hear shots ...

... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets.  Danny ducks into a 
liquor store and watches from the window.

The red car cruises slowly past.

Danny squinting, trying to make out ...

... THE LICENSE PLATE NUMBER.  A street light illuminates the tag 
momentarily.  A VANITY PLATE: IFORGIV.

Danny frowns, not sure that to make of it.

<b>INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Colette and Quincey lying in bed.  THE LILTING SOUND of Danny's trumpet 
wafting in the air.

Quincey is fast asleep.  Colette lays there, eyes open, listening to 
the coolly hypnotic strains of Miles Davis' "Generique."

<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Danny in his good clothes, sitting in front of the mirror, playing his 
trumpet, staring at the photos of his wife.

<b>INT. COLETTE'S ROOM - SAME

Colette now sitting on the floor of the adjoining wall with her arms 
around her knees.  She closes her eyes and leans her head against the 
wall, soaking in the music.

Danny continues playing.  He sneaks down a look at ...

... A GREETING CARD on the vanity in front of him.  The word, 
"CONGRATULATIONS" printed on the front.

THE FLASHBACK IMGERY appears on the wall behind him again.  MOVE from 
Danny to the image as we ...

The car jolting slowly back and forth over the bumpy road.

Danny driving. Liz in the passenger seat looking pissed.

The Salton Sea can be seen far below in the distance shimmering under a 
full moon.

<b>AGAIN.  REMEMBER, DANNY IS KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.

                  There's a house up there. I'll go ask

Liz sees the run-down old house.

<b>                             LIZ
</b>                  You think that's a good idea?

<b>                             LIZ

Danny steers the car onto the narrow dirt approach to the house.

Danny doesn't answer.

                             LIZ (cont'd)
                  I never once asked you to stop
                  playing. I wouldn't dream of it. So
                  don't take your low self-esteem out
                  on me.

Danny continues to ignore her.

<b>                             LIZ

DANNY lying on the bed, reliving the moment.  THE IMAGE STILL PROJECTED

But the DANNY IN THE IMAGE never answers.

<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</b>
It is raining buckets outside.  Danny sleeping soundly.

The roof of Danny's room is leaking, PUDDLING UP ON THE FLOOR NEAR HIS 
<b>BED.
</b>
Danny's eyes pop open. He lays there rigidly.  LISTENING TO THE WATER.

<b>ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS THE WATER PATTERS AND PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR.  
</b><b>IT IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.
</b>
<b>INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT
</b>
The bar is almost empty.

Danny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back 
of the room - the through-line of Davis' "All Blues." 

<b>                             COLETTE (O.S.)

Danny looks up. 

<b>                             DANNY

                  By the way, I'm not looking for a

                  Where's Quincey?

<b>                             COLETTE

<b>                             COLETTE

Colette sits down on the piano bench next to Danny. 

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Please keep playing.

He continues. She sits there listening for a few moments. 

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  That's nice. What is it?

<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             COLETTE

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Just a fucked-up guy who played
                  beautiful music.

<b>                             COLETTE

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Nah. I'm strictly minor league...
                  except for the fucked-up part.

Danny continues to play. 

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Dude played his soul right out the
                  end of the horn. No false notes.
                  Always honest.

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  And you admire that?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  It's the only way to play.

Colette slides closer. 

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  Is that how you play?

<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             COLETTE

She pulls even closer. 

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  No deep dark secrets?

She goes to kiss him. Danny stops playing. Pulls away from her. 

<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             COLETTE

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  It gets me through the day.

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  You really need to lighten up.

She puts her hand on his leg. 

                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Just relax.

He moves his leg away. 

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Look, I can't help you with Quincey

<b>                             COLETTE

<b>                             COLETTE

                  Harlan Dale Monty a.k.a. Pooh-Bear.

<b>                             GARCETTI

<b>                             TANNER

Danny's eyes dart back and forth between Garcetti and Tanner.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Come on! Who is it?  Domingo's boys?

Garcetti and Tanner break out laughing.

</b>                  Car is registered to a Mrs. Nancy Plummer.

Danny reacts to the name, not listening to the rest of what Garcetti 
and Tanner have to say.

</b>                  She's 57 and she's been teaching

Danny lost in thought.

<b>                             GARCETTI

Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny.  Jimmy gets out and 
hands Danny the keys.

ON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU!

Danny sighs. Walks to the back, rips the sign off and gets in the car, 
leaving Jimmy with the sign.

Danny burns rubber.

<b>EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Danny being led towards a trailer by TWO OF POOH-BEAR'S MEN. LITTLE 
BILL AND BIG BILL. Little Bill is big and Big Bill is little.

<b>INT. HOUSE - SAME
</b>
Pooh-Bear sitting in a recliner, obscured by shadows when Danny and his 
escorts enter.

A WIRE CAGE IN THE CORNER, SOMETHING MOVING AROUND INSIDE.  It too is 
obscured by shadows.

Pooh-Bear doesn't look up. He is preoccupied with something in his hand 
which he is cleaning with a toothbrush.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Pooh-Bear, my man.  What's up?

Pooh-Bear doesn't respond. Continues brushing.

<b>                             BIG BILL

Danny closes his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear.

<b>                             DANNY

Danny looks to the two Bills for help.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Big Bill.

Big Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his 
jacket and points it at Danny's head.

<b>                             BIG BILL
</b>                  Argh, matie. I'm a pirate.

Little Bill drops Danny's trousers.  Danny about to object when he is 
started into silence.

The saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face.  He 
isn't wearing his prosthetic nose.  A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD 
BE.  He looks like some obscene human bat.

Pooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it 
under the light.


                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  Introduce him to Captain Steubing.

He pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked.

The Bills escort Danny over to the cage.  There is A GIGANTIC CRAZED 
<b>WEASEL INSIDE.
</b>
The cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  You'll have to excuse him, he ain't
                  ate for over a week.

The weasel is foaming at the mouth.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                  That and the rabies.  Don't make for
                  a happy weasel.

<b>                             DANNY

                       (off Pooh-Bear's silence)
                  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.

<b>                  
</b>                  Big Bill pushes Danny up to the cage, which comes up to about waist 
                  level.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Captain Steubing thinks you might
                  work for the police.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  What?!

Pooh-Bear holds up his hand.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Don't address me.  I didn't make the
                  accusation.

<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Uh-uh-uh ...

He points to the cage.   Danny looks down at the weasel, which is 
trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Jesus Christ.
                       (to the weasel)
                  Um ... I'm not .. Captain Steubing.
                  I'm not working for the cops.

The weasel continues to gnaw.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  He don't believe you. Big Bill.


<b>                             BIG BILL
</b>                  Drop your package in the cage.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  My what?

<b>                             BIG BILL
</b>                  Put your pee-pee through the hole.

There is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the 
Plexiglas from Captain Steubing.
<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  This is fucking crazy!

Big Bill pulls back the hammer on the gun.

<b>                             BIG BILL
</b>                  Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Oh fuck ... oh Jesus ...

Danny's eyes dart quickly over to Little Bill, who like everyone else, 
is watching the weasel.

Little Bill is wearing a big, filthy pea coat with A LARGE TEAR on the 
side.

Danny still hasn't complied with Pooh-Bear's order.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Shoot him.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Okay! Okay!

From behind, we see Danny bend slightly, dropping his privates into the 
cage.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (eyeing the wild rodent)
                  Oh my God ... oh-my-fucking-God ...

Danny tries to stay calm, shoots another look at Little Bill who is 
standing right next to him.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Now get talkin'

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  I didn't fucking do anything! I
                  swear to God!

Pooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half an 
inch.

THE WEASEL bolts for the opening, gnashing its teeth, trying to squirm 
through.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  You got something to tell Captain
                  Steubing, you'd better do it now.

The weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas.

Danny uses the diversion.  He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own 
jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILL'S JACKET between 
the coat and the lining.

No one notices.

Pooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more.  The weasel is able to get his 
head through the hole.  He bares his filthy teeth.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                       (rapid-fire)
                  Captain Steubing, listen to me.
                  You're after the wrong guy. This is
                  the fuck you should be talking to.

He nods towards Little Bill.  Pooh-Bear cocks his head.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Jimmy told me that Little Bill's been
                  shorting Pooh-Bear ... settin' up his
                  own stuff on the side.

<b>                             LITTLE BILL
</b>                  That's a pack of discharge.

Danny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear, who listens intently.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  It's true. Jimmy saw him flashing a
                  pimp role at a bar the other night ...
                  said he was dissin' your ass in front
                  of one of your customers.

Pooh-Bear rises slowly.  Approaches the triumvirate.

Danny keeps one eye on ...

... the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening.


<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Man'll say a lot of thing when he's
                  sporting weasel food for a pecker.

<b>                             LITTLE BILL
</b>                  Damn straight.


<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Least I can do is check it out though.

Pooh-Bear pulls a chrome .45 from his waistband.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Can I pull my dick out now?

Pooh-Bear limply aims the .45 at Little Bill.

                             POOH-BEAR (cont'd)
                             Big Bill
<b>

<b>                             LITTLE BILL
</b>                       (holding up his arms)
                  Go ahead. I got nothing to hide.

Big Bill checks all of Little Bill's pockets, coming up empty.

The weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Can I pull my dick out?

Danny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat.

<b>                             BIG BILL
</b>                  He's clean.

Danny can't believe it.  But when Little Bill lowers his arms, a big 
roll of cash protrudes from the hole.

Pooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately.

<b>                             LITTLE BILL
</b>                  What?

He follows their gaze to the cash.

<b>                             DANNY
</b><b>                  CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                       (eyes on Little Bill)
                  Yeah.

Danny extracts himself from the cage just as ...

... the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in 
the cage.

                  to be sure of who I'm dealing with
                  from time-to-time.

Pooh-Bear nudges the baggie towards Danny.

                  Take it easy.  You passed.

Nancy and Verne look at one another.


<b>INT. PALOS VERDES HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Danny and Verne sitting at the dining room table.  Nancy brings in a 
pot of coffee.  Verne eyes Danny silently.  Danny won't look him in the 
eye.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  All right, Nancy, how'd you track me down?

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  Billy Sutcliffe said he saw you at a
                  bar down in Gardena a few weeks ago.
                  Said you looked so bad, he barely
                  recognized you.

Nancy pours the coffee.

                             NANCY (cont'd)
                  Billy's a cop now, you know.

<b>                             VERNE
</b>                  Highway Patrol.

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  He said you were ... the people you 
                  Were with ... well ...

<b>                             VERNE
</b>                  Said you were a drug addict.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Maybe I should just go.

Danny pushes away from the table.  Nancy grabs Danny's wrist.

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  No. We want to help you, Tom.

Danny stays put.

                             NANCY (cont'd)
                  I know everyone deals with grief in
                  their own way.  I know how hard it is
                  to find closure.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Closure? How do you find closure
                  when her killers are still running
                  around out there?

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  I found forgiveness in my heart for
                  the people who killed my daughter. I
                  gave my grief to Jesus Christ.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Is that what you want me to do?  Put
                  it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out
                  in the afterlife?

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  You've got to deal with this sooner
                  or later, Tom. You can't keep
                  hiding.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Maybe I am dealing with it.

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  I know it's not my place to pass
                  judgement on you but ...

Danny looks at the shrine to Liz on top of the piano.



<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Then why don't I see any pictures
                  Of me up there?

<b>                             VERNE
</b>                  That was my idea.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  You never did like me much, did you
                  Verne?
                       (beat)
                  And you can't stand it that I walked
                  out of there alive and Liz didn't.
                  You think I'm a coward,
                  don't you?

Verne's silence is answer enough.



                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I don't blame you for hating me.  At
                  least I understand that.
                       (back to Nancy)
                  But forgiving the butchers who killed
                  Liz well I'm having some trouble
                  with that one.

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  Love your enemies, bless them that
                  curse you, do good to them that hate
                  you, and pray for them which
                  despitefully use you, a persecute
                  you.

Danny touches Nancy's hand tenderly.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  I'm genuinely happy that you found
                  some peace, Nancy. But you can't
                  forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And
                  you can't forgive for me.

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  Your hatred makes them stronger and
                  you weaker.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.
                       (beat)
                  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night 
                  she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a
                  chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?

<b>                             NANCY
</b>                  It's not too late to show her you're sorry.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  How?

Verne slams his hand down on the table.

<b>                             VERNE
</b>                  By not disgracing her memory!

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  What does that mean?

<b>                             VERNE
</b>                  You might as well be spitting on her
                  grave every time you put drugs up
                  your nose.  Or did you just
                  conveniently forget that it was drug
                  dealers who killed my daughter?

Verne glares at Danny.  No forgiveness in his heart.

                             VERNE (cont'd)
                  You ever think you might be buying
                  drugs from the very people who took
                  her life?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  You don't understand.

<b>                             VERNE
</b>                  Understand what?

Danny starts to say something.  Stops.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Nothing. It's ... it's complicated. I
                  just want you to know ... I'm not what
                  you think I am.

<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny sitting at a table, the lockbox open in front of him.

He is endorsing the back of a life insurance check.  His Tom Van Allen 
driver's license laying next to it.

<b>A KNOCK AT THE DOOR

</b>                  Please open the door, Danny.

He pockets the check and the license, closes the lockbox and goes over 
to the door.

Colette standing on the other side.  Her FACE AND ARMS ARE BLACK AND 
<b>BLUE WITH BRUISES.
</b><b>                             DANNY

He lets her come in.  Colette looks away.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Colette ... You've gotta leave.

<b>                             COLETTE

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  I need my paycheck.

<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  It's not that easy. I just got a

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  You always been this stubborn?

Colette cracks a crooked smile.

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  From day one.
                       (beat)
                  I was a breach birth. They tried for
                  hours to turn my little butt around.
                  But I wouldn't let 'em.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Ass first into the world.

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  I been that way ever since.

Danny smiles.  He gently touches her eye.  Colette reaches up and 
touches Danny's bruised eye.
                             COLETTE (cont'd)
                  Look at us.  What a pair.

Colette leans in to kiss him, but they bump bad eyes.

<b>                             COLETTE/DANNY
</b>                  Ouch.
                  They laugh.

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  Can we try that again?

They kiss again.  Deep and long.  Danny suddenly pulls back mid-kiss.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  I can't.

Colette goes to touch him. He pulls away.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I can't.

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  Why not?

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  I just can't. Okay?

Danny paces uncomfortably.

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  What's wrong, Danny?

<b>                             DANNY

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  No. I want to know what the hell

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  I can't tell you.

Colette comes to a slow realization.

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  There's someone else, isn't there?

THE FLASHBACK IMAGERY suddenly FLICKERS TO LIFE on the wall behind 
Danny - THE MOONLIGH SALTON SEA.

Danny freezes.  Looks up at Colette.
<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Yes.

Colette waits a beat, then turns to leave.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Don't go.

                       (she stops)
                  Stay and talk to me, please.

Something about Danny's voice - a raw vulnerability - which we haven't 
seen in him before.  MOVE OFF of Danny and ONTO THE FLASHBACK IMAGE.

Danny's car parked out front.

<b>INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT
</b>
A CHUBBY GUY sitting on the couch in his underwear, watching A MEXICAN 
WESTERN.  He sits there with wide eyes, GRINDING HIS JAWS.

Danny, Liz AND BO, the affable owner of the house, looking at a map on 
the kitchen table.

<b>                             BO

<b>                             DANNY/TOM
</b>                  You got a bathroom I can use before

Danny heads down the hallway, Liz looks a little uncomfortable.

                             LIZ (cont'd)
                       (trying to make small talk)

<b>                             BO

<b>INT. BATHROOM - SAME
</b>
Danny peeing WHEN HE HEARS ANOTHER CAR PULL UP OUTSIDE.  CAR DOORS OPEN 
<b>AND CLOSE.  HUSHED VOICES  OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM WINDOW.
</b>
Danny finishes up.  He steps up onto the tub and peaks out the bathroom 
window.

<b>THROUGH THE WINDOW - TWO FIGURES CROSS IN FRONT OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF 
</b><b>THE CAR.  THE ENGINE REMAINS RUNNING.
</b>
Danny frowns, not sure what to make of it.  He steps down from the tub 
and is just about to exit when THE FRONT DOORS IS KICKED OPEN AND SHOTS 
<b>ARE FIRED.
</b>
<b>VOICES SHOUTING.
</b>
Danny freezes, not sure what to do. His eyes dart around for a weapon.

He picks up a large plumber's wrench and goes to the bathroom door.

<b>MORE SHOTS.  SEMI-AUTOMATIC FIRE.
</b>
SEVERAL BULLETS slam through the bathroom wall, one striking Danny in 
the shoulder.

He slumps to the floor.

THE PANDEMONIUM continues in the front room.

There is a BULLET HOLE about the size of a fifty cent piece in the wall 
next to Danny's head.  He puts his eye to the hole and looks out.

DANNY'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning the room.  Stopping on ...

... LIZ. In the confusion, she has managed to hide from the intruders.  
She is squeezed into a tiny space between the sofa and the wall.  She 
clings tightly to the curtains, her hands shaking violently.

ONE THE CURTAIN RINGS - pulled taught by Liz's grip.

Danny adjusts his gaze through the hole.

THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning to the other side of the room.  Bo and the 
other guy sprawled on the floor. INTRUDER ONE stands over them, only 
his legs visible.

BACK ON LIZ - scared to death, clinging to the curtains.

The curtain rings are pulled to the breaking point.


<b>INTRUDER ONE
</b>Let's go!

INTRUDER TWO emerges from the back carrying a small nylon bag.  They 
start to head out the front door when ...

... one of the curtain rings breaks with a METALLIC "TING".

ON DANNY - freaking. His eyes shooting back to Liz.

<b>SILENCE.
</b>
Listening.

Then the CREAKING FOOTSTEPS of Intruder One approaching. It takes an 
eternity.

Liz can't possibly see Danny through the hole but it looks like she is 
staring directly at him, her body rigid with fear.

Danny grabs the wrench again.  Tries to get to his feet but slips back 
down, either too weak from loss of blood or just plain scared.  His 
hand is shaking violently.

He looks through the hole again.

THROUGH THE HOLE - Liz still staring at Danny. THE FOOTSTEPS CONTENCE 
at a agonizing slow pace, then stop.

A GUN, ever so slowly, enters FRAME. EXTREME CLOSE UP on Liz's eyes as 
they widen.

EXTREME CLOSE UP on Danny's eye peering through the hole. A SHOT IS 
FIRED. His eye closes.

ON DANNY-his mouth opens to scream BUT NOTHING COMES OUT.

And with that it is all over.

Danny tries to get to his feet again. Fails, His eyes flutter. All is 
silent except for A FAINT LIQUID SPATTERING.

LONG SHOT-Back on the Salton Sea, placid and silvered with moonlight.

<b>INT RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM- NIGHT (LATER)

Danny and Colette face-to face- in profile, silhouetted by the IMAGE of 
the sea.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  She died knowing that I was a coward...
                  that I didn't lift a finger to help her.

<b>                             COLLETTE

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  No, you're wrong, I tried to tell 
                  myself the same thing but I could
                  have gotten up. I could have done 
                  something.

<b>                             COLETTE

                  Nothing could be worse then this 
                  slow death I'm living now.

Colette puts her arms around him and hugs him tight. The IMAGE OF THE 
SEA FLICKERS AND FADES behind them.

CLOSE ON DANNY-holding Colette.

                  for a change.

Danny goes over to the dresser. Takes out a baggie of meth.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I want you to hide this
                  somewhere where Quincy

<b>                             COLETTE

Danny stalks her.

                  Don't make the same mistake I did,
                  Colette. Do something while you 
                  have a chance. Do it for your daughter 
                  before something happens.

                  He helds the baggie out again. Colette 
                  reluctantly takes it from him.

<b>                             COLETTE

                  the street and watch. You'll know 
                  when it's safe to go back.

Colette goes to protest. Danny puts his hand to her mouth the same way 
she did to him earlier.

<b>                             DANNY

Danny stares at Jimmy with pity.

laughing.

                  before it was over? How I sneak away 
                  for cap-naps? How when the crank 
                  came around to me, I always said I'd

Jimmy slack-jawed.

                  You asked me how I always keep my

                  I thought that maybe if you knew that

Danny looks self-conscious.

                             TRAHN (cont'd)
                  About a year and half ago, Mr. Van 
                  Allen's wife was murdered at a meth 
                  lab out near the Salton Sea. No one 
                  was ever apprehended for the crime 
                  but local authorities have always 
                  assumed it was a hit and grab 
                  perpetrated by rival drug dealers. 
                  That is, until Tom here took it upon 
                  himself to conduct a one-man 
                  undercover operation at great risk to 
                  his own personal safety.

</b>                  Cool it. We got business.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Yeah, dickhead.

Danny moves over and plops down in the guys seat.

UNDER THE TABLE - Danny fumbling with the gun, trying to untape it 
without being too obvious.

Pooh-Bear unzips the bag. Inside, a lot of cash.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Oh my, oh my.
                       (beat)
                  Big Bill, come take a look at this.

Big Bill is behind Danny, over by the sink.  He pulls his FLINTLOCK and 
walks over.

Danny continues trying to get the gun loose.  Something catches his eye 
<b>...
</b>
... the MICROWAVE OVEN DOOR is open, casting a reflection of the room 
behind him.  Big Bill approaches Danny, pointing the gun at Danny's 
head.

The other men ease back from the table a little.

UNDER THE TABLE - Danny still can't get the gun loose.

ON THE REFLECTION - Big Bill right behind Danny.  He raises the 
flintlock.

Danny bugging.  He rips at the gun. Too late.

Big Bill goes to fire.  Using the reflection, Danny ducks at the last 
instant.

Big Bill FIRES.

The guy across the table takes the mini-ball in the chest.

ALL IN AN INSTANT - Danny extricates the gun.  Turns on Big Bill, who 
sees the gun and holds his hands up.

Danny SHOOTS TWICE, the bullets blowing through Big Bill's hands and 
thumping into his chest.  Big Bill crumples.

When Pooh-Bear goes to pull his gun from his waist-band, it discharges, 
shooting him in the thigh.

The muzzle flash ignites his pants leg.  POOH-BEAR HITS THE FLOOR, 
SCREAMING, slapping at the fire on his leg.

Danny wheels on the other two guys at the table, who are going for 
their guns.  Danny opens up on them with the Glock, flooring them 
before they can get a shot off.

OUTSIDE - still descending the bluff, Tanner and Garcetti hear the 
gunfire.

INSIDE - Danny turns on Pooh-Bear, who sits there staring at his 
injured leg.

Danny puts the gun to Pooh-Bear's head, closes his eyes and starts to 
pull the trigger.

Pooh-Bear lifts his gun and SHOOTS DANNY IN THE TORSO THREE TIMES.  
Danny collapses.

Pooh-Bear gets to his feet.

<b>                             POOH-BEAR
</b>                  Oh lordy, oh lordy, oh lordy.  Pooh-
                  Bear done shot himself.

He's in shock.  He grabs the duffle bag from the table and staggers 
down the hallway, into the living room.

OUTSIDE - Tanner and Garcetti at the front door, listening. They pull 
their ski-masks on, take out their guns, then silently enter.

INSIDE - gunsmoke abounds.  One of the guys MOANS on the floor.

Tanner and Garcetti enter the kitchen, guns drawn and ready.  They 
survey the scene.

Bodies everywhere.

Big Bill lays there dying, staring with confusion at the stigmata in 
his hands.

Danny lying in a heap, next to Big Bill.

Suddenly, they hear POOH-BEAR MUMBLING from somewhere in the house.

Tanner signals for Garcetti to take point.  They head down the long 
hallway, slowly and silently.  When they are gone ...

... Danny stirs on the floor. His eyes open. He opens his shirt and 
checks his torso REVEALING THAT HE IS WEARING HIS BULLET-PROOF VEST.

He struggles to a sitting position, in great pain from the impact 
bruises left by the bullets.

He picks up his gun, gets up on wobbly legs and follows Tanner and 
Garcetti down the hall.

ON DANNY as he creeps down the hall.

<b>INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT
</b>
Exiting the bathroom and creeping towards the front room.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Anybody there?

<b>ONLY THE SPLATTERING LIQUID SOUND.
</b>
Danny continues.

He stops at the end of the hall.  His eyes go wide with fear and 
revulsion.

<b>THE LIQUID SOUND BECOMES LOUDER AND LOUDER UNTIL IT IS ALL THAT CAN BE 
</b><b>HEARD.
</b>
Liz is still in her hiding place behind the end of the couch.  Her head 
is resting comfortably on the arm of the couch.  She looks fine.  There 
is even a slight smile on her lips.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Liz?

Then he notices it ...

... a widening pool of BLOOD seeps from under the couch like some 
living thing.  More blood patters down from some UNSEEN WOUND on the 
side of her head.

Danny staggers towards her.

Her eyes flutter slightly.

Danny sits next to her. Holds her hand.  There is nothing he can do.

Liz tries to speak.  Can't.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  I'm here, Liz. I'm here.

She squeezes his hand.  Then goes limp.

<b>INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
Danny continues down the hall, remembering.

<b>INT. CREEPY HOUSE - SALTON SEA - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
</b>
Danny sitting there with Liz in a pool of blood.  He notices something 
on the floor ...

... LIZ'S PURSE, the contents spilled on the floor.  A GREETING CAR 
with a teddy bear and the word "CONGRATUALTIONS" on the front.

Danny goes over and picks up the card.

<b>INSERT - CARD
</b>
He opens it  ... "YOU'RE A DADDY!"  A home pregnancy test taped inside, 
the reading is POSITIVE.

Danny drops the card.  Stares down at it as ...

... the blood from the floor pools out and engulfs the card.

<b>EXT. SALTON SEA - NIGHT
</b>
On the placid sea as DANNY'S HORRIFIC SCREAM resounds from the house in 
the distance.

<b>INT. POOH-BEAR'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
ON DANNY standing in the hallway, staring, his face a blank.

ON POOH-BEAR - cooking up a huge dose of meth with a lighted hundred 
dollar bill.

He draws the meth into a syringe then turns on the stereo with a 
remote.

<b>A YODELING INSTRUCTION TAPE BLASTS FROM THE SPEAKERS.
</b>
Pooh-Bear prepares to dose, looking for a vein in his neck, never 
noticing ...

... Garcetti's gun moving to the back of Pooh-Bear's head.

Pooh-Bear about to plunge the drugs when GARCETTI FIRES.

Pooh-Bear pitches forward, dead.  The syringe falls to the floor.

Tanner and Garcetti standing over him.  They pull their ski masks off.

<b>                             GARCETTI
</b>                  Get the bag.

Garcetti holsters his weapon and picks up the bag of money from the 
floor.

                             GARCETTI (cont'd)
                  Let's get out of here.

A GUNSHOT.  Garcetti goes down where he stands.  He lays there 
twitching like a rabbit.

Tanner staring down the sucker's end of Danny's gun.

<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  Danny?

<b>                             DANNY

Tanner frowns.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Tom Van Allen

Danny raises his gun.

<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can

<b>                             DANNY

                  You're in the bathroom.  You've been
                  shot in the shoulder ...

Danny shoots Tanner in the shoulder.  He collapses to the floor.

ON GARCETTI - his eyes flutter and open.

Danny walks over to Tanner and stands above him.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  ... there's two guys with masks and
                  guns in the other room about to kill
                  your wife.

Tanner looks at Danny, confused.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But you know if you go out there,
                  they'll kill you, too.  You'll both
                  die.  What do you do?

Tanner realizes what Danny is talking about.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Do you go out there and die like a
                  man or do you live to fight another day?

Tanner doesn't answer.

                             Danny (cont'd)
                  What do you do?

Still no answer.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Answer the question!

Tanner is ghost white, loosing blood quickly.

                             Danny (cont'd)
                  What do you do!

<b>                             TANNER

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Answer the fucking question!

When Danny goes to shoot Tanner again ...

... Tanner pulls a K-BAR KNIFE from the back of his belt and plunges it 
into the back of Danny's gun hand.  The gun discharges, missing Tanner.

Danny drops the gun.  Tanner snatches it up.

Tanner immediately has the gun inches from Danny's head.  Danny freezes 
<b>...
</b>
<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  Does that answer your question?
                       (beat)
                  I fight.
                  I fight and I die like a man.
                       (beat)
                  You're a fucking coward, Flynne.  You
                  lived like one and now you're gonna
                  die like one.

Danny looks up at the gun, his face a blank.

QUICK FLASHES of all the shots Danny fired with the Glock.

- TWO at Big Bill
- FOUR at the guys at the table
- ONE at Garcetti
- THREE  at Tanner

<b>THE KID AGAIN.
</b>
<b>                             KID
</b>                  ... and a TEN ROUND magazine ...

ON DANNY.  Still staring at the gun. He knows the gun is empty. He 
notices something on the floor ...

<b>... THE LOADED SYRINGE.
</b>
                             KID (cont'd)
                  Or did I say ELEVEN?

Danny trying to remember.

                             KID (cont'd)
                  Which was it, mister?  Was it ten or was it eleven?
                       (beat)
                  Pretty big fucking difference if you ask me.

DANNY starts chuckling. Looks up at Tanner.


<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  It doesn't matter.

Danny looks down at the syringe again.  Tanner sees it too.

<b>                             TANNER
</b>                  Too late to be a hero.

Danny picks up the syringe.

Tanner pulls the trigger.

INSIDE THE GUN - MOVING SLOWLY towards the firing pin as it springs 
forward toward CAMERA with a LOUD CLICK.

<b>THE GUN IS EMPTY.
</b><b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Ten it is.

Danny jams the SYRINGE INTO TANNER'S THROAT all the way down to the 
plunger, dosing him with the meth.

Tanner goes down, blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe.  
His eyes roll back as he  convulses from the drugs.

Danny struggles to his feet.

Tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked-out Pentecostal in 
the throws of a holy possession.

Danny pulls the syringe from Tanner's throat.  A LONG WET WEEZE 
<b>ESCAPES.
</b>
Suddenly, A NOISE BEHIND DANNY.

Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny, rocking slightly 
back and forth, a bullet hole in his cheekbone.  He looks brain dead.

Danny doesn't move. TANNER STILL WHEEZING.

Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun, but can't.  He keeps 
looking down at his hand, trying to get it to obey.

Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti.

Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood.  He 
looks down at his hand.

He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with.

Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny.  TANNER'S WHEEZING 
<b>CONTINUES.
</b>
<b>                             DANNY
</b>                       (softly)
                  You're dead.

Garcetti nods slightly.  He goes to a kneeling position, then curls up 
on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies.

Danny goes over to the couch and sits down.

Danny with his head in his hands, emotionally and physically exhausted.  
<b>TANNER WHEEZING LOUDER AND LOUDER.
</b>
CLOSE ON DANNY'S FACE.  Blank.  Devoid of anything.  He stuffs 
Garcetti's gun into his own mouth, hand shaking.

He takes the gun out.

Stuffs it back in again, shoving it way down, almost gagging on it.  
The barrel clatters against his teeth. He takes it out again.  THE 
<b>WHEEZING CONTINUES.
</b>
Danny starts crying.  Lifts the gun halfway again, then drops it.

He jumps up.  Goes over to the still-wheezing Tanner and empties his 
clip into him.  When the clip is spent, Danny keeps pulling the trigger 
... over and over again.

He stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and 
again.

<b>                                                          FADE OUT.

<b>INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Danny dressed in his "Tom" clothes. He limps over to the bed and picks 
up the trumpet case.  Carries it over to the mirror.

Danny staring at his reflection. He lights a cigarette.

<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  My name is Tom Van Allen. I'm a

Danny smiles.

</b>                  Nah, you're Danny Flynne.

He turns.

COLETTE and QUINCEY standing there.  Quincey holds a nine millimeter 
with a muzzle suppressor.

<b>                             QUINCEY
</b>                  You're a motherfucking rat.

He shoots Danny in the stomach.  Danny slumps to the floor.  His 
cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed.

Colette freaks.

<b>                             COLETTE
</b>                  You said you wouldn't kill him!

Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white 
shirt.


<b>                             DANNY
</b>                  Colette, what happened?  Didn't the cops ...

                  'em some bad information.

Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs.

Danny looks from Quincey to Colette.  Colette looks away.

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  You fuck with the Mexicali Boys, this

UNDER THE BED - the cigarette smoldering on the carpet.

                  Domingo thought you might be the one

Quincey looks at Colette

                             QUINCEY (cont'd)
                  So I brought in a rat of my own.

Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded.

<b>                             QUINCEY
</b>                  Bitch played you like a squeezebox, Romeo.

Danny can't help from laughing at the irony.  Beads of sweat are 
forming on his blanched face.  He looks at Colette with a wry smile.

<b>                             DANNY

                  But I told them I wouldn't do it .. I

Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe.  He looks over at 
Quincey.

taken.

</b>                  Your daughter needs you.  Go.

The fire continues to spread.  Colette kisses Danny on the lips.  
Quincey pulls her away.

Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door, 
cutting off any escape.

Danny breathing hard. He gets up.  Staggers over to the mirror where 
his trumpet is.

He opens the case and takes the trumpet out.

He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second, 
a smile on his lips.

He starts to play SAETA.

<b>INT. BURNING ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
Back to the opening scene.  The whole room ablaze.  Danny lying on the 
bed, playing the horn.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  So what is it?  Who am I after it's
                  all said and done?

Pieces of the roof start falling in.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Tom Van Allen or Danny Flynne?
                       (beat)
                  Avenging angel or plain old Judas?

He stops playing.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                       (weakly)
                  You decide, friend.  You decide.

He closes his eyes.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I'm too tired ... so you decide.

He drops his trumpet and lays his head back.

</b>
<b>BLACK SCREEN
</b>
THEN BLURRY, VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames.

CLOSE ON DANNY'S HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  Oh shit. What is this?

Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway.

Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Am I dead?

A linoleum floor rushes underneath.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Linoleum.  This must be hell.

Danny head sags, finds himself staring at ...

...  A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF.  The tattoo smiles and speaks.

<b>                             TATTO
</b>                       (warped, distorted)
                  Hang in there buddy.

Stairs rush by underneath.  Then another hallway.

DANNY'S P.O.V.  - a bright white light at the end of the hall.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  Oh no.  What a fucking cliché.

On Danny's face, floating through the hall.  His eyes fluttering.

MOVING TOWARDS the light.  Closer.  Closer.

Danny's eyes close, his head droops.

<b>                                                          FADE TO WHITE:

CLOSE ON DANNY as his eyes flutter and open.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - an image slowly coming into focus ...

... JIMMY staring down at him with concern.

Danny blinks his eyes again.  Looks up at ...

... A PARAMEDIC working on him.

Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy.

Jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit-eating grin on his 
face.

The paramedic continues to work on Danny.  His eyes slowly close.

<b>                                                          FADE OUT.

</b>
<b>EXT. THE CITY - DAY
</b>
Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop.  He looks like a new 
man.

<b>                             DANNY (V.O.)
</b>                  Well, I've had some time to think
                  about it and it's pretty simple after
                  all.  I guess it's like the man said -
                  "Man is the measure of all things."
                  I should know.  I ran the gamut.
                  Avenging Angel, Judas, loving
                  husband, prodigal son, prince of
                  Denmark.  I was all of those things.
                       (beat)
                  Tom Van Allen got his revenge.
                  Good for Tom.  And Danny Flynne? He
                  got gut-shot for being the low-life
                  rat that he was.  Sucks for him.
                       (beat)
                  But as far as I'm concerned, they're both dead.

Danny looks through the window of the shop.

Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But what about this guy? Who is he?

Danny enters the shop.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  To tell you the truth, I don't know yet.

<b>INT. COFFE SHOP - SAME
</b>
Danny takes a seat at the counter.  Colette turns and sees him.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  But I like his chances.

They stare at one another for a beat, then smile.  Colette pours him 
some coffee.

                             DANNY (cont'd)
                  I really like his chances.

They strike up a conversation as we ...
