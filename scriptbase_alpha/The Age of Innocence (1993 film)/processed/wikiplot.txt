Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an affluent lawyer in 1870s New York.
He is engaged to May Welland (Winona Ryder), a beautiful but conventional socialite.
Newland begins to question the life he has planned for himself after the arrival of Mayâ€™s cousin, the exotic and sophisticated Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer).
Ellen is a passionate woman seeking a divorce from her abusive husband, a Polish count.
This has made her a social outcast and greatly displeases her family, who are afraid of scandal.
As Newland grows to care more and more deeply for Ellen, he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the society to which he belongs and with the prospect of a passionless marriage with May.
He must decide whether he will follow society's dictates, or those of his heart.
