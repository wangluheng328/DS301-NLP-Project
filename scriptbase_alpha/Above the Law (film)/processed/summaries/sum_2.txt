Nicolo "Nico" Toscani is the son of Sicilian immigrants, and Nico studied martial arts in Japan.
His talents got the attention of CIA, which recruited him and sent him to help in some covert operations on the Vietnamese-Cambodian border in 1973.
There, he became disgusted with Zagon, one of his superiors who used the Vietnam war as an opportunity to get into the money making business of smuggling drugs.
Nico left the CIA, and Nico now works as a Chicago detective and he has a wife named Sara.
Nico discovers a major drug deal that involves Salvadorian drug dealer Salvano.
Nico and his partner Delores "Jax" Jackson arrest Salvano, but Salvano is released at the request of Federal officials.
Not listening to the orders to back off, Nico discovers that Salvano is connected to Zagon, who wants to fund an invasion of Nicaragua.
When Senator Harrison puts the heat on Zagon and his group to reveal their undercover operations, Harrison becomes Zagon's next target.
Sara's life is put in danger when Nico tries to protect Harrison from Zagon, who will stop at nothing to keep Nico out of the way.
