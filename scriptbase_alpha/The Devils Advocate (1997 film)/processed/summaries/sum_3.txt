This is a movie about a young, seemingly unbeatable lawyer from a small town in Florida.
When he gets an offer to go to New York and work for a large firm, him and his wife Mary Anne jump at the opportunity.
Soon, Mary Anne begins to dislike the city and Kevin's job.
She urges him to quit and go back to Florida but he sees her as insane.
The longer he works however, the more his wife makes sense, but is it too late?
