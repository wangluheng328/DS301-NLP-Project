In New York, Margaret Tate is a successful self-made chief-editor of the Ruick & Hunt Publishing and loathed by her coworkers.
Margaret lost her parents when she was sixteen and is tough with the employees of the office.
Her executive assistant and aspirant editor Andrew Paxton has been working with her for three years without any recognition.
When Margaret has problems with the immigration due to an expired visa and is threatened with deportation, she blackmails Andrew to agree to marry her.
In return, he would be promoted to editor and she would publish his book.
Meanwhile, the skeptical clerk of the immigration department Mr. Gilbertson schedules an interview with Margaret and Andrew after the weekend.
The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Andrew's grandmother and Margaret is welcomed by his warming family.
Over the weekend, she grows closer to Andrew's family who ask her to marry Andrew in their barn, a family tradition in the Paxton family.
And the tension increases when Mr. Gilbertson appears out of the blue in Sitka promising to charge Andrew for fraud.
