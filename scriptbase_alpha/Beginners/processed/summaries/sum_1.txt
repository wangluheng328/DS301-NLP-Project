2003 in L.A. Oliver's 38, grieving: his father Hal has died, six years after Oliver's mother.
After her death (and 45 years of marriage), Hal comes out of the closet.
In flashbacks we see Oliver with Hal during his last year of life, in love with Andy, a younger man.
Flashbacks include Oliver's childhood with a lonely and quirky mom, which, with his grief, explains his diffidence and emotional unavailability.
At work, he's drawing a series of sketches he calls the history of sadness.
At home, he bonds with Hal's terrier.
Oliver meets a French actress, Anna, in town for a month, rootless, living in hotels as she goes from film to film.
Is she to be his route to a beginning?
