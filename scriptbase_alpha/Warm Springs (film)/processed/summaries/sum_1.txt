Following an early and promising political career, Franklin Delano Roosevelt is stricken with polio in 1921 at 39 years of age.
This film follows his struggle with his paralysis, the refuge he took in an obscure and run-down Georgia health spa, and the family pressure to return to public life and politics.
Perhaps the most significant battle he fought with the stigma of paralysis was not in the eyes of others but in his own mind.
