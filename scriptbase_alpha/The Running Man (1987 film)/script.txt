The Running Man - TITLES 

Based on the novel "The Running Man" by Richard Bachman 

Screenplay by Steven E. deDouza 

Directed by Paul Michael Glaser 

  

INTRODUCTION 

By 2017 the world economy has collapsed. Food, natural resources and 
oil are in short supply. A police state, divided into paramilitary 
zones, rules with an iron hand. Television is controlled by the state 
and a sadistic game show called "The Running Man" has become the most 
popular program in history. All art, music and communications are 
censored. No dissent is tolerated and yet a small resistance movement 
has managed to survive underground. When high-tech gladiators are not 
enough to suppress the people's yearning for freedom......more direct 
methods become necessary.

Move in and check it out. 

Ben
Roger. Moving in. Food riot in progress. Approximately fifteen-hundred 
civilians. No weapons evident. 

Over Military-Radio
Proceed with plan alpha. Eliminate anything moving. 

Ben
I said the crowd is unarmed! There are lots of women and children down 
there! All they want is food for-gods-sake! 

Over Military-Radio
As you were Richards. Proceed with plan alpha. All rioters must be 
eliminated. 

Ben
The hell with you I will not fire on helpless people! Abort mission. We

Saunders
Affirmative 

Over Military-Radio

Ben
You're a hell of an actor Laughlan. 

Laughlan
Who's acting? 

Ben
Well you're still alive aren't you? 

Laughlan
Use that code. 

Weiss
Ok. 

Ben
Weiss, what's the hold up? C'mon! 

Weiss
The linking computer's denying the code. It must be the walls in here, 
it's blocking the signal. It's not happening. 

Ben
Then we try it outside. Move!

INSIDE CARAVAN WITHIN LOS ANGELOS JUNKYARD 

MIC WORKS ON REMOVING LAUGHLAN'S RESTRAINT COLLAR 

Laughlan
Do you believe this shit? Twenty-four hours a day. 

Mic
Seven days a week. 

Ben
Don't listen to it. 

Laughlan
I worry about the kids. The network shuts down schools. The kids are 
either in hiding or getting basic training, brain-washed by the TV. 

Weiss
We can jam the network once we find the up-link to the satellite, then 
we'll broadcast the truth. 

Ben
The truth, hasn't been very popular lately. 

Mic
Can't find the code or the up-link. Don't know where the network hid 
something that big, but they managed. Er Stevie, would you mind? 
Goodbye my lovely. 

BOOM! RESTRAINT COLLAR THROWN IN AS SAFE WHERE IT BLOWS UP 

BEN SITS IN CHAIR TO HAVE HIS COLLAR REMOVED 

Mic
Your one of the cops who locked up all my friends, burned my songs. 
People like you took this country, and turned it into a jail. 

Laughlan
We don't want his death on our hands. 

Mic
He's a cop. He's the Butcher of Bakersfield. 

Weiss
C'mon Mic. Now you can see through that crap. It's network propaganda. 

Laughlan
We don't know that. 

Weiss
We know we wouldn't be here if he hadn't helped us. 

Laughlan
We also know he's not one of us. 

Mic
Perhaps now he's seen too much. 

Ben
I've seen to much? All I've seen is a bunch of low foreheads who think 
they can change the world with dreams and talk. It's too late for that. 
If you're not ready to act give me a break and shut up. 

Mic
Nothing worth losing your head over though, aye? 

Ben
You got it. 

  

ROAD LEAVING LOS ANGELOS JUNKYARD 

UTILITY VEHICLE ARRIVES 

Laughlan
Well, there's your ride. It's all set.Ben
Whoa, nothing like first class.Mexican Guy
Senorita, senorita. You want to come in? Yeah. Hey, you too? 

Ben
I guess this is it. Now you, Weiss, stay out of the national database. 
And you, Laughlan, stop trying to teach the constitution to the street 
punks. See you at the ten year prison re-union. 

Weiss
You can still join us if you want to. 

Ben
No thank you. My brother's going to get me out of the city. Plus I'm 
not into politics, I'm into survival. 

Laughlan
Nowadays friendship's the same thing. 

Ben
Laughlan, save it for the written test. Good luck. 

Laughlan
Yeah, to all of us.

AMBER'S TV:Captain Freedom
Are you ready for pain? Are you ready for suffering? If the answer is 
yes, then you're ready for Captain Freedom's Work-out. Phil
Yes it's America's own, Captain Freedom. Ten time national champion. 
The greatest stalker to ever play the game. All right now all you 
runners, ready, get set, go! 

TV News announcer
We interrupt Captain Freedom's Work-out to bring you this urgent news 
bulletin. 

Female News Reporter
The city police are engaged in a door-to-door search for a Benjamin A. 
Richards. Known as the Butcher of Bakersfield, Richards, a former 
police officer, was the helicopter pilot who went berserk eighteen 
months ago firing without warning on a crowd of innocent civilians. 

If you see this man do not approach him, contact your local law 
enforcement agency. He is considered armed and dangerous. We will now 
return... 

  

BEN PUTS A HAND OVER AMBER'S MOUTHBen
Don't make a sound, you understand? Who are you? A friend of my 
brothers? 

AMBER SLAPS BEN'S HAND AWAY

What are you talking about? Ben
This is his apartment.Amber
I moved in last month. They said the last tenant was taken away 
for...Ben
...yes...Amber
...for re-education. 

AMBER IS CHASED AROUND HER APARTMENT 

Amber
Help! Are you the man!?! He's entered and is in my house! And Butcher 
of Bakersfield is in my bathroom! 

Captain Freedom (on Amber's TV)
That's the ticket, no pain, no gain. 

AMBER IS CAUGHT BY BEN 

Amber
Let go of me! Let go! Let go! 

Ben
Listen to me because I'm only going to say this once. This is all a 
lie, I was framed, I'm completely innocent. 

Amber
Yeah sure. 

Ben
Now be quiet and stay still. I'm out of here in five minutes.

Baby-face March. 

Damon
Are you kidding me? Next. 

Tony
How's this one? Case one-fourteen. School teacher. Killed his wife and 
mother-in-law at a faculty dinner with a steak knife. 

Damon
See I like that quality. He's the sort that the neighbours say 'such a 
nice man and never too busy to say 'hello''. But look at him he weighs 
a hundred and twenty pounds, he wouldn't last thirty seconds. Who else? 

Brenda
What about those bank robbers? The ones that made that suicide pact. 

Damon
Did they commit suicide? 

Brenda
Obviously not Damon. 

Damon
Then they're unreliable. 

Tony
I got a friend at a talent agency, maybe they've got an axe-murderer or 
something... 

DAMON'S ATTENTION DRAWN TO A TV IN THE NEXT ROOM 

Damon
Hello Gorgeous. 

Tony
...somebody with stamina. 

Damon
Tony. Tony. Pipe that feed in here now! Take a look at this. This is 
footage of yesterday's prison break. Hey. Look! Look at that mother 
move. Is he beautiful? Who is he? 

Tony
Are you kidding? That's Ben Richards. 

Damon
The cop from the massacre. Sensational. Perfect contestant. I want 'im! 

Brenda
You can't have him. 

Damon
Why not? 

Brenda
Damon, you know our contract, we never get military prisoners. 

Tony
Who's a military prisoner? He's still at large. 

Damon
Yeah, well they'll get him for me. Cadre's can't have it both ways. 
They want ratings, I can get ten points for his biceps alone. Hello? 
This is Killian. Get me the justice department, entertainment division. 
No hold that. Operator, get me the president's agent.

It's my synthesiser set-up. I'm a musician. Well I'm really...I'm 
really...a singer. I...I...I write music for the network. Have you 
heard the theme song 'You give me joy, you give me strife'? Well I 
wrote that. 

Ben
You must be very proud of yourself. 

Amber
It's really nothing. 

BEN SEARCHES THROUGH A CARDBOARD BOX IN A CUPBOARD 

Ben
Look at this. They're all on a censored list. And look what we have 
here. This looks like black-market clothing. And you wrote the network 
jingle. 

Amber
Come on. Everybody does it. 

Ben
Money. That's what I need, money. 

Amber
That money's not going to do you any good. You won't be able to do 
squat. You don't have a travel pass. 

Ben
You do. (Ben un-clips travel pass from one of Amber's shirts) Now I do. 

BEN PRESSES KEYS ON AMBER'S COMPUTER 

Ben
Let's see. Now where should we go. Maybe some place warm. I need to 
work on my tan anyway. You see you get so pale in prison. Here you are. 
Good. Now, I'm going to untie you, and your going to get dressed, and 
your going to come with me. 

Amber
Oh yeah? Well why should I? 

Ben
Because I'm going to say 'please'.

You'll never pull this off you know. You're unarmed, out-numbered. Face 
it, you're screwed. So why don't you forget about all this and turn 
yourself in? 

Ben
You know, you have a very negative attitude. And remember, I can break 
your neck like a chicken's. 

Travel Pass Guard
Travel pass. 

Ben
What a beautiful day today. I can practically taste the Pina Colada's 
already. Right, sweet-heart? 

Travel Pass Guard
Miss. 

Ben
Oh you didn't put it in your purse again did you? Last vacation she put 
my credit cards in there and we couldn't find them for a week. Oh dear. 
[to Travel Pass Guard] Could you hold on to this please? 

Impatient Lady (behind them in cue)
You wanna move it up there? We've got a plane to catch. 

Travel Pass Guard
Go on. Go on.

Can't live with them, and you can't live without them.

Hi cutie-pie. You know one of us is in deep trouble. Do you know who I 
am? 

Ben
Sure, I've seen you before. You're the ass-hole on TV. 

Damon
That's funny, I was going to say the same thing about you. I saw the 
video of your prison break. Sensational. Ben, I think we might be able 
to help each other out. I've got brains and you've got talent. No, 
you've got more than that, you've got talent, you've got charisma, and 
you've got balls. That's why I pulled a few strings to get you here. 
And that's why I'd like you to volunteer to appear on tomorrow's 
broadcast of The Running Man. 

Ben
Fuck you. 

Damon
Hahaha. You're a brilliant conversationalist Ben. A trifle limited but 
brilliant. Take a look.

Weiss
How long are they going to keep us here? 

Laughlan
They've got Richards too. 

Weiss
I hope not. Lord knows what they'd do to him. 

  

Damon
Isn't that your old school teacher buddy there, huh? And there's that 
other one who helped you in the prison break. 

Ben
Weiss, Laughlan. What are you going to do with them! 

Damon
Well, that's really up to you, Ben. You see, I created The Running Man, 
but I don't make the rules. I've got a contract with the government, 
they send me the convicts and I put them on the show. Well you've seen 
it right? You know at least you've got a chance, but your buddies, Ben, 
they're the B-list. So if you don't do the Running Man tomorrow, Weiss 
and Laughlan are gunna go on in your place. What do you say?

BEN ESCORTED ON STAGE 

Studio Audience
Booo! 

BEN CLOTHES TORN OFF TO REVEAL A 'RUNNERS' OUTFIT 

Studio Audience
Yey! 

Damon
Now Ben Richards could have gone to prison and paid the penalty but 
instead he volunteered for The Running Man...and have a chance at our 
fabulous prises like a trial by jury, suspended sentence, maybe even a 
full pardon like our previous winners, Wittman, Price and Hadad. You 
remember them, Wittman, Price and Hadad, there they are, and at this 
very moment they're basking in the beautiful Maui sun, their debt to 
society paid in full. Speaking of prises, you don't have to be a menace 
to society to be a winner, you folks in the audience, you'll get a 
chance too. Phil tell our friends what they can win today. 

Phil
Damon, how about a years supply of Orgofura procreation pills, both 
adult and kiddie sizes, and the latest edition of The Running Man home 
game. 

Damon
Ben, I know you're just dying to get into that game-zone and show us 
that same determination you showed up in Bakersfield, well first I've 
got a little surprise for you. 

BEN IS CLAMPED INTO A VACCUUM SLED 

Studio Audience
Hahahaha. 

Damon
Haha. We all know you're a big, tough guy, Ben, but that doesn't mean 
that your a loner, and it takes a big man to admit that he needs his 
friends. We didn't want to break up a winning team Ben, so here they 
are ready to go for broke right by your side. Ladies and gentlemen, 
Ben's buddies, Harold Weiss and William Laughlan! 

Ben
Son-of-a-bitch. 

Damon
You know how this works. The game-zone is divided into four hundred 
square blocks, left over from the big quake of ninety-seven, and I 
don't think any of us will ever forget that one. 

Studio Audience
Hahahaha. 

Damon
Once inside the zone the runners have three hours, they've got to go 
through all four game quads, three hours or less, and they're going to

All the relays are the same they point into the middle of the game-

link to the network satellite is in there. 

Laughlan
No wonder Mic's people couldn't find it. No one ever comes out here. 

Weiss
If we can find the up-link we can crack the code. 

Laughlan
If we get it to Mic the hologram will jam the network

Jam the network? Jam it up your ass! Forget this crazy up-link

you and I. It's not going out on the air. Listen very carefully Ben, 
how would you like a three year contract, guaranteed, a CADRE credit 
line and a beach-front condo? Sound impossible? That's the standard 
deal for a network stalker. And I know real talent when I see it Ben, 
and I'd just hate to see you get cancelled tonight when you could go 
the distance. Say the word Ben, and you could be the one doing the 
stalking. What do you think? 

Ben (holding and speaking into TV camera)
You cold blooded bastard! I'll tell you what I think of it! I live to 
see you eat that contract, but I hope you leave enough room for my fist

Haha. Sven, do you want to talk to Mister Richards? Well? 

Sven
I got to score some steroids. 

SVEN WALKS OFF THE STAGE 

Damon
You look pissed, Ben. Believe me you've got every right to be. But hey, 
will ya...will you just let me explain? This is television, that's all 
it is. It's nothing to do with people, it's about ratings. For fifty 
years we've told them what do eat, what to drink, what to wear. For 
Christs sake Ben don't you understand? Americans love television. They 
ween their kids on it. Listen, they love game shows, they love 
wrestling, they love sports, and violence. So what do we do? We give 
'em what they want. We're number one Ben, that's all that counts. 
Believe me, I've been in the business thirty years. 

Ben
Well I haven't been in show business as long as you have Killian, but 
I'm a quick learner, and I'm going to give the audience what I think 
they want. 

BEN PUTS DAMON IN A VACUUM SLED 

Damon
You bastard! Drop dead! 

Ben
I don't do requests. 

Damon
Noooooooo! Ahhhhhhhhh! 

KILLIAN SUCKED DOWN VACUUM SLED TUBE AND OUT THROUGH A CADRE COLA SIGN 
WHICH EXPLODES 

Ben
Well, that hit the spot. 

TV AUDIENCE CHEER AND CHANT "...Richards! Richards! Richards!..."

SONG PLAYED DURING CREDIT SEQUENCE - "Running Away With You" by John 
Parr 

This is no game, 

Standing in the dark I swear I heard you calling my name, 

And I know things have changed, 

No pain, no gain, 

Somethin' in your eyes just told me that this nightmare will end, 

And I have found a friend 

  

Shout it from the highest steeple, 

Let it to out to all the people, 

You hit the right spot 

  

CHORUS


No more lonely nights, with a restless heart, 

Roll the dice, make a brand new start, 

When the world you knew got shattered, 

You and me were all that mattered, 

Just one way I'm going to lose this restless heart, 

Running away with you 

  

You won again, 

I'll take you in me arms and hold you 'til the fear is all gone, 

And now the race is won 

  

Shout it from the highest steeple, 

Let it to out to all the people, 

Hey, scream it on the loudest speaker, 

Burning like the highest fever, 

You hit the right spot 

  

CHORUS 

  

GUITAR SOLO 

  

There's a new horizon that we've both entered, 

It's out there in the distance, and it's playing at you, 

Restless heart, running away with you 

  

You won again, 

I'll take you in me arms and hold you 'til the fear is all gone, 

And now the race is won 

  

Shout it from the highest steeple, 

Let it to out to all the people, 

Scream it on the loudest speaker, 

burning like the highest fever, 

You hit the right spot, 

Running away with you 

  

CHORUS 

  

Roll the dice, make a brand new start, 

Running away, running away with you, 

Running away, running away with you, 

Restless heart
