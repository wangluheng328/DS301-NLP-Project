                                      Joss Whedon 


<b>             FADE IN:
</b>
<b>             EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - JUST BEFORE SUNSET
</b>
             We see an Italian village at the height of the plague.  Funeral 
             processions, decrepit houses with their windows boarded up...  
             the stench of death all around.

<b>             TITLE:  EUROPE. THE DARK AGES
</b>
             Through the filth a KNIGHT walks his horse.  He is weary but 
             not so dingy as his surrounding; a stranger in these parts.  
             He comes to an inn, where a boy takes his horse round back.  
             He enters the inn.

<b>             INT. INN - SAME TIME
</b>
             The inn is dark and almost empty.  A couple of patrons drink 
             silently at tables.  Behind the bar stands a slovenly BARMAID, 
             dark-haired and lazy.  She scratches at her shoulder, on which 
             we see a birthmark.  The knight approaches the bar, throws 
             money down.

<b>                                       KNIGHT
</b>                            A tankard of ale, wench.

             The barmaid pours him a cup of ale.  He drinks deep, stands a 
             moment.

<b>                                       KNIGHT
</b>                                (continuing)
                            Some plague we're having, huh?

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>             INT. INN - UPSTAIRS HALL/BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
             The barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his 
             room.  The door opens inward.  The knight stands in the doorway, 
             places a hand on the barmaid's hip.  She pauses a moment, then 
             breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall.  He laughs a 
             bit, resignedly, and closes the door.

             A VAMPIRE stands behind it.  Not two feet from the knight, 
             grinning at him.  His eyes are skull-hollow and dancing in his 
             head, his bloody smile full with teeth.  His skin is gray, and 
             peeling.  The knight turns slowly and sees him.

<b>                                       KNIGHT
</b>                            Oh, my god...

             The vampire licks his lips.

             He is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into 
             the middle of the small room.  The knight struggles but is no 
             match for the vampire, who buries his face in the knight's 
             neck.  The knight screams.

<b>             ANGLE ON DOOR
</b>
             It suddenly flies open, the lock shattered.

             The vampire turns like a frightened animal.  In the doorway 
             stands the barmaid, a SLAYER.  In her hand is a wooden stake.

             The vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner.  
             The Slayer and the vampire come at each other.  The Slayer 
             spins and kicks; the vampire flies back.  Snarling, he comes 
             back at the slayer.  They struggle; he slips free and is out 
             the door.

             For a moment, the Slayer remains still, crouched on the floor.  
             The knight watches her.  She seems to be making a decision -- 
             perhaps even knows what is going to happen.

             She runs at the window.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>             EXT. IN FRONT OF THE INN - SAME TIME
</b>
             The vampire comes running out the front door.  Before he is a 
             few feet from the front of the inn, the Slayer SMASHES through 
             the upstairs window and lands on him.  They both hit the ground, 
             and she plants the stake right in his heart.

             After a moment, we hear a voice:

<b>                                       AMILYN (O.S.)
</b>                            The lord giveth, and the lord taketh 
                            away.  Ashes, ashes...

             She looks up.

<b>                                       AMILYN
</b>                                (continuing)
                            ... All fall down

             There are ten or more vampires walking slowly toward her in 
             the otherwise deserted street.  At the front, maybe ten feet 
             away, is AMILYN.

             Amilyn is a grinning jackal, a servant to the Vampire-King.  
             His garb is a rotted approximation of a courtier's livery.  He 
             ambles toward the Slayer, giggling, as she stands.

             Behind her is LOTHOS, the Vampire-King.  His skin is deep white, 
             and smooth.  He wears a long coat -- his dress is not of any 
             era.  He is practically upon her before he speaks.

<b>                                       LOTHOS
</b>                            You must forgive Amilyn.  He tends 
                            to drool before supper.

             She turns.  He smiles, almost lovingly.

<b>                                       SLAYER
</b>                            Lothos...

<b>                                       LOTHOS
</b>                            You people will never learn.

             She swings at him but he grabs her arm.  Amilyn laughs 
             obnoxiously.  Lothos grabs the back of the Slayer's head, brings 
             her to him in a loving embrace.

<b>                                       LOTHOS
</b>                                (continuing)
                            We can't be stopped.  This is our 
                            world now.

             He pulls her head back swiftly, snapping her spine as her head 
             hits the back of her legs.  Lightning flashes.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>             INT. ENGLISH CASTLE - NIGHT
</b>
             Lightning flashes outside the window.  It is torrenting rain.  
             An old MAN speaks to a hysterical GIRL of sixteen or so.  They 
             are both obviously noble of birth.

<b>                                       GIRL
</b>                            I can't!

<b>                                       MAN
</b>                            You know you must.  There is only 
                            one.  Now you are that one.  It is 
                            time.

<b>                                       GIRL
</b>                            Why?  Why me?

<b>                                       MAN
</b>                            She has died.  You are the next to 
                            be called.  Why do you think you 
                            were sent to me?  Trained as you 
                            were?  You bear the mark.

             He pulls aside her blouse to reveal a birthmark on her shoulder, 
             identical to the barmaid's.

<b>                                       MAN
</b>                                (continuing)
                            The mark of the Coven.

<b>                                       GIRL
</b>                            I don't understand.

<b>                                       MAN
</b>                            Ever since Adam and Eve first left 
                            the garden, he followed: the serpent.  
                            Satan.  He sends his legion in the 
                            shape of men, to feed on us, to 
                            breed his Hell on our earth.  They 
                            are a plague upon us.

             The man unravels a satchel of cloth.  From it he pulls an 
             elaborately carved wooden stake.

<b>                                       MAN
</b>                                (continuing)

<b>             EXT. HEMERY HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - WIDER SHOT - DAY
</b>
             Opening CREDITS OVER:

             A football game in progress.  The stands are pretty full, the 
             crowd enthusiastic.  The hemery football stadium is just that; 
             a real stadium, not just makeshift stands on grass.

             On  the sidelines are the Hemery cheerleaders, led by BUFFY. 
             She is blonde (in nature as in name), pretty, and very 
             gracefully athletic.  She obviously enjoys what she is doing, 
             and she's good at it.

             With her on the squad are JENNIFER and NICOLE, two of her best 
             friends.  Beside them the COACH, yelling at the players.  The 
             scoreboard reads HEMERY VS. SETON.

             On the field are JEFFREY, wide receiver (and Buffy's boyfriend), 
             ANDY, quarterback, and GRUELLER, the huge left tackle.

             Buffy and the crowd wince as Andy is sacked for a nine-yard 
             loss.

                            Where you make it go forward!

                            Grueller!  Fill that hole!  They 
                            were all over me!  Okay.  Let's run 
                            twenty-two.  Grueller, close the 
                            pocket, watch out for thirty-five.

                            out.  Jeffrey, go up the middle and 
                            run around like a chicken.

             They clap and break.  As they line up, Jeffrey looks over at 
             Buffy.  She smiles at him.  He winks, very suave.

                            If he can't do it 
                            We don't want it!

             On the hike, Andy drops back and looks for a receiver.  Jeffrey 
             runs in circles like an idiot (and not unlike a chicken), waving 
             his arms until Andy sails him the ball and he breaks for a 
             touchdown.

             The crowd goes wild -- particularly Buffy, who does an 
             impressive standing backflip.  Nicole looks at her, impressed.  
             Buffy smiles at her, giddy.

             The mall is typically busy.  Buffy, Nicole, Jennifer and 
             KIMBERLY can bee seen making their way through it.  They are 
             all dressed very similarly:  bright colors, a lot of white and 
             pink.  Not trashy, but mainstream and uninspired.  Esprit.  
             All of them carry shopping bags; they've done a good days work.

             somewhat haggard.  Intelligence shines through his eyes.  He 
             holds himself stiffly, arms close to him, almost as if he

             This is MERRICK.  He pulls a picture out of his coat pocket,

             Grueller walks off, head through a park.

             At the same time, Pike and Benny emerge from the theater.  
             They pass Andy and Jeffrey and the two pairs circle each other, 
             almost growling, eyes locked, before pike and Benny turn and 
             walk off, not quite in the direction Grueller took.  Buffy,

             Grueller walks through the trees, enters an enclosed clearing 
             of grass.  He hears something, stops.  Maybe his name, maybe 
             just the BUSHES RUSTLING.  He looks about him, hesitantly.  
             Starts forward, stops again.

             He turns on his heel, ready to drop all show and bolt.  WALLY 
             BESSEL is right behind him.

             Wally is a ninth grader, small, nerdy, and recently undead.  
             In marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue, Wally 
             is freshly undead.  He still has fat on his face; in fact, he 
             looks almost normal from afar.  But his inhuman eyes and his 
             uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire.  And the way he speaks 
             is unearthly.  Hollow, almost detached; repeating phrases 
             sometimes almost as though he had never heard them before.

             He smiles at Grueller.

             Grueller grabs Wally by his shirt collar and readily hoists 
             his small body up, Wally's feet dangling two feet off the 
             ground.

             He lets Wally go.  Wally remains two feet in the air.  
             Grueller's eyes go wide.

             Wally smiles even more broadly, quietly hissing.  He has long 
             fangs, made somehow more grotesque by the fact that he also 
             has braces.

             Wally's hands vise onto Grueller's head, lightning quick.  
             Grueller screams.

             We see SHOTS of the deserted city at night.  It's a small, 
             upscale town.  Suburban streets, businesses, and a  few more 
             depressed areas, boarded up houses.  No one is out.  TREES 
             RUSTLE, shadows flicker, but the curling mist is the only

             A few people look up, annoyed, as they approach the counter.

             Buffy is still looking at Benny, she seems to be hypnotizing 
             him, and maybe even herself.  The NOISE in the diner seems to 
             FADE AWAY for a moment.  Buffy shifts slightly, almost a twitch, 
             and the spell is broken.  The SOUND RETURNS, Buffy looks away, 
             letting go of the knife exactly where it was.

             Benny looks down.  His hot dog has been sliced neatly down to 
             about an inch.  He is shocked.

             Perhaps in answer, we see the same shadowy figure moving behind 
             Pike and Benny as they continue to walk home.  They're really 
             bombed now.  They are somewhere in the hills now, and they 
             come to the edge of a steep incline overlooking the valley.  A 
             waist-high concrete wall is built into the side of the earth.  
             They stand below a thick, green tree.

                            It's be beauty.  It just needs new 
                            shocks, you know, break pads, an 
                            engine, and some wheels.  It'll be 
                            totally cherry.

             Pike finishes the bottle, eats the worm, and chucks the BOTTLE 
             over the side.  There is a moment before they hear it SHATTER.

             Benny wavers, catches hold of Pike.

             He leans over the side of the wall, hangs his head down.

             Pike passes out.

             Still waiting to throw up.  The figure approaches slowly from 
             behind him.  The figure is a few feet away from him when a 
             hand shoots down from above and grabs Benny's face.

             Amilyn sits on a low branch, pulls Benny up to face him.  Amilyn 
             has changed his manner of dress drastically.  He wears a 
             motorcycle jacket and sunglasses.  His hair is punked out.  
             Benny is in shock, as Amilyn holds him easily by his shirt 
             collar.

             Amilyn leans back -- all the way back, falling back out of the 
             tree and pulling Benny with him.  We see them fall out past 
             the wall just as the shadowy figure reaches it.

             It is Merrick, the man from the mall.  He runs to the side of 
             the wall, looks over.  The two are already lost in the dark 
             mist.  Merrick turns around, looks about him.  He digs in his 
             pockets, pulls out a cross and a stake, holds them tightly.  
             While digging he pulls out an old, stained picture, lays it on 
             the railing.  Stake and cross in hand, he stands by Pike looking 
             out at the night.

             The other girls leave.  Buffy is alone on the empty field.  
             She looks around her.  She starts doing a routine, tentatively.  
             Then she runs toward the middle of the field and jumps, flies 
             into an extraordinary series of gymnastic flips and cartwheels.  
             She rolls into one final flip, a huge one, and lands, a perfect

             of the grave.  Buffy sits and leans against another stone.

             Merrick reaches into his jacket, pulls out a stake and a cross,

             Cassandra stands waiting for Buffy.  The sun is down, darkness

             her.  Looks slowly around.

             Buffy sits fidgeting.  Playing with her fingernails.  Merrick 
             stays in the position, listening.

             A low, almost inaudible MOAN come from under the ground.  Buffy 
             sits up straight, holds the cross to her.  The MOAN becomes 
             louder, almost a scream.  The SOUND is followed by the SOUND 
             of FINGERS SCRAPPING wood -- of WOOD SPLINTERING -- of digging.  
             The moaning continues, becoming eerier, somewhat more 
             articulate.

             Buffy and Merrick wait.

<b>             ANGLE - THE GRAVE
</b>
             Finally, fingers break through the ground and hold stiff in 
             the open air.  The moan becomes a triumphant HISS.  The fingers 
             clutch at the ground.

             ROBERT BERMAN pops halfway out of his grave like a jack-in-the-
             box, his face dirty and dead-white.  He sees Buffy in front of 
             him, and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin, stretching as 
             to a mother's tit.

             Merrick drops down behind Robert and grabs him, raising the 
             stake.  Buffy watches, immobilized.

             A pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under Buffy.  
             They grab her and pull her to the ground.  Next to her face, 
             the face of another vampire, a YOUNG WOMAN, emerges grinning 
             from the crumbling earth.

             Buffy screams lustily, and struggles to break free.

             Merrick is momentarily distracted by this, and Robert throws 
             him off, and pulls himself out of the grave.  Merrick falls to 
             the ground, and his stake goes flying.

             Buffy pulls herself out of the girl's grasp, starts running 
             away, but the girl grabs her.  Buffy remembers the cross in 
             her hand, spins and holds it to the vampire's forehead.  It 
             burns and the lady lets go, screaming and falling to the ground.

             They are struggling, several feet away.  Robert grabs Merrick 
             by the shoulders and picks him up, preparing to bite him.  A 
             stake suddenly pops out of his chest, planted in his back by 
             Buffy.  He falls and dies.

             It leaps at her, screaming.  She throws it off, as Merrick 
             produces another stake and throws it to her.  Buffy sticks it 
             in the vampire's heart.  She dies, screaming, her face still 
             smoking, blood spurting onto Buffy.

             Buffy looks at herself.  At the blood.

             Merrick walks Buffy to the door.  She is silent, slow.

                            happening.  This is important.  
                            When the vampires find out who you 
                            are... you won't be hunting them 
                            anymore.

</b>
             Buffy shuts the door, turns to go up to her room.  She is 
             startled by someone standing in her path.  She almost screams.

             It's her mother.  She stands, arm akimbo, looking very 
             confrontational.  Buffy looks a sight, and stands uncomfortably 
             in front of her mother for a moment.

                            Honey, come on, we're gonna be late.

             Her mother gone, Buffy lets out a small sigh -- of relief or 
             frustration, it is not clear.  She heads upstairs.

             Buffy stands at the sink, washing her shirt.  She tries to get 
             the blood off with fierce intensity.  She is near tears.

             She sits in the middle of the bed in her pajamas, the blankets 
             pooled around her.  She cannot sleep.  Finally, she lies back 
             on the pillow.

             Lothos is beside her.

             Buffy walks through the hall slowly, obviously the worse for 
             last night's wear.  Gary Murray comes up next to her, looking 
             at his watch pointedly:  she's late for class.  He moves on.  
             Jeffrey, going the other way, stops next to her.

             Buffy looks confused for a moment, then remembers.

<b>             INT. LOTHOS' CAVE - CLOSEUP OF CASSANDRA'S FACE
</b>
             She is waking up, obviously from being knocked out.  She blinks 
             stupidly, looks around.  She is lying by a pool of what looks 
             to be dark water in a large cave.  Torches burn around her.

             She tries to get up and finds it difficult.  She pulls herself 
             up to the side of the pool and splashes water on her face.

             It's blood.

             She starts, staring with growing horror at her hands.  She 
             does not even see the figure rise from the pool at first.

             It's Lothos.  He wears no shirt, only white trousers and boots, 
             the style maybe Nineteenth Century.  No blood seems to touch 
             him as he rises.  He looks at Cassandra with an almost sleepy 
             lust.

                            their souls coursing about me.

                            Amilyn.

             Cassandra turns.  Amilyn stands behind her, grinning.  He 
             hisses, bares his fangs at Cassandra.

                            it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect 
                            place to spread my empire.  Honestly, 
                            Eastern Europe was so dead, the 
                            Communists just drained the blood 
                            out of the place.  It's livened up 
                            a bit in the past few years, but 
                            it's nothing compared to this.... 
                            this Mecca of consumption.  The 
                            city of Angels.

             He steps right up to her.

                            We exist to consume.

             On the world "to consume" we see Amilyn mouthing the words 
             with Lothos, his eyes to the ceiling.  He's heard this a hundred 
             times.

             Cassandra pulls her gold card out of her wallet.

             Amilyn snatches it from her, looks it over.

             He rips out her throat, tearing at it with his teeth as blood 
             gushes around their faces and she wriggle, twists, dies.  He 
             hurls her into the door and wipes blood from his mouth.

             Slowly Cassandra slides down the wall, her eyes glazing over.  
             As she descends we see, stenciled on the wall, "Hemery High

             Grey, dusty and long since abandoned.  Sunlight pours in through 
             the large windows, practically caked with dust.  Old crates 
             are stacked here and there, bits of manikins leaning on one or 
             two.  Merrick sits on a crate, reading the newspaper.

             Buffy enters hesitantly, puts down her bookbag next to a pile 
             of Merrick's stuff, including a rolled-up sleeping bag.  This 
             is definitely not her turf.  She runs her finger along a crate, 
             picks up a world of dust.  She holds up her finger at Merrick.

                            with one or two of their followers 
                            to lay the groundwork.  The vampires 
                            find a community and they feed on

                            difficult to trace, and I think the 
                            process has gone a lot further than 
                            I'd anticipated.  Usually this goads 
                            a community into some kind of 
                            paranoid frenzy.  But for some 
                            reason, nobody here seems to be 
                            paying any attention.

             In the middle of her routine, he hurls it at her.  She catches

             He moves the point to where his heart would be.

<b>             INT. PIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
             The room is a shambles.  Outside the first floor window, it is 
             dark night.  "Help Yourself" by the Posies blasts from Pike's 
             STEREO.  Pike lies on his bed.

             Through the window we see Benny approach, slowly fading up to 
             the pane.  He's floating, really.  (He's a vampire.)  He scrapes 
             his fingers on the glass.

             Pike sits up, turns down the music.  He goes to the window, 
             begins to try to open it.  It's stuck.

             Benny grins, presses his slimy forehead against the glass.

             He laughs at his impression, brown spittle caking the window.

             Benny smiles, moves suddenly out of sight.  Pike looks at the 
             window for a second, then bolts out of his room.  He runs to 
             the front door, frantically hooks the chain.  Benny appears at 
             the door's little window, banging and scraping the glass.

             Buffy walks slowly down the street, trying to appear nonchalant, 
             but looking about her a lot.

                            Nice night for a walk.

             She whistles some, keeps walking.

                            Boy, I'm helpless.

             She passes an alley and there is a RUSTLING amid the garbage 
             cans.  She moves slowly down the alley toward the noise.  She 
             is about halfway down when a rat scurries out from the cans 
             and down a drain.

             Behind her, another SOUND.  She turns slowly.  At the entrance 
             to the alley stands a vampire.  They stare at each other, some 
             thirty feet away.

             She moves back a step.  The vampire takes a step.

             It floats rapidly at her, hissing.  Buffy looks about her 
             frantically, trapped.  It hits her at top speed and she 
             instantly rolls onto her back, flipping it and hurling it 
             against the wall at the end of the alley.  As it hits, Buffy, 
             still rolling, produces a stake from her jacket and throws it 
             directly at its heart.  The stake punctures the startled 
             creature's chest.  Before he can so much as grab it, Buffy 
             throws a roundhouse kick, driving the stake all the way home 
             with her foot.  The vampire screams, sinks to the ground.

             Buffy turns, triumphant.

             A hand stops it.  It is Merrick, who steps into the alley and 
             stares at Buffy.

             The two exit Merrick's car, an old Dodge Dart.  As they talk, 
             they make their way into the warehouse.  Buffy looks out for 
             trouble while Merrick unlocks the door.  This is obviously 
             their routine.

                            we're just a bunch of harmless old 
                            loonies.  I thought so myself for a

                            baby.  Come on, breathe.

             Amilyn appears in the street in front of the car.  Pike finally 
             hears the SCRAPING OF HIS FEET as he approaches the car.  Pike 
             straightens up slowly, and as the rear view mirror comes INTO 
             THE FRAME, we see there are two more behind him.  They are 
             both high-school age, fresh like Bessel and Benny.  They all 
             approach, slowly.

             Pike waits for a second, his hand on the key.

                            me proud.

             He turns the key again and the car ROARS to life.  The 
             headlights trap the hungry scowl of the vampires as Pike pops 
             the car in reverse, smashing into the back two vampires.  They 
             both go flying, hurt but not killed.

             Pike races at Amilyn, but he leaps up as Pike reaches him, and 
             Pike hears a THUD as Amilyn lands on the roof of his car.  
             Pike continues to bullet down the street as a hand suddenly 
             punches through the roof, grabbing at him.  He fights off the 
             hand and tries to control the speeding car.

             It can't be done:  he goes off the road and into a park.  The 
             car careens along.

</b>
             Amilyn ride it, laughing.

<b>             ANGLE - INSIDE THE CAR
</b>
             Pike spots a tree with a low branch and heads for it.  Still 
             fighting, he aims at the branch.  It gets closer.

</b>
             Amilyn looks up.

</b>
             They pass under the branch and we hear a TEARING THUD.  The 
             arm stiffens and falls into Pike's lap.

             The car hits another tree dead on.  Pike slams into the steering 
             wheel.  The guitar case flies right through the windshield and 
             lands on the grass.

             Pike pulls himself slowly from the car.  He is bleeding, but 
             not badly.  Just shaken.  He hears a low, seething WAIL from a 
             few yards back and turns around.  Amilyn is getting shakily to 
             his feet.

             Amilyn hisses at him, then turns and races away, snarling, 
             clutching what's left of his arm.

             One of the other vampires nears him.  Pike tries to run and 
             his knees buckle.  He lands on them right next to the guitar 
             case.  As the vampire nears, he pulls the guitar out of the 
             case and swings it, hitting the vampire in the head.  He hits 
             him again.  The vampire bats away the guitar and grabs Pike.  
             Brings his face to Pike's as Pike squirms.

             A blasting kick in the head from Buffy.  The vampire is flung 
             to one side, falls.  He starts up at Buffy and she nails him 
             with a stake.  Pike stares at her.  She pulls a walkie-talkie 
             from her pocket.

             The last vampire hits Pike from behind.  Without missing a 
             beat, Buffy picks up the guitar and snaps the neck off.  She 
             and the vampire meet in the middle -- the creature barely moves 
             before she buries the guitar neck in its chest.  It falls.

             Merrick runs up.  He is wearing black jeans and a windbreaker.  
             He is more modern than he was before, but subtly.  He sees the 
             decaying bodies, one with a guitar sticking out of its chest.

             arms.

                            tiny, the whole place.  I couldn't

             The snap.  Andy drops back and lobs it to Jeffrey.  Jeffrey is 
             way open.  He catches it easily, looks behind him as he runs.  
             Barber players are rushing at him.  And Grueller is coming at 
             him too, throwing other players right and left.

             Jeffrey looks a little worried.  He bolts down field, toward 
             the end zone, Grueller on his heels.

             Grueller hits Jeffrey a second before he is enveloped by other 
             players.  Grueller, hungry with bloodlust, is confused by the 
             exultant crowd, snarling at people.

             Buffy races for the crowd.  She sees Jeffrey is all right.  
             Grueller makes his way out of the throng and up into the stands 
             even as everyone else is rushing onto the field.

             Jeffrey is triumphant.  He sees Buffy running for him and raises 
             his arms.  She passes him right by and continues after Grueller, 
             heads up the stands.  He looks after her, confused, before he

             Grueller reaches them and leaps over the back.  Buffy sees 
             him, runs up and without hesitation, dives off herself.

             The stands reach some thirty feet off the ground.  Buffy sails 
             down like a diver, grabs a branch about halfway down.  She 
             swings like a gymnast and the branch snaps.  Still holding the 
             broken branch, she completes a perfect flip and lands on her 
             feet.

             The vampire fan is on the ground behind her, come for her and 
             without stopping or even turning she twirls the branch and 
             sinks the broken end in his heart.

             She looks around for Grueller.  He is booking out, already 
             several yards away..

             Merrick appears at the top of the stands just in time to see 
             Buffy take off after Grueller.

             Buffy is still following, but she can't keep up.  She spot a 
             BIKER tooling along the street on a Harley.  She comes up to 
             the side of the road and tentatively sticks her thumb out.  
             The biker smiles, stops in front of her.

<b>             EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE  (MOMENTS LATER)
</b>
             A RUSTLING in the trees signifies Grueller's flight.  Seconds 
             late, Buffy roars into view behind him.  She navigates the 
             streets with less ease than determination.

             Her eyes follow him off the road and she steers the bike on a 
             violently bumpy and erratic course through the site.  She 
             finally hits a pile of bricks and is thrown headlong from the 
             bike.  She hits the ground hard; she rolls into it but has 
             trouble getting up.

<b>             BUFFY'S POV

             Grueller's smiling face appears over her.

                            you?

             He brings his face right next to hers.  His voice is no longer 
             passionless; it boils up from hell.

<b>                                       GRUELLER

             She head-butts him with enormous force, sending him staggering 
             back.  Before he can recover, she dives for a pile of discarded 
             lumber, chooses a nasty shard of wood.

             She turns on Grueller, who is smiling again.  There are two 
             more Vampires approaching her, surrounding her.

                            his kingdom, now.

             They rush her.  She takes one on as the second hits her, 
             knocking her over.  They all three swarm over her, meeting her 
             kicks with raking claws.  The two hold her in front of Grueller.

                            You know, Buffy, I've always wanted 
                            you.

             He smiles again and leans toward her neck.

             The stake that pops out through his chest is as much a surprise 
             to him as it is to Buffy.  He falls backward, shocked and dead.  
             Behind him stands Pike.

             One of the other vampires stupidly goes after Pike, who runs 
             away.  Buffy instantly flips the other one over onto Grueller, 
             impaling him as well.

             Pike runs more or less in a circle, yelling, the vampire at 
             his heels.

<b>                                       PIKE

             Wooden shard in hand, Buffy sprints toward them, jumps into a 
             series of flips.  She lands with her legs around the vampire's 
             shoulders, plants the stake in its heart as they topple onto 
             Pike.

             For a moment, Pike and Buffy lie on top of each other, breathing 
             hard.  Then they get up awkwardly, embarrassed by their 
             touching, (and by their slight arousal).

             Buffy appears, far away, between the trees.

             Merrick looks at Lothos, afraid he will notice.

             Approaching, stopping some twenty yards away.  She looks about 
             her for a weapon.

             Lothos rushes suddenly at Merrick, hissing, his feet just off 
             the ground.  Merrick steps back, whips out the GUN, and SHOOTS 
             himself without hesitation in the head.

             Buffy's eyes go wide.

             Lothos growls, holding Merrick's spurting corpse.

             A small, involuntary noise escapes Buffy.

             Even twenty yards away, he hears.  He spins and stares, starest 
             at CAMERA.  Listening.

             Buffy walks slowly, silently backward, fading back into the 
             dark, terrified and shocked.

             Lothos turns back and looks at Merrick dead in his hands.  
             Disgusted, he lets him drop.

             Pike pays no attention to this babbling monologue.  Over the

             thicker than an arrow, and rubs it with garlic.  He places it 
             in the crossbow, take aim in front of him.  He fires into the 
             tire of a truck.  The tire pops flat.  Zeph cracks up.

             Buffy enters the gym.  She is wearing a long white strapless 
             gown.  It is lovely, but very conservative for this crowd.  
             Over her shoulder is a purse that goes with the dress.  She 
             enters hesitantly, looking around her for Jeffrey.  She passes 
             Andy, who is moving away from Gary Murray.

             But Andy has moved on.  Buffy works her way through the crowd 
             to the punch bowl, sees Nicole and Kimberly.  They stop 
             whispering real quick.

             Nicole and Kimberly look at each other significantly.

             Buffy is startled by this attack.  Nicole giggles.

             Jeffrey suddenly appears between them.  Jennifer is on his

             She stops, as everybody assesses the situation.  Buffy is 
             shocked, doing a slow fade to hurt.  Jeffrey is uncomfortable.  
             Jennifer is apoplectic with embarrassment.  Kimberly is in 
             serious giggle, Nicole a bit more restrained, checking it out.

</b>                            I'm out of here.  Jenny.

             At the mention of her name Jenny jumps, and in her haste to 
             get away, she bumps into Buffy's arm, spilling bright red punch 
             on Buffy's chest.  She flees, Jeffrey in tow.  They leave the 
             gym.  Kimberly finds it all pretty funny.  Nicole is silent.

             Buffy turns away, toward the wall.  A soft BALLAD come on over 
             the SPEAKERS.  Tears are forming in Buffy's eyes, as she wipes 
             futilely at her dress.  Finally she turns, looks toward the 
             door.

             Pike is there, walking in on his own.  He wears a leather jacket 
             and baggy old tux pants, accented by chains, earring and unlaced 
             Doc Martins.  He looks great.

             He walks directly toward Buffy, and does turn a few heads.

             Pike picks up a glass of punch as he notices the stain on 
             Buffy's dress.  He looks about him a bit, then without 
             hesitation dumps some punch on his lapel, matching stains.  
             Buffy smiles at him.

             They begin slow dancing, not too close.

             They dance for a while, closer and closer.

                            girls.

             Buffy pulls him closer, holds him, whispers almost weakly in 
             his ear.

             We see couples dancing, kissing... Gary Murray watching them.

             Sitting by the window with her bovine date, she watches Buffy 
             dance disdainfully.

             The window SHATTERS by her head, a vampire's hand reaching for 
             her.  She screams, starts back.

             Other windows shatter, vampires appearing all around.  A couple 
             of students run for the inner door but it is locked shut from 
             the other side.

             Gradually the party stops as everybody becomes aware of the 
             situation.  They vaguely herd to the middle of the room.

             A STUDENT runs staggering in, blood spurting from his neck.

             He falls to the ground, a few feet in front of the doorway.  
             Nobody moves for a second.  Then one of the students starts 
             toward the body.

             Buffy does instead, checking the lifeless body and listening 
             as a number of figures begin to lumber toward the door through 
             the mist.

             Buffy steps back as three 17-year-old vampire come to the door.

             Pike reaches into an inner pocket and pulls out a number of 
             small stakes he has made, hands them to Buffy.  She opens her 
             purse.

             We see the doorway to the gym.  A mist has risen around the 
             entire house, swirling about the feet of the undead who stand 
             clustered about it.  Some have keen and eager expressions, 
             some vacant, half-conscious with bloodlust.  They wait.

             A figure appears in the doorway, walking slowly out.  Buffy.  
             Her torn dress now comes to just above her knees.  She wears 
             Pike's leather jacket over it.  She wears her purse strapped 
             across her chest under the jacket.  In one hand she holds his 
             crossbow; in her other hand is a cross.  As she steps further 
             away from the doorway, the vampires slowly begin to close around 
             her.

             The door shuts behind her.

             Gary Murray, yelling orders at student, holding a board against 
             a window as vampires pound on it.  The exposed part of the 
             window above him shatters, raining glass on his head.

             A vampire is clutching a helpless girl as another vampire takes 
             their picture with an Instamatic.  He expresses confusion and 
             dismay when his image does not come out in the photo.

<b>             ANGLE - PIKE AND BENNY
</b>
             Pike is backing away from Benny, who is approaching him.  Pike 
             passes an overturned table, the stubs of its broken legs 
             sticking up at the ceiling.

                            never get busted.

             Benny grabs him with hateful force.  His fingers dig into Pike's 
             arms enough to draw blood.

                            that slut?!  What about my needs?!

             Pike suddenly grabs Benny, holds him tightly in a brotherly 
             embrace.  Benny is thrown slightly by this.

             Still holding him, Pike pitches onto the table, driving the 
             leg-shard through Benny's back.  Pike still holds Benny as he 
             twitches and screams, dying.  Finally, he lets go, gets up.  
             He looks a little dazed, a little lost.  A window shattering 
             far behind him pulls his eyes back into focus, and he goes to 
             help.

             She slams her elbow down on the chair leg -- very controlled, 
             efficient motion -- and snaps it off.  Looks around to see if 
             anyone is around to hear as she picks up the leg, now a weapon.

             She goes softly to the door, peers cautiously out.

             Buffy screams, turns, and Amilyn decks her, sends her flying 
             back into the classroom.  The stake flies out of her hand.  It 
             lands on a desk by the window.

             Buffy does not land nearly as well, crashing into a pile of 
             desks and twisting her leg badly.  Amilyn laughs repulsively, 
             advancing.

             He grabs her by the neck with his one arm and pins her against 
             the wall in the corner.  She reaches for the stake but it is 
             just out of reach.  He is squeezing the life out of her, his

             Buffy eyes the bottom of the shade, the pull dangling aimlessly.

             He turns in horror, letting go of Buffy, trying to catch the 
             shade.  The instant he releases her, Buffy grabs the stake and 
             in one swift motion, buries it in Amilyn's back.

             The shade goes up, flapping loudly as it spins.  It is still 
             pitch black out.  Amilyn stare, wide-eyed and silent, at the 
             night as he dies.

             Amilyn spins, dying rage in his eyes.  He grabs her.  His 
             strength is formidable even as his body begins to smoke.  
             Suddenly screaming, he forces her over suddenly with such power 
             that the two of them go crashing through the floorboards.

             The two of them fall through the ceiling directly into the 
             blood pool.

             Amilyn's body surfaces first, now just a husk.

             Buffy pops up from the waist-deep blood, soaked and wounded.  
             She stays a moment, breathing hard.  Suddenly her eyes go wide.

             by fear.

             Buffy is suddenly galvanized into action.  She throws a few 
             punches at Lothos, but he takes them without flinching.  She 
             grabs at the stake in what remains of Amilyn's chest.  Lightning 
             quick, Lothos closes his hand around her and squeezes till the 
             stake splinters and she screams with pain.  He knocks her back 
             on her ass.

             She starts moving backward, away from him, but it is hard enough 
             for her to make her way through the thick gore.  Lothos 
             contemplates Amilyn's corpse, and his face darkens.

                            They'll kill us!  Get her out!

             Gary Murray stops in front of Kimberly, takes her face in his 
             hand and lightly pops the back of her head against the wall.  
             Cross-eyed, she slides back down into comatic silence.

<b>                                       PIKE

</b>                            Get away from me!

             She pushes them away.  Lothos crashes through the trap door 
             behind her, ugly and crazed.  He picks her up, floating a good 
             two feet off the ground.

</b>                            You bitch!

             He hurls her the length of the room.  She hits a locker, which 
             opens, spilling out someone's notebook.  The binder falls open, 
             inside it is a plastic pen case with pens and pencils within.

             Buffy looks, by this time, like shit.  She props herself up as 
             best she can, looks about her.  There is nothing wooden, nothing 
             sharp, within reach.

                            You would challenge me?

             Andy charges Lothos from behind.  Pike tries to stop him, but 
             is too late, as Lothos grabs him by the face without even 
             looking at him.

<b>                                       LOTHOS

                            I'll rip the flesh from your stinking 
                            bones!

             Squeeze Andy's head until we hear something crack.  Lets him 
             drop.  Looks around at the cowed students.

<b>                                       LOTHOS
</b>                                (continuing)
                            I am a God!  A God!

<b>                                       BUFFY
</b>                            I am so sure.

             Lothos roars.  Furious, he charges Buffy, his feet just skimming 
             the ground, racing toward her, violently fast, upon her...

             She spins, on her feet in a flash, one quick motion.  She 
             thrusts her palm forward and stops him, cold, like Superman 
             stopping a train, palm at his chest.

             Silence.  Buffy looks directly into his eyes, the mad rictus 
             of his face.

             Lothos stops, almost wide-eyed, as he looks down at his chest.

             Sticking out of the middle of his chest is a small eraser, and 
             a #2.

             He steps back, staring at Buffy.  The expression on his horrible 
             face seems to have changed to one almost of respect.  Her look 
             is unfathomable.

             Lothos smiles, graciously.

</b>                            It doesn't... hurt... as much as I 
                            had imagined.

             He falls gently to the ground.  He's dust before he hits it.

             Silence.  One by one the vampires, stricken, slip out into the 
             night.

             Kneeling by Andy's body.  He gets up, and walks toward what's 
             left of Lothos, warily keeping his eye on the spot.  In the 
             background we see Gary Murray, running out after a vampire.

<b>                                       GARY MURRAY

                            with you!

             Pike kneels by the pile of dust with a pencil in it.

             Everybody is looking at Buffy.  She stares back at the students 
             who cast her out.  Turns and walks out.  Pike follows her.

<b>             EXT. A COURTYARD - LATE EVENING
</b>
             Buffy and Pike are walking up the elaborate stone drive toward 
             us.  We can't really tell where they are, but there are trees, 
             hills in the background.

             Buffy leads the way.  She is confident, at ease.  She wears a 
             large old sports jacket, a baseball cap pulled backward.  Skirt 
             and sneakers.  Casual, cool, but disarming.  She carries a 
             knapsack.

                            just said the timing was off.  We 
                            could maybe wait till later.

                            have to check it out.  I got a hunch.

                            thought maybe we should wait.

             Buffy stops at a large, elaborately carved door.  She turns to 
             Pike.

             Buffy grabs the large metal knocker, ringed through a gargoyle's 
             mouth.

             And on the boom of the knocker, we see:

<b>             WIDER ANGLE - THE CASTLE

             The castle.  Archetypal, turreted, terrifying.  Standing lonely 
             on the craggy hill, drenched in the light of the rising moon.
