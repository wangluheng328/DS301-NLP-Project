<br/>Long moment.   He's taking it in.   Trying to.
<br/>
<br/><b>                      BOURNE
<br/></b>          Why am I alive?
<br/>
<br/><b>                      PAMELA
<br/></b>          Are you disappointed?
<br/>
<br/>They study each other a beat.
<br/>
<br/><b>                      BOURNE
<br/></b>          I know who you are.
<br/>
<br/>PAMELA nods.   Very calm here.    No sudden movements.
<br/>
<br/><b>                      PAMELA
<br/></b>          Thank you for your gift.    I'm sorry about Marie.    *

<br/>
<br/>She has a folder.   A PHOTOGRAPH -- Bourne's face -- stapled
<br/>to the cover.
<br/>
<br/><b>                      PAMELA (CONT'D)                           *
<br/></b>          It's all in here. Treadstone.      A summary
<br/>          of your life. All of it.
<br/>
<br/>He waves it off.
<br/>
<br/><b>                      BOURNE
<br/></b>          Don't need it. I remember everything.
<br/><b>                      PAMELA
<br/></b>                (smiles again)
<br/>          Sounds like a threat.
<br/>
<br/><b>                      BOURNE
<br/></b>          You didn't answer my question.
<br/>
<br/><b>                         PAMELA
<br/></b>          Why you're a   live?
<br/>                (beat)
<br/>          You're alive    because you're special.
<br/>          Because she    kept you alive.
<br/>                (she s   miles)
<br/>          Because we w   ant you back on our side.
<br/>
<br/>BOURNE silent.   But hearing it.    PAMELA leaves the file.

<br/>      BOURNE watching her back away.     As she exits into --

<br/>      Long, sterile hallway. CRONIN and NICKY standing there
<br/>      with an AIR FORCE SENTRY assigned to guard the room.
<br/>
<br/>      CRONIN and NICKY trying to play it cool, but now, as they

<br/>      A chill in the air. Both of them going quiet because
<br/>      there's A NURSE carrying a tray of food. She's coming
<br/>      toward us. They're walking away.

<br/>      THE SENTRY smiles -- opens the door and she enters --
