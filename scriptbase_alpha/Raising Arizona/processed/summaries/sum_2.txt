Colourful and unconventional slapstick comedy.
Ex-con Hi and ex-cop Ed meet, marry and long for a child in the wilds of Arizona.
When Ed discovers she's barren the God-given solution is presented: to snatch a baby from a set of quins.
Thus begins a series of kidnappings, capers and rum goings-on that revolve around the helpless yet universally-loveable child.
Hi's convict friends, his boss, and even the Lone Biker Of The Apocalypse become involved in the ever-twisting plot in the quest to own the baby.
