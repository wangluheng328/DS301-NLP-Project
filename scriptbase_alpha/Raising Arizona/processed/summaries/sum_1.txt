It's the story of "Ed" (short for Edwina), a policewoman who falls in love with "Hi" (short for H.I.
McDonnough), while she's taking his mug shots.
She's infertile and he's a habitual robber of convenience stores, and their folksy marital bliss depends on settling down with a rug rat.
Unable to conceive, they kidnap one of the newsworthy quintuplets born to an unpainted-furniture huckster named Nathan Arizona.
A Harley-riding bounty hunter gets on their trail and things start to get dangerous.
