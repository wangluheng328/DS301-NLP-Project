Seattle PD captain Martin Jenkins reinstates suspended hero detective Quentin Conners because Lorenz, the alias of the ruthless gangsters' leader who holds staff and clients hostage in a bank, demands that interlocutor, but gives him a 'baby-sitter', brilliant rookie Shane Dekker, son of a SPD hero killed in action.
Lorenz tricks them to escape, apparently without any loot, although a Saudi prince keeps a fortune there, but an ICT expert works out the crooks just needed to get in to install an untraceable virus.
Shane's erudite suspicion Lorenz is using 'chaos theory' proves crucial in combination with a series of murders on accomplices and apparently dirty cops.
The bloody trail finally makes a startling twist.
