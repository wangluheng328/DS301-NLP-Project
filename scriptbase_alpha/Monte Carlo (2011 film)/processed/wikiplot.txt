Grace Bennett is a Texas high-school student who works as a waitress with her best friend Emma Perkins to earn money for a trip to Paris after graduation.
Grace's stepfather pays for her stepsister Meg Kelly to come with them on the trip.
Emma goes to Paris despite her boyfriend Owen's proposal of marriage.
After being left behind by their tour guide, the three girls seek refuge from the Paris rain in a posh hotel.
There, the hotel staff and paparazzi mistake Grace for celebutante British heiress Cordelia Winthrop-Scott, Grace's double, who leaves rather than stay to attend an auction for a Romanian charity for which she is to donate an expensive Bulgari necklace.
The Americans spend the night in Cordelia's suite, and the next day fly to Monte Carlo with Cordelia's luggage.

At Monte Carlo the girls meet Theo Marchand, the son of the philanthropist hosting Cordelia.
Theo dislikes Cordelia's spoiled nature but escorts them to a ball, where Grace successfully fools Cordelia's aunt Alicia and Emma dances with a prince.
Meg reunites with Riley, an Australian backpacker she briefly met in Paris.
They find they have things in common, and spend time together before he leaves for Italy.
When Grace has to take part in a game of polo, Alicia discovers the impersonation because of Grace's different riding style.
Alicia believes her niece has hired a lookalike to take her place while she parties, but in order not to endanger the charity auction she agrees to keep silent.
Theo is attracted to "Cordelia's" frank personality, while Emma's prince invites her to a party on a yacht.
Emma dresses for the party in Cordelia's necklace but meets Meg on the way, and Meg takes it for safekeeping, but later forgets it in Riley's backpack.
Emma is disillusioned at the party by the prince's arrogance toward the servants.

Owen arrives in Monte Carlo in search of Emma.
So does Cordelia, and she sees the newspaper account of Grace's appearance at the ball.
She finds that the necklace is missing and calls the police.
The girls have gone in search of Riley but he shows up at the hotel with the necklace; they find Cordelia in the room.
Cordelia threatens to withdraw the necklace from the auction, and the girls tie her up so Grace can take her place at the auction.
Cordelia escapes, and reveals Grace's fraud at the auction.
She demands that Grace be arrested, but after Grace's sincere public confession Alicia bids the unexpectedly large amount of â‚¬6 million for the necklace to save her.
The film ends with Meg joining Riley on his travel around the world; Owen and Emma moving into their own home in Texas; and Theo Marchand and Grace reuniting at the Romanian charity.
