When Cole, a convict volunteer, is sent back in time to find information on a deadly virus that will destroy 5,000,000,000 members of the human race in 1996-1997, he mistakenly arrives in 1990.
After explaining his plea to Dr. Kathryn Railly, he is placed in a mental institution.
In 1996, he kidnaps Railly, using her to find the 12 Monkeys, a group of revolutionists that are planning to release the virus into select cities.
But, he is wanted by the authorities for murder and kidnapping, plus he refuses to return to the future; he is in love with Railly.
