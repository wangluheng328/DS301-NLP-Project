Two emotionally scarred people, Sharon Pogue and Steve 'Catch' Lambert meet and slowly fall in love.
Sharon is a Chicago police officer who grew up in a dysfunctional home.
Her father would at times get violent with her mother and while he would never touch her, the psychological damage was done.
She is haunted not only by her family environment but that she is now shunned by her father after she reported him to the police.
For Catch, a tragic accident he blames on himself has resulted in him blocking out the past.
He lives alone in an unfurnished apartment refusing to acknowledge the tragedy in his past.
As they get to know and trust one another, Sharon realizes she has met Catch before.
