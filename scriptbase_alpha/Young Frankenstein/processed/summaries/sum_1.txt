The grandson of Victor Frankenstein is a teaching surgeon who has spent his life living down the legend of his grandfather, even changing the pronunciation of his name.
When the diary of his grandfather is brought to him, he takes a leave of absence to examine the family castle.
Then things get a little silly.
Due to a switch, he implants an abnormal brain in his creation which causes problems, but things really get out of hand when the young Frankenstein's bride to be shows up at the castle.
The whole film is shot in Black and white to simulate the old monster movie feeling.
