In 1910, the last year of the life of Leo Tolstoy (Christopher Plummer), his disciples, led by Vladimir Chertkov (Paul Giamatti), manoeuvre against his wife, Sofya (Helen Mirren), for control over Tolstoy's works after his death.
The main setting is the Tolstoy country estate of Yasnaya Polyana.
Tolstoy and Sofya have a long, loving marriage, but his idealistic and spiritual side (he is opposed, for example, to private property) is at odds with her more aristocratic and conventionally religious views.

Contention focuses on a new will that the "Tolstoians" are attempting to persuade him to sign.
It would place all of his copyrights into the public domain, supposedly leaving his family without adequate support.
The maneuvering is seen through the eyes of Tolstoy's new secretary, Valentin Bulgakov (James McAvoy), who finds himself mediating between the two sides.
He also has a love affair with one of the Tolstoians, Masha (Kerry Condon).

Ultimately, Tolstoy signs the new will and travels to an undisclosed location where he can continue his work undisturbed.
After his departure, Sofya unsuccessfully attempts suicide.
During the journey, Tolstoy falls ill.
The film ends with his death near the Astapovo train station where Sofya is allowed by their daughter to see him just moments before his death.
[2] The closing credits state that five years after his death the Russian senate reverted the copyrights of Tolstoy's work to Sofya.
