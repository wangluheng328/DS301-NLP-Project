Jerry hires two men to kidnap his wife so he can get his rich father in law to pay the ransom of $1 million.
Once the ransom is paid the kidnappers will get $40,000 and Jerry gets the rest.
That's the plan, but what happens is something totally different.
Blood is shed when a cop and two innocent people are killed.
Marge Gunderson is the Chief who investigates the murders.
While Marge investigates, Jerry gets involved in deeper problems, ranging from financial troubles, to threats from the kidnappers.
