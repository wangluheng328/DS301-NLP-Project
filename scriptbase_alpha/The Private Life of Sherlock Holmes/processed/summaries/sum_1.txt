Sherlock Holmes becomes involved in the case of Gabrielle Valladon when the young woman is fished out of the river and brought to 221b Baker Street by a cabbie.
She's quite beautiful and doesn't really remember who she is or why she mentioned Holmes' name when found.
Using his deductive powers, Holmes determines she is Belgian and having retrieved her luggage from Victoria station, that she had only recently arrived on the boat train.
She came to England looking for her husband and has no idea how she ended up in the river.
Soon however, the case becomes more complex when Holmes' brother Mycroft warns him to stay away and that it involves the security of realm.
Undaunted, Holmes, Watson and Gabrielle follow the trail of clues and are soon in Inverness where they encounter both a troop of missing midgets - a case Holmes had earlier turned down - and have an encounter with the Loch Ness monster.
Brother Mycroft also has some unexpected information for his brother.
