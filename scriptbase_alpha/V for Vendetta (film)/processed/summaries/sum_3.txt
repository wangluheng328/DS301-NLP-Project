In the not too distant future, Britain is filled with torture cells, unfair punishments, prejudice against minorities.
However in the mist of all this chaos, one man known only by the name V dares to stand up to the government and is labeled as a terrorist.
One night V rescues a mild young woman called Evey Hammond and an unlikely bond between the two emerges which results with Evey becoming Vs ally.
But though V may be charismatic and have a passion for justice he also is bitter and has his own personal hatred of the government for something they did to him long ago.
As November the 5th, the day V says he and those who will follow him will stand up to the government once and for all approaches, Detective Finch becomes more and more determined to uncover the truth about V, however his search leads him to ask to question whether or not he is on the right side.
