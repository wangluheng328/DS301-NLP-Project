In this obscure and Gothic tale, one attractive girl, Evey gets involved accidentally in a terrorist attack, perpetrated by a masked and megalomaniac character, V. V is following the same steps of Guy Fawkes, a sort of terrorist of the XVII century, who wanted to blow up the English Parlament in London.
However, in the present time, the Orwellian London lives under the fascist government of chancellor Adam, and V will fight against his regime, using the power of powder, blowing up important buildings.
Evey will be chased by the secret police, thinking that she's the accomplice of V, who will accomplish Fawkes' mission of destroying the Parlament on the 5th of November, in this mixture of The Phantom of the Opera, George Orwell's 1984 and Batman.
