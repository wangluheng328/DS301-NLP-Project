<b>                      PHILADELPHIA
</b>

                    by RON NYSWANER





September 21, 1992




<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>VARIOUS SHOTS OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS (EXT./DAY) ...
</b>
which may include the Liberty Bell, the Italian Market,
scenes along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers,
Independence Square, the Russian Orthodox neighborhood, the
ghettos of North Philly.

MAIN TITLES PLAY OVER THIS SEQUENCE which culminates in a
<b>SHOT OF...
</b>
<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>PHILADELPHIA'S GLORIOUSLY ORNATE CITY HALL (EXT./DAY) ...
</b>
TITLE: "Philadelphia City Hall."

<b>CITY EMPLOYEES, JUDGES, COPS, LAWYERS, CRIMINALS, TOURISTS
</b>pour into City Hall, into...

<b>                                                  TO:
</b>
<b>TWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY (INT-DAY).
</b>
Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying
an accordion file under his arm like a football.

Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP.

Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time

<b>                                                  TO:
</b>
<b>JAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR, FOOTSTEPS
</b>making a racket...

Jamey rushes toward a door marked "JUDGE TATE."

RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers:

<b>                              JOSEPH MILLER (OS)
</b>                    This construction site is
                    causing mortal and irreparable
                    harm to an unsuspecting public!

<b>                              ANDREW BECKETT (OS)
</b>                    My client has one of the finest
                    and most respected safety records
                    in the business, Your Honor!

Jamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO
<b>CAMERA) STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE: ANDREW BECKETT
</b>(in conservative gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes).

<b>                              JUDGE TATE
</b>                    One at a time. Mr. Miller?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp.
                    began construction, the
                    surrounding residential
                    neighborhood has been enshrouded
                    in a cloud of foul-smelling,
                    germ-carrying, pestilent dust.
                    My client is being forced to
                    breathe known carcinogens daily!
                    Other residents are coming forth
                    on a daily basis to add their
                    voices of outrage!

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Your Honor, I submit there were
                    no complaints until Counselor
                    began knocking on doors,
                    drumming up business. And the
                    dust, which Counselor refers to,
                    has appeared on only three
                    occasions. Each time it has
                    been examined and the results...

Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs
a document into Andrew's hand.

<b>                              ANDREW (CONT.)
</b>                    Limestone. Messy, but innocuous.

Andrew submits the report to the Judge.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Innocuous?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Defined by Webster's as harmless.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    I know what it means. Your
                    Honor, imagine how the children
                    in this neighborhood have been
                    made to feel. The pounding of
                    construction ringing in their
                    ears as this skyscraper, a
                    tribute to mankind's greed,
                    grows daily, casting an ominous
                    shadow over their lives, filling
                    them with dread even as they are
                    surrounded in a black, toxic
                    fog, blocking out the sun while
                    poisoning their lungs! And
                    Counselor calls it harmless?!

His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to
Jamey: "Not bad." But he whips around, serious again:

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Your Honor, Counselor is
                    attempting to portray my client
                    as a hideous manifestation of
                    evil and corruption. But
                    nothing could be further from
                    the truth. Rockwell has
                    generously contributed ten
                    thousand dollars to this
                    neighborhood's schools, clinics
                    and youth centers! Granting a
                    restraining order on the
                    construction site will throw
                    hundreds of Philadelphians out
                    of work, and will lend
                    validation to this contemptible
                    and groundless nuisance suit,
                    which speaks directly to the
                    kind of greed and treachery that
                    today is threatening the very
                    fabric of our society.

Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.

<b>                              JUDGE TATE
</b>                    Let's not go off the deep end,
                    gentlemen. I thought we were
                    talking about some dust.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>A MAN ON CRUTCHES HOBBLES INTO A COURTHOUSE ELEVATOR AND IS
</b>joined by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside (INT./DAY) ...

As soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro-
cassette recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite
corner of the elevator, <u>does exactly the same thing</u>.

<b>               ANDREW                      JOE
</b>     ... plaintiff seeks to re-     ... whereas decedent had
     strain defendants from con-    pre-existing asthmatic

                                    sequent death...

Andrew and Joe stop at the same time, look at each other...

And turn toward the corner, seeking privacy.

<b>               ANDREW (CONT.)              JOE (CONT.)
</b>     ... plaintiff's permission or  ... complainant seeks
     authorization...               relief...

There's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe <u>pull out their
portable telephones at the same time</u>.

They look at each other: which phone is ringing?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    You.

Andrew resumes his telephone conversation.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Right.
                         (into phone)
                    Miller.

The ELEVATOR OPENS: Andrew breezes past the MAN ON
CRUTCHES, saying to Joe:

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Client of yours?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Funny.

Andrew hurries down the corridor. Joe waits a moment... then
pursues the MAN ON CRUTCHES.

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)
</b>                    Excuse me..? Sir? Yo!

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
ANDREW EKERGES FROM CITY HALL, ONTO DILWORTH PLAZA BUSTLING with
<b>PEDESTRIANS (EXT./DAY) ...
</b>
... DARTS into the street, hailing a cab.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>THE CAB PULLS UP TO A BROWNSTONE ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET,
</b>Andrew hopping out, stuffing papers into his briefcase
<b>(EXT./DAY) ...
</b>
RUSHING to the door marked "Dr. Roberta Gillman, Internal
Medicine."

Coming out is a YOUNG ASIAN MAN with a cotton ball taped to
the inside of his elbow.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>CLASSICAL MUSIC (INT./DAY) ... AS CAMERA PANS PATIENTS
</b>(MOSTLY YOUNG MEN) in a cheerful room... some, like a UPS
DELIVERY MAN, are attached to IV's, some sit with arms
extended, waiting to be hooked to an IV by TYRONE, a BLACK
<b>PHYSICIAN'S AID.
</b>
CAMERA FINDS ANDREW sitting quietly, with an IV drip running
into his arm. Andrew is wearing a Walkman, the source of
the CLASSICAL MUSIC, and he's reading a legal brief. Most
of the people in the room look SICKER than Andrew.

DIALOGUE CAN BE HEARD under the CLASSICAL MUSIC (although
MUSIC dominates the SOUNDTRACK).

<b>                              TYRONE
</b>                         (slapping a thin
                         PATIENT'S wrist)
                    Gonna have to start looking for
                    veins in your feet, sweetheart.

DR. ROBERTA GILLMAN, passes through, speaking to Andrew:

<b>                              DR. GILLMAN
</b>                    Andy. Can you stop at my office
                    on your way out?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Sure.

Andrew is distracted by A HISPANIC MAN across the room,
rolling up his sleeve for an IV -- his bare arms, hands,
face and neck are marked with PURPLE BLOTCHES.

Andrew closes his eyes, concentrating for a moment on the
CLASSICAL MUSIC... then goes back to work.

He punches out of the conference, back to his Mom (glancing
over his shoulder to make sure the door is <u>shut</u>).

Andrew's fingers FLY across the keys of a notebook computer.

Needing a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from
the computer... opens a reference book... grabs a carton of
Chinese food... (NOTE: The library may be equipped with a
computer terminal which Andrew uses for reference, rather
than a book.)

Andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks, finding a
relevant citation:

A SHADOW falls across Andrew. He IGNORES IT.

ANGLE: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON says:

<b>                              KENTON
</b>                    Look at this fucking guy. He's

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Walter.

The SECOND MAN steps forward, a silhouette becoming visible
This is BOB SEIDMAN. He and Kenton wear tuxedos.

ANOTHER SILHOUETTED FIGURE APPEARS. This image has a
horror-film feeling to it.

Andrew WHIPS AROUND to face them.

                    Charles. Is that correct, Andy?

The lawyers have gathered in Wheeler's spacious office, with
its floor-to-ceiling view of the Philadelphia skyline.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    The fate of the participants

Wheeler, Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of
preparing cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass
clip, rolling them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the
cigars in and out of their rounded mouths.

Andrew, holding a cigar but NOT preparing to light it, watches
with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye.

Wheeler leans back in his chair, swirling a brandy snifter.
He exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure.

<b>                              KENTON

                         (prompting Andrew)
                    It's an anti-trust action.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    It is, and it isn't, Charles.

                    elements of Kronos' spreadsheet
                    program. If they're allowed to
                    sell it, Kronos will get undersold
                    right out of business. For me, the
                    legal principle, involved is
                    copyright infringement.

                    any way.

Walter Kenton has shifted a lamp, so that its LIGHT FALLS
ACROSS ANDREW'S FACE, REVEALING: <u>a faint purple blotch
about the size of a quarter, much like the blotches we saw
on the HISPANIC PATIENT in Andrew's doctor's office.</u>

<b>                              KENTON

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Because they deserve to, Walter.

Andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed
back, revealing the blotch.

He stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to
cover the blotch.

<b>                              ANDREW (CONT.)

                    out of work. Moreover, the laws of
                    copyright and anti-trust were
                    enacted to prevent exactly the
                    kind of bullshit Macrosystems is
                    trying to pull.

                    more specifically, senior
                    associate Andrew Beckett.

A moment before it sinks in, then: Andrew clenches his fist
in a victory salute.

Chandra applies the makeup gently, supervised by another friend

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (to the FEMALE CLIENT)
                    Explain this to me like I'm a
                    six year old, okay? The entire
                    street is clear except for one
                    small area under construction,
                    with a huge hole that is clearly
                    marked and blocked off, and you
                    decide you <u>must</u> cross the street
                    at this spot. You fall into the
                    hole and you want to sue the
                    city for negligence? ...

<b>                              MRS. FINLEY
</b>                    Yeah. Do I have a case?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Of course you have a case! Now,
                    I want you to go with my
                    assistant, Iris, and fill out
                    some forms. She'll tell you
                    about our fee arrangement.
                         (as they're leaving)
                    Mrs. Finley? Any back pain
                    since the accident? Dizziness?
                    Nightmares?

<b>                              MRS. FINLEY
</b>                    Now that you mention it...

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Tell Iris all about it.
                         (leading her out)
                    Take good care of Mrs. Finley,
                    Iris.
                         (to Andrew)
                    Beckett, come in.

Joe offers his hand, getting a look at Andrew's face.

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)
</b>                    Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I have AIDS.

Joe WITHDRAWS his hand, before it touches Andrew's.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Whoa-oh!
                         (beat)
                    Sorry, I...

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    It's okay. Can I sit down?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Uh, yeah.

Andrew hesitates. Joe doesn't sound sure.

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)
</b>                    Go ahead.

Andrew sits, Joe returns to his desk. (Joe finds himself
acutely aware of where Andrew places his hands.)

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Thanks, Beckett. I'm real
                    excited about it.
                         (glances at his watch)
                    What can I do for you?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I
                    plan to bring a wrongful
                    termination suit against Charles
                    Wheeler and his partners.

<b>                              JOE

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Correct. I'm seeking

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I misplaced an important
                    complaint. That's their story.
                    Want to hear mine?

<b>                              JOE

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Nine.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I was diagnosed with AIDS eight
                    months ago. During a bout of
                    pneumonia. I recovered quickly
                    and was back at work in ten
                    days. Since I was doing so well
                    on the AZT, we decided against
                    telling anyone about it.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    We?

<b>                              ANDREW

                    together for nine years.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I dove back into work,
                    everything was fine. Until the
                    lesions started...

                    face. For a short period, I
                    avoided the office during the
                    day, waiting for the chemo
                    therapy to clear up the
                    lesions...

                    I made all my calls from home.
                    I worked sixteen hour days on a
                    complaint for a 350 million

                    down that corridor was strange.

<b>                              WHEELER

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Charles, I must apologize again,

                         (smiling)
                    It was a scary few minutes

                    has come over you, lately: A
                    kind of... stupor, a fogginess,
                    a lack of focus... Earth to
                    Andy. Anybody home?

<b>                              KILLCOYNE
</b>                    That's right, Andy. The last
                    four, five months you've seemed
                    really out of it...

<b>                              SEIDMAN
</b>                    At least... different, somehow.

</b>                         (keeping it positive)
                    Perhaps... you're right. I've
                    certainly been busy. With the
                    Kronos complaint, a preliminary
                    injunction hearing and the
                    Saunders trial all falling at the

<b>                              KENTON

<b>                              ANDREW

<b>                              WHEELER

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I had no idea there was a concern

                         (a smile)

                    Excuse me? Am I being fired?

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    Let's put it this way, Andy:
                    your place in the future of this
                    firm is no longer secure.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    In a word, yes.

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    We don't think it's fair to keep
                    you here, where your future is
                    limited. But we wish you luck,

Wheeler rises, wearing a friendly smile.

                    due respect... this is...
                    preposterous! It doesn't make
                    any sense, it sounds as if we're
                    talking about someone else.
                    Pardon the lack of humility, but
                    I've had the distinct impression
                    I was kind of... one of the
                    rising stars around here. And I
                    feel that wasn't just my
                    imagination. And I also think I
                    deserve to know what's really

                    Andy, you nearly blew the case,
                    for God's sake! That alone is
                    inexcusable. It would have been
                    catastrophic for us. Put
                    yourself in our shoes, Andy.

Wheeler breaks the silence.

                    having AIDS, so they make you
                    look like a fuck up. Which
                    leads us to the mysterious, lost

sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN
saunters by (INT./DAY) ...

A CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE:

Andrew taking a seat across the room (<u>the blotches have been
reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold</u>). Andrew
removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a
package of tissues, blowing his nose.

Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or
eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him.

<b>JOE'S POV, PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS:
</b>
Andrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes
something. Sneezes.

A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew.

<b>                              LIBRARIAN

Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching.

<b>                              LIBRARIAN

<b>                              LIBRARIAN

The LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating
she's done all she can do.

As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks
up his books and moves away.

Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye
on Andrew, who concentrates on his work.

Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just <u>happens</u> to be
sauntering by. Suddenly he "notices" Andrew.

<b>                              JOE

Andrew goes back to his work.

<b>                              JOE

                    One of the partners spotted a
                    lesion on my forehead.

Nearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she
hears the word "lesion."

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Uh huh...

Andrew concentrates on his work once more.

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)

                    have been a bruise, to the
                    partners deducing you had AIDS
                    and basing a decision to
                    terminate you on that
                    conclusion?

The CHINESE PROFESSOR moves away.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Good point.

Andrew removes a legal pad with "KENTON" written in big
letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath.

<b>                              ANDREW (CONT.)
</b>                    The partner who spotted the
                    lesion, Walter Kenton, used to
                    work for Benton, Myers, in D.C.
                    There's a paralegal there, Maria
                    Torres. She's had lesions on
                    and off for three years. She
                    says it was common knowledge
                    around the office that her
                    lesions were caused by AIDS.

<b>                              JOE

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    No. They didn't fire her.

Andrew goes back to his work. Joe stands there.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    So Kenton connected the... lesion,

                    your personal life... to this
                    woman, Maria... and blew the
                    whistle on you. Suddenly you're
                    losing files, and it's time to
                    let you go. But, up to this
                    point, you've been their Golden
                    Boy, their rising star... Their
                    behavior is... inconsistent.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Thank you.

Andrew goes back to work.

<b>                              JOE

Andrew SHOVES the legal book toward Joe.

CLOSE ON ANDREW'S HANDS (<u>with one blotch</u>) on the book's white
pages.

The book is still <u>facing</u> Andrew. If Joe wants to read it,
he'll have to turn it around.

Joe looks at Andrew's hands. A MOMENT.

Joe turns the book around, begins to read:

<u>DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER:</u> Andrew and Joe face each

<u>DISSOLVE TO A SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER (DAY IS TURNING INTO

<u>DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE, LATER:</u> Andrew and Joe sit on the

Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Kenneth Killcoyne, Bob Seidman
and SEVERAL LAWYERS and SPOUSES watch the game from a plush,
private box, complete with TV, bar, snack table. The lawyers wear
Ralph Lauren polos, chinos and ball caps. The place reeks of
cigar smoke. Walter Kenton has a twentyfive year old WIFE.

Charles Wheeler's nine year old GRANDSON sits nearby.
Wheeler turns the GRANDSON'S ballcap around, smiling
lovingly at the boy.

JUST BEYOND WHEELER: The door to the box is opened by a SECURITY

                    Andrew Beckett is making his
                    private life our business. We
                    gave him Kronos. Did he say,
                    "I'm sick. I might not be able
                    to see this through?"

<b>                              SEIDMAN
</b>                    He was doing a great job.

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    Bob. I must ask you to shut the
                    fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say
                    "I might not be able to serve our
                    clients to the <u>best of my ability</u>?"
                    He said nothing. And now, Andrew
                    Beckett proposes to haul me into a
                    court of law, to sling accusations
                    at me, in full view of the entire,
                    Philadelphia, judicial
                    establishment. My God.

</b>                    Beckett doesn't want to go to court,
                    he's hoping for a quick tasty
                    settlement.

<b>                              SEIDMAN
</b>                    A jury might decide that Andy has a
                    case.

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    Wait a minute. The man was fired for
                    incompetence, not because he has
                    AIDS. You didn't know he was sick,
                    did you, Bob?

<b>                              KENTON
</b>                    Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?

<b>                              SEIDMAN
</b>                         (after a moment)
                    No. Not really.

Wheeler walks away, followed by Kenton and Killcoyne.

Bob Seidman stands alone in this dark place.

                    today, among ourselves... There is
                    nothing I hate more, than to see
                    lawyers suing each other. If you
                    look at the opinion polls, when Mr.
                    John Q. Citizen is asked to rank
                    professions according to the
                    respect he holds for them... Where
                    are the lawyers? Somewhere below
                    personal fitness trainers and only
                    slightly above child pornographers.
                    If we keep suing each other, if we
                    fail to settle the smallest
                    difference among ourselves with
                    mutual respect, if we continue to
                    scrap like bucks in heat, we'll
                    fall lower on that list. And when
                    people lose respect for lawyers,
                    they lose respect for the law. And
                    when this society loses all respect
                    for the law, we'll be murdered in
                    our beds, my friends, our cherished
                    institutions will be burned to the
                    ground and our children and our

</b>                    Your generosity overwhelms me,
                    Belinda, considering my client
                    was earning over a hundred thou
                    when he was terminated almost six
                    months ago.

<b>                              JUDGE GARNETT

                    through these false attitudes.
                    Give them a figure. How much do

Andrew and Joe confer with each other.

                    years, including benefits and
                    projected raises, and the

The CAMERA POINTS to SEVERAL PAIRS OF CHILD'S HAND PRINTS in the
sidewalk, then, BACK TO ANDREW IN CLOSE UP, SMILING.

<b>INSIDE THE HOUSE (INT./DAY):

CHILDREN are running through the house, while WOMEN sporting

Andrew's arms.

Andrew's older and very down to earth sister JILL, puts her
arms around Andrew, squeezing tight.

As Jill leaves Andrew's arms, the CAMERA IS TRADED OFF TO
ANDREW, who SHOOTS JILL GIVING MIGUEL A HUG.

<b>QUIET (INT./DAY) ...
</b>
Andrew and his immediate family are gathered in the den, sitting
quietly, facing each other. Andrew's father, BUD, with an
American flag pin in his lapel, sits next to Sarah. Jill holds
the hand of her husband, REVEREND JIM. Two of Andrew's brothers,
MATT and RANDY, (big, athletic guys with mustaches) are there.

Andrew sits next to Miguel.

<b>                              ANDREW

                    about me, about my private life.

                    okay with everybody.

<b>                              MATT

<b>                              ANDREW

<b>                              JILL
</b>                    To be honest, I'm worried about
                    Mommy and Daddy. They've had to
                    go through so much already...
                    And, we all know...
                         (very difficult to say)
                    There's going to be even worse
                    things to deal with, eventually.
                    I wonder if it's fair to put
                    them through this.

Andrew's father STARES at his folded hands.

                    trooper. But when they fired
                    you... you were so devastated,
                    Andy... I don't expect any of
                    my kids to sit in the back of

There's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks.

</b>                    Supposedly, the Lord doesn't

                    can handle. But I'm having a
                    hard time believing that these days.

Andrew's construction worker brother, RANDY, wipes tears
from his eyes. Clearly their father is in alot of pain.

<b>                              BUD (CONT.)

                    I have been so very impressed...

Andrew gazes at his father with incredible love. Miguel puts
an arm around Andrew.

<b>                              BUD (CONT.)
</b>                    I can't imagine there is anything,
                    that anyone could say, that would

<b>                              ANDREW

<b>                              RANDY

                    That's the bottom line. I mean,
                    what are those bastards going to say?
                    You're gay? Shit, I knew that
                    when you were five years old.

Everyone LAUGHS. Andrew and Randy high five.

More laughter. But Jill speaks seriously:

                    theirs...

Joe crosses the courtroom, coming to stand in front of...

ANDREW, whose appearance has changed: <u>thinner, paler than we've
ever seen him, some blisters on his lips. But the most disturbing
thing about his appearance is the way he moves, slowly, like a
much older man.</u> He's taking notes (which he will do
relentlessly throughout the trial.) And he has a cane at his
side, which he'll use throughout the trial.

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)
</b>                    There are certain points in our
                    version, that I must prove to
                    you... Point number one: Andrew
                    Beckett was... is a brilliant
                    lawyer. A great lawyer. Point
                    number two. Andrew Beckett,
                    afflicted with a debilitating
                    disease, made the legal,
                    understandable, personal choice
                    to keep the fact of his illness
                    to himself... Point number three:
                    His employers discovered his
                    illness. And ladies and gentlemen,
                    the illness I'm referring to, is
<b>                    AIDS...
</b>
Joe pauses, letting that sink in.

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)
</b>                    Point number four. They panicked.
                    And, in their panic, they did what
                    most of us would like to do with
                    AIDS... Get it, and the people
                    who have it, as far away from us
                    as possible.

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)
</b>                    The behavior of Andrew Beckett's
                    employers may seem reasonable to

                    Andrew Beckett because he had
                    AIDS, <u>they broke the law</u>.

                    Fact. He was successful in his

ANGLE ON THE JURY: Several JURORS write in notebooks like the
Marine's; he's been handing them out...

Joe seems ill at ease today, a little off his game. When he
glances at Andrew, it's with irritation.

<b>                              JOE

                    air, all of a sudden, only to
                    reappear in the nick of time?

Jamey answers nervously:

</b>                    I've never known that to happen

Joe stands, staring at Jamey. Too long. Jamey squirms.

The COURTROOM ERUPTS: ACTIVISTS booing Joe, Wheeler's crowd
expressing OUTRAGE, JURORS looking confused.

Andrew takes in the commotion, as the JUDGE BANGS HIS GAVEL.

<b>                              JUDGE GARNETT
</b>                    Hold it, hold it!

Andrew trains his attention on Joe.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    Objection! Where has this come
                    from?! Suddenly Counsel is
                    attacking his own witness. Mr.
                    Collins' sexual orientation has
                    absolutely no relevance to this
                    case.

                         (the courtroom QUIETS)
                    Mr. Miller. Could you kindly share
                    with me exactly what's going on
                    in your brain, because I don't
                    have a clue at the moment.

Joe faces Andrew, also curious to know what Joe's up to.

                    preference, sexual orientation,
                    whatever you want to call it.
                    They're looking at me, and

                         (looking at Andrew)
                    They're looking at Mr. Beckett, and
                    wondering about it. They're looking
                    at Mr. Wheeler and wondering about
                    it. They might even be looking at
                    you and wondering about it. So,
                    let's get it out in the open. Let's
                    talk about what this case is really
                    about: the general public's
                    hatred... our loathing, our <u>fear</u> of
                    homosexuals.

DEAD SILENCE while the Judge thinks it over.

<b>COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM, FIVE URINALS, THREE SINKS (INT./DAY).
</b>
The MARINE JUROR, the RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR, and AN
UPTIGHT BUSINESSMAN JUROR stand at the urinals, with an empty
urinal between each of them. The MARINE JUROR whistles while
he pees (a classic rock tune, like "Radar Love.") The
BUSINESSMAN sighs, "Ahhhhhh."

The RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR jingles change.

The ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR enters, stepping up to the urinal
between the BUSINESSMAN and the MARINE. He unzips, and it seems
to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary
organ. This does <u>not</u> escape the MARINE'S notice.

<b>                              ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR
</b>                         (innocently, to Marine)
                    I have some gay friends. What's
                    the biggie?

The MARINE says nothing.

<b>                              ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (CONT.)
</b>                    Everybody has a couple of gay

<b>                              MARINE
</b>                    No, sir. I do not.

The MARINE moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see
his private parts.

<b>                              ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR
</b>                    You might have them, and just
                    not know they're gay.

The MARINE shakes, zips, flushes, turns away. He pauses to look
directly at the ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR.

crossed arms, waiting.

                    not doing me any good anyway.

Miguel shoves away from the table.

<b>                              MIGUEL

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I'm not going to die.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                    That's right. We're on the

Miguel slides down the wall, sitting in a heap.

Andrew goes to him. They hug. Miguel holds him tight.

<b>                              MIGUEL (CONT.)

Miguel rocks in Andrew's arms. Andrew kisses the top of his
head, holding tight.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I am so scared. I am so fucking,

A MOMENT. Andrew stroking Miguel's hair, as he calms down.

<b>                              ANDREW (CONT.)
</b>                    You know, there's only one thing to

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
JOE AND LISA STAND OUTSIDE ANDREW'S APARTMENT -- <u>IN COSTUME</u>.
DANCE MUSIC is playing inside (INT./NIGHT) ...

Lisa is dressed as a giant sandwich. Joe's costume looks quickly
thrown together: he's wearing a suit, but has pages from a legal
document stapled all over the suit.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Did I ever tell you, I hate

<b>                              LISA
</b>                    My lettuce is wilting.

The DOOR IS OPENED -- by the LEAD SINGER OF WHITE SNAKE: big
hair, leather, guitar.

<b>                              ANDREW (AS ROCKER)
</b><b>                    PARRTYY!

<b>                              JOE

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    It's me, you dork.

<b>                              LISA
</b>                    I'm Lisa Miller.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Glad to finally meet you. Come on in.

<b>                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
</b>
JOE AND LISA FOLLOW ANDREW INTO THE APARTMENT (<u>HE LIMPS, relying
on his cane, but he's got A LOT OF ENERGY</u>). The room is filled
with two Madonnas, an M.C. Hammer, three nuns, a can of soup
<b>(INT./NIGHT) ...
</b>
<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                         (to Lisa)
                    I have to introduce you to the
                    can of soup. You can enter the
                    costume contest together as a
                    lunch special.

Miguel approaches, dressed as a MEMBER OF MEGA-DEATH or ANTHRAX.
He strikes a pose, contorts his face and hits an air guitar riff.
Andrew crosses guitars with Miguel. Then:

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    This is Lisa Miller. Miguel Alvarez.

Miguel's sister MARIA is passing by with a GROUP OF FRIENDS.
Everyone ad libs greetings.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                    My sister, Maria.
                         (to Lisa)
                    Pastrami on rye?

<b>                              LISA
</b>                    Corned beef.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                    Want to dance?

<b>                              LISA
</b>                    Sure!

Miguel leads Lisa away. Joe is reluctant to give her up.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Beckett. You seem... better.
                    Energized, more alive...

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I had a blood transfusion today.
                    I feel great.

Andrew studies Joe, trying to figure out the costume.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    I'm a law suit.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Not bad.

<b>                              JOE

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Let's find you a drink.

Andrew leads Joe through the crowd, greeting Rachel, skin
painted blue (SMURFETTE) her daughter AMY (BART SIMPSON),
Anthea, TYRONE from Dr. Gillman's office (A COWBOY), and
TYRONE'S LOVER (A HORSE) ... Some of Dr. Gillman's PATIENTS
are here too, including the YOUNG ASIAN MAN who is now in a
wheelchair. And, one or two of ANDREW'S SIBLINGS may be
present as well. And Alan, Bruno and Chandra, and some arty
friends and neighbors.

<b>                              ANDREW (CONT.)
</b>                    What do you want?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Beer.
                         (patting his briefcase)
                    We need to go over your Q and A.

<b>                              ANDREW

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Sure. It's fine.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    No, we have to do it. But

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Thank you.

A MAN dressed as LA TOYA JACKSON (with fake snake) squeezes
past Joe, reaching for a beer.

<b>                              LA TOYA
</b>                    'Scuse me, darling.

Andrew is SMILING at Joe.

<b>                              JOE

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Correct.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    You're right.

Joe spills beer down his shirt.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Thank you.

<b>          CUT TO A SERIES OF PARTY MOMENTS OVER LOUD MUSIC:
</b>
--Andrew and Miguel ROCKING to HEAVY METAL MUSIC, playing a
battle of the guitars. At one point, Andrew has to sit
down, but he doesn't stop "playing," while Miguel jumps all
around him.

--Joe talking to a MAN DRESSED AS MARIE ANTOINETTE:

<b>                              MARIE ANTOINETTE
</b>                    I'm an accountant. What do you do?

                         (points to Lisa)
                    That's my wife!

--Andrew's mother Sarah, as Marge Simpson, delivers a tray
of hors d'oeuvres to Joe (standing next to a POLICEMAN):

                         (to the POLICEMAN)
                    Nice costume.

<b>                              POLICEMAN
</b>                    It's not a costume, I just got

--Everyone SLOW DANCES to the Talking Heads tune "Heaven"
(Simply Red cover version): Joe and Lisa, Andrew and
Miguel, Rachel with a sleepy Amy in her arms, the POLICEMAN
and TYRONE, Sarah Beckett and MARIE ANTOINETTE, LA TOYA and
her snake.

<b>QUIET IN ANDREW'S CONDO, THE PARTY LONG OVER (INT/NIGHT).

Joe opens his briefcase, removing a legal pad with notes.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Congratulations, Miller.

Andrew clears away party debris from the table, making space
for his legal work. He is attached to an IV line, which is
connected to a drip bag on a rolling stand, that can move
with him. He is no longer in costume.

<b>                              ANDREW (CONT.)
</b>                    You survived your first gay
                    party intact.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Let me tell you something, okay?
                    When you're brought up, like the
                    rest of us, in a place like where
                    I was brought up, there's not a
                    whole lot of discussion about...
                    homosexuals.
                    As a kid, you're taught right away
                    that queers are weird, queers are
                    funny, they're a danger to kids,
                    they're afraid to fight, and they
                    all want to cop your joint. And
                    that pretty much sums up the
                    general thinking out there, if you
                    want to know the truth.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Thank you for sharing that with me,
                    Joe.

<b>                              JOE

                    testimony. We have a big day on
                    Monday.

Joe begins ticking off a list of courtroom reminders:

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)
</b>                    When you refer to Wheeler, call him

                    Andrea Chenier, by Giordano.
                    This is Madeleine. She's
                    telling how, during the French
                    revolution, a mob set
                    fire to her house. Her mother
                    died, saving her.

                    "I look...
                    The place that cradled me was
                    burning!"

                    Do you hear the heartache in her
                    voice? Then, here come the
                    strings. Everything changes.
                    The music fills with hope.
                    Madeleine says...

Andrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the IV
at his side. He seems truly free and relaxed.

</b>                    "It was during that sorrow that
                    love came to me!

                    A voice filled with harmony
                    That said...
                    Live still, I am Life!"

                    "I am the god that descends
                    From the heavens to the earth
                    To make of the earth
                    A heaven!"

ANGLE ON JOE: Shifting, uncomfortable.

The MUSIC ENDS.

Joe sits there, fidgeting. He reaches for his briefcase
organizing his notes.

<b>                              JOE

                    leader, gifted at bringing out
                    the very best in others. An
                    awesome ability to illuminate

</b>                    It's possible I was infected with

                    wasn't diagnosed until several years

<b>                              JOE

<b>                              ANDREW

                    not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal
                    life, really. Anyway, I did
                    plan to tell Charles,
                    eventually. But then, this
                    thing happened at the tennis

Joe sits with a stone-sober expression: this isn't easy.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    When? Approximately what year did

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I guess it was 1984, 85.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    Were you aware in 1984 or 1985
                    that there was a fatal disease
                    out there, called AIDS, and that
                    you could contract it through
                    sexual activity?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    It's impossible to know exactly
                    when or how I was infected with HIV.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    But you <u>were</u> having anonymous
                    sex in porno theaters in 1984
                    and 1985?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    That happened once. People
                    weren't talking about AIDS then,
                    the way we are now. Or safe
                    sex.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay
                    plague, gay cancer, but... we
                    didn't know how you could get it,

<b>                              ANDREW

ANGLE ON MIGUEL, sitting next to Sarah.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Yes.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    You could have infected him, isn't

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Miguel has not been infected. As
                    I said, we weren't aware of AIDS,
                    then, or how it is spread.

<b>                              BELINDA

<b>                              BELINDA

<b>                              ANDREW

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    And it's your contention, that
                    when the partners were made
                    aware of the lesions, they
                    jumped to the conclusion you had
                    AIDS and fired you.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Absolutely.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    Do you have any lesions on your

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    One. Here, in front of my ear.

An ASSISTANT hands Conine a shaving mirror. She holds it
before Andrew.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    Remembering you are under oath,

                    see the lesion on your face, in
                    this mirror, three feet away?
                    Answering truthfully.

Andrew looks in the mirror: the lesion is NOT very visible.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    By the time I was fired, there

                    Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a
                    note of that. Andy didn't lose the
                    complaint in his computer. He
                    never put it in. He lied about
                    that, too.

                    isn't a conspiracy.

Wheeler and the gang moves on, leaving Seidman alone in the
high-ceilinged corridor.

<b>CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM CHARLES WHEELER -- ON THE STAND...
</b>
<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett
                    to your firm?

Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate.

Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity.

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    If you're the owner of a major
                    league ball club, you recruit the
                    hot rookie. And Andy was tremendously
                    promising as a young attorney.
                    That's why we went after him,
                    that's why we hired him, and
                    that's why we stuck with him,
                    year after year... waiting for
                    the promise to be fulfilled. But
                    it never was.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    You kept giving him another chance?

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    Of course we did. When you've
                    groomed someone they way we groomed
                    Andy, nurturing him, lavishing all
                    kinds of special treatment on him...
                    you've made quite an investment.
                    We were waiting for his promise to
                    kick in, and deliver. But,
                    ultimately, we could no longer
                    ignore the gap between the promise
                    and the reality... This is one of
                    the saddest times in my life. To
                    sit in this court, testifying to
                    Andy's ultimate failure to make
                    the grade. To discover that he is
                    one of those people who wants to
                    benefit by the system, but doesn't
                    want to play by the system's
                    rules. To think you <u>know</u> someone,
                    only to find out... you don't know
                    them at all. It's heartbreaking.

<b>                              BELINDA
</b>                    Thank you. That's all for now,
                    Your Honor.

Joe rises. Adjusts his jacket. Wheeler waits.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (very gentle)

                    Wheeler, explain this to me like
                    I'm a ten year-old. This trial is
                    not about a disease, is that what
                    you're saying? <u>Not</u> about your
                    understandable, if unfounded, fear
                    of catching AIDS through casual
                    contact with someone who has it?
                    You're saying, this trial is about
                    Andrew Beckett's character. Am I
                    getting this right?

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    Yes, character. To the extent that it
                    affects a person's ability to do
                    a great job.

Andrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat, breathing
difficult. He takes in the rest of the court, while
Wheeler's words THROB THROUGH THE AIR...

<b>                              WHEELER (CONT.)
</b>                    Andy worked when he wanted to work,
                    telling us what he thought we
                    needed to know about his
                    lifestyle...

ANDREW'S POV -- ON RACHEL, sitting among the spectators. Rachel
begins speaking, her WORDS OVERLAPPING Wheeler's (we should get
the feeling she's giving her testimony).

<b>                              RACHEL
</b>                    I didn't mind covering for Andy,
                    but I did wonder... when was he
                    planning to deal with his problem?

Andrew blinks... what's going on?

Looking back to the court: Joe presses in on Wheeler.

Everything seems normal.

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    Sometimes it seems like society
                    is <u>run</u> by these kinds of people.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    What kind of people?

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    People who want to bend the rules...

ANDREW'S POV -- KENNETH KILLCOYNE at the defense table:

<b>                              KILLCOYNE
</b>                    If you want to be a leader in this
                    society, you have to make
                    certain sacrifices.

Wheeler keeps speaking:

<b>                              WHEELER
</b>                    ... to suit their personal desires,

                    with it.

</b>                    Who makes the rules, Mr. Wheeler?

</b>                    Yes, I did see the lesions. I
                    suspected he was sick...

</b>                    It seems like he wasn't willing to
                    face the <u>reality</u> of his situation...

Andrew slowly rises, the VOICES GETTING LOUDER:

<b>                              SEIDMAN
</b>                    I didn't tell the others, I

</b>                    ... It's time to get this society
                    back on track!

Andrew OPENS HIS EYES... WE SWITCH TO HIS POV:

The Judge, the Jury -- everyone silent, looking concerned.

ANDREW'S POV of the courtroom floor.

Andrew falls into his own POV SHOT. In slow motion.

He lies on the floor, looking up.

ANDREW'S POV -- Joe steps over him.

Dr. Gillman RUSHES into the room, in street clothes,
obviously having answered an emergency call. She tries
assessing the situation, just as the tube is removed and
Andrew GASPS for breath. A NURSE places an oxygen mask over
Andrew's face and he drinks in the air. His eyes are wide
open with fear, sweat covering his face.

<b>ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING... JOE STEPPING INTO THE CORRIDOR OF
</b>a hospital (INT./NIGHT), carrying two shopping bags from the
Famous 4th Street deli...

Joe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room.

Dr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low
voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them,
entering Andrew's room, he hears:

<b>                              DR. GILLMAN
</b>                    ... if he comes out of the
                    hospital this time, you mustn't
                    expect him to be like he was
                    before...

Joe steps into...

<b>ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./NIGHT) ...
</b>
A hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed:
"Victory."

OPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a
hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face.

JILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand,
smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free
hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an
amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various
parts of his body.)

Andrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV.
JIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while
Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering
the judgment. Matt's audience is loving it.

As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags
from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others.

People KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and
happiness evident in the room.

ON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling
eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile.

ON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look.

Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he
wants Joe to sit there.

Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed.

With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His
voice is raspy, weak:

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    What do you call a thousand lawyers
                    chained together at the bottom of the
                    ocean?

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    What?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    A good start.

Joe smiles.

<b>                              ANDREW (CONT.)
</b>                    Excellent work, Joe. I thank
                    you.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    It was good working with you, Andrew.
                    You're welcome.
                         (sees the oxygen mask)
                    Hey. Shouldn't you put
                    that thing back on?

Andrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are
weak. Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears.

<b>                              JOE (CONT.)
</b>                    I better get home. Lisa and I
                    are having some friends over.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                         (muffled by the mask)
                    Sure thing.

Joe stands.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    I'll see you, Beckett.

Andrew nods, weakly. But he's still smiling and his eyes
are dancing.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                         (through mask)
                    Thanks for coming by.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    You bet. We'll see you later.

Joe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                         (to Miguel)
                    He's looking good. I wouldn't
                    be surprised if he gets out of
                    here soon.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                    We just want to get him home.
                    Thanks for stopping by, Joe.

Miguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him. Joe slaps
Miguel's back.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Night.

Joe leaves.

Miguel begins circulating among the "guests," saying:

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                    He's tired. He ought to sleep.

<b>                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
</b>
<b>JOE STEPPING INTO THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR (INT./NIGHT), AND
</b>saying to a GROUP OF DOCTORS and NURSES:

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    What do you call a thousand
                    lawyers chained together at
                    the bottom of the ocean?

The elevator doors close.

<b>                                        CONTINUOUS CUT TO:
</b>
<b>ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM...
</b>
Matt gives Andrew's hand a squeeze, before leaving.

<b>                              MATT
</b>                    Night, Andy. See you tomorrow,
                    buddy.

Rev. Jim pats Andrew's shoulder.

<b>                              REV. JIM
</b>                    God bless you, Andy.

Bud Beckett kisses Andrew on the cheek.

<b>                              BUD
</b>                    Goodnight, son.
                    Get some rest, okay?

Sarah Beckett is strong, kissing Andrew on the forehead.

<b>                              SARAH
</b>                    Goodnight angel, my sweet boy...

Randy Beckett loses control of his emotions as he bends to hug
his brother. He begins to sob.

<b>                              RANDY
</b>                    Andy.

Andrew puts his weak arms, with the IV lines connected,
around his brother Randy, to comfort him.

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                         (through mask)
                    I'm okay, bro. I'll see you tomorrow.

Jill hugs Andrew, giving Miguel a kiss as she leaves the room.
Maria waves goodnight from the doorway, closing the door.

Miguel sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off his shoes.

Miguel stretches onto the bed next to Andrew, picks up the
remote control, and TURNS ON THE TV.

Andrew pulls aside the oxygen mask, to say:

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    I'm ready...

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                    Ready for what, baby?

<b>                              ANDREW
</b>                    Whatever.

<b>                              MIGUEL
</b>                    I hope you're ready for "Studs,"
                    because that's what's on.

Andrew replaces the oxygen mask.

They lie next to each other, watching television.

<b>                                        FADE OUT/FADE IN:

<b>EXTERIOR: JOE'S HOUSE AT NIGHT, ESTABLISHING...

From inside the house: the phone rings.

</b>
<b>JOE AND LISA'S DARK BEDROOM, QUIET (INT./NIGHT) ...
</b>
Lisa is sitting up in bed, having answered the phone.

Joe is just waking up.

<b>                              LISA
</b>                         (to Joe)
                    It's Miguel.

Joe sits bolt upright.

<b>                              JOE
</b>                    Miguel?

A TAXI ARRIVES and an elegant, well-dressed older COUPLE
step out.

</b>
<b>RACHEL OPENS THE DOOR OF THE LOFT, FINDING MIGUEL'S FAMILY
</b>on the other side: very dignified, handsome people who have
just arrived from Spain. They enter the apartment, where...

A wake is in progress. Lots of food. People sharing stories
about Andrew. Some people laughing. one or two softly crying
as they hug each other.

Someone has set up a "memento" table, with pictures of Andrew
at various stages of his life, and things that meant something
to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his
favorite cat, etc.

THEME MUSIC PLAYS, but we hear BITS OF DIALOGUE under the
music ("You're Miguel's parents?" "Do you remember when
Andy..." "I went to college with Andy..." etc.)

Bud Beckett sits alone, very quiet.

Miguel leads his parents over to Bud. Bud looks up, rises,
extending his hand to MIGUEL'S DAD. Miguel's father shakes his
head in sadness, reaches for Bud and pulls him into his arms for
an embrace.

<b>CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD, SEEMING TO SEARCH FOR
</b><b>SOMETHING...
</b>
CAMERA ZEROS IN ON THE TV SET, across the room, where BLACK AND
WHITE IMAGES ARE FLICKERING, ignored by everyone...

AS CAMERA GETS CLOSER TO THE TV, it becomes apparent that the
images are BLACK AND WHITE HOME MOVIES, converted to video...

THE HOME MOVIES FEATURE a bright-eyed LITTLE BOY...

Andrew...

Riding a bike with training wheels...

Swinging wildly at a wiffle ball...

<b>AS CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE TV, PARTY SOUNDS AND THEME MUSIC
</b>FADES... People are still talking, still laughing, still
crying, but we CAN'T HEAR THEM ANY LONGER. Instead...

We hear only the SOUNDTRACK from the HOME MOVIES...

Andrew SHOUTING GLEEFULLY as he chases a new puppy...

Andrew SQUEALING as he jumps into a tiny swimming pool...

Andrew on a swing, going higher and higher...

And laughing.

<b>FADE TO BLACK.
</b>
<b>ROLL END CREDITS.
</b>


May we never find space so vast, 
planets so cold, heart 
and mind so empty 
that we cannot fill them 
with love and warmth...
