Berlin in 1995.
Michael Berg watches an U-Bahn pass by, flashing back to a tram in 1958 Neustadt.
A 15-year-old Michael gets off because he feels sick and wanders the streets, pausing in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he vomits.
Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a tram conductor, comes in and helps him return home.
