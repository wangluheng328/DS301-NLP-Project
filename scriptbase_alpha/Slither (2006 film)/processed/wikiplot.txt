A meteorite housing a malevolent extraterrestrial parasite crashes into the town of Wheelsy, South Carolina.
While frolicking in the woods with Brenda (Brenda James), local car dealer Grant Grant (Michael Rooker) finds the parasite and is infected by it.
The parasite takes over his body and absorbs his consciousness and memories.
[2] With the alien now in control of his body, 'Grant' begins to slowly change into a tentacled slug-like monster.

Many pets soon disappear, but Grant is not suspected.
However, his wife Starla (Elizabeth Banks) begins to question his health; he explains the initial changes in his appearance as an allergic reaction to a bee sting, saying that a doctor has already given him something for it, but Starla soon learns this is a lie.
Starla contacts the police chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) – her childhood crush – who attempts to reassure and comfort her while not acting on his feelings.

Grant infects the lonely and neglected Brenda with hundreds of his offspring.
He hides her in an isolated barn where she becomes massively obese as baby alien slugs grow inside her.
Bill leads a small group of officers on a hunt for Grant; they find Brenda in time to see her explode, releasing hundreds of the alien slugs.
Most of Bill's group are infected by the slugs and become Grant's puppets, speaking as if they were Grant and obsessed with bringing Starla home and holding her to her wedding vows.

Everyone in town is quickly eaten or absorbed into Grant's hive mind except Starla, Bill, mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry) and one teenager, Kylie (Tania Saulnier), who escaped a partial bonding in which she saw the slug's memories; it moves from planet to planet, eating or absorbing all life it finds there.
The parasite's consciousness, however, is influenced by the real Grant's memories and his love for his wife, Starla.

The survivors try to escape detection and kill Grant.
The townspeople attack their vehicle, capturing Starla and Jack.
Bill and Kylie track Starla to her home, and find that the infected are melding into one giant creature.
They must risk their lives to stop the infestation from spreading any further.
Jack awakens in the house's basement, where several of the infected are eating; he tries to escape but soon finds that he too is infected.
Starla charms the monster by calling him "Grant" and telling him they can be together, but as they get close to each other, she pulls a hairbrush handle from her underwear and stabs him in the chest.
He slaps her with a tentacle and knocks her across the room.

Bill arrives; Jack begs to be killed, and Bill shoots him in the head.
He tries to kill the monster with a grenade, but another tentacle knocks the grenade into the pool, where it detonates.
The monster sends two tentacles to stab Bill and infect him; one is lodged in his abdomen, but Bill attaches the other to a small propane tank, filling Grant with gas, and Starla shoots the monster, causing it to explode, whereupon all the infected die.
The three survivors walk away to find a hospital for Bill.

In a post-credits scene, a cat approaches to feed off Grant's remains, and is infected as Grant was in the beginning.
