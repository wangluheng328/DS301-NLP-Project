Near the deer hunting season in the small town of Wheelsy, a meteor falls on the woods with an egg of alien worm.
Along the night, the local Starla Grant refuses to have sex with her husband Grant Grant and the upset man goes to a bar to have some drinks.
He meets his acquaintance Brenda Gutierrez, the younger sister of his former girlfriend, who has a crush on him, and they go to the woods, but Grant does not have sex with her.
He sees the weird egg on the grass, and when he touches it, the egg releases a sort of sparrow with an alien parasite that dominates Grant's brain.
Along the next days, Grant has an insatiable hunger for meat, and while his hostage body is transforming, he builds a nest of slugs in his cellar.
Grant infects Brenda and the slugs attack the human beings in Wheelsy, possessing their bodies.
Starla, the local sheriff Bill Pardy and the survival Kylie Strutemyer try to find a way to stop Grant, the leader of a new breed of starving zombies.
