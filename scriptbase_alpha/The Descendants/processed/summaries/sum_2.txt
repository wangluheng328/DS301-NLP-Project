Attorney Matt King is having a difficult time coping with his life at the moment.
His wife Elizabeth is in a coma in the hospital following a boating accident.
His youngest daughter Scottie is acting out and in many ways Matt is forced to be a parent for the first time in a long time.
Matt is also in control of a family trust, one that is set to expire in a few years time.
The trust owns a huge tract of land - vigorously sought by developers - the sale of which would be of great help financially to many of his cousins.
He fetches his eldest daughter Alexandra from school and in a heated argument learns that Elizabeth was having an affair and was going to divorce him.
Matt sets out to see the man, but isn't quite sure what he will say or do when he locates him.
