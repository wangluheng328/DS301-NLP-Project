Misanthropic TV weatherman/broadcaster, Phil Connors, is annoyed and despondent when he's assigned the job of covering the annual Groundhog festivities in the small "Hick" town of Punxsutawney - making this his fourth in a row.
The only noticeable upside is his attractive and good-natured producer.
But the real nightmare begins when Phil ends up reliving the same day (Groundhog Day) over, and over again.
Unable to leave the town due to a severe blizzard, and with no end in sight, Phil struggles to find a way to escape (and ultimately make the best of) his seemingly hopeless situation.
