Phil Connors is the arrogant and egotistical weatherman for local station WPBH-TV Pittsburgh.
He has disdain for those with who he works as well as for his viewers.
But he has the most disdain for Groundhog Day held in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, which he is to cover for the third time in his career, this year with Rita and Larry, the station's new producer and cameraman respectively.
Phil wants to get in and out of Punxsutawney as quickly as possible, but a snowstorm forces the threesome to stay an extra night in town after the Groundhog Day festivities.
When Phil awakens the next morning, he is experiencing what he thinks is déjà vu.
In reality, he is experiencing that Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney all over again.
The same happens the following day and the following.
As Phil relives that same Groundhog Day over and over again, he goes through a myriad of highs and lows.
But as he comes to the realization that Groundhog Day may be his fate for eternity, he also comes to other realizations, such as that his actions have no long term consequences, but that knowledge, especially as it relates to Rita, can be a powerful and dangerous thing.
But he is given opportunity after opportunity to get the day "right".
