Mike cannot decide what is real and what isn't, and is plagued by vivid nightmares.
He gets the shock of his life when he watches, with binoculars, the conclusion of the funeral of his older brother's friend--the mortician (the Tall Man), by himself, lifts the casket into the back of a hearse.
Mike heads to the grounds of the mortuary, which is home to very bizarre happenings, including a unique security device.
Enlisting the help of brother Jody and ice cream salesman Reggie, Mike attempts to vanquish the Tall Man.
