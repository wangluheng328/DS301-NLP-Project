It is a distant galaxy in the far future.
It is the year 10191.
Arrakis is a desert planet and the only source of Melange, a vital drug used by the Guild Navigators for space travel from star system to star system.
Two rival families, the Atreides and the Harkonnens, fight for control of the mining operations of Melange on Arrakis.
When his father Duke Leto Atreides is assassinated by the evil Baron Harkonnen, Duke Leto's son Paul and Paul's mother Lady Jessica flee deep into the desert and are befriend by the Fremen, natives of Arrakis.
Because of the influence of Melange, Paul learns he has special powers and he can see into the future.
Paul unites the Freman, forms an army of warriors and leads them into battle against Baron Harkonnen and the corrupt Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV, who is in league with the Harkonnens, vows to avenge his father and sets out to liberate Arrakis and its people from the Emperor's rule and fulfill his destiny.
