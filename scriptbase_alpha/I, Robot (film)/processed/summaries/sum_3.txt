It's 2035 A.D., where robots are everyday objects and are programmed to live alongside humans.
Detective Del Spooner is called out to investigate the apparent suicide of the scientist behind these robots, Dr. Alfred Lanning.
Spooner suspects that the death might not be a suicide, but the result of one of the robots.
All robots are programmed by three laws, but Spooner starts to wonder if a robot can in fact feel emotions, and possibly murder.
But if Spooner's suspicions are true, he is going to have a hard time convincing everyone.
