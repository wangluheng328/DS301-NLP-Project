This is the year 2035.
Everybody in the world relies on a huge system of robots, which are programmed specifically to help humans and not harm them in any way.
But one person does not think that robots are helpful.
Chicago homicide detective Del Spooner.
but one day, he received a call from the United States Robotics (USR) about a recent death of renowned robot scientist Dr. Alfred J. Laning.
Spooner immediately blamed this incident on robots without justifiable reason or proof.
Then, he begins his investigation on Lanning's death, only to discover Sonny, a "unique" robot.
What Spooner does not realize, is that something is about to happen.
Something that is beyond even spooner's wildest dreams.
