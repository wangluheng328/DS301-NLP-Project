Set in the northwest section of Baltimore, Maryland, during the last week of 1959, Diner tells the story of a circle of male friends – now in their early twenties – who reunite for the wedding of one of their group.
The title refers to the Hilltop Diner that was located at Reisterstown Road and Rogers Avenue, Baltimore, their late-night hangout.
However, the Hilltop had been converted into a liquor store, so the location in the film is in the Canton section of Baltimore.
An element of the story includes the Baltimore Colts winning the 1959 NFL Championship Game.
The semi-autobiographical film explores the changing relationships among these friends as they become adults through what is mostly a series of vignettes rather than a traditional narrative.
Levinson encouraged improvisation among his cast to capture realistic camaraderie.
