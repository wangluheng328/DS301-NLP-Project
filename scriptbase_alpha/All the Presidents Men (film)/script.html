                                     William Goldman

                                    Based on the novel

                                "All The President's Men"

                                            by

                             Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward

                            Pre-rehearsal version March, 1975

<b>                
</b>
               Start with as few credits as possible. When they're over--

<b>               FADE IN ON:
</b>
<b>               A TINY BLACK PIECE OF TAPE.
</b>
               We see it in the center of the large, dimly lit screen. As 
               the tape is pressed around a door--

<b>               BEGIN THE BREAK-IN SEQUENCE.
</b>
               It's a major piece of action, running maybe five minutes and 
               it's all as detailed and accurate as we can make it, with as 
               many "if only's" included as possible. ("If only" the tape 
               had been attached up and down instead of around the door, 
               Wills wouldn't have spotted it and alerted the police; "if 
               only" the first police car called had gone to investigate, 
               Baldwin, watching from the Howard Johnson Motor Inn, would 
               have seen their uniforms and radioed Hunt and Liddy in time 
               for them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely 
               away.)

               The break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men. He thought 
               he only had one guy, so when ten hands were raised he was 
               surprised. The hands are all encased in Playtex rubber 
               surgical gloves. HOLD on the hands a moment; then--

<b>                                                                     GO TO:
</b>
<b>               A DARK APARTMENT.
</b>
               The phone rings. WOODWARD fumbles for the receiver, turns on 
               the bed light. He listens a moment.

<b>                                     WOODWARD
</b>                         No, no trouble, Harry, be right down.
                              (he hangs up)
                         Son of a bitch.

               He lies back. The apartment is one room, a small terrace 
               beyond. Not much of a place.

               WOODWARD lies still, staring at the ceiling. He blinks, blinks 
               again. HOLD...

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               THE ENORMOUS FIFTH FLOOR OF THE WASHINGTON POST.
</b>
               It looks, early of a Saturday morning, pretty deserted. Those 
               reporters that are around are young, bright, and presently 
               involved in nothing more taxing than drinking coffee and 
               thumbing through the papers.

               HARRY ROSENFELD surveys the scene from his office doorway as 
               WOODWARD approaches, hangs his coat at his desk, not far 
               from where ROSENFELD is standing.

<b>                                     ROSENFELD
</b>                         Where's that cheery face we've come 
                         to know and love?

<b>                                     WOODWARD
</b>                         You call me in on my day off because 
                         some idiots have broken into local 
                         Democratic Headquarters--tell me, 
                         Harry, why should I be smiling?

<b>                                     ROSENFELD
</b>                         As usual, that keen mind of yours 
                         has pegged the situation perfectly.
                              (chomps on some Maalox 
                              tablets)
                         Except (a) it wasn't local Democratic 
                         Headquarters, it was National 
                         Democratic Headquarters--
                              (WOODWARD is surprised--
                              he hadn't known)
                         --and (b) these weren't just any 
                         idiots, these were special idiots, 
                         seeing as when they were arrested at 
                         2:30 this morning, they were all 
                         wearing business suits and Playtex 
                         gloves and were carrying--
                              (consults a piece of 
                              paper)
                         --a walkie-talkie, forty rolls of 
                         film, cameras, lock picks, pen-sized 
                         tear gas guns, plus various bugging 
                         devices.
                              (puts paper down)
                         Not to mention over two thousand 
                         dollars, mostly in sequenced hundred 
                         dollar bills.

               A CORRIDOR INSIDE. WOODWARD comes down it, looks around,

               A CLERK AT A DESK as WOODWARD comes up. Behind them, two 
               lawyers are clearly angry about something, talking and 
               gesticulating to each other.

               THE COURTROOM and business is booming. Muggers, pimp, hookers, 
               their families and friends. In the scene that follows, a 
               constant counterpoint is what's going on up at the front as 
               an endless succession of petty criminals caught the previous 
               night, the aforementioned muggers, pimps, and hookers, are 
               shuttled in, given a quick appearance before a JUDGE who 
               sets bond, and then shuttled out.

               In the audience, one man stands out--DOUGLAS CADDY. He is 
               extremely well-dressed and obviously successful. Beside him 
               sits another smaller man, who is unshaven and squints. 
               WOODWARD moves in, sits alongside CADDY.

                         I'm from the Post and I wanted to 
                         ask about how you happened to come

                         in the courtroom, denied he was in

                         burglars had arranged for their own 
                         counsel. And that could only mean 
                         the burglars didn't arrange for their

               Without a word, CADDY turns, leaves the line without getting

               THE COURTROOM as without warning, it quiets. There is suddenly 
               a tremendous air of expectancy, you can feel it. Now we see 
               why as five men in dark business suits are led in; they've 
               been stripped of belts, ties, and shoelaces. McCord is taller 
               than the others. They stand, facing the JUDGE, backs to the 
               audience.

               WOODWARD sits watching as the proceedings start, but it's 
               hard to hear. He concentrates as the JUDGE starts speaking.

                         professions.

               The five men do not move or reply. Then, after a long pause, 
               Barker says--

                         That, sir, is not your average 
                         occupation.

               WOODWARD starts moving forward now, down an aisle, moving 
               past kids and whores and all the rest, trying to hear what 
               the hell's going on. At the front of the spectator's section 
               is a fence-like wooden barricade about three feet high. As 
               he approaches it--

               The JUDGE indicates the bald burglar.

               We're in a room in a police station and two men are present. 
               One, a COP, is nervous as hell and constantly aware of the 
               door. The other, BACHINSKI, is taking hurried notes in a 
               reporter's type notebook as he examines the evidence.

               THE ADDRESS BOOK. Beside the name "Howard E. Hunt" is the 
               notation "W.House." Now, BACHINSKI hurriedly opens the other 
               book to the letter "H" and there is the same name, "Howard 
               E. Hunt" and beside it, the letters, "W.H."

               THE NEWSROOM as the triangle sound echoes.

               HOWARD SIMONS leaves large Managing Editor's office, walks 
               past another office, knocks twice on the glass wall.

               Inside the Executive Editor's office, BEN BRADLEE sits. As 
               SIMONS knocks, he turns, nods. He appears, for the moment, 
               deep in thought.

               HARRY ROSENFELD on the opposite end of the room hurries out 
               of his office, following a bunch of editors, all of them 
               heading across the huge room. As he passes WOODWARD's desk 
               ROSENFELD pauses.

<b>                                     ROSENFELD

</b>                              (massaging his neck)
                         Lotsa hints--

<b>                                     ROSENFELD
</b>                              (not happy)
                         I can't sell hints to Simons--
                              (stops, looks at piece 
                              of yellow paper)
                         --you called everyone you know?
                              (WOODWARD makes a nod)
                         Call someone you don't know.

               WOODWARD continues to rub his neck as ROSENFELD hurries off, 
               all the editors still moving toward the place where the moon-
               faced man intermittently rings the triangle.

               WOODWARD picks up the sheet of yellow paper from his desk. 
               Lined, legal-sized, it is crammed with names and numbers and 
               addresses. They are in no neat order; looking at them it's 
               almost like following a path; chicken tracks in ink. WOODWARD 
               mutters "to hell with it" and reaches for a thick book, flips 
               it open.

               NOW WE SEE THE BOOK: It's the Washington Phone Directory and 
               we're in the W's. As WOODWARD's finger stops, we can see 
               he's looking at the White HOuse entry number. There it is, 
               just like your name and mine. Listed.

               Now WOODWARD starts to dial, visibly nervous, a fact he tries 
               very hard to keep out of his voice tone.

               He's got the Colson file spread out now, and we see pictures 
               of the man and articles the Post had done on him. But 
               basically what we see is WOODWARD plugging away on the goddamn

               dialing and you know his voice is tiring as this montage 
               goes on, you can hear it grow raspy. But a lot of what a 
               reporter does he does on the phone, and that's what we're 
               compressing here. The dialing never stops, the voices are

               is, it should include that strange smile of his that kept

               BERNSTEIN moves up behind him, carrying a cup of coffee of

                         Post. I was just wondering if you 
                         remember the names of any of the 
                         books that Howard Hunt checked out 
                         on Senator Kennedy.

                         for somebody, but it wasn't Mr. Hunt. 
                         The truth is, I've never had any

<b>               THE HUNT FOR DAHLBERG.

               This is a compressed montage sequence in which we CUT from 
               one reporter to the other, both of them desperately trying 
               to locate a man names DAHLBERG.

               WOODWARD is maybe in the reference room of the Post, sweating, 
               surrounded by Who's Who and Dictionary of American Biographies 
               and phone books from dozens and dozens of cities--

               BERNSTEIN is maybe in the phone booth of the Justice Building, 
               sweating, with a pile of dimes as he dials away.

               This took them hours, and that effort should be visible to 
               us. They tire, grow punchy, but they keep on, checking phone 
               book and dialing numbers and God knows what else. The point 
               is, we want to get to DAHLBERG in a reasonably short amount 
               of time, but we also want people to know there was effort 
               involved.

               Either they get it as it is now, or as they really did, from 
               a Post researcher who knew someone. In ant case, we see the

               We also see the two of them working, first, making long 
               attempts at figuring out who worked for whom at CREEP.

               Then, once they have that, they begin using the cross-
               reference phone books, which are not familiar to moviegoers. 
               And from these, they begin to get the home addresses of the 
               various small-fry people who work for CREEP.

               Near the end alphabetically, there is a common female name, 
               Jane Smith or something like that. As BERNSTEIN runs his

               WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN pulled over to one side. BERNSTEIN, 
               baffled, stares around; WOODWARD looks at a map with the aid 
               of a flashlight.

</b>                              (shaking his head)
                         My first day as a copy boy I was 
                         sixteen and wearing my only grown-up 
                         suit--it was cream colored. At 2:30 
                         the head copy boy comes running up 
                         to me and says, "My God, haven't you 
                         washed the carbon paper yet? If it's 
                         not washed by three, it'll never by 
                         dry for tomorrow."
                              (WOODWARD is getting 
                              interested in the 
                              story now)
                         And I said, "Am I supposed to do 
                         that?" and he said, "Absolutely, 
                         it's crucial." So I run around and 
                         grab all the carbon paper from all 
                         the desks and take it to the men's 
                         room. I'm standing there washing it 
                         and it's splashing all over me and 
                         the editor comes in to take a leak, 
                         and he says, "What the fuck do you 
                         think you're doing?" And I said, 
                         "It's 2:30. I'm washing the carbon 
                         paper."

               WOODWARD goes back to his map. BERNSTEIN continues to smoke, 
               staring around at the night.

                         break-in funds, I went to the safe 
                         and gave him--out of this whole 
                         fortune--I happened to give him the 
                         same hundreds he gave me--banks have 
                         to keep track of hundreds. If the

                         they can suspend the rules because 
                         they're fulfilling a mission. That

                         press conference and appointed Hoover

                         and I was thinking back a year or

                         he wanted to publish the Pentagon 
                         Papers the next day. The Times had 
                         already been stopped from publishing

                         no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. 
                         So we published, and that night,

                         woke up in the darkness and I thought,

<b>               THIS IS WHERE THE SOURCE BURNING SCENE WOULD COME BUT I AM 
</b><b>               NOT WRITING IT FOR THIS VERSION.
</b>
               My reasons are as follows: (1) it is a complicated long scene 
               to put down; (2) we are terribly late in our story; (3) it 
               would mean, here, two hours into the movie, we are bringing 
               in an entirely new character; the FBI agent's head to whom 
               they go, and I think that is unnecessary and confusing; and 
               (4) most important, I think the characters have been abused 
               enough in this version--we have added the Sedam scene and 
               they are berated more in this version by the CREEP people 
               before things turn. (5) Finally, all this can show in reality 
               is that they are desperate, and I would rather let the actors 
               give that to us. I feel that it would be a genuine error at 
               this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how 
               it's bad manners for a reporter to burn a source, if we've 
               got anything going by this point, I can't conceive of much 
               an audience will be less interested in than the reporters 
               misbehaving.

               However, if the scene is requested next time through, I shall 
               be only too happy to oblige.

               What I would like to do is cut from the FBI saying "fuck you 
               fuck you fuck you" and locking his door to the following:

                         leading us on so they could slip it

                         everyone is involved in the cover-
                         up, all the way to the top. The whole 
                         U.S. intelligence community is mixed 
                         in with the covert activities. The 
                         extent of it is incredible.
                              (little pause)
                         And people's lives are in danger, 
                         maybe including ours.

               BRADLEE. He nods again, starts walking the two reporters 
               back toward WOODWARD's car.

</b>                         He's wrong on that last, we're not 
                         in the least danger, because nobody 
                         gives a shit--what was that Gallup 
                         Poll result? Half the country's never 
                         even heard the word Watergate.

               THE RED KARMANN GHIA as the three approach.

</b>                         Look, you're both probably a little 
                         tired, right?
                              (They nod)
                         You should be, you've been under a 
                         lot of pressure. So go home, have a 
                         nice hot bath, rest up fifteen minutes 
                         if you want before you get your asses 
                         back in gear--
                              (louder now)
                         --because we're under a lot of 
                         pressure, too, and you put us there--
                         not that I want it to worry you--
                         nothing's riding on you except the 
                         First Amendment of the Constitution 
                         plus the freedom of the press plus 
                         the reputation of a hundred-year-old 
                         paper plus the jobs of the two 
                         thousand people who work there--
                              (still building)
                         --but none of that counts as much as 
                         this: you fuck up again, I'm gonna 
                         lose my temper.
                              (pause; softer)
                         I promise you, you don't want me to 
                         lose my temper.
                              (shooing them off)
                         Move-move-move--what have you done 
                         for me tomorrow...?

               And as they get back into the car--

</b>
               and it's empty pretty much, except at their desks sit WOODWARD 
               and BERNSTEIN, typing away. They type on and on and as they 
               do, voices are HEARD, the same voices we've become familiar 
               with, the WESTERN SENATOR, the CREEP P.R. MAN and the WHITE 
<b>               HOUSE SPOKESMAN.

<b>                                     WESTERN SENATOR (O.S.)
</b>                         Although I'm a Republican, I would 
                         like to state in a pure bipartisan 
                         spirit tht the greatest political 
                         scandal of this campaign is the brazen 
                         manner in which, without benefit of 
                         clergy, the Washington Post has set 
                         up housekeeping with the McGovern 
                         campaign...

<b>                                     CREEP P.R. MAN
</b>                         For twenty years, the Eastern liberal 
                         press has been trying to smear Dick 
                         Nixon. Fortunately, the American 
                         public is too smart to be fooled 
                         by...

<b>                                     WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
</b>                         I have been informed reliably by 
                         John Dean that no one connected with 
                         the White House...

<b>                                     WESTERN SENATOR
</b>                              (coming in, overlapping)
                         It is only our pathetic Post that 
                         deliberately tries to infuse the 
                         Watergate caper with a seriousness 
                         far beyond those shenanigans that 
                         have been the stock trade of political 
                         pranksters ever since...

               WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN work on. And now, as the voices 
               continue condemning, we see them--all the President's men--
               as their faces flash on the screen for an instant--only these 
               aren't fashion portraits we're looking at, these are the mug 
               shots of the men taken when they went to jail and they flash 
               on, the mug shots and the name and across each the word 
               CONVICTED. There's VIRGILIO GONZALES--CONVICTED, and EUGENIO 
               MARTINEZ, CONVICTED, and FRANK STURGIS, CONVICTED, and BERNARD 
               BARKER, CONVICTED, and JAMES McCORD, CONVICTED, and HOWARD 
               HUNT, CONVICTED, and GORDON LIDDY, CONVICTED, and DONALD 
               SEGRETTI, CONVICTED, and DWIGHT CHAPIN, CONVICTED, and now 
               the denunciations are louder, shriller, briefer.

<b>                                     WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN
</b>                         An insult to the American public--

<b>                                     CREEP P.R. MAN
</b>                         --the deplorable tactics employed by 
                         the Washington Post--

<b>                                     WESTERN SENATOR

                         in possession of the White House and 
                         that evidence--

               WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN type on. Their machines are the only 
               SOUND in the enormous room. And now more mug shots appear--

<b>               JEB MAGRUDER, CONVICTED, EGIL KROGH, CONVICTED, JOHN DEAN,

               and MITCHELL and HALDEMAN--all, all the President's men--
               CONVICTED. Now--

               THE CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE toward the pillar, the one that 
               separates the two reporters, and the denunciations are still 
               going on, but not so loud now, not so fierce.

<b>                                     WESTERN SENATOR
</b>                         Well, if I was wrong, I sure the 
                         hell wasn't alone--

<b>                                     CREEP
</b>                         --the fact remains that except for 
                         Watergate, we ran one hell of a great 
                         campaign...

               The CAMERA is almost at the pillar now.

               BERNSTEIN bums a cigarette from a cleaning lady. WOODWARD 
               kicks his typewriter. Then they both go back to work.

               Now we're at the pillar. That's all we see. Just that. And 
               all we HEAR is the two reporters working away, on and on 
               until--
