The President of the United States is caught making advances on an underage "Firefly Girl" less than two weeks before Election Day.
Conrad Brean (De Niro), a top-notch spin-doctor, is brought in to try to take the public attention away from the scandal.
He decides to construct a fake war with Albania, hoping the media will concentrate on this instead.
In order to come up with his 'war', he contacts Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Hoffman), who brings in a series of specialists who help construct a theme song, build up interest, and fake some footage of an orphan in Albania.

The plan's setbacks, including an error that led to seizing a criminally insane Army prison convict (Harrelson) to be their "hero" who was "shot down behind enemy lines", do not disturb Motss, who repeatedly claims "this is nothing" while comparing the situation to past movie-making catastrophes he averted.
In the end, with the president re-elected, everything seems fine until Motss finds out from the news outlets that the media are crediting the president's win to his tired campaign slogan of "Don't change horses in mid stream" rather than Motss's hard work.
Motss announces that he will call the media to "set them straight", despite Brean's warning that he is "playing with his life".
When Motss refuses to back down, Brean reluctantly has him killed and makes it look as if he had a heart attack.
A news report about a violent incident in Albania is shown, but it is ambiguous whether this is a true event or simply a continuation of the fictional war.
