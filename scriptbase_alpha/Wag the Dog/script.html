<b>                                WAG THE DOG

                                David Mamet






<b>10/14/96
</b>









<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>A CARD, WHITE ON THE BLACK SCREEN, READS:
</b>
            Why does a dog wag its tail?

<b>BENEATH IT, THE NEXT LINE FADES IN:
</b>
            Because a dog is smarter than its tail.

<b>CROSS-FADE TO THE NEXT CARD, WHICH READS:
</b>
            If the tail were smarter, the tail would wag the dog.

<b>DISSOLVE
</b>


<b>FADE IN:
</b>
<b>EXT THE WHITE HOUSE NIGHT
</b>
<b>A VAN FULL OF PEOPLE STOPS AT A SIDE ENTRANCE.
</b>
<b>ANGLE INT THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
<b>AT THE SIDE, UTILITY ENTRANCE, WE SEE THE DISGORGING WORKING-CLASS MEN AND
</b><b>WOMEN, THEY PASS THROUGH SECURITY SCREENING IN THE B.G., THROUGH METAL
</b><b>DETECTORS, AND PAST SEVERAL GUARDS WHO CHECK THE PHOTO-I.D.'S AROUND THEIR
</b><b>NECKS.
</b>
<b>ANGLE INT THE WHITE HOUSE
</b>
<u>WILFRED AMES</u>, AND <u>AMY CAIN</u>, A BRIGHT YOUNG WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES, WALKING DOWN
<b>A CORRIDOR, LOOKING WORRIED.
</b>
<b>ANGLE AMES AND CAIN
</b><b>AMES AND CAIN HAVE STOPPED AT THE END OF THE HALL.  BEYOND THEM WE SEE THE
</b><b>CLEANING PEOPLE COMING IN FROM THE VAN, AND BEING CLEARED THROUGH A METAL
</b><b>DETECTOR INTO A HOLDING AREA, AND HANDED CLEANING MATERIALS, MOPS, VACUUMS, ET
</b><b>CETERA, BY A TYPE HOLDING A CLIPBOARD.  PART OF THE GROUP, A MAN IN HIS
</b><b>FORTIES, IN A RATTY JACKET, OPEN COLLARED SHIRT, PASSES THROUGH THE GROUP,
</b><b>AND IS STOPPED BY A SECRET SERVICEMAN WHO APPEARS NEXT TO AMES.  IN THE B.G.
</b><b>WE SEE A TV IN AN ADJACENT ROOM, SHOWING A POLITICAL COMMERCIAL.
</b>
<b>                          AMES
</b><b>                    (TO SECRET SERVICEMAN)
</b>            ...That's him.

<b>AMES MOVES OUT OF THE SHOT.  LEAVING US ON THE POLITICAL COMMERCIAL.
</b>
<b>WE SEE TWO BUSINESS PEOPLE ON THE PLANE, A MAN AND A WOMAN.
</b>
<b>                          BUSINESSMAN
</b>            Well, all I know, you don't change horses in the middle
            of the stream.

<b>                          BUSINESSWOMAN
</b>            "Don't change Horses," well, there's a lot of truth in
            that.

<b>THE IMAGE SHIFTS TO A PRESIDENT, DOING PRESIDENTIAL THINGS.  AND THE VOICE-
</b><b>OVER.
</b>
<b>                          VOICE-OVER
</b>            For Peace, prosperity, for <u>all</u> of us:  Don't change

<b>ANGLE
</b>
<b>A CORRIDOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE, AS AMES AND THE MAN IN THE RATTY JACKET (BREAN)
</b><b>WALK HURRIEDLY.  AMES FINISHES ONE CIGARETTE AND USES THE BUTT TO LIGHT A
</b><b>FRESH ONE.  THEY PASS BY A LARGE PHOTOGRAPH OF THE BACK OF A MAN, BENDING TO
</b><b>SHAKE HANDS WITH ONE OF A LINE OF GIRLSCOUTS.  AMES GLANCES UP AT THE
</b><b>PHOTOGRAPH AND SHAKES HIS HEAD DEJECTEDLY.
</b>
<b>INT WHITE  HOUSE "SITUATION" ROOM.   NIGHT.
</b>
<b>A WOMAN WITH A STENOPAD, ARRANGING PADS AND PENCILS AT A SMALL CONFERENCE
</b><b>TABLE.  A SECRET SERVICE TYPE PUTS HIS HEAD IN THE ROOM, AND BOWS OUT, AND
</b><b>NODS, BREAN AND AMES ENTER HURRIEDLY.
</b>
<b>                          AMES
</b>            We're going to...

<b>HE STOPS TALKING AS A WHITE HOUSE WAITER ENTERS WITH A TRAY WITH COFFEE THINGS
</b><b>ON IT, FOLLOWED BY TWO YOUNG AIDES, SLEEPY AND DISHEVELLED, WHO ENTER QUICKLY,
</b><b>AND APOLOGIES UNUTTERED, SIT AND MAKE THEMSELVES SMALL.
</b>
<b>BREAN MAKES A LITTLE GESTURE AT THE WAITER, WHO IS SETTING OUT THE COFFEE,
</b><b>AND AT THE STENOGRAPHER, MEANING "GET THEM OUT OF HERE."
</b>
<b>                          AMES
</b>            Thank you, that'll be all.

<b>                    (TO AMES)

<b>                          AMES
</b>            When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.

<b>                          BREAN

<b>AN AIDE ENTERS, WITH SEVERAL TYPED SHEETS, WHICH SHE HANDS TO CAIN. CAIN

<b>IT READS:

</b>            Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't
            that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war
            again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to
            fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>?
            Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time
            has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the
            Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be
            against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst,
            perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah.
            And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You
            have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert.
            Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not
            gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will
            fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.
