Eddie Adams would have been just another high-school drop-out had he not met the likes of adult film director Jack Horner.
Horner transforms Eddie into Dirk Diggler, a rising-star actor with a special gift.
Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the film is a tribute to the decor, style, culture, and social attitudes of the era.
