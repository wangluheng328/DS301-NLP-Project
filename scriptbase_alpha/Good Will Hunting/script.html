                                 Matt Damon &amp; Ben Affleck

<b>                
</b>
<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE -- DAY
</b>
<b>                                                                    CUT TO:
</b>
<b>               INT. L STREET BAR &amp; GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- EVENING
</b>
               The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is 
               ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across 
               several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last 
               nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         Oh my God, I got the most fucked up 
                         thing I been meanin' to tell you.

               As the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a 
               table near the back of the bar.

<b>                                     ALL
</b>                         Oh Jesus. Here we go.

               The guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest 
               of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer. 
               Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a 
               softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22, 
               heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle 
               with.

               Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other 
               guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror 
               stories with eager disgust.

               All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a 
               rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are 
               its product.

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         You guys know my cousin Mikey 
                         Sullivan?

<b>                                     ALL
</b>                         Yeah.

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         Well you know how he loves animals 
                         right?  Anyway, last week he's drivin' 
                         home...
                              (laughs)

<b>                                     ALL
</b>                         What? Come on!

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                              (trying not to laugh)
                         I'm sorry, 'cause you know Mikey, 
                         the fuckin guy loves animals, and 
                         this is the last person you'd want 
                         this to happen to.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         Chuckie, what the fuck happened?

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         Okay. He's driving along and this 
                         fuckin' cat jumps in front of his 
                         car, and so he hits this cat--

               Chuckie is really laughing now.

<b>                                     MORGAN
</b>                         --That isn't funny--

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         --and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!"
                         And he looks in his rearview and 
                         sees this cat -- I'm sorry--

<b>                                     BILLY
</b>                         Fuckin' Chuckie!

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         So he sees this cat tryin to make it 
                         across the street and it's not lookin' 
                         so good.

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         It's walkin' pretty slow at this 
                         point.

<b>                                     MORGAN
</b>                         You guys are fuckin' sick.

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         So Mikey's like "Fuck, I gotta put 
                         this thing out of its misery"--So he 
                         gets a hammer--

<b>                                     WILL/MORGAN/BILLY
</b><b>                         OH!

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         out of his tool box, and starts 
                         chasin' the cat and starts whackin' 
                         it with the hammer. You know, tryin' 
                         to put the thing out of its misery.

<b>                                     MORGAN
</b>                         Jesus.

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         And all the time he's apologizin' to 
                         the cat, goin' "I'm sorry." BANG, 
                         "I'm sorry." BANG!

<b>                                     BILLY
</b>                         Like it can understand.

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         And this Samoan guy comes runnin' 
                         out of his house and he's like "What 
                         the fuck are you doing to my cat?!" 
                         Mikey's like "I'm sorry" --BANG--" I 
                         hit your cat with my truck, and I'm 
                         just trying to put it out of it's 
                         misery" -- BANG! And the cat dies. 
                         So Mikey's like "Why don't you come 
                         look at the front of the truck."
                         'Cause the other guy's all fuckin 
                         flipped out about--

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         Watching his cat get brained.

               Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles.

<b>                                     CHUCKIE
</b>                         Yeah, so he's like "Check the front 
                         of my truck, I can prove I hit it 
                         'cause there's probably some blood 
                         or something"--

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                         --or a tail--

</b>                         And so they go around to the front 
                         of his truck... and there's another 
                         cat on the grille.

<b>                                     WILL/MORGAN/BILLY

               their daily lives.

               We see a panoramic view of South Boston.

               Will sits in his apartment, walls completely bare. A bed, a 
               small night table and an empty basket adorn the room. A stack 
               of twenty or so LIBRARY BOOKS sit by his bed. He is flipping 
               through a book at about a page a second.

               Chuckie stands on the porch to Will's house. His Cadillac 
               idles by the curb. Will comes out and they get in the car.

               We travel across crowded public housing and onto downtown.

               Finally, we gaze across the river and onto the great 
               cementdomed buildings that make up the M.I.T. campus.

               Will comes jogging up towards BOBBY CHAMPA, calling out from 
               across the street,

</b>                              (smiling, good 
                              naturedly)
                         Hey, Bobby Champa! I went to 
                         Kindergarten with you right? Sister 
                         Margaret's class...

               Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure 
               of Will's intentions. Just when it looks as though Bobby 
               might remember him, Will DRILLS HIM with a sucker-punch which 
               begins the

</b>
               Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the 
               hapless Champa out cold.

               As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends CONVERGE ON WILL. 
               Billy JUMPS IN and wrestles one guy to the ground. The two 
               exchange messy punches on the sidewalk.

               Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying 
               to avoid being overrun.

               When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he 
               HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head.

               Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a 
               shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he 
               was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground.

               Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will 
               can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's 
               boys from the hood of a car.

               Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a 
               fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows.

               The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown 
               wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone 
               throws a bottle.

               In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's 
               friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will, 
               standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING 
               him.

<b>               ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT

               Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking 
               them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious 
               Champa, fury in his eyes. Chuckie and Billy pull Will away.

               The POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only 
               witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him.

               A crowd of onlookers have gathered. Chuckie addresses them.

                         Morgan's house for a complementary

               The Police slam Will into the hood of a car.

               The cop holding Will SLAMS his [Will's] face into the hood, 
               another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car. 
               The look of rage returns to Will's eye.

               Will resists. Another cop comes over. Will KICKS HIM IN THE 
               KNEE, dropping the cop. Momentarily freed, Will engages in a 
               fracas with three cops. More converge on Will, who -- though 
               he struggles -- takes a beating.

               draws closer, reveal that the figure is Will, in his janitor's 
               uniform. There is a look of intense concentration in his 
               eyes.

               Will looks up, immediately starts to shuffle off.

               Lambeau follows Will down the hall.

                         supervisor.

               Will walks out. Lambeau goes to "fix" the proof, scanning 
               the blackboard for whatever damage Will caused. He stops, 
               scans the board again. Amazement registers on his face.

               Down the hall, we hear the DOOR CLOSE. He turns to look for 
               Will, who is gone.

               With an imperceptible nod, Casey waves our boys through. A 
               fifth kid, a HARVARD STUDENT, tries to follow. He is stopped 
               by Casey's massive, outstretched arm:

               Chuckie is collecting money from the guys to buy a pitcher, 
               all but Morgan cough up some crumpled dollars.

               Chuckie returns to a table where Will, Morgan and Billy have 
               made themselves comfortable. He [Chuckie] spots two ATTRACTIVE 
               YOUNG HARVARD WOMEN sitting together at the end of the bar.

               Chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair. 
               He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston 
               accent.

                         with you.

               At this point, several interested parties materialize. Morgan 
               Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate 
               themselves within listening distance. A rather large student 
               in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt, CLARK (22) notices Chuckie. 
               He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering 
               over them as protector. This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's 
               attention.

</b>                         Yah, it's not a bad school...

               At this point, Clark can't resist and steps in.

                         have been a survey course then.

               Chuckie nods. Clark notices Chuckie's clothes. Will and Billy 
               exchange a look and move subtly closer.

<b>                                     CLARK

                         talk about school at the bar. But as 
                         long as you're here I want to "seize" 
                         the opportunity to ask you a question.

               Billy shifts his beer into his left hand. Will and Morgan 
               see this. Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say "not again..."

                         history class.

               Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed. They are not.

               When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and 
               rolls her [own] eyes. They laugh. Will sees this and smiles.

</b>                         To tell you the truth, I wasn't there 
                         much. The class was rather elementary.

                         it was. I remember the class, it was 
                         just between recess and lunch.

               Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie.

                         problem?

</b>                         There's no problem. I was just hoping

                         the evolution of the market economy 
                         in the early colonies. My contention 
                         is that prior to the Revolutionary 
                         War the economic modalities especially 
                         of the southern colonies could most 
                         aptly be characterized as agrarian 
                         precapitalist and...

               Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and 
               is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation.

                         strongly entrepreneurial and 
                         capitalist back in 1740. That'll

               Will catches Skylar's eye.

                         with it that way.

               While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark] 
               decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer.

               He turns and walks away. Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a 
               look.

               Morgan turns to a nearby girl.

               Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some amusement 
               as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where the 
               players shoot miniature balls at a small basket. In the B.G.  
               occasionally we hear Chuckie shouting "Larry!" When he scores.

               Skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches Will.

               on a diagram as Tom takes notes. Will seems disinterested.

               He draws a vertical line through the diagram.

               Will the chalk.

               Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at. In a flash he starts 
               drawing lines through the diagram, energized.

               Lambeau steps in, writing with him [Will].

               The two stop. They are silent for a moment. Like two 
               gunfighters after a duel, they put down the chalk.

               This is SEAN MAGUIRE'S "Dying and Bereavement" class. 
               Emblazoned on the door is "room 101." While the lecture hall 
               could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here 
               today.

               Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. Tired 
               of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the 
               tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student 
               body.

                         Okay. If a patient doesn't trust you 
                         then they won't feel safe enough to 
                         be honest with you -- then there's 
                         no point to them being in therapy. 
                         It's like saying -- "Fine, come here 
                         and don't tell me a thing but go 
                         home feeling like you're doing

                         give me my fifty bucks before you 
                         leave will ya'!"

               He looks around the room for approval. No one is listening.

                         them to sleep with you. And that 
                         should be the goal of any good

                         that's always been my motto.

               The students look up, somewhat stunned.

               pretty good, but his on-stage persona could use some work. 
               He is incessantly repeating the phrase "this is the rabbit,

</b>                         Have you ever heard of a man named

</b>                         He was alive over a hundred years 
                         ago.  He was Indian. Dots, not 
                         feathers...

               Sean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         So this Ramanujan lived in a tiny 
                         hut in India. No formal education, 
                         no access to other works. But he 
                         came across an old math book and 
                         from this basic text he was able to 
                         extrapolate theories that had baffled 
                         mathematicians for years.

</b>                         That's right, Sean. He mailed it to 
                         a professor at Cambridge who 
                         immediately recognized the brilliance 
                         in his work and brought Ramanujan to 
                         England.

                         the most exciting math theory ever 
                         done.  Ramanujan's genius was 
                         unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like 
                         that. But he's very defensive and I

               Lambeau looks at Sean, surprised. Sean's stare is unwavering.

               After an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will 
               alone. Will doesn't look at Sean for more than a second. He 
               seems more interested in the room. There is a long silence

               A smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and 
               sits.

                         deep peaceful sleep and haven't

                         give me the skinny on every art book 
                         ever written... Michelangelo? You 
                         know a lot about him I bet. Life's 
                         work, criticisms, political 
                         aspirations. But you couldn't tell 
                         me what it smells like in the Sistine 
                         Chapel. You've never stood there and 
                         looked up at that beautiful ceiling. 
                         And if I asked you about women I'm 
                         sure you could give me a syllabus of 
                         your personal favorites, and maybe 
                         you've been laid a few times too.
                         But you couldn't tell me how it feels 
                         to wake up next to a woman and be 
                         truly happy. If I asked you about 
                         war you could refer me to a bevy of 
                         fictional and non-fictional material, 
                         but you've never been in one. You've 
                         never held your best friend's head 
                         in your lap and watched him draw his 
                         last breath, looking to you for help. 
                         And if I asked you about love I'd 
                         get a sonnet, but you've never looked 
                         at a woman and been truly vulnerable. 
                         Known that someone could kill you 
                         with a look. That someone could rescue 
                         you from grief. That God had put an 
                         angel on Earth just for you.  And 
                         you wouldn't know how it felt to be 
                         her angel. To have the love be there 
                         for her forever. Through anything, 
                         through cancer. You wouldn't know 
                         about sleeping sitting up in a 
                         hospital room for two months holding 
                         her hand and not leaving because the 
                         doctors could see in your eyes that 
                         the term "visiting hours" didn't 
                         apply to you. And you wouldn't know 
                         about real loss, because that only 
                         occurs when you lose something you 
                         love more than yourself, and you've 
                         never dared to love anything that 
                         much. I look at you and I don't see 
                         an intelligent confident man, I don't 
                         see a peer, and I don't see my equal. 
                         I see a boy. Nobody could possibly 
                         understand you, right Will? Yet you 
                         presume to know so much about me 
                         because of a painting you saw.  You 
                         must know everything about me.  You're 
                         an orphan, right?

               Will nods quietly.

                         the first thing about who you are 
                         because I read "Oliver Twist?" And I 
                         don't buy the argument that you don't 
                         want to be here, because I think you 
                         like all the attention you're getting. 
                         Personally, I don't care. There's

                         read somewhere else.  Unless we talk 
                         about your life. But you won't do

               occasionally at the clock. Sean continues to check the clock 
               on the wall. It is the only clock in the room and it is BEHIND

                         And I'm sittin' there and the captain 
                         comes on and is like "we'll be 
                         cruising at 35,000 feet," and does 
                         his thing, then he puts the mike 
                         down but forgets to turn it off. 
                         Then he says "man, all I want right 
                         now is a blow-job and a cup of 
                         coffee."  So the stewardess goes 
                         runnin' up towards the cock-pit to 
                         tell him the mike's still on, and 
                         this guy in the back of the plane 
                         goes "don't forget the coffee!"

                         off in her sleep. I was late for 
                         work all the time because in the

                         and turn the damn thing off. 
                         Eventually I got a second clock and 
                         put it under my side of the bed, but 
                         it got to where she was gettin' to 
                         that one too. She was afraid of the 
                         dark, so the closet light was on all 
                         night. Thing kept me up half the 
                         night.  Eventually I'd fall asleep, 
                         out of sheer exhaustion and not wake

                              (beat)
                         Sean, in 1905 there were hundreds of 
                         Professors who were renowned for 
                         their study of the universe. But it 
                         was a 26-year-old Swiss Patent clerk, 
                         doing physics in his spare time, who 
                         changed the world, Sean. Can you 
                         imagine if Einstein had given that 
                         up? Or gotten drunk with his buddies 
                         in Vienna every night? All of us 
                         would have lost something. And I'm 
                         quite sure Timmy never would have 
                         heard of him.

                         life. But it's important to start 
                         early. I was doing advanced 
                         mathematics at eighteen and it still

                         you play the piano. When you look at 
                         the keys, you see music, you see 
                         Mozart.

</b>                         Well all right, Beethoven. He looked 
                         at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' 
                         guy was deaf when he composed the 
                         Ode to Joy. They had to turn him 
                         around to take a bow because he 
                         couldn't hear the crowd going crazy 
                         behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all 
                         of that music in his head.

</b>                         Not a lick. I look at a piano and I

                         and a box of wood. Beethoven, Mozart, 
                         they looked at it and it just made 
                         sense to them. They saw a piano and 
                         they could play. I couldn't paint 
                         you a picture, I probably can't hit 
                         the ball out of Fenway Park and I 
                         can't play the piano--

               Skylar is awestruck with admiration for Will, the Robot-pimp.

                         When I made the decision to come

                         don't understand why Will never tells 
                         me anything, he won't let me get 
                         close to him, he tells me these weird

               puts it out. He looks up at Will.

                         Yes. That's right, Will. Most days I 
                         wish I never met you. Because then I 
                         could sleep at night. I wouldn't 
                         have to walk around with the knowledge 
                         that someone like you was out there. 
                         And I wouldn't have to watch you 
                         throw it all away.

               Lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the 
               wrinkled proof. He picks it up, smooths it out.

               A beat. Will has obviously been stewing on this.

</b>                         Say I'm working at N.S.A. Somebody 
                         puts a code on my desk, something 
                         nobody else can break. So I take a 
                         shot at it and maybe I break it. And 
                         I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I 
                         did my job well.  But maybe that 
                         code was the location of some rebel 
                         army in North Africa or the Middle 
                         East. Once they have that location, 
                         they bomb the village where the rebels 
                         were hiding and fifteen hundred people 
                         I never had a problem with get killed. 
                         (rapid fire) Now the politicians are 
                         sayin' "send in the Marines to secure 
                         the area" 'cause they don't give a 
                         shit. It won't be their kid over 
                         there, gettin' shot. Just like it 
                         wasn't them when their number got 
                         called, 'cause they were pullin' a 
                         tour in the National Guard. It'll be 
                         some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel 
                         in the ass.  And he comes home to 
                         find that the plant he used to work 
                         at got exported to the country he 
                         just got back from. And the guy who 
                         put the shrapnel in his ass got his 
                         old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen 
                         cents a day and no bathroom breaks. 
                         Meanwhile my buddy from Southie 
                         realizes the only reason he was over 
                         there was so we could install a 
                         government that would sell us oil at 
                         a good price. And of course the oil 
                         companies used the skirmish to scare 
                         up oil prices so they could turn a 
                         quick buck. A cute, little ancillary 
                         benefit for them but it ain't helping 
                         my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And 
                         naturally they're takin' their sweet 
                         time bringin' the oil back and maybe 
                         even took the liberty of hiring an 
                         alcoholic skipper who likes to drink 
                         seven and sevens and play slalom 
                         with the icebergs and it ain't too 
                         long 'til he hits one, spills the 
                         oil, and kills all the sea-life in 
                         the North Atlantic. So my buddy's 
                         out of work and he can't afford to 
                         drive so he's got to walk to the job 
                         interviews which sucks 'cause the 
                         shrapnel in his ass is givin' him 
                         chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile 
                         he's starvin' 'cause every time he 
                         tries to get a bite to eat the only 
                         blue-plate special they're servin' 
                         is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                              (has to smile)
                         Thank you, Will. I'll do that.

               Will smiles, turns and walks away.

<b>               INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY
</b>
               Sean is packing his office. Lambeau opens the door.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         Hello, Sean.

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         Come in.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         Sean...

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                              (a beat)
                         Me too.

               A moment.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         So I hear you're taking some time.

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd 
                         travel some. Maybe write a little 
                         bit.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         Where're you going?

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         I don't know. India maybe.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         Why there?

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         Never been.

               Lambeau nods.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         Do you know when you'll be back?

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                              (picks up a flyer 
                              from his desk)
                         I got this mailer the other day. 
                         Class of Sixty-five is having this 
                         event in six months.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         I got one of those too.

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         You should come. I'll buy you a drink.

               Lambeau smiles.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         Sean...

               A beat.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         The drinks at those things are free.

               Sean smiles.

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         Hell, I know that.

               Both men laugh.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         How about one now?

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         Sounds good.

               They start to walk out.

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         It's on you though, until eight 
                         o'clock tonight when I win my money.

               Sean pulls out his lottery ticket. They start out down the 
               hall.

<b>                                                                    CUT TO:

               On their backs as they walk down the hall.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         Sean, do you have any idea what the 
                         odds are against winning the lottery?

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         I don't know... Gotta be at least 
                         four to one.

<b>                                     LAMBEAU
</b>                         About thirty million to one.

<b>                                     SEAN
</b>                         You're pretty quick with those 
                         numbers.  How about the odds of me 
                         buying the first round?

<b>                                     LAMBEAU

</b>
<b>               EXT. BANK OF THE CHARLES RIVER -- AFTERNOON
</b>
               Will sits alone, thinking. We hold on him for an extended 
               beat until he gets up and walks away.

<b>               OMITTED
</b>
<b>               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- EARLY EVENING
</b>
               Begin final sequence.

               A wide, establishing shot of Sean's apartment complex as the 
               sun is setting. The lights are on in one unit. A tighter 
               shot reveals Sean, in his apartment, packing his belongings 
               in cardboard boxes.

<b>               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT, STREET -- SAME
</b>
               The camera cranes down from Sean's window and onto the street, 
               where we pan to reveal Will, sitting in his car and looking 
               up at Sean as he packs his things. Will's car is packed full 
               of clothes and books.

<b>               EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- SAME
</b>
               Chuckie and the boys drive down the street in the Cadillac.

               Morgan and Billy ride in the back, leaving the shotgun seat 
               open for Will.

<b>               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME
</b>
               Will holds an envelope which he slips in Sean's mailbox. He 
               puts the flag up and smiles as he looks up at Sean in his 
               apartment who is still unaware that Will is there.

<b>               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME
</b>
               Chuckie pulls up in front of Will's house. He honks the horn, 
               waits a beat, then gets out and heads toward the house.

<b>               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME
</b>
               Will drives away from Sean's house. Sean hears the car pull 
               out and looks out the window. Sean sees Will's car pulling 
               away.

               Curious, he investigates.

<b>               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME
</b>
               Chuckie walks up Will's front steps.

<b>               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME
</b>
               Sean walks out to the sidewalk and looks around. Seeing the 
               mailbox flag has been raised, he walks over to it.

<b>               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME
</b>
               Chuckie knocks on Will's front door. There is no answer. He 
               waits a beat, looks in the window. An incredulous smile slowly 
               starts to form.

<b>               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME
</b>
               Sean opens the card Will left for him. It reads:

<b>                                     WILL
</b>                              (in writing)
                         Sean -- If the Professor calls about 
                         that job, just tell him, "Sorry, I 
                         had to go see about a girl."

<b>               EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME
</b>
               Chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the 
               broad smile. He knows Will is gone. He shrugs in explanation 
               to the guys. Morgan takes Will's seat as they pull away from 
               the curb.

<b>               EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME
</b>
               We pan up from the letter to Sean. A broad smile comes over 
               him.

               This is a look we haven't seen. Sean is truly happy.

<b>               EXT. MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE -- SUNSET
</b>
               Will is on the road, driving away. As we pull back and credits 
               roll, the car disappears into the horizon.

<b>                                         THE END
