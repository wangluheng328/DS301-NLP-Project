Peter Gibbons just can't seem to catch a break.
His girlfriend is cheating on him, he has an obnoxious neighbor, and he's completely miserable with his job as a small cog in a company called Initech.
Then he visits a hypnotherapist, who dies just after putting Peter into a state of complete bliss.
Free of worrying about making a living, he no longer feels the need to keep his job, just as the company is going through a massive downsizing.
However, his new attitude only makes him more valuable in the company's eyes, and his friends Michael and Samir are fired instead.
Together, they scheme to plant a virus inside Initech's computer system that will pull money into their own account.
