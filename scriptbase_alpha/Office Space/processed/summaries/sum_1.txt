Three engineers have had enough of the daily grind working their dull, mundane jobs at Initech Corporation.
Subjected to filling out useless forms, fighting with faulty office equipment, and their obnoxious boss Bill Lumbergh are enough to drive anyone crazy.
There's also other odd characters like Tom Smykowski and Milton Waddams.
When Initech announces that they're bringing in "consultants" to "clean house" (read: fire a bunch of programmers so that means a nice big bonus for the boss), Michael, Samir, and Peter scheme to reclaim their freedom with a software programming scheme that aims to take Initech for a small fortune through a virus that is designed to skim a little off the top.
Unfortunately thanks to a typo, that virus skims a lot off.
Realizing they don't have much time the three scramble to cover their tracks, but constantly shoot themselves in the foot.
Can they recover and get out of their predicament safely?
And will Milton reclaim his famous red stapler?
