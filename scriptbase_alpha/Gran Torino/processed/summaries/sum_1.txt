Walt Kowalski is an embittered Korean War veteran who has just lost his wife.
The world has changed around him as well.
His once all-white neighborhood is now mostly Southeast Asian and he has a Hmong family living next door.
He doesn't get along with his sons and is out of touch with his grandchildren, all of whom seem more interested in getting his house than anything else.
His pride and joy, however, is his mint condition 1972 Gran Torino.
When the Hmong teenager who lives next door, Thao, is challenged by his cousin and other local gang members to steal it, Walt almost shoots him.
Gradually, however, he realizes he has more in common with his neighbors than his own family and becomes something of a neighborhood hero when he prevents the gangbangers from forcing Thao into their car.
He gradually takes Thao under his wing, teaching him a few things about life and helps getting him a job.
Walt's intervention has a price, however, when the gang shoots up Thao's house and attack his sister Sue.
For Walt, it's time to take action, though not in a way you would expect.
