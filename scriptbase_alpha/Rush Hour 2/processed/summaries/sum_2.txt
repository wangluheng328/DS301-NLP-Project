Lee and Carter are back!
This time they're in Hong Kong.
Carter wants a relaxing vacation but Lee just wants to do police work.
At a night club, Lee spots an evil agent named Ricky Tan, who runs an evil gang of counterfeiters, and his partner is a woman who delivers packages containing bombs.
Lee and Carter follow these two aboard a boat where their attempted bust really busts, so Lee and Carter fly back to Los Angeles where they meet a woman in the Secret Service who helps them on their mission to find the counterfeiters.
Lee and Carter are captured by the bad guys but soon escape into a sewer come emerge in downtown Las Vegas.
