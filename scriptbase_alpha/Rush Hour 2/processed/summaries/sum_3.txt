Det.
James Carter is on vacation in Hong Kong, but Inspector Lee is too busy doing police work.
After an explosion at the American Embassy, Lee attempts to track down the man who may be responsible, Ricky Tan, a Triad gang leader and the former partner of Lee's father, who was also a cop.
Obviously, Carter doesn't appreciate being dragged along like that, but what choice does he have?
Lee discovers a power struggle among the Triads between Tan and Hu Li.
They later find out it has something to do with the death of Lee's father, and a counterfeiting scheme.
Lee and Carter go back to Cali, and later Las Vegas, where they discover that everything that's happened goes way beyond an explosion at the Embassy.
