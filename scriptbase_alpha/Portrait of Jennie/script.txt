               It is a cold wintry day and, although there is no snow, an 
               icy wind whips around the building.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Superimposed over this is the following legend:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               4. INTERIOR METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - ONE OF THE 
               ROOMS

               We see a group of children -- about ten years of age -- 
               standing before one of the paintings. It is obviously a class. 
               A middle-aged woman is lecturing to them.

               CAMERA GOES CLOSER and we see the woman and children more 
               closely. The woman -- Miss Spinney -- seems remote and far 
               away -- her lecture for the most part a cold recital of facts.

               CAMERA PANS UP TO A CLOSE SHOT OF THE PAINTING - "CARDINAL 
               NINO DE GUEVARA" -

                                     SPINNEY
                         Cardinal Nino de Guevara -- painted 
                         by El Greco around 1596. El Greco is 
                         of the Spanish school -- although he 
                         was really a Greek. That is what El 
                         Greco means -- "The Greek." El Greco 
                         cared nothing for the charms of the 
                         flesh --
                              (suddenly she catches 
                              herself, hesitates 
                              and hurries on)
                         That is -- I mean -- I mean he was 
                         only interested in -- well -- in the 
                         spirit of a person. For example, in 
                         this painting he didn't try to make 
                         the man look just pretty -- he tried 
                         to show us what the man thought and 
                         felt -- what the man's spirit was!

                         Was he a real Cardinal?

                                     SPINNEY
                         Yes. El Greco's portraits are of 
                         real people.

                                     LITTLE BOY
                         But sometimes a painter paints people 
                         who aren't real.

                                     SPINNEY
                         That's true, Johnny. Different artists 
                         are inspired by different things. 
                         Sometimes it's their wives -- or 
                         their mothers --

                                     CYNICAL LITTLE BOY
                         Or their goil-friends --

               The children giggle a little.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (seriously, but smiling)
                         Yes, Freddie -- or their girl friends.
                              (her smile fades as 
                              she looks away a 
                              little)
                         But, of course, some artists are 
                         inspired by things that only they 
                         can see --

                                     CYNICAL LITTLE BOY
                         Aw! How can dey see anything no one 
                         else sees? Are dey crazy?

                                     SPINNEY
                         No. A lot of people do think artists 
                         are crazy, but that's only because 
                         we ordinary people haven't the vision 
                         of genius -- We miss so much... so 
                         much... Things we just don't see -- 
                         until that --
                              (she turns to Freddie, 
                              smiles a little)
                         that craziness you speak of, Freddie, 
                         shows them to us.

               She pauses a moment. We HOLD her for a foot or two as she's 
               lost in her thoughts.

               5. THE CHILDREN

               Watch her -- and the Cynical Little Boy makes a gesture to 
               the other children covertly, indicating that Miss Spinney is 
               a bore or nuts or both. After a moment we hear over this, 
               Spinney's voice:

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                         Take William Blake, for example --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               6. CLOSE SHOT OF THE PAINTING THE WISE AND FOOLISH VIRGINS 
               BY WILLIAM BLAKE

               We hear Spinney's voice over the painting, then CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK to include Spinney and the children in front of the 
               painting.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Blake seldom used models for any of 
                         his figures. He saw what we see -- 
                         but he also saw the spirit -- and 
                         that's what he painted. Just before 
                         he died he said, "I should be sorry 
                         if I had any earthly fame, for 
                         whatever natural glory a man has is 
                         so much taken away from his spiritual 
                         glory. Why, when Blake was only a 
                         little boy --
                              (she turns to Freddie)
                         -- about your age, Freddie -- he saw 
                         a whole flock of angels sitting on 
                         the boughs of a tree.

                                     CYNICAL LITTLE BOY
                              (scornfully)
                         Angels!

                                     SPINNEY
                         You don't believe in angels?

                                     CYNICAL LITTLE BOY
                         Coitainly not!

                                     SPINNEY
                         Don't be so sure... When you're older 
                         you'll believe in lots of things you 
                         can't see.
                              (then that same far-
                              away look)

                                     ROMANTIC LITTLE GIRL
                         Are those angels, Miss Spinney?

                                     SPINNEY
                         No -- those are virgins. The picture 
                         is called "The Wise and Foolish 
                         Virgins."

                                     CYNICAL LITTLE BOY
                              (examining the painting)
                         Which is de wise ones?

                                     SPINNEY
                              (hurriedly)
                         Come, children. We'll go to the next 
                         one.

               As they start off, we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               7. ANGLE ON FACES OF SPINNEY AND CHILDREN

               They are staring at a portrait (behind CAMERA), and are 
               obviously very much taken with it. After a moment:

                                     ROMANTIC LITTLE GIRL
                         My! Isn't she pretty?

                                     SPINNEY
                              (a little surprised)
                         Pretty?... Yes, she is pretty... 
                         very pretty.

                                     ANOTHER CHILD
                              (advancing a step, 
                              looks down and reads 
                              slowly)
                         "Portrait... of... Jennie... by 
                         Eben... Adams."

               During the last couple of words, the CAMERA HAS MOVED UP AND 
               FORWARD TO A CLOSEUP OF SPINNEY. We see in her face how much 
               this portrait means to her; her emotion and her pride.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Yes... "Portrait of Jennie -- by 
                         Eben Adams."

               There is almost a suggestion of a tear in her eye as she 
               looks at the portrait.

               8. REVERSE ANGLE ON THE GROUP - COMPARATIVELY LOW CAMERA

               During the following, we SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal the 
               portrait bit by bit until it is in full view over the heads 
               of the group at the end of the following:

               At first Spinney is again the professional teacher, but as 
               she gets toward the end of the speech, her personal interest 
               and emotion and increase in feeling take hold of her again.

                                     SPINNEY
                         -- And it might be well to note -- 
                         with some pride, perhaps -- that 
                         here we have a portrait painted by 
                         an American -- and not so many years 
                         ago -- that has been considered of 
                         sufficient merit to hang here in the 
                         Metropolitan... In this portrait you 
                         can feel the extraordinary spiritual 
                         vision of the artist -- not only his 
                         talent as a painter, but the genius 
                         that we can only sense -- and not 
                         quite understand.

               9. A SHOT OF THE PORTRAIT ITSELF

               (NOTE: It is suggested that in the staging of the whole scene 
               we try to get the effect of a slightly changing light; and 
               that we also try to get this in the Long Shot Exterior with 
               which the picture opens in order to justify this slightly 
               changing light. This in order that we might be able to take 
               full advantage of Joe August's stunningly successful test 
               experiments with the slightly changing light on the portrait 
               in this particular angle. But we should have protection 
               without the changing light in the event that this does not 
               work out well.)

               There is nothing under this shot of the portrait but the 
               MUSIC. Here it is suggested that we introduce for the first 
               time the "WHERE I COME FROM" theme, starting its use during 
               and under Spinney's speech and giving it full play without 
               dialogue under this shot.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - PERHAPS PROFILE AND LOW CAMERA - ON SPINNEY 
               AND THE CHILDREN -

               (The shot in any event should feature Spinney -- and this is 
               an excellent opportunity to make superb use of Miss 
               Barrymore's profile.)

                                     ROMANTIC LITTLE GIRL
                         Was Jennie real?

                                     SPINNEY
                         Well now, Millicent, there's a strange 
                         legend about that. I never saw Jennie, 
                         but --
                              (she stops herself 
                              short and the far-
                              away look comes into 
                              her eyes)

                                     ROMANTIC LITTLE GIRL
                         Did anyone ever see her?

                                     SPINNEY
                              (pulling herself 
                              together, coming out 
                              of her thoughts)
                         Why, of course. Eben Adams saw her. 
                         There's the portrait. It's proof 
                         that he saw her. I remember he once 
                         said...

                                     ROMANTIC LITTLE GIRL
                              (interrupting)
                         Oh, did you know Eben Adams?

               Pause as Spinney realizes she has gone too far, but now she 
               must proceed and answer the question.

                                     SPINNEY
                         I knew him in the days before he 
                         painted this picture -- and in the 
                         days after -- when he --

               The Cynical Little Boy gives an elaborate and noisy fake 
               yawn. She looks at him, realizes that she's been carried 
               away for a second. She is embarrassed, lowers her eyes, then 
               regains her dignity and composure.

                                     SPINNEY
                         That will be all for today, children. 
                         Class is dismissed.

                                     THE CHILDREN
                         Yes, Miss Spinney. Goodbye, Miss 
                         Spinney.

               The children are delighted that the class is over. The Cynical 
               Little Boy is out first and way ahead of them. The Romantic 
               Little Girl trails behind a few feet reluctantly, looking 
               back at the portrait and Miss Spinney.

                                     ROMANTIC LITTLE GIRL
                              (tenderly)
                         Goodbye, Miss Spinney...

               Spinney doesn't answer, for she is again lost in her thoughts 
               as she looks at the picture. CAMERA MOVES UP SLOWLY to Spinney 
               so that we see clearly she is not speaking, and we hear her 
               voice in almost a stage whisper.

               (NOTE: Mr. Stewart will please note that we should experiment 
               with Miss Barrymore's voice before we reach this scene and 
               see what effects we can get with this and other narrations 
               through the picture.)

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                         Eben -- Eben -- how slowly the years 
                         go by -- such tired, dead years -- 
                         if I could only turn them back to 
                         you. Yes, back to the days when you 
                         were poor -- and cold -- and 
                         friendless -- your work unknown. 
                         Harsh, harsh years for you, Eben --

               As she is speaking:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CENTRAL PARK - WINTER

               (already shot)

               Along the deserted walk we see Eben Adams, walking slowly 
               and dejectedly. He is a slender young man in his thirties, 
               bare-headed, dressed in a thin shabby overcoat hanging loosely 
               from his hunched shoulders. He is carrying a large portfolio 
               containing sketches. His face is weary, bitter, preoccupied.

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         For those were the years when there 
                         was a hunger in you for more than 
                         food. There was a suffering in you 
                         that was worse than anything a winter, 
                         or poverty, could do. It was a winter 
                         of your mind when the life of your 
                         genius seemed frozen and motionless -- 
                         and how did you know if spring would 
                         ever come again to set it free?

               As she is talking:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               12. EXTERIOR MATHEWS GALLERY - SHOOTING TOWARD THE SHOP

               Adams stops, looks at the brass plates on the small building. 
               His eye stops at one and we either MOVE IN to it or CUT to 
               it:

                                 MATHEWS-SPINNEY GALLERY

               13. BACK TO ADAMS

               Adams decides to go in and enters.

               During the above action, we hear Spinney's voice:

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         Oh, Eben, I will never forget the 
                         day you first came into our place. 
                         There was a desperation that had 
                         taken hold of you, a dreadful feeling 
                         of the world's indifference. Your 
                         courage was running out fast, like 
                         sands from a glass. You were at the 
                         bottom -- without money or friends -- 
                         without hope --

               14. INTERIOR MATHEWS GALLERY - FULL SHOT

               (NOTE: It is suggested that we not see Adams' face very 
               clearly, if at all, in scenes 12, 13 or 14 until the place 
               indicated. We've built up to Adams and let's raise the curtain 
               on him.)

               It is a small place -- a one room gallery in the rear. There 
               is nobody in the room when Adams enters (CAMERA is on his 
               back -- Adams walks away from CAMERA. We still have not seen 
               his face), but when the tinkle of the doorbell is heard, a 
               man emerges from the office. It is Henry Mathews. He 
               approaches Adams. CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO A MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
               OF ADAMS AND MATHEWS, SHOOTING OVER ADAMS' SHOULDER AT 
               MATHEWS.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

               15. ANOTHER ANGLE - OVER MATHEW'S SHOULDER AT ADAMS

               Adams is opening his portfolio. In the middle of this angle, 
               he rather slowly, but not unnaturally, raises his head and 
               for the first time we see his face.

                                     ADAMS
                         I don't know. You could buy one of 
                         my pictures, perhaps.

               Mathews coughs lightly.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (worriedly)
                         Landscapes?

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes, mostly.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Well, I don't know. Of course we buy 
                         very, very little... almost nothing. 
                         And the times being what they are... 
                         however, let me see what you have.

               The camera trucks with them to a small table near the window. 
               Adams starts to open his portfolio.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (continuing)
                         Landscapes... hmmmm... yes... too 
                         bad.

               16. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE WITH SKETCHES

               Adams has opened the portfolio and stands aside to let 
               Matthews look at them.

                                     ADAMS
                              (in way of explanation)
                         Those are some studies I did at Cape 
                         Cod... That one is the fisheries at 
                         North Truro.
                              (as MATTHEWS turns 
                              the sketches)
                         That's Cragmore.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (sadly)
                         Landscapes!

               As they are speaking, a woman comes in from a rear room and 
               quietly looks over Matthews' shoulder at the sketches. She 
               is a lean frosty-eyed woman of about forty-five -- and we 
               suddenly realize that it is MISS SPINNEY -- years younger.

                                     ADAMS
                              (burning a bit at 
                              Matthews' attitude)
                         Here are one or two sketches of the 
                         city. There's the bridge.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (vaguely)
                         Yes... Yes, it's a good bridge. I 
                         just don't happen to like bridges. 
                         They come in every day by the dozen.

               He suddenly notices Miss Spinney, peering over his shoulder.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Miss Spinney -- you startled me! 
                         This is my partner, Miss Spinney -- 
                         I don't believe I caught your name.

                                     ADAMS
                         I didn't say it.
                              (With kind of sharp, 
                              defiant pride, as 
                              though he were saying 
                              "Raphael" or 
                              "Rembrandt")
                         My name is Eben Adams.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (brusquely)
                         What are you so defensive about?

                                     ADAMS
                              (backing down a little)
                         I'm not --

                                     SPINNEY
                              (mocking him)
                         "I'm Eben Adams!" You might be better 
                         off if you weren't! You might eat.

               Adams grimly starts to put his pictures back in the portfolio.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Don't be in such a hurry! Let's see 
                         what else you've got.

                                     ADAMS
                         Nothing, I'm afraid, that would 
                         interest you or your partner.

                                     SPINNEY
                         You're probably right. But do you 
                         mind if I take a look at what 
                         interests you?

               Spinney's brusqueness seems to intimidate Adams. He lets her 
               take the portfolio away from him, and she starts to turn 
               through the pictures. Adams looks somewhat helplessly at 
               Matthews, who shrugs his shoulders, having bowed for many 
               years before the natural force that is Miss Spinney.

               FLOWER

                                     SPINNEY
                              (Dryly)
                         You paint a nice flower.

               18. MED. CLOSE SHOT - ADAMS MATTHEWS SHOOTING TOWARDS SPINNEY

                                     ADAMS
                         Thank you.
                              (With a flash of 
                              irritation, reaching 
                              for the portfolio)
                         Look, Miss Spinney --

                                     SPINNEY
                              (Ignoring him)
                         Sit down, Adams. You may not sell 
                         anything, but you can rest.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (Softly)
                         I'd advise you to sit down.

               ADAMS sits down reluctantly.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (slowly, almost 
                              indifferently, as 
                              she continues to 
                              look at the paintings)
                         Ever read Robert Browning?

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes... a long time ago.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Remember his poem about Andrea Del 
                         Sarto? The perfect painter? -- 
                         proportion, anatomy, color, -- he 
                         had everything. And he had nothing. 
                         He could paint a perfect hand, where 
                         Raphael drew a formless claw. But 
                         Raphael loved what he did, and poor 
                         Andy Del Sarto...

                                     ADAMS
                         I get your point.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (embarrassed by her 
                              forthrightness)
                         Miss Spinney --

                                     SPINNEY
                         Oh, don't be so soft, Mr. Mathews! 
                         I'm an old maid -- and no one knows 
                         love like an old maid!
                              (almost harshly, to 
                              Adams)
                         And there isn't a drop of it in your 
                         work!

               19. CLOSE SHOT SPINNEY SHOOTING TO ADAMS

               She looks straight into Adams' eyes. He stares back at her. 
               After a few moments, Adams' eyes waver; he turns away.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (relentlessly)
                         You're a closed man, Adams. You must 
                         learn to care deeply about something. 
                         We'll take the flower.

                              (shocked)
                         What?

                                     SPINNEY
                         Yes -- I have a weakness for flowers, 
                         and he doesn't do too badly with 
                         them.
                              (to Adams)
                         We'll give you twelve dollars and 
                         fifty cents, and if there's any 
                         argument, there's no sale.

                                     ADAMS
                              (with a wry smile)
                         There's no argument.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Pay him, Mr. Mathews.

               MATHEWS, bewildered, takes out a wallet, peels off some bills.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Have you got change of a dollar?

                                     ADAMS
                         I haven't got a dime.

                                     SPINNEY
                         He'll owe us fifty cents.

                                     ADAMS
                         If you want more flowers, I've a 
                         carload of them at home.

                                     SPINNEY
                         That's what I was afraid of.
                              (then, gruffly)
                         Good day, Adams.

                                     ADAMS
                         Good day -- and --

               He hesitates. Spinney turns back and looks at him. Their 
               eyes meet for a moment.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Yes?

                                     ADAMS
                         Thank you. I -- I don't think you 
                         really want the painting.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (gruffly)
                         If I hadn't wanted it I wouldn't 
                         have taken it.

               They look at each other a moment, then Adams smiles -- a 
               warm understanding smile. Then suddenly he blurts out, 
               impulsively --

                                     ADAMS
                         You have beautiful eyes.

               Miss Spinney stares at him, bewildered, not believing her 
               ears.

                                     ADAMS
                         Good bye.

               He goes out of the door. Spinney stands looking after him, 
               lost in thought, a strange, distant smile on her lips. 
               Matthews looks at her a moment, a faint smile on his face. 
               Then he looks down at the painting.

               21. MED. CLOSE SHOT MATTHEWS, SPINNEY

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Oh, dear, I'm afraid that painting 
                         isn't worth more than a couple of 
                         dollars.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (Her mind way off)
                         No -- but Adams is.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (with unaccustomed 
                              spunk)
                         Of course, we're supposed to be in 
                         business for profit, Miss Spinney...
                              (frightened at the 
                              enormity of his 
                              courage)
                         I thought.

                                     SPINNEY
                         I bought this painting for myself.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Oh --
                              (with a smile -- 
                              relieved)
                         It's peculiar what a little compliment 
                         can do.

               Slowly Miss Spinney looks at him.

                                     SPINNEY
                         My first in twenty years, Mr. 
                         Matthews.

               She turns and goes out of the room, Matthews following her 
               with his eyes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               (already shot)

               As he walks along, he is deep in thought. From far away, the 
               sound of a piano can be heard. Some one is playing a simple 
               tune with one finger. Curiously, this melody seems to drift 
               out of an open window across the square, clearly and 
               distinctly, in spite of the city noises.

               (already shot)

               Now he notices a parcel lying on one of the benches. It is 
               something wrapped in an old faded newspaper and tied together 
               with a string. He approaches the bench, bends over the parcel 
               and reaches out to pick it up. At this instant, a voice is 
               heard.

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                         It belongs to me.

               We see his tired face turning in astonishment toward the 
               voice.

               (already shot)

               Jennie is putting the finishing touches to a snow man. She 
               is dressed in old-fashioned clothes, a coat, gaiters, high 
               buttoned shoes, and large beaver hat. Adams watches her for 
               a while. She is paying no attention to him whatsoever.

                                     ADAMS

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes, it's late.

                                     JENNIE
                         Well, I don't have to go home yet.

                         No. Why should there be?

               She puts the finishing touches to the snow man, sticks a 
               twig in his side.

                                     JENNIE

                                     JENNIE
                         Jennie Appleton. Father and Mother 
                         are actors and actresses. They're 
                         working at Hammerstein's Victoria. 
                         They do juggling on a rope.

                                     ADAMS
                         Because it was torn down years ago, 
                         when I was a boy.

                                     JENNIE
                         You must be thinking of some other 
                         place because I was there only 
                         yesterday.

               29. ANOTHER ANGLE OF ADAMS AND JENNIE

               (already shot)

               Shooting across their shoulders down on the portfolio which 
               is resting in Jennie's lap. Adams watches her closely as her 
               face puckers up with concentration. Silently, she turns a 
               few of the sketches -- mostly landscapes of the Park and the 
               City -- until she comes to a sketch of Cape Cod. It shows a 
               church with its steeple standing near the bay. A dark, stormy 
               sky stretches across the landscape.

                                     JENNIE
                         Those are awful little windows for 
                         such a big church.

                         They have to be little -- there's so 
                         much wind on Cape Cod.

                                     JENNIE
                         I don't like it. It scares me.

                                     ADAMS
                         The wind?

                         No -- the black water.

                              moment)
                         There should be a lighthouse out 
                         there on the ocean.

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes, there should be. How do you 
                         know?

                         I don't exactly remember.
                              (she puts her finger 
                              on the sketch)
                         Some day I'll show it to you. Out 
                         there on the rocks. The Land's End

                         You're wrong. Cecily Brown's father 
                         is in Germany now. He sees him all 
                         the time.

                                     ADAMS
                         But he...

                                     JENNIE
                         He says the Kaiser rides around on a 
                         white horse and he likes to fight. I 
                         can fight, too. I can fight Cecily. 
                         She's bigger but I'm stronger. I can 
                         fight her good.

                                     ADAMS
                         I thought Cecily was your best friend.

                                     JENNIE
                         She is. It's fun having somebody to 
                         play with. Don't you have anyone to 
                         play with?

                                     ADAMS
                              (laughs)
                         No.
                              (he rises to go)

                                     JENNIE
                              (getting up)
                         Well, I'll walk a ways with you, if 
                         you don't mind -- because it's a 
                         little lonesome here all by myself.
                              (she comes to his 
                              side)
                         I know a song, too. Would you like 
                         to hear it?

               As they walk along, she sings, camera pulling back with them. 
               It is the same simple, haunting tune we have heard before 
               played on the piano.

                                     JENNIE
                              (singing)
                         Where I come from Nobody knows; And 
                         where I'm going Everything goes.
                         The wind blows, the sea flows -- 
                         Nobody knows. Where I come from
                         Nobody knows.

               They stop walking.

                                     ADAMS
                         Who taught you that?

                                     JENNIE
                         Nobody. It's just a song... Do you 
                         know the game I like to play best?

                                     ADAMS
                         No. What?

                                     JENNIE
                         It's a wishing game. I'll tell you 
                         what I wish most.

                                     ADAMS
                         What do you wish?

                                     JENNIE
                         First you have to close your eyes 
                         and turn around three times.

               Adams watches her as Jennie closes her eyes and turns around.

                                     JENNIE
                              (as she turns)
                         I wish you'd wait for me to grow up 
                         so we can always be together.
                              (she stops and faces 
                              him)
                         But you won't, I guess.
                              (quickly)
                         Well, I can't talk to you anymore... 
                         Goodbye.

               Jennie turns and starts to walk away from him. Adams suddenly 
               recalls the parcel.

                                     ADAMS
                         I'll get your parcel.

               He goes to the bench.

               CLOSE SHOT - BENCH

               (already shot)

               On it lies the parcel wrapped in the faded newspaper. Adams 
               picks it up.

               MED. SHOT - ADAMS

               (already shot)

               He turns back to where he left Jennie and there is no sign 
               of her.

               Slowly, CAMERA PANS down the road. It is empty. Jennie is 
               gone.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               34. MED. CLOSE SHOT INT. OLD BROWNSTONE NIGHT (WINTER) HALL

               Everything is quiet for a moment, and then the front door 
               opens cautiously and we see Adams come in. He closes the 
               door quietly behind him and starts softly toward the stairs. 
               As he about reaches them, we hear a voice o.s.

                                     VOICE
                         Is that you, Mr. Adams?

               We see Adams' shoulders suddenly slump. He gives a deep sigh 
               and turns wearily.

                                     ADAMS
                              (resigned)
                         Yes, Mrs. Jekes.

               35. A SMALL LIVING ROOM OFF THE HALL

               In it we see, Mrs. Jekes -- a tall, boney woman -- sitting 
               with another woman, a little, elderly, mousey person. A pay 
               telephone is on the side of the wall.

               Adams turns as Mrs. Jekes comes into the hall and stands 
               facing him.

                                     MRS. JEKES
                              (sarcastic)
                         You always come in so extremely quiet. 
                         I can hardly hear you, Mr. Adams. So 
                         thoughtful of my other tenants...

               The little ELDERLY LADY comes to the door and listens, a 
               smirk on her face.

                                     ADAMS
                         Well, I -- didn't want to disturb --

                                     MRS. JEKES
                         Of course not. A fine gentleman like 
                         you -- I waited to see you this 
                         afternoon. I thought you said you 
                         wanted to see me about something --

                                     ADAMS
                              (helplessly)
                         Well, I --

                                     MRS. JEKES
                         I hope you have no complaint to 
                         register. You're not dissatisfied 
                         with the service?

               The little Elderly Lady sniggers.

                                     ADAMS
                         No. I --

                              off more by the 
                              Elderly Lady)
                         That's good. Of course, there's not 
                         much heat in your radiator, I know -- 
                         and it does make noises at night. 
                         They don't keep you awake, do they?
                              (Mrs. Jekes is rewarded 
                              by another snigger 
                              from the Elderly 
                              Lady)
                         I wouldn't want that to happen.

                                     ADAMS
                              (he reaches into his 
                              pocket and reluctantly 
                              takes out a bill)
                         Look, would-would five dollars do 
                         for awhile?

               Mrs. Jekes reverts to type. She takes the bill.

                                     MRS. JEKES
                         It won't do -- but I'll take it.

                                     ADAMS
                         I'll try to have more for you soon.

                                     MRS. JEKES
                         You better see that you do.

                                     ADAMS
                              (holding up his 
                              portfolio)
                         I don't imagine you'd be interested 
                         in another one of my sketches until --
                         ?

                                     MRS. JEKES
                         Oh, no. The bathroom is full of them 
                         now. Where would I put another one? 
                         In my parlor?

                                     ADAMS
                              (defeated)
                         No -- I wouldn't expect you to do 
                         that. Well --
                              (Adams turns and starts 
                              up the stairs)

               36. THE TWO WOMEN

               as they start back into the living room. Mrs. Jekes 
               automatically puts her finger into the pay phone to see if 
               there is any loose change. There isn't. They go in.

                                     ELDERLY LADY
                         You certainly have a way, Mrs. Jekes. 
                         Play with him like a cat with a mouse -- 
                         and then pounce! But he is attractive, 
                         isn't he? And a gentleman besides.

                                     MRS. JEKES
                         That's what makes it hard to throw 
                         him out.

                                     ELDERLY LADY
                              (grandly)
                         He's an ornament to your house, Mrs. 
                         Jekes.

                                     MRS. JEKES
                         Just can't understand a man fiddlin' 
                         away his time just paintin' things -- 
                         though he did shovel some snow to 
                         pay part of last month's rent.

                                     ELDERLY LADY
                              (with a gleam in her 
                              eye)
                         Paintin' things! Women? You mean, 
                         women in the -- ?

               She leans over and whispers in Mrs. Jekes' ear. Mrs. Jekes 
               draws herself up.

                                     MRS. JEKES
                              (with dignity)
                         Mrs. Delaney! We agreed he was a 
                         gentleman! Gentlemen don't paint 
                         women in the --

               She leans over and whispers in Mrs. Delaney's ear.

                                     ELDERLY LADY
                              (crestfallen)
                         No -- no, of course not.

               37. UPSTAIRS HALL - NEAR ADAMS' ROOM

               Adams hurries toward his room.

               INT. ADAMS' STUDIO - NIGHT

               It's a big, high room with a dark, dusty ceiling. The studio 
               window overlooks a line of roofs and chimneys, and through 
               one narrow gap one catches a glimpse of the Hudson River. At 
               intervals, one can faintly hear the hooting of river boats.

               The room is in quite a state of disorder. A typical artist's 
               studio without maid service. In addition to the easel there 
               are palettes, tubes of color, sketches and crayons littered 
               on the work table and floor. There is a worn narrow couch, 
               one rather beautiful oak armchair, and a number of stools 
               and rickety furniture pieces as would be found in a cheaply 
               and carelessly put together place.

               Adams enters room, sees a man dressed in his hat and coat, 
               absorbed in looking at one of his pictures. He recognizes 
               him, and bursts out.

                                     ADAMS
                         Arne, you old tramp! When did you 
                         get back? What are you doing here?

                                     ARNE
                         Looking at your pictures. Terrible! 
                         Horrible! It is more horrible than 
                         when I was in town six months ago. I 
                         am depressed. I wish I hadn't stopped 
                         in to see you. I will be depressed 
                         for weeks. How are you, my friend!
                              (he holds out his

                         After that, I feel pretty good... 
                         It's nice to see you, Arne.

                         Here is my new stuff. Twenty pictures 
                         in a month.

                         Twenty pictures! Fast work, I'd say -- 
                         how did you do it?

                                     ARNE
                         With my thumb. No more brushes for 
                         me. I paint with my thumb. Yes, my 
                         friend, with my thumb.

                         Brushes? -- That's old stuff. That's 
                         passe, fini.

                         No brushes? You mean it seriously? 
                         That's something new. Last time you 
                         were here you told me...

                                     ARNE
                         What I told you yesterday, I don't 
                         remember today. The trouble with you 
                         is that you don't understand the 
                         first principles of art. Now, look 
                         here, what's this?
                              (pointing to a flower 
                              piece on the wall)

                         What do you mean, what's this? Can't 
                         you see?

                                     ARNE
                         No! Can you?

                         Of course. It is a flower.

                                     ARNE
                         A flower? Ha! If it's a flower, why 
                         doesn't it smell? Why doesn't it 
                         grow?

                                     ADAMS
                              (smilingly)
                         That's silly. It's a painting.

                                     ARNE
                         Exactly. A painting. Then why do you 
                         fool yourself calling it a flower... 
                         besides, if I want flowers, I get 
                         them at a flower shop; they cost 
                         less and smell better... here, I'll 
                         show you something.

                         Guess.

                         I can't make it out.

                         You guessed it.

                         I can't understand.

                                     ARNE
                         Naturally. This is called "Woman on 
                         the Dynamo." The Dynamo -- the symbol 
                         of the world we live in; the woman, 
                         the symbol of the thing we live for... 
                         on one side we have power, speed, 
                         machines... on the other side -- 
                         woman, love, the soul. I am in 
                         between, so it's bang on one side... 
                         bang on the other.

               Arne is looking as Adams examines the picture.

                         You don't like her!

                         Oh, I wouldn't say that. It's just 
                         that, well -- she doesn't exactly 
                         remind me of my mother.
                              (patting him on the 
                              shoulder)
                         Arne, you're as mad as you ever were.

                                     ARNE
                         Don't we live in a mad world? If you 
                         want to remain sane in a mad world, 
                         you are doubly mad... open your eyes. 
                         Look through the window. There is an 
                         airplane flying; before you take 
                         your shoes off, it will be in Europe. 
                         On the rooftops -- everywhere -- 
                         radio towers. Sneeze here, and in a 
                         split second they hear it in Ethiopia. 
                         In times like these, you are sitting 
                         here painting a flower... Soft... 
                         sweet... a child licking an ice cream 
                         cone...

                         Hmmm... Might not be a bad idea for 
                         a picture...

                         All right. But if you must paint an 
                         ice cream cone, paint it like a rocket 
                         to the moon! Paint the ball of ice 
                         cream as if you were licking a bomb 
                         with your lips. But who wants ice 
                         cream? If I want ice cream, I go to 
                         a soda fountain... say, do you have 
                         some bicarbonate of soda, by any 
                         chance?

                         There was some here. Oh, here it is. 
                         Maybe, this will make you see my 
                         pictures in a better light.

                              for a glass of water)
                         I hope you are not mad at me.

                         No, not at all. I guess you're right. 
                         I guess my stuff hasn't much feeling 
                         of the world today. As a matter of 
                         fact, I guess it hasn't much feeling 
                         at all. I know it, and so I've about 
                         made up my mind to quit and get a 
                         job.

                                     ARNE
                         A job!

                         Honestly, Arne. Don't you think that's 
                         what I should do?

               A moment's pause. Arne looks at Adams, seriously. We suddenly 
               realize Arne at the moment is not the buffoon that he seems 
               to be. We see that underneath he is sincere and honest. He 
               senses Adams' depression. He puts his hand on Adams' shoulder.

                                     ARNE
                              (simply and sincerely)
                         Adams -- I never thought you were a 
                         genius -- but one thing I have always 
                         admired about you. Your sincerity! 
                         Do not lose that sincerity, Adams! 
                         Be true to yourself! Sincerity is 
                         the most important thing of all!
                              (suddenly he flashes 
                              back into character)

                         There's nothing insincere about taking 
                         a job, is there?

                                     ARNE
                         It is the most insincere thing of 
                         all! You think a man can have a job 
                         and be sincere?

                                     ADAMS
                         I don't see why not.

                         Impossible! That is what the very 
                         word "job" means! You are doing one 
                         thing -- when you should be doing 
                         another! Can you name me one man who 
                         has a job who doesn't wish he was 
                         doing something else! Here is a clerk -- 
                         who wanted to be a doctor. A truck 
                         driver who wanted to be President. A 
                         President who wanted to be a 
                         haberdasher! Instead of being true 
                         to themselves -- they took jobs! 
                         Bowed down to life! Never make that 
                         compromise, Adams. Never, never take 
                         a job... Well, salute.
                              (raises his glass)

                         To the masses, of course. Art belongs 
                         to the masses.
                              (he reflects a second)
                         If they'd only buy my pictures, I'd 
                         salute them with champagne. And that 
                         brings me to the point of my present 
                         visit. Have you some filthy lucre on 
                         you, by any chance?

               He fishes in his pocket, peels off one bill, leaving himself 
               two other bills. Arne peers at the remaining bills.

                                     ARNE
                         Five dollars, hmmm? Is that the best 
                         you can do?

                         it more.

                              doing him a big favor)
                         Don't apologize. I'll take it. And 
                         do you know why I'll take it? It's 
                         because you have a soul -- the soul 
                         of an artist -- if only you could 
                         paint. Well, so long.

                                     ADAMS
                         Goodbye, Arne. Thanks for the visit.

               Adams remains standing looking after him a moment, 
               thoughtfully. Arne's quick appearance has done more to enhance 
               his loneliness. He closes the door quietly and stands looking 
               around the room. We feel that he is miserably alone. He picks 
               up the sketch of the dynamo and looks at it a moment, then 
               puts it down. He picks up one of his own sketches, looks at 
               it a moment, then puts it away from him, shaking his head 
               dismally. He crosses slowly to the window and stands looking 
               out. Leaning his head against the cool window pane, he stares 
               at the dark jagged line of roofs, outside and the river 
               beyond. We hear the mournful hooting of the tugboats on the 
               river. He listens to them. Slowly it seems as though there 
               were some pattern to the sound -- it seems as if for a moment, 
               a little of the sound of Jennie's theme song is heard. Adams 
               listens, a slightly puzzled expression on his face. He sits 
               down and picks up his concertina and begins to play idly. 
               Jennie's theme song creeps in this too. He plays for a moment, 
               then puts the concertina down and moves to his drawing board. 
               He sits before it, staring at the blank paper. Then slowly, 
               almost subconsciously, he picks up a crayon and starts to 
               make a sketch of Jennie. As we PAN TO A SHOT OF NEW YORK

               45. EXT. STREET NEAR ADAM'S HOUSE - NOON

               Adams, his portfolio under his arm, is walking down the 
               street. He has the paper of Jennie's that he picked up from 
               the bench in his pocket. He comes to a corner and, as he 
               hesitates a moment, we hear --

                                     VOICE
                         How'ya, Mack?

               Adams looks up and smiles and walks over to the garage. Near 
               the entrance stands Gus, a driver. He has his cap on, but 
               his sleeves are rolled up and he has a wrench or some kind 
               of repairing instrument in his hand. He is looking at Adams.

                                     ADAMS
                         Good morning, Gus.

                                     GUS
                         Mornin' is it? You've slept it all 
                         away, Mack... it's gone forever... 
                         An' a grand mornin' it was, too.

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes -- I worked late last night -- 
                         didn't get to sleep until about dawn.

                                     GUS
                         Had your breakfast?

                                     ADAMS
                         Why, no --

                                     GUS
                         Then how's about havin' some lunch 
                         with me?

                                     ADAMS
                         No, thanks. I'm not eating off you, 
                         Gus. You work too hard for your money.

                                     GUS
                         You gotta eat, Mack. That's a rule.

                                     ADAMS
                         Hey, wait a minute -- I've got some 
                         money of my own.
                              (He puts his hand 
                              into his pocket)

                         Sold a picture -- seven dollars and 
                         a half --

                                     GUS
                         What do you know!

                                     ADAMS
                         So today you're lunching on me.

                                     GUS
                              (warmly)
                         It'll be a real pleasure, Mack... 
                         Just come along a minute while I fix 
                         up the hack, and we'll be soon on 
                         our way.

               He starts walking into the garage, Adams at his side, towards 
               his cab. During the following they reach the cab which has 
               its hood up -- and maybe it's on some round platform or 
               instrument so the motor can be worked on:

                                     ADAMS
                         You know, Gus -- I don't get you at 
                         all.

                                     GUS
                              (pleased)
                         No kiddin'! -- Sure, there's nothin' 
                         very puzzlin' about me, Mack.

                                     ADAMS
                         There is to me. Why should you care 
                         if I eat or not?

                                     GUS
                              (after a moment)
                         Maybe I don't like to see people 
                         hungry.

               Gus gets under the engine and the following is played with 
               Adams leaning against the cab, his foot on the running board 
               or in any other fashion that the setting makes possible. 
               (NOTE: Gus' cab and the other cabs that are visible should 
               be, if possible, those of about 1930 and certainly not any 
               later than the early 1930s, avoiding the streamline models 
               of the 1940s)

                              engine)
                         Well, let me put it this way, Mack. 
                         Remember the day you staggered past 
                         where I was parked on Second Avenue?

                                     ADAMS
                              (quietly)
                         I remember.

                                     GUS
                              (tinkering; his face 
                              is not visible)
                         I thought you were just plastered. 
                         Then something about you made me 
                         say, "Timothy Agustin, that guy's 
                         not drunk. I bet he's hungry." And I 
                         saw that portfolio thing you're always 
                         carrying under your arm.
                              (he pauses. Adams 
                              looks down at his 
                              portfolio)
                         I had a kid brother in Ireland once. 
                         He never knew when it was time to 
                         eat, neither. He was always messin' 
                         around -- tryin' to write a poem -- 
                         or paint a picture -- or make 
                         somethin' out of little pieces of 
                         wood and stuff... He died one day.

                         That's tough, Gus.

                         you but your own stomach. Right?

                         I guess that's right, Gus.

               During the following Adams pulls the door closed as Gus gets 
               himself seated in the cab in his own seat.

                         a kind of faith. It makes you think

               to the neighborhood trade.

               Gus and Adams are seated at one of the tables, plates of 
               corned beef and cabbage before them and glasses of beer. 
               Other people at other tables. Gus and Adams have just started 
               eating.

                                     GUS
                         No, sir, don't think I've missed a 
                         day eatin' in here for over two years.

               Adams takes out the newspaper with Jennie's scarf that has 
               been in his pocket. It had been in his way and now he places 
               it on the table. As he does so, a couple of men pass the 
               table.

                                     MAN
                         How'ya, Gus. Hi, Gus.

                                     GUS
                         Howya, Mack. Howya, Mack.

               They pass on. Gus continues.

                                     GUS
                         It's sort of like home -- you couldn't 
                         pay me to eat anywhere's else --
                              (he reaches for the 
                              salt and knocks the 
                              paper over that Adams 
                              has placed on the 
                              table)
                         Oh, sorry, Mack.

                                     ADAMS
                         That's all right.

               They both reach to pick up the paper. The scarf falls out. 
               Adams picks it up as Gus retains the paper.

                                     GUS
                         Hey! Takin' to wearin' scarfs?

                                     ADAMS
                         Oh -- that isn't mine. I found it. 
                         It belongs to a little girl I met in 
                         the Park. Brought it along in case I 
                         ran into her.

                                     GUS
                              (with a dubious look)
                         Big scarf for a little girl.

               Adams has stuffed it into his pocket. Gus, in the meantime, 
               has glanced casually at the paper. They eat.

                                     GUS
                         Well, what do you know.

                                     ADAMS
                              (eating)
                         What?

                                     GUS
                         We almost humped into a comet -- or 
                         the comet almost bumped into us --

                                     ADAMS
                         Really? When was that?

                                     GUS

               Adams has stopped eating and is watching Gus, suddenly 
               frightened.

                                     ADAMS
                         What comet did you say?

                                     GUS
                         Halley's.

                              of the paper)
                         What do you know. This paper is 
                         nineteen ten.

               Adams reaches over and takes the paper from him.

                         What you lookin' at?

               Adams hands him the paper and points to the ad of 
               Hammerstein's Victoria.

               Gus starts reading the ad aloud.

               While he is reading Adams takes the scarf from his pocket 
               and turns it over in his hand. When Gus gets to the name 
               Appleton, Adams interrupts him.

               Adams turns to Gus, holding up the scarf.

                              then after a moment)
                         You mean they were acrobats at 
                         Hammerstein's. Hammerstein's was 
                         torn down years ago.

                         I know. But she said she was there -- 
                         yesterday.

                              (with a grin)
                         You know, that's what I like about 
                         kids. Always makin' up somethin' new -- 
                         livin' in a world all their own.

                                     ADAMS
                         She told me the father of one of her 
                         classmates is in Germany now. She 
                         said: "he sees the Kaiser all the 
                         time."

                                     GUS
                         Sounds like a nice kid. Bet she's 
                         Irish.

                                     ADAMS
                         No, she's not Irish.

               Gus looks up at him suddenly, curious. Something in Adams' 
               tone makes him wonder.

                                     GUS
                         Look! Mack! You're not tryin' to 
                         believe this kid, are you?

               After a moment, suddenly Adams grins.

                                     ADAMS
                         Of course not. What do you think?

                                     GUS
                         Okay.

               He continues to watch Adams a moment, curiously.

               48. MED. CLOSE SHOT - GUS AND ADAMS

               Gus is watching him.

                                     GUS
                              (quietly)
                         Go ahead an' eat your lunch, Mack.

                              (looking up)
                         What?

                         Put some linin' in your stomach...

                         eat?

                                     ADAMS
                              (smiling)
                         Oh, I see. You think I'm just 
                         imagining it all. Oh, no, she was 
                         real enough, Gus.

                                     GUS
                         I'm not arguin' with ye, but my mother 
                         always says: "If you don't have enough 
                         in your stomach, you get too much in 
                         your head."

                              (good-humored)
                         Okay. I'll eat my lunch.

               They eat a moment in silence. As Adams bends over his food, 
               we see Gus studying him thoughtfully. He shakes his head and 
               whistles softly between mouthfuls of corned beef and cabbage. 
               He looks around the room thoughtfully. He suddenly spots 
               some one.

               49. ANOTHER ANGLE

               Moore, the proprietor, waves and calls.

               He waves and calls back.

                                     GUS
                         Hi, Mack.

               51. MOORE

               He starts forward.

               52. GUS

               A quizzical expression comes to his face. He studies the 
               brown panelling of the room. He looks over at Adams, 
               thoughtfully. An idea seems to be forming in his mind. Moore 
               strolls up.

                                     GUS
                         How's things? Meet my friend Mack.

                                     MOORE
                              (to Adams)
                         How are you?

                                     ADAMS
                         Hello.

                              (to Adams)
                         Mack here's the owner of the joint.

               NOTE: The remainder of this scene should be shot in over 
               shoulder angles; across Gus to Moore; and across Moore to 
               Gus; together with individual shots of Gus, Moore and Adams. 
               Adams closeups should show him turning from Gus to Moore, 
               almost as though watching a tennis match.

                                     MOORE
                         Well, sometimes, I don't know if I'm 
                         the owner of the joint or if the 
                         joint's the owner of me. Business 
                         ain't too good these days. Mind if I 
                         sit down a minute?

                                     GUS
                         A pleasure.

                              (to Adams)
                         Everything all right, sir?

                                     ADAMS
                         Couldn't be better.

                                     MOORE
                         I'm glad to hear you say it. An' 
                         you, Gus, Everything all right?

                                     GUS
                         Why, sure -- I guess so, Mack --

                                     MOORE
                              (quickly sensing 
                              something)
                         What do you mean I guess so? Anything 
                         wrong?

                                     GUS
                         No -- no -- I guess not --

               They eat a moment in silence. Adams looks at Gus in surprise. 
               Moore regards him thoughtfully. Then:

                                     MOORE
                         The food is all right?

                                     GUS
                         Oh, sure, sure --

                                     MOORE
                         Then what's gripin' you?

                                     GUS
                              (hesitantly)
                         I kind of hate to say this, Mack... 
                         you're not a man I'd like to hurt... 
                         your feelin's, I mean... but --
                              (he dwindles to a 
                              pause)

                                     MOORE
                         Yeah?

                                     GUS
                         Well, if you don't see me around for 
                         awhile, don't be surprised. I've 
                         sort of been thinkin' I might start 
                         eatin' down at Nick's for a change.

                                     MOORE
                         Nick's?

                                     GUS
                         Yeah.

                                     MOORE
                         Nick's!

                                     GUS
                         What's the matter with Nick's?

               A pause. Moore shakes his head.

                                     MOORE
                              (slowly)
                         No-o-o... there's nothing the matter 
                         with Nick's... I suppose -- if you 
                         like that type of place --
                              (a slight pause)
                         So you're goin' to start eatin' down 
                         at Nick's.
                              (Pause. Moore turns 
                              to Adams; pleasantly)
                         It's a nice day, we're havin'.

                                     ADAMS
                         Beautiful day.

                                     MOORE
                         It's all that and more.
                              (he pauses and studies 
                              Gus who is eating 
                              diligently. Then:)
                         So you're goin' to start eatin' at 
                         Nicks, eh?

                                     GUS
                         Just thought I might for awhile.

                                     MOORE
                              (to Adams)
                         It takes all kinda people to make a 
                         world... all kinds... and some of 
                         them haven't a trace of friendship, 
                         or loyalty, or --
                              (he whirls on Gus)
                         You get as good a cornbeef and cabbage 
                         down at Nick's?

                                     GUS
                         You can't even get it there, Mack.

                                     MOORE
                         But the beer is better down there?

                                     GUS
                         Same beer.

                                     MOORE
                              (vehemently)
                         Then what in the name of all the 
                         saints are you goin' to eat down at 
                         Nick's for?

                                     GUS
                         Look, Mack, nothing personal. But a 
                         fellow likes a change once in awhile.

                                     MOORE
                         A change from what?

                                     GUS
                         Well, it's... er --
                              (looks around, and 
                              then with a shuddering 
                              gesture)
                         It's the joint... it's... it's the 
                         room... it's --
                              (quietly)
                         It's dark, Mack.

                                     MOORE
                         Dark?

                                     GUS
                         The woodwork... that dark woodwork --
                              (Motions at the 
                              panelling. Then, 
                              almost cheerfully)
                         Nick's got nice, bright tile down 
                         there.

                                     MOORE
                         Tile!

                                     GUS
                         Yeah. You should brighten it up... 
                         brighten up the joint, Mack. Everytime 
                         I polish that hack of mine, I do 
                         good business... People like things 
                         to look good.

               A pause. Adams and Gus eat. Moore regards Gus a minute, then 
               looks thoughtfully around the room. Then:

                                     MOORE
                         I'll be puttin' no tile in this 
                         restaurant and bar.

                                     GUS
                         No... no... I wouldn't want you to 
                         anything like that, Mack.

                                     MOORE
                         What would you want me to do?

                                     GUS
                              (at first he seems 
                              puzzled for a solution)
                         I don't know exactly... It's not an 
                         easy problem with all that dark 
                         wood... but the other day I was 
                         sittin' here, I got lookin' at that 
                         wall... an' all of a sudden I says 
                         to myself: "Timothy Augustin, wouldn't 
                         it be cheerful to be lookin' at some 
                         nice green trees, with maybe a sup 
                         of river runnin' between them... an' 
                         maybe a little Kerry cow or two, 
                         munchin' the grass... or maybe --

               Adams looks at him quickly, suspicious.

                                     GUS
                              (continuing)
                         -- a whole scene from Killarney 
                         itself... or may be, the Gap of Dunlow --

                                     MOORE
                              (interrupting)
                         Is it pictures, you mean?

                                     GUS
                         Well, I don't know, Mack. I hadn't 
                         thought that far.

                                     MOORE
                              (dubiously)
                         Suppose I could hang a stray picture 
                         here and there...

                                     GUS
                              (quickly)
                         Oh, they'd have to be the right kinda 
                         pictures... an', anyway, I don't 
                         think a few pictures would do it... 
                         It's a cryin' shame that you couldn't 
                         have a big scene painted right on 
                         the wall... but --
                              (he pauses)
                         Of course I know that can't be done.

                                     MOORE
                         Why can't it be done? Didn't ye ever 
                         hear of muriels?

                                     GUS
                         Muriels, huh?

                                     MOORE
                         They're painted right onto a wall.

                                     GUS
                         You don't tell me --
                              (he begins to get 
                              excited)
                         Ye know, Mack, I think you hit on 
                         the very thing yourself --
                              (he stops in 
                              astonishment)
                         What d'ye know about that?

                                     MOORE
                         Now what's bitin' ye?

                                     GUS
                         This guy --
                              (points to Adams)
                         He's an artist, Mack... one of the 
                         best in the world... He can tell us 
                         all about it.

                                     MOORE
                              (turning to Adams)
                         That so?

                                     GUS
                              (cutting in fast)
                         Is Mack right? Is it possible to 
                         paint a picture right on the wall?

                                     ADAMS
                              (playing up)
                         Of course it's possible... It's done 
                         often.

                                     MOORE
                              (to Gus)
                         See, ye dumb ox!

                                     ADAMS
                         As a matter of fact, that wall would 
                         lend itself to a mural very well.

                                     GUS
                              (suddenly, to Moore)
                         Look, what are we thinkin' of! Here 
                         we got one of the grandest artists 
                         in the world sittin' right at our 
                         table. Why don't we talk him into 
                         doin' somethin'?

                         You could squeeze it in, Mack?...

                         I'd have to think it over --

                                     MOORE
                              (butting in)
                         Wait a minute -- wait a minute -- 
                         This is goin' to cost money!

                                     GUS
                         An' what's money to an artist? If we 
                         can talk him into doin' this, it 
                         won't cost you a cent.
                              (to Adams)
                         You could drop in just now an' then 
                         in your spare time -- say around 
                         noon or suppertime -- you got to eat 
                         somewhere, haven't you, Mack?

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes, I suppose I have.

                                     GUS
                         Then that solves the whole problem... 
                         Come in here for your meals. . .an' 
                         take a few minutes out after each 
                         breakfast an' dinner an' supper... 
                         just a few minutes to paint after 
                         each meal --
                              (turns to Moore 
                              admiringly)
                         You're a smart man, Mack. Gettin' 
                         yourself a work of art for a few 
                         meals a day.

               A pause. Gus and Adams continue to eat industriously. Moore 
               looks from one to the other, speculatively. He smells a rat. 
               He looks down at the poster in his hand.

                                     MOORE
                         Excuse me a moment. I've got to post 
                         this.

               He gets up and slowly goes to the wall and tacks up the 
               poster.

                                     GUS

                              from his plate)
                         Lost him! Had him and I lost him!

                                     ADAMS
                              (uncomfortable)
                         Let it go, Gus. Don't say anything 
                         more.

                                     GUS
                         Had him and lost him! Smelled a rat!
                              (he looks up slyly 
                              and sees Moore is 
                              posting the poster. 
                              It is an announcement 
                              concerning St. 
                              Patrick's Day. Gus 
                              thinks shrewdly for 
                              a moment. Then he 
                              raises his head and 
                              his beer. He calls

                         Up the rebels!

                         Mack! Did ye ever see Mic Collins?

                                     MOORE
                         I never did an' I've always regretted 
                         it.

                                     GUS
                         He musta been the boyo!... A real 
                         Irish patriot!

                                     MOORE
                              (coming back to them)
                         He was all that, an' more.

                                     GUS
                              (firing his last 
                              broadside)
                         An' we sit chatterin' of trees an' 
                         rivers an' Kerry cows!... A fine 
                         collection of idiots we are!... Here's 
                         what you should do, Mack... Right 
                         over that service door there... a 
                         painting of Michael Collins... Mic 
                         Collins himself, an' he leadin' his 
                         men into battle against the might of 
                         England.

                         Now wait a minute, Gus --

                                     GUS
                         Man alive... it'd be the greatest 
                         thing to ever hit this town... Moore's 
                         Alhambra would be the rallyin' place 
                         for every Irish patriot to come to... 
                         Can't you see them gatherin' in droves 
                         to buy a beer an' get a good look at 
                         Mic Collins himself?... Why, you 
                         wouldn't have standin' room at the 
                         bar... An' all you have to do... an' 
                         you with the gift of the gab... is 
                         to talk Mack here into painting it 
                         for ye. An' it wouldn't cost ye a 
                         penny in cash.

                                     MOORE
                              (reflectively)
                         Well -- it does sound kinda 
                         interesting...

               Gus gets up. He moves around, acting out the scene.

               53. PAN SHOT

               CAMERA PANS with Gus as he gets up and walks toward the 
               service door. He plants himself in front of it, looking at 
               an imaginary painting above it.

                                     GUS
                         Here's how I see it:
                              (with a nod to Adams)
                         Or should I say how my friend Mack 
                         sees it?
                              (dramatically)
                         It's early dawn on a small hill in 
                         Ireland... Wisps of fog are floating 
                         over the ground, but the sun is 
                         already rising behind Loch Allen. 
                         And there...
                              (he points)
                         There on a carpet of Shamrock, under 
                         an old elm stands Mic Collins. He's 
                         leaning on his gun -- waitin' for 
                         zero hour. And all the Murphys and 
                         Flannagans and O'Sheas are waitin' 
                         with him.
                              (to Moore)
                         An' you know what they're waitin' 
                         for? They're waitin' for the day of 
                         liberation. They don't know it yet, 
                         but this is the day! In a brief 
                         moment, Mic himself will lead them 
                         into battle and will lead them to 
                         victory!
                              (he raises his glass)
                         Up the rebels!

               Adams and Moore have come up behind him. Moore's eyes are 
               shining as he raises his glass to the imaginary painting of 
               the Irish Patriot.

                                     MOORE
                              (Elatedly)
                         Up the rebels!
                              (he turns quickly to 
                              Adams)
                         You've got to paint it, Mr. Adams!

                                     GUS
                         You've got to do it, Mack!

               A second's pause as they wait for his decision. Adams looks 
               from one to the other, slowly rises and pounds his fist on 
               the table.

                                     ADAMS
                         I'll do it!

                                     GUS
                              (quickly seizes the 
                              victory)
                         Up the rebels!

                                     MOORE
                         Up the rebels!

                                     ADAMS
                         Up the rebels!

               CAMERA FALLS BACK to a picture of them all toasting and 
               quaffing, as we

               54. LONG SHOT - THE SKATERS ON THE POND IN CENTRAL PARK

               CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see Adams standing at a window 
               watching the scene, CAMERA shooting over his shoulder. As he 
               looks, we hear:

                                     MATHEWS' VOICE
                              (sadly)
                         Flowers! Flowers and landscapes!

                                     ADAMS
                              (annoyed)
                         See here, I asked you not to look 
                         through those. I just came in to 
                         give you the fifty cents change on 
                         the one you did buy.

               CAMERA DRAWS BACK TO SHOW INTERIOR MATHEWS GALLERY

               Mathews is standing looking through Adams' portfolio, Spinney 
               looking over his shoulder as he runs through the sketches.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         I know, I know, Mr. Adams...
                              (suddenly spotting 
                              something)
                         Here! What's this?

                                     ADAMS
                         What?

               He crosses to them and looks down at the sketch Mathews is 
               holding.

               JENNIE

                                     ADAMS
                         Oh, that's nothing. Just a sketch of 
                         a little girl I saw in the park.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Ah, but this is different! It's alive. 
                         It's very good, isn't it, Miss 
                         Spinney?

                                     SPINNEY
                              (studying the sketch)
                         Yes -- you seem to have something 
                         here, Adams.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Do you know why I like it?

                                     ADAMS
                         Why?

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Because there's a quality about that 
                         girl reminds me of long ago...
                              (reaching for his 
                              feeling)
                         It feels like when I was young.

                                     ADAMS
                              (slowly, thinking 
                              back)
                         She did have a look of not belonging -- 
                         not altogether belonging to today.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (happily)
                         That's it... It's more as if I've 
                         seen her before -- somewhere in the 
                         past. And yet I couldn't tell you 
                         where.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Yes -- there's something -- timeless 
                         about it --

                                     MATTHEWS
                         That's it. And there ought to be 
                         something timeless about a woman -- 
                         something eternal. You can see it in 
                         all great portraits of the past; 
                         they make you feel you could meet 
                         those women -- anywhere -- and be 
                         inspired by them.

                              Adams. He squares 
                              his shoulders, 
                              defiantly)
                         Well, then, Mr. Adams, I'll tell you 
                         what I'll do. I'll take that girl 
                         and I'll give you twenty-five dollars 
                         for it -- and I don't care what Miss 
                         Spinney says.

               He looks at Spinney defiantly. Spinney gives a faint smile.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (quietly)
                         In that case, I won't say anything. 
                         Now you don't have to feel quite so 
                         sorry for yourself any more, Adams.

               Mathews has been fishing for his wallet and brings out some 
               bills.

                                     ADAMS
                              (suddenly happy)
                         No. Things are looking up. I get 
                         three meals a day for doing a mural -- 
                         and now I sell a sketch for twenty-
                         five dollars!
                              (he turns to get his 
                              hat)
                         Well -- thanks.
                              (he picks up his hat 
                              and starts for the 
                              door)

                                     SPINNEY
                         Where are you going now?

                                     ADAMS
                              (gaily)
                         Oh -- nowhere -- anywhere --
                              (suddenly he remembers 
                              something)
                         Where I come from 
                         Nobody knows; 
                         And where I'm going 
                         Everything goes.

               Mathews looks at him as though he's mad, then looks at 
               Spinney.

                                     SPINNEY
                         What's that?

                                     ADAMS
                         Oh, something that little girl in 
                         the Park sang.
                              (gesturing toward the 
                              sketch)

                                     SPINNEY
                         Well, if you don't know whether you're 
                         coming or going, maybe you need a 
                         cup of coffee.

                                     ADAMS
                         Okay. Don't mind if I do.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Come along, then.

               They start to the office.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               56. SPINNEY'S OFFICE

               Adams is standing at the window, a cup of coffee in his hands, 
               looking out.

               57. LONG SHOT OF WHAT HE SEES

               The skaters on the pond in Central Park.

               58. ADAMS

               As he turns from the window and goes back into the room.

                                     ADAMS
                         You know, I haven't skated since I 
                         was a kid up in Maine.

               59. TWO SHOT - ADAMS AND MISS SPINNEY

               As Adams sinks into a chair near where she is sitting. There 
               is a comfortable, cozy feeling. A fire is burning in a little 
               fireplace.

                                     SPINNEY
                         You were brought up in Maine?

                                     ADAMS
                              (grinning)
                         South Paris, Maine. Pretty swanky, 
                         eh?

               Spinney smiles at him.

                                     ADAMS
                         Nice little town. Lakes and mountains 
                         and rivers -- My father ran the 
                         General Store until he died.

                                     SPINNEY
                         How old were you then?

                                     ADAMS
                         Oh, fifteen or so. My mother died a 
                         couple of years later. So I pulled 
                         out and worked my way through three 
                         years of college, and then --
                              (he pauses a moment 
                              and looks at her)
                         Fascinating, isn't it?

                                     SPINNEY
                         It's interesting.

               Suddenly Adams leans forward, serious.

                                     ADAMS
                         Look, Miss Spinney. I don't feel 
                         sorry for myself, the way you said. 
                         And I don't even think I'm 
                         particularly bitter. I know that 
                         every artist that ever lived -- if 
                         he was worth his salt -- went through 
                         a lot more than I have -- But they 
                         were great artists. They knew they 
                         had something. You can take a lot of 
                         beating if you're reasonably sure 
                         you've got something inside of you 
                         that makes it worthwhile. But I'm 
                         faced with a very practical problem. 
                         Have I got anything like that in me -- 
                         anything worth saying? There're 
                         thousands and thousands who haven't. 
                         Who do I think I am?

               A pause. Then --

                                     SPINNEY
                         Adams, you say that every great artist 
                         went through more than you. What do 
                         you mean by that? You mean they went 
                         through hunger, poverty, loneliness? 
                         Why, of course they did. But do you 
                         think that's all they suffered? You 
                         think they didn't also suffer -- 
                         doubt? Do you think they knew -- 
                         anymore than you do -- whether they 
                         had anything in them worth saying? 
                         Of course they didn't. You should 
                         know that. Certainly you can take 
                         any amount of punishment -- if you 
                         know you're going to win in the end. 
                         And of course it's the not knowing 
                         that's brutal. But don't think for a 
                         minute this doubt is unique with 
                         you. It's what every artist has faced 
                         since the beginning of time.

               A pause. Adams looks at her. Then, quietly:

                                     ADAMS
                         You're right, Spinney.

               Adams rises, goes slowly to the window. Spinney's eyes follow 
               him. There is a sad, nostalgic, almost misty light in them. 
               It is the first time he has called her "Spinney." She gets 
               up and stands behind him at the window.

                                     SPINNEY
                         It was a lot simpler when you were a 
                         kid in Maine, wasn't it?

               Adams smiles at her.

                                     ADAMS
                         And more fun, too... How's about you 
                         and me taking a whirl on the ice 
                         right now?

                                     SPINNEY
                         Oh, go on with you!

               Adams pats her lightly on the cheek twice and smiles, then 
               leaves. She turns and watches him go with deep affection.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               The late afternoon sun is shining on the big lake. Skaters, 
               singly and in pairs, glide by, circle, race. It is a picture 
               reminiscent of a "Currier and Ives."

               Adams looks around as he continues to skate forward.

               Adams looks around, still not sure, as he skates by CAMERA 
               and out of scene.

               As he skates away from CAMERA, Jennie's voice is again heard.

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                              (closer now; calling;

               As she skates closer to CAMERA, silhouetted against the sun, 
               waves and calls.

               As they meet and skate together, Jennie skating in a circle 
               around him.

                         I can't believe it's you.

                         Well, maybe you didn't see me so 
                         good before.

               They stop skating.

                         Of course I have. I'm hurrying. Don't 
                         you remember our wish?
                              (she takes his arm)
                         Let's skate.

               They continue to skate.

               (TO BE SHOT)

               As Adams gets up into the SHOT, he brushes off his coat, and 
               as he brushes off his pocket, he sees a corner of the scarf 
               sticking out of the pocket and suddenly remembers.

                                     ADAMS
                         Oh, by the way, Jennie. I have 
                         something of yours. Here --
                              (he takes the scarf 
                              from his pocket)

                                     JENNIE
                         What a pretty scarf!

                         It was in the parcel on the bench. 
                         You said it was yours.

               Adams is watching her intently.

                                     JENNIE
                              (puzzled)
                         Did I?...
                              (dismissing it)
                         Well, if I said so it must be true... 
                         I'll tell you what: Why don't you 
                         keep it for me till I grow up? Then 
                         I'll have one more reason to grow up 
                         fast.

                              curiously, smiles)

                                     JENNIE
                         I'm glad.

               With a wild sweep, Jennie whirls around excitedly.

                         I'm going to have my picture painted!

                         Emily's my best friend. She had her 
                         picture painted by Mr. Fromkes and I 
                         said you were going to do mine.

                         Well, I wished it, and then I closed 
                         my eyes and turned around three times.

               Jennie is seated on a bench at the edge of the ice pond, 
               waiting. Adams enters with two cups of hot chocolate, hands 
               her a cup, sits beside her. Throughout this scene Adams is 
               questioning himself and his whole attitude is almost like 
               that of a detective.

                                     JENNIE
                         Oh, how wonderful! Thank you!

               penetrating look.

                              some effort)

                         but of course that's silly. That's 
                         why they're so famous. They scare 
                         everybody.

               Jennie starts out on the ice. Adams stands watching her.

               77. JENNIE - (PROCESS) (TO BE SHOT)

               As she skates farther away.

               NOTE: This shot should be patterned after the technique of 
               her entrance and she should not exit through a crowd of 
               skaters.

               78. ADAMS - MED. SHOT - LOW ANGLE (SKY BACKING) (TO BE SHOT)

               As Adams stands there, watching, Spinney comes up behind 
               him. He doesn't notice.

               79. JENNIE - (PROCESS) (TO BE SHOT)

               (continuation of 77)

               Jennie disappearing.

               80. ADAMS AND SPINNEY (TO BE SHOT)

               (continuation of 78)

               Spinney looks at Adams for a moment, then off in the direction 
               he is looking.

               81. WHAT SHE SEES --

               (already shot)

               The pond is empty.

               82. SPINNEY AND ADAMS (TO BE SHOT)

               She looks back at Adams.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Looking for someone, Adams?

                                     ADAMS
                         I was just watching the little girl 
                         I told you about. I've been skating 
                         with her --

                                     SPINNEY
                         Oh!

               Spinney watches Adams who is looking off in awe and 
               puzzlement. As CAMERA MOVES IN a little, we hear Spinney's 
               voice, and on this we start a SLOW DISSOLVE:

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                              (as we heard it at 
                              the beginning of the 
                              picture)
                         No. I never saw Jennie.
                              (a slight pause)
                         -- I think I nearly saw her once... 
                         Didn't I, Eben?
                              (another slight pause)
                         You saw her, in any event. That much 
                         is sure. And there was a strange 
                         wonder in your face...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MOORE'S RESTAURANT - LONG SHOT. LOW CAMERA UP AT ADAMS; 
               LONG SHOT. HIGH ANGLE FROM ADAMS' VIEWPOINT DOWN AT SPINNEY; 
               INDIVIDUALS OF EACH; AND MASTER SHOT

               As Spinney's voice continues over the scene, we see Adams on 
               a ladder at work on his patriotic mural of Michael Collins. 
               He seems very gay at his work, painting easily and happily.

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         Something had happened to you, Eben. 
                         I don't think you were quite aware 
                         of it yourself. Your work on your 
                         mural was coming well - but it wasn't 
                         only that. There seemed to be a new 
                         Eben Adams. During those next few 
                         days you were gayer than I had ever 
                         seen you...

               As she is speaking, we see Adams turn, look down and wave 
               gaily.

               Spinney is seated at a table, a glass of beer before her. 
               Adams' coat and a rolled up sketch is on a chair beside her. 
               She is looking up at Adams and we see that her expression is 
               one of tenderness. We see her wave back to Adams.

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         I must confess, Eben, that you made 
                         me wish I were young again. That I 
                         could go along with you -- carefree -- 
                         happy -- sharing whole-heartedly 
                         your happiness...

               Adams makes an elaborate Bohemian gesture with his paint 
               brush and looks down at her. She looks up at him and laughs. 
               He comes down the ladder and joins her. He uses her glass, 
               pours himself a glass of beer and drinks.

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         But of course those days were long 
                         past and I could only feel a deep 
                         thankfulness that I could be with 
                         you even a little -- and watch you -- 
                         and laugh with you.

               While Adams talks to her, excited and eager, Spinney listens, 
               her eyes glued on him.

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         I'll never forget that Saturday as I 
                         watched you -- trying to see into 
                         you -- scarcely listening to what 
                         you were saying --

               Adams reaches over and picks up the rolled sketch of Jennie 
               and shows it to Spinney.

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         -- you showed me another sketch you 
                         had made of Jennie. And then you 
                         suddenly looked at your watch -- 
                         jumped up -- and said you had to go -- 
                         that you had an appointment. I half 
                         suspected that it was with Jennie.

               During the above we have seen Adams look at his watch, jump 
               up, and apologize as he gets into his coat. Now we see him 
               lean over and kiss Spinney on the cheek, then turn and leave. 
               Spinney looks after him a moment - then slowly we see her 
               hand rise and caress her cheek. She looks down at the new 
               sketch of Jennie.

               ANGLE OVER HER SHOULDER

               As we see the sketch and hear her voice over it.

                                     SPINNEY'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         Oh, Eben -- how long, long ago it 
                         seems...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CENTRAL PARK - THE BENCH IN THE PARK WHERE ADAMS AND JENNIE 
               FIRST MET -

               We see Adams waiting impatiently. He is looking all around. 
               He looks at a cheap nickel-plated watch, shakes his head 
               anxiously, and begins to walk up and down. He comes back to 
               the bench. Again he looks at his watch, looks all around, 
               and then decides to start off.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               POND WHERE PEOPLE ARE SKATING -

               There are very few people on the ice. He watches them 
               anxiously. Jennie is not there. He starts off.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CORNER BROADWAY AND 42ND STREET -

               With all its people and traffic. CAMERA PANS DOWN and we 
               see: RIALTO THEATRE -- and then we see Adams walk into the 
               crowd -- pause -- and look at the theatre. CAMERA GOES TO 
               CLOSE SHOT OF NAME: RIALTO THEATRE.

               ADAMS -

               as he looks at it, then turns and looks at other buildings 
               nearby. He sees a policeman standing on the curb. He hesitates 
               a moment -- and then goes up to him. He stands by him a 
               moment, reluctant to speak. The policeman turns and looks at 
               him.

                                     ADAMS
                              (hesitantly)
                         Nice day.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         It is that.

                                     ADAMS
                         I was just -- well -- I had a bet 
                         with a friend of mine. I wonder if 
                         you could help me. You remember the 
                         old Hammerstein Theatre?

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Do I remember it? Bud, you came to 
                         the right party to ask about 
                         Hammerstein's.

                                     ADAMS
                         Well, I claimed it used to be right 
                         down around here somewhere. My friend --

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Your friend loses. Hammerstein's 
                         used to stand right there where the 
                         Rialto is now.

                                     ADAMS
                         That's what I thought.
                              (he hesitates)

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Yes, sir, many's the time I went to 
                         Hammerstein's.

                                     ADAMS
                         You're -- you're sure it's not here 
                         now anywhere?

               The cop turns slowly and looks at him. Adams becomes 
               embarassed.

                                     ADAMS
                         I mean -- that is -- well, I thought 
                         maybe --

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Look, Bud, you look like a nice guy. 
                         Better go home and sleep it off.

                                     ADAMS
                         I just -- wanted to be sure.

                                     POLICEMAN
                         All right -- you're sure now. Go on 
                         home.

                                     ADAMS
                         Yeah -- Thanks.
                              (He starts to go, 
                              then hesitates)
                         Let me ask you one more question. 
                         You say you used to go there. Do you 
                         remember the Appletons?

                                     POLICEMAN
                         Appletons?

                                     ADAMS
                         They used to have an act -- trapeze --

                                     POLICEMAN
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Seems to me -- Look, you go over and 
                         ask old Pete. He used to be doorman 
                         at Hammerstein's. Now he works at 
                         the Rialto. He knows more about 
                         Hammerstein's than anybody.

                                     ADAMS
                              (brightening)
                         Thanks a lot.
                              (he goes)

               89. CLOSEUP - POLICEMAN

               He looks after Adams, not convinced he is all right.

               90. FRONT OF RIALTO THEATRE

               -- as Adams approaches. He looks around. People are entering 
               the theatre. He sees an attendant, but he is young and 
               handsome. Adams shakes his head -- looks around again -- 
               then goes up to the young attendant.

                                     ADAMS
                              (agreeably)
                         I was told the doorman here was an 
                         old fellow -- name of Pete -- Don't 
                         suppose that could be you?

                                     YOUNG ATTENDANT
                              (nastily)
                         You don't suppose so, eh? Wise guy!

                                     ADAMS
                         Well -- is there an old fellow here 
                         named Pete?

                                     YOUNG ATTENDANT
                              (jerking his head)
                         In there.

                                     ADAMS
                         Thanks.

               Adams starts toward the lobby.

               90A. LOBBY - MASTER SHOT AND INDIVIDUALS

               Pete is in uniform. He is in his late seventies, amiable, 
               pathetically dapper in a threadbare way, his once handsome 
               face now a ruin, his eyes watery and vacant. He just stands 
               at one side as the people pass in -- occasionally saying: 
               "Better seats to the left, please." He has obviously just 
               been "kept on."

                                     PETE
                         Better seats to the left, please.

               He nods and smiles at people as they pass in.

                                     AN USHER
                         Say, pop -- it's time for your cup 
                         of coffee...

                                     PETE
                         Already?

                         Excuse me -- are you Pete?

               Pete has started down through lobby.

                                     PETE
                              (ambling by)

                         I'm looking --

               He watches Pete leave the lobby.

                                     USHER
                         Friend of Pete's?

                         get here in the morning and go home -- 
                         wherever that is. But they tell me 
                         he was quite a guy in his day, when...

                         Thanks...

               He exits quickly in pursuit of Pete.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               90B. INT. COFFEE SHOP

               Pete is sitting in a little booth, his manner meticulous, 
               almost elegant, his empty eyes beaming faintly, his head 
               nodding to invisible admirers. A waitress brings Pete's 
               coffee.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Got it all ready for you, pop. Why 
                         don't you have a hamburger? Put some 
                         meat on those bones.

                                     PETE
                         Oh, no -- thank you, miss -- always 
                         kept my figure -- slim -- straight 
                         as an arrow --

               Adams comes into the SHOT. The waitress mops the table.

                                     ADAMS
                              (casually)
                         Mind if I sit down?

                                     PETE
                         Mind? It's a pleasure... please do...

                              (to waitress as he 
                              sits down opposite 
                              Pete)
                         Coffee -- black, please.

               He watches Pete pour the cream and sugar in a precise and 
               memory-evoking ceremony.

                                     ADAMS
                              (calmly, trying not 
                              to show his great 
                              anxiety)
                         Pete --

               Pete looks up, a slight furrow on his brow.

                                     ADAMS
                         I think you can help me. You used to

                              thumb)
                         -- didn't you? -- When it was 
                         Hammerstein's...

                                     PETE

                         Hammerstein's -- the old theatre --

                         Oh... oh, yes...

               He smiles, a slight streak of memory illuminating his face. 
               The waitress brings Adams' coffee.

                                     ADAMS
                         Thank you. Pete --

                              look through Adams 
                              into the past)

                         I tried to keep out of trouble --

                         long time... started to drink... got 
                         to liking it after awhile, but -- no 
                         taste for it now at all... don't you 
                         like your coffee, sir?

                              (feeling a little 
                              badly for Adams)
                         No... I don't remember... I'm sorry...

                                     ADAMS
                              (defeated, softly)
                         I'm sorry, Pete... I didn't mean 
                         to...

               He sips his coffee, looking at Pete with a hopeless smile. 
               Pete gets over the feeling of being a little harassed, and 
               his mind wanders off again.

                                     PETE
                         I used to talk to Clara about it -- 
                         after Helen left me... everybody did 
                         when they were in trouble... she 
                         knew everybody... knew everybody's 
                         troubles...

               During the last several words, Adams' hopes have been reborn.

                                     ADAMS
                         Clara? Clara who, Pete? Where is she 
                         now?

                                     PETE
                         Wise woman, Clara... They're wise -- 
                         colored people... they know what 
                         trouble is...

                                     ADAMS
                              (almost wildly, forcing 
                              Pete to be attentive)
                         Yes, Pete, yes! But tell me, please... 
                         where can I find Clara? What's her 
                         last name?

               But Pete doesn't hear him and Adams' attempts are hopeless. 
               Pete's mind is still on his own tragedy.

                                     PETE
                         You're all alone when your wife leaves 
                         you...

               Then, as though to illustrate this point, slowly, like an 
               automaton, Pete takes out his wallet, and removes a card 
               which he hands to Adams. During this Adams makes one final 
               attempt.

                                     ADAMS
                              (pleadingly)
                         Listen to me... where's Clara?

               Adams has taken the card during this last. He looks down at 
               it.

               90C. AN ANGLE OVER ADAMS' SHOULDER

               CAMERA MOVES DOWN to an insert of the card, which is rather 
               worn, but on which has been written in an old trembling hand:

               "MY NAME IS PETER BRADFORD. IN CASE OF DEATH OR INJURY, PLEASE 
               NOTIFY CLARA B. MORGAN, 1346 SIXTH AVENUE."

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               91. SMALL ROOM ON SIXTH AVENUE (BACK ROOM NOT FACING ON 
               SIXTH AVE.) CLOSE SHOT - CLARA MORGAN - DAY

               She is a very handsome colored woman, quite old. Her face is 
               powerful and yet sensitive and intelligent. Her grey hair 
               lends an ageless dignity to her face.

                                     CLARA
                         Of course, I remember the Appletons. 
                         Frank and Mary Appleton. I remember 
                         all of the old acts as if it were 
                         yesterday.

               As she speaks, CAMERA DRAWS BACK TO reveal a simply but 
               scrupulously clean, neat room. Through the window can be 
               seen falling snow. Adams is sitting in a chair, listening 
               intently.

                                     CLARA
                              (continuing)
                         Eva Tanguay, Will Rogers, Weber and 
                         Fields, the Appletons -- You know, I 
                         think I have a picture of them 
                         somewhere. Would you like to see it?

                                     ADAMS
                         Oh, yes -- very much, Mrs. Morgan.

               Clara rises and goes to an old trunk in the other side of 
               the room. Adams follows her as she digs into the trunk and 
               takes out some old photographs. She looks through them as 
               she talks.

                                     CLARA
                              (as she looks)
                         They were all wonderful acts. For me 
                         they had more glamor than anything 
                         you see today. You sort of felt as 
                         if you knew all the artists 
                         personally. Ah, here it is.

               She has found an old photograph which she takes out. Adams 
               leans forward eagerly.

               92. INSERT - PHOTOGRAPH

               It is covered with dust. As Clara rubs it off we see appear 
               a man and a woman posing stiffly against a "photographer's 
               column." In front, between them, stands Jennie, dressed as 
               we have seen her last, in her skating costume. Over the SHOT 
               we hear --

                                     CLARA'S VOICE
                         Yes, these are the Appletons. Frank 
                         and Mary Appleton.

                                     ADAMS' VOICE
                         And -- the little girl?

                         But this -- this picture must have 
                         been taken many years ago.

                         Yes -- many years ago.

                         It couldn't be that this -- this 
                         child is their granddaughter?

                                     CLARA
                              (almost with a little 
                              laugh)
                         Oh, no. I knew Jennie when this 
                         picture was taken. A darling little 
                         girl -- with big, sad eyes. She used 
                         to come back stage and sit on my 
                         lap. I used to give her rock candy. 
                         She was crazy about rock candy.

                                     ADAMS
                         Do you know where she is now?

                                     CLARA
                         No. I lost track of her after her 
                         parents were killed that night on 
                         the trapeze. That was many years 
                         ago. Jack Boles came to the dressing 
                         room and told me: 'The Appletons had 
                         an accident,' he said. 'The wire 
                         broke. They're both dead.'... Jennie 
                         was in the theatre -- looking -- 
                         when it happened.

               Pause. Slowly Adams hands the photograph back to her.

                                     ADAMS
                         And you're sure you don't know what 
                         happened to her?

                                     CLARA
                              (thoughtfully)
                         Well -- it seems to me I do remember 
                         there was some talk of her aunt's 
                         wanting to put her into a convent. 
                         Jennie wasn't a Catholic -- but her 
                         aunt said a convent was the best 
                         place for a girl to be.

                                     ADAMS
                              (after a moment)
                         Well, thank you very much, Mrs. 
                         Morgan. I appreciate your giving me 
                         the time.

                              (with a smile)
                         Thank you, Mr. Adams. It isn't very 
                         often I have a chance to share my 
                         memories... I hope you find Jennie. 
                         She was a dear little girl.

                                     ADAMS
                         I hope I do, too. Thank you. Goodbye, 
                         Mrs. Morgan.

                         Goodbye, Mr. Adams.

               As he goes, Clara looks once more at the photograph and starts 
               to put it back into the old trunk, as we --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               94. CENTRAL PARK - LOW CAMERA - NIGHT

               Adams walks along, looking from right to left anxiously. A 
               wind has risen. Mingled with the SOUND of the wind, we hear 
               the haunting melody of Jennie's theme song. Suddenly we hear 
               a weird sound that could or could not be the sound of the 
               trees. Adams stops and looks.

               95. CLOSE SHOT - SWAYING TREES

               96. ADAMS - CAMERA DOLLYING WITH HIM

               He listens a moment, then moves on. There is a feverish 
               anxiety in his eyes. He slows down his walk, his instinct 
               making him believe that somehow Jennie is near. Suddenly he 
               stops abruptly as he looks down and ahead of him. We see 
               there is movement of shadows. We PULL BACK THE CAMERA (or 
               otherwise move the CAMERA) to reveal it is merely the shadow 
               of the trees.

               97. ADAMS

               As he sees what has caused the shadow. He starts again, 
               looking around. Faintly, but we can't be sure, there seems 
               to be the sound of sobbing mingled with the wind and the 
               MUSIC. He stops, and the sobbing stops. Adams calls softly:

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie... Jennie...
                              (looking around)

               There's no answer. He takes another step or two, and the 
               sobbing becomes more distinct.

               98. CLOSEUP - ADAMS

               He is sure now, looks for the source of the sobbing and 
               follows it -- the CAMERA with him -- to the bench.

               99. CLOSE SHOT - ADAMS - SHOOTING DOWN THE DARK PATH TO THE 
               BENCH WHERE THEY FIRST MET

               -- and on which sits the figure of a little girl. It is from 
               her the sobs are coming -- long, broken sobs that shake her 
               body. Adams hurries to her.

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie --

               He sits beside her, takes her hands. She turns to him and we 
               see that it is Jennie, helpless and heartbroken, unable to 
               control her sobs. She is in a different hair-do than when we 
               last saw her, and is about fourteen or fifteen.

                                     ADAMS
                         What's the matter, dear? What are 
                         you crying about?

                                     JENNIE
                              (sobbing)
                         Father and Mother --

               He looks, absorbs it for a second.

                                     ADAMS
                              (almost afraid to 
                              have it confirmed)
                         Something -- happened to them? They 
                         had -- an accident?

                                     JENNIE
                              (scarcely hearing 
                              him, her words 
                              overlapping his)
                         I knew it would happen --

                                     ADAMS
                         The wire -- broke?

                                     JENNIE
                         I knew it would happen -- I was always 
                         scared it would happen -- and 
                         tonight...

                                     ADAMS
                              (almost to himself)
                         Tonight!

               He can scarcely credit his ears. He has only just heard that 
               it was many years ago and here is proof that from Jennie's 
               standpoint it was tonight. But he pulls himself out of it, 
               for this child is clearly grief-stricken right now and brushes 
               off the mystery to comfort her.

                                     ADAMS
                         I know how you feel, Jennie -- I 
                         know how much it hurts -- But it 
                         isn't hurting them. Try to think of 
                         it that way.

               Jennie's sobs have been gradually subsiding during his last 
               speech. They have now stopped and she looks up at him, dazed 
               and almost incredulous.

                                     JENNIE
                         But they're -- dead --

                         I loved them...

                              almost appealing for 
                              understanding)
                         They loved me...

                         Then you mustn't be too unhappy, 
                         Jennie. They wouldn't want you to 
                         be, would they?

               A pause. She looks at him, trying to understand. He adds, 
               gently --

                                     ADAMS
                         Would they?

                              over it)
                         No... They told me once --

               Pause.

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes?

                              as she remembers, 
                              slowly, her parents' 
                              cautionary advice)
                         They said -- if anything happened to 
                         them -- I mustn't be unhappy -- 
                         because they were doing -- what they 
                         wanted to do -- and if they --
                              (she stops)
                         -- if anything happened -- it would 
                         happen to them both -- at the same 
                         time -- the way they wanted --

                         Yes -- I shouldn't cry, should I? 
                         They wouldn't like it. They died the 
                         way they wanted. So I guess I'm only 
                         crying for myself -- because they're 
                         gone -- and because I'm lonely --

                              hearing; her mood

                              to belief and

                         Of course I want to go. Then I'll be 
                         grown up. Don't you understand?

               Adams looks at her, understanding nothing.

                                     ADAMS
                              (kindly)

                         I don't understand. I don't understand 
                         any of it. It's all so strange. Each 
                         time I see you, you've changed -- 
                         you're older... You talk about things 
                         that happened -- well, that happened 
                         long ago.

               of what she hears from one side to the other then up. After 
               a moment we see that she has discovered the source and she

                         The cold settled into people's bones

               With buds on them, and beyond a very blue sky. The CAMERA 
               SLOWLY PANS across the trees and starts to SLOWLY PAN DOWN --

                         -- the trees were covered with little 
                         yellow green leaves -- and the sky 
                         was a different blue -- and the clouds 
                         were a different white. And a robin 
                         sang. But you didn't awaken to the 
                         warmth of spring, Eben. You became 
                         restless, despondent -- almost 
                         melancholy. What was it, Eben? I was 
                         worried about you. All of your new-
                         found eagerness toward life was gone. 
                         You wouldn't work -- you seemed 
                         lifeless. What were you searching 
                         for? I couldn't understand. The actual 
                         truth never occurred to me. How could 
                         it have? I wept for you, Eben.

               The CAMERA HAS PANNED DOWN FROM THE TREES TO SHOW THE TAVERN 
               ON THE GREEN, and we see Adams and Spinney seated at a table.

                         can't be a little brighter for you.

                         Jennie is? There are other people -- 
                         other things to paint.

                         the last one to say that a painter 
                         mustn't have some -- some inspiration -- 
                         but that's not the same thing as 
                         mooning about -- not even trying.

                         and see what happens. You'd be 
                         surprised how many ideas have come 
                         to people that way. You're not giving

               as Adams trudges in. He doesn't try to be quiet as before -- 
               he is too preoccupied. Sitting in the little room just off 
               the hall, is Mrs. Jekes and her friend. As Adams comes in he 
               stops a moment at the door. Mrs. Jekes rises.

                                     ADAMS
                         Has anyone been here to see me, Mrs. 
                         Jekes?

                                     MRS. JEKES
                              (turning to the little 
                              elderly woman)
                         Just a moment, Mr. Adams. I'll ask 
                         my social secretary. Has anyone been 
                         here to see Mr. Adams, Mrs. Delaney?

               Mrs. Delaney sniggers with delight and shakes her head.

                                     MRS. JEKES
                              (to Adams)
                         Mrs. Delaney says she doesn't know. 
                         And I'm sure I wouldn't know either, 
                         Mr. Adams.

                                     ADAMS
                         No. That's right. How would you know?

               He turns and starts up the stairs, the women looking after 
               him.

                                     MRS. DELANEY
                              (giggling)
                         Oh, you are a card, Mrs. Jekes.

                                     MRS. JEKES
                         Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.

                                     MRS. DELANEY
                         What?

                                     MRS. JEKES
                         Having a gentleman in the house. So 
                         far he's cost me sixty dollars.

               Automatically she puts her fingers into the pay telephone. 
               She draws back in happy surprise, looking at the nickel in 
               her hand.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               115. ADAMS' STUDIO

               as he enters. He stands surveying the room forlornly. He 
               walks over and looks out of the window. He turns and takes 
               up a number of sketches and looks at them -- sketches of 
               Jennie. He throws them down. He goes to a table and stares 
               down at a half-eaten can of beans with a spoon in it. He 
               takes a spoonful -- looks at it -- and puts it down. He goes 
               to his drafting board on which there is a paper. He starts 
               to sketch -- a bridge -- then stops. Suddenly he has an idea. 
               He looks around and gets a large canvas and starts to prepare 
               it, -- stretching it, mounting it, wetting it, and setting 
               it out to dry. As he is doing so, there is a knock on the 
               door. He looks up eagerly.

                                     ADAMS
                         Come in.

               Gus enters. Adams is disappointed. He turns back to his work.

                                     ADAMS
                         Oh, hello, Gus.

                                     GUS
                         Howya, Mack? Watcha doing?

                                     ADAMS
                              (irritably)
                         What do you think I'm doing?

                                     GUS
                         I dunno.

                                     ADAMS
                         I'm preparing a canvas for a portrait.

                                     GUS
                         What do you know! So that's the way 
                         you do it!

                                     ADAMS
                         That's the way you do it.

               There is a pause. Gus is uncomfortable. Then --

                                     GUS
                         Speaking of painting --

                                     ADAMS
                         I know, I know. Moore is sore because 
                         I haven't finished that mural.

                                     GUS
                         After all -- he made a deal --

                                     ADAMS
                         -- and I let him down.

                                     GUS
                              (with a smile)
                         Well, Mic Collins is beginnin' to 
                         look a little sore, too, Mack -- 
                         leanin' there on his gun -- waitin' 
                         to lead his men into battle -- and 
                         havin' only half a leg to stand on --

                                     ADAMS
                              (irritably)
                         Okay -- okay -- I get it.

               A pause. Gus looks at him a moment, then turns and begins to 
               wander around the room, looking at the various sketches, 
               etc. Then he begins to sing his lilting Irish song. He 
               finishes, looks at Adams once more, and then starts to the 
               door.

                                     GUS
                         Well, see you later, Mack.

               He starts to go out. Adams straightens up.

                         Gus.
                              (Gus stops and turns)
                         I'm sorry. Guess I'm in a rotten 
                         mood these days. Tell Moore I'll be 
                         over, will you? I'll finish it 
                         somehow.

                                     GUS
                         Sure.

                                     ADAMS
                              (smiling suddenly)
                         Thanks. And, Gus -- I don't want to 
                         seem ungrateful...

                                     GUS
                         Why, that's all right, Mack. There's 
                         times a big black cloud comes down 
                         over all of us. Be seein' you.

               He goes out whistling, as we

               116. INT. MOORE'S RESTAURANT - EVENING

               Adams is at work putting the last finishing touches to his 
               mural of Michael Collins. Several people are seated at the 
               tables drinking beer: regular patrons and people who have 
               heard about it and come to watch. There are also several 
               people at the bar. There are several Irish cops in various 
               places, watching. There is a general hubbub as the scene 
               opens.

               117. CLOSE SHOT BAR - MOORE AND GUS

                                     MOORE
                              (delighted)
                         You were right, Gus. It's a grand 
                         paintin!!! A grand paintin!!! Just 
                         look at all the people buyin' beer.

                                     GUS
                         That's what I told you, Mack. You 
                         got patriotism, art and beer all at 
                         the same time.

               118. CLOSE SHOT - ARNE - AT A TABLE NEAR THE BAR

               He has his elbow on his knee, chin in hand, and is watching 
               the painting, critically. We hear Moore's voice.

                                     MOORE'S VOICE
                              (happily)
                         Yes -- a beautiful paintin'... isn't 
                         it now?

               Arne turns and gives him a slow, disgusted look, then turns 
               back to his former position, watching the painting.

               119. FULL SHOT - ROOM

               The crowd is muttering happily, guzzling happily. Suddenly 
               Adams throws down his brush.

                                     ADAMS
                         Well, there it is! Finished!

               All look at the painting in silence, then look from one to 
               another, wordlessly.

               120. GUS

               Glancing around expectantly. He looks at Moore.

               121. MOORE

               Worried by the silence.

               122. ADAMS

               Looking disgusted and somewhat uncomfortable.

               123. GUS

               He thinks a moment, gets an idea, then starts to applaud.

               124. MED. LONG SHOT

               As the on-lookers join in the applause enthusiastically. 
               During the applause we hear:

                                     AD LIBS
                         Mic Collins! The spittin' image of 
                         him! Michael Collins would be a proud 
                         man this moment! Erin go bragh! Any 
                         Irishman that doesn't come to see 
                         this is no friend of mine!

               125. MOORE

               Beaming.

               126. GUS

               As the applause subsides, Gus looks again, gets an idea and 
               starts to sing "The Soldiers' Song."

               127. ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE CROWD (or PULL BACK CAMERA)

               As the crowd takes it up with a roar, not as a trained chorus, 
               but joining in one by one.

               128. ADAMS

               Embarrassed by this demonstration.

               129. FULL SHOT

               NOTE: Shoot the song so that we can end it at the end of the 
               refrain or at the end of the chorus.

               As the song ends, there is more applause. Adams makes his 
               way through the crowd to Moore and Arne. Gus joins them.

               130. MEDIUM SHOT - THE GROUP

                                     ADAMS
                         Well, I hope you're satisfied, Mr. 
                         Moore.

                                     MOORE
                         Satisfied! It's a mighty proud man I 
                         am to have the picture there, Mr. 
                         Adams. Now I've been thinkin' -- on 
                         the wall over there we might have a 
                         scene of the Mighty Emmet -- in his 
                         green and white uniform -- with the 
                         English fleein' in terror over the 
                         hills --

                                     GUS
                              (looking at Adams)
                         Hey, wait a minute, Mack. Mack's in 
                         no mood to talk about more paintin'...
                              (turning to Adams)
                         It's a swell job.

                                     MOORE
                         A grand job.

                                     ADAMS
                         I'm glad you like it.
                              (he turns to Arne)
                         What do you think of it, Arne?

                                     ARNE
                         It stinks.

                                     GUS
                              (a little belligerently)
                         Yeah? That the way you feel about 
                         it?

                                     ADAMS
                              (with a wry smile)
                         I think it stinks too.

               He moves out of scene. They look after him as he exits from 
               the cafe. There's a moment's silence.

                                     GUS
                         You know something? Your picture 
                         don't stink.

                                     ARNE
                              (holding it up, pleased)
                         You like it?

                                     GUS
                         Swell. I think it's swell.

                                     ARNE
                              (with ample gesture)
                         My friend, it's yours!

                                     GUS
                         You mean you're giving it to me, 
                         just like that?

                                     ARNE
                         Just like that. For nothing.

                                     GUS
                              (raising his voice)
                         Bring the gentleman a beer, Mack.
                              (to ARNE)
                         I don't take nothing for nothing.

               Mack serves a glass of beer to ARNE, which he raises to his 
               lips in salute to Gus, the man of the people who appreciates 
               his art.

                                     GUS
                         Is it mine now?

                                     ARNE
                         My friend, it's yours!

               Gus takes the picture and starts deliberately to tear it 
               into pieces. Arne, in a rage of insulted pride, starts for 
               him, murder in his eye. Gus is ready.

                                     MOORE
                         Gentlemen, gentlemen -- whatever can 
                         ye be thinkin' of? Why --
                              (indicating painting)
                         -- it's insultin' to Mic Collins...

               Gus is torn between patriotism and going after Arne. The 
               patriot wins, and as he turns back to his beer, we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               NO SCENES 131-134

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               135. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

               Adams, all alone, walks along past the recognizable park 
               bench -- pauses a moment -- then walks on.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               136. THE WATERFRONT - THE SKY IS LIGHTER

               We see the lonely figure of Adams walking along, looking out 
               at the boats, solitary, mournful.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               137. HALL IN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAWN

               As Adams enters, whipped, tired and about at the end. He 
               starts up the stairs.

               138. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ADAMS' DOOR

               Door is ajar. He approaches hopefully but fearful, reaches 
               out his hand for the knob. He opens the door, steps in, and 
               suddenly stops in his tracks, frozen, staring.

               139. ADAMS' STUDIO - SHOOTING OVER HIS BACK - DOWN AT THE 
               FLOOR

               Adams' sketches are spread out on the floor, and we see a 
               girl's hands.

               140. CLOSEUP - ADAMS

               Incredulous, he takes a step forward.

               141. MED. CLOSE SHOT - JENNIE

               On all fours -- or seated on the floor -- as she slowly raises 
               her head to him. She is very beautiful in her convent dress. 
               Her beauty is that of a girl of seventeen. As she looks up 
               at Adams her eyes are aglow. Over this we hear:

                                     ADAMS' VOICE
                         Jennie!...

                                     JENNIE
                              (eagerly)
                         Yes --

               PULL CAMERA BACK as Adams rushes forward to her. Jennie rises 
               and rushes to him eagerly.

                                     ADAMS
                         It's not true! It isn't you!

               He takes her hands in his.

                                     JENNIE
                         Oh, yes, yes, yes it is... see!
                              (she turns her face 
                              up to his)
                         I tried to get here sooner but I 
                         couldn't.

                                     ADAMS
                         Here -- let me look at you.

               He holds her hands out wide, looking at her. Jennie smiles.

                                     ADAMS
                              (astonished)
                         Why, you're beautiful.

                                     JENNIE
                         Am I?

                                     ADAMS
                         You've grown.

                                     JENNIE
                         Of course. I'm nearly a young lady 
                         now. I'm hurrying. I'm in my first 
                         year of college at the convent.

                                     ADAMS
                         Oh, that's wonderful, Jennie.

               He has still been holding her hands. He holds her from him 
               and looks her over from head to toe. Then, admiringly:

                                     ADAMS
                         That dress...

                                     JENNIE
                              (girlishly pleased)
                         Do you like it? It's our Sunday dress.

                                     ADAMS
                         It's enchanting.

                                     JENNIE
                              (coming closer to 
                              him, suddenly eager 
                              and impulsive)
                         Oh, I've thought of you so much. It 
                         could --
                              (reaching for the 
                              right expression)
                         -- it could fill an eternity.

                                     ADAMS
                              (with a smile)
                         What have you thought?

                                     JENNIE
                         About how wonderful it all is -- 
                         about how I've searched and searched, 
                         and now --

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes, Jennie?

                                     JENNIE
                         How we'll be together always. I'm 
                         almost sure...
                              (then, childlike)
                         You know what Emily wants to know?

                                     ADAMS
                         What?

                                     JENNIE
                         Whether you're going to marry me.

               He laughs.

                                     JENNIE
                              (pouting, a bit wounded)
                         Please don't laugh at me... Eben.
                              (it's the first time 
                              she's used his name, 
                              and she uses it 
                              tentatively)
                         I know I'm not old enough yet, but I 
                         will be soon...
                              (her eyes spot 
                              something)
                         What's that?

               Adams, who has been swept away by her mercurial moods, is 
               amused and puzzled.

                                     ADAMS
                         What?

                                     JENNIE
                         That sketch.

                                     ADAMS
                              (looking at the sketch)
                         That's Radio City.

                                     JENNIE
                              (dubiously)
                         Radio City?... I never heard of it.

                                     ADAMS
                              (realizing)
                         Oh -- well -- it's new, I guess... 
                         hasn't been built long.

                                     JENNIE
                              (vaguely)
                         Oh...

               Her eyes fall on another sketch. She shudders and mutters a 
               startled and frightened "Oh!"

                                     ADAMS
                              (concerned)
                         What is it, Jennie?

                              to a horrible thing 
                              that she knows)
                         That's -- Land's End Light!

                              (puzzled)
                         Yes... Land's End Light...

               143. ADAMS AND JENNIE

               He is watching her with a penetrating look.

                                     ADAMS
                         I sketched it several years ago. 
                         It's a deserted lighthouse -- up on 
                         Cape Cod.

                                     JENNIE
                         It makes me -- unhappy --

                                     ADAMS
                              (still watching her)
                         Have you ever been there?

                                     JENNIE
                              (vaguely)
                         Perhaps -- I don't know...

               She dismisses this unpleasant subject from her mind and looks 
               in the direction of the window, turns, and walks to the 
               window.

                                     JENNIE
                         Look -- it's getting lighter. I'm 
                         afraid I must leave soon.

                              (frantic)
                         No -- no, Jennie. You can't -- now 
                         that I've found you --

                                     JENNIE
                              (gently)
                         I'll be here again, Eben.

                         But that's not right. I've waited 
                         and waited -- You can't go now --
                              (He notices the canvas 
                              that he has prepared)
                         Look, Jennie -- The canvas -- I have 
                         it all prepared --

                              canvas as Adams goes 
                              on excitedly)
                         I was sure you'd be here some day. 
                         The portrait of you, Jennie -- the

                         I've not been able to do anything 
                         else. Will you stay?

                              smile)
                         I'll try to stay for a little while...

                                     ADAMS
                         Sit there, Jennie. There where I've 
                         dreamed you would sit...

                                     JENNIE
                         The girls will be so jealous when I 
                         tell them.

               Jennie, as she is getting into position, chatters away, while 
               Adams hastily goes about the business of preparing the paints 
               and getting ready for the portrait.

                                     JENNIE
                         You know, some of my friends are 
                         taking the veil next Sunday. It will 
                         be lovely to watch. Will you come 
                         and see it with me?

               144. CLOSEUP - JENNIE IN CHAIR

               She is sitting with her head turned.

                                     ADAMS' VOICE
                         I'd love to... Turn your head a little 
                         more to the left, Jennie.

               She does so.

                                     JENNIE
                              (with sudden sadness)
                         A few of my classmates will be 
                         leaving. I hate to have them go. 
                         I'll miss them.

                                     ADAMS' VOICE
                         Drop your arms into your lap.

               She does so. As the directions come and Jennie moves obeying 
               them, we see her finally form into the position we have seen 
               in the final portrait early in the picture. SLOWLY THE CAMERA 
               STARTS TO DRAW BACK and, as Jennie finally assumes the correct 
               position, we see Adams -- the bare canvas in front of him -- 
               crayon in hand raised to make the first stroke.

                                     ADAMS
                              (tensely)
                         That's it -- that's right, Jennie -- 
                         Hold that --

               The crayon comes down in the first stroke for the portrait, 
               as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               145. THE BRUSH - NIGHT

               We see the brush working frantically on the canvas. CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK and we see Adams, alone, painting the dress of 
               the portrait rapidly. Jennie's face is practically complete. 
               Outside the rain beats against the window. CAMERA MOVES IN 
               again to the brush, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               NO SCENES 146-152

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               153. LONG SHOT - EXT. CONVENT - ENTRANCE - DAY - (SPRING)

               (already shot)

               Out of the door tumbles a large group of young girls, dressed 
               very much in the same manner as Jennie was dressed when we 
               saw her last.

               A nun tries to bring order in this tumult of voices and 
               giggling. We cannot understand her commands, but we can see 
               her waving her arms furiously and the girls lining up two 
               abreast. At a final command, they start marching in double 
               file down the hill. The nun walks at the end of the line. 
               CAMERA DRAWS BACK TO:

               154. MED. SHOT - ADAMS

               (already shot)

               He is at the side of the path, waiting for the girls to 
               approach, watching them.

               155. MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               (already shot)

               of the girls approaching, with Adams in the foreground. We 
               can soon see their young, wide-eyed faces closely.

               156. CLOSE SHOT OF GIRLS

               (already shot)

               passing by. They are marching silently, looking straight 
               ahead while Adams stands at the side of the path, searching 
               among their faces for Jennie. She is not there. The girls go 
               on.

               157. MEDIUM LONG SHOT

               (already shot)

               Adams is gazing after the girls walking away. A slight puzzled 
               frown comes to his face. He turns and walks away.

               158. LONG SHOT - CONVENT SHOOTING PAST ADAMS

               He walks toward the entrance.

               159. MED. SHOT - A CORRIDOR

               (already shot)

               as Adams enters and looks around, tentatively. He has become 
               more worried as he looks around. Then, suddenly, we hear:

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                              (reverberated -- from 
                              a distance)
                         Hello!

               He looks around quickly.

               160. CLOSE SHOT - ADAMS

               (already shot)

               As he looks around. Again we hear:

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                         (reverberated -- closer) Hello!

               161. CLOSE TWO SHOT - ADAMS AND JENNIE

               (already shot)

               Jennie is dressed in her white convent dress. She looks 
               radiant and more beautiful than ever, a little more grown 
               up.

                                     ADAMS
                              (with a sigh of relief)
                         Jennie! I was afraid -- afraid you 
                         might not be here.

                                     JENNIE
                         Why, I told you I'd be here.

                                     ADAMS
                         I know but -- but I had the feeling -- 
                         something might have happened --

                                     JENNIE
                              (interrupting)
                         Hush!
                              (She listens intently)

               The sound of singing and organ music can be heard.

                                     JENNIE
                              (continuing)
                         Do you hear that?
                              (She takes his hand)
                         We'd better hurry if we want to see 
                         it.

               162. LONG SHOT

               (already shot)

               Jennie and Adams walk through the vaulted passage toward the 
               convent gardens. The premises are completely deserted -- all 
               the sisters are assembled inside the chapel for the 
               consecration ceremony.

               A chorus of voices, singing the TE DEUM can now be heard 
               more clearly.

               163. FULL SHOT - EXT. CONVENT GARDENS - DAY - (SUMMER)

               (already shot)

               Jennie and Adams hurriedly cross the gardens in the direction 
               of the chapel. The music grows louder, the words of the TE 
               DEUM more distinct.

               164. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE OF CHAPEL

               (already shot)

               Carefully, Jennie opens the door, pushes Adams inside and 
               follows him.

               165. FULL SHOT - INT. CHAPEL - DAY - (SUMMER)

               (already shot)

               Bathed in a sea of candles around the altar, we see a group 
               of novices dressed in white veils, waiting for the 
               consecration.

               The Sisters of the Order are standing in their pews, singing 
               the TE DEUM. The guests and parents are seated on one side 
               of the chapel.

               166. CLOSE SHOT - ADAMS AND JENNIE

                              (whispering)
                         Isn't it beautiful? I always feel a 
                         little closer to the truth of things 
                         in here. As if pretty soon I would 
                         understand -- See -- those are the 
                         ones who are taking the veil.

               of Adams and Jennie.

                                     JENNIE
                              (whispering)
                         Our teachers are all in the first 
                         row. There's old Sister Mary

               of front row of benches. As Jennie speaks CAMERA PANS slowly 
               along the faces of the Sisters.

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         She teaches history. And Sister Mary 
                         Euphemia who teaches science and 
                         next to her is my favorite, Sister 
                         Mary of Mercy.

               HOLD ON the face of Sister Mary of Mercy.

               170. CLOSE SHOT - ADAMS AND JENNIE

               (already shot)

               Jennie looks up at Adams. Their eyes meet.

                                     JENNIE
                              (slowly)
                         I'm glad you're waiting for me, Eben.

               As they look at each other, the priest begins the intonation 
               of The Lord's Prayer:

                                     PRAYER
                         Our Father Which Art in Heaven 
                         Hallowed Be Thy Name Thy Kingdom 
                         Come Thy Will Be Done On Earth As It 
                         is In Heaven Give us This Day Our 
                         Daily Bread And Forgive Us Our 
                         Transgressions As We Forgive Our 
                         Transgressors And Lead Us Not Into 
                         Temptation But Deliver Us From Evil 
                         For Thine Is The Kingdom And The 
                         Power, And the Glory Forever.
                         Amen.

               Congregation responds during the above.

               171. TWO SHOT - ADAMS AND JENNIE

               (already shot)

               Adams and Jennie kneel and join the congregation in the 
               response.

               (NOTE: This has been checked with Father Finnley and will be 
               supervised by him. There should be an alternate dissolve 
               eliminating the prayer for England, where the censors will 
               eliminate the prayer.)

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               171A. A LITTLE BROOK - SHOOTING DOWN ON THE RIPPLING BROOK 
               THROUGH THE TREES

               CAMERA drifts along the brook - accompanied by musical 
               underscoring -- until we reach Adams under a tree, playing 
               his mouth organ. CAMERA CONTINUES and we see Jennie wading, 
               barefoot, in the water.

                                     JENNIE
                         Your music sounds just like the brook, 
                         Eben --
                              (he plays on)
                         Ripple -- ripple -- ripple --

               Suddenly, in the brook, she starts to do a little dance to 
               the music. Adams watches her, stops a moment.

                                     ADAMS
                         And your dance is like the music.

               He continues to play and she continues to improvise in her 
               little dance.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BEYOND; ALSO INDIVIDUALS

               After a moment:

                                     JENNIE
                         I'm just beginning to realize how 
                         beautiful the world is, Eben. How 
                         spring comes year after year -- for 
                         us -- and for everyone the whole 
                         world over. The sun goes down in the 
                         same lovely sky -- just as it did 
                         yesterday -- and will tomorrow.

                                     ADAMS
                         Tomorrow? When is tomorrow?

                                     JENNIE
                         Does it matter? It's always. This 
                         was tomorrow -- once.

                                     ADAMS
                         Where I come from, Nobody knows, And 
                         where I'm going --

               Jennie looks up, surprised.

                                     JENNIE
                         I've heard that somewhere.

                                     ADAMS
                         Of course! You sang it to me that 
                         first day in the park.

                                     JENNIE
                         Oh, did I? I had forgotten.

                                     ADAMS
                         The wind blows, The sea flows,
                              (he shrugs)
                         And God knows.

                                     JENNIE
                         I think He knows, Eben.

               A slight pause.

                                     ADAMS
                         I hate the day to end.

                                     JENNIE
                         It'll be here again tomorrow.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BACK TO INTERIOR

               The room is empty for a moment, and then the door opens and 
               Spinney, Mathews and Adams come in. Adams is in a rather 
               excited mood.

                                     ADAMS
                         Just put your things down anywhere. 
                         Here, Spinney, I'll take that --

                              (looking around)
                         So this is where the master works --

                                     ADAMS
                         Not much of a place is it? -- Now, 
                         look -- you know it isn't finished!

                                     SPINNEY
                         Don't be coy. Let's see it.

                                     ADAMS
                              (boyish)
                         All right, then -- sit down, Spinney --
                              (he goes to the easel 
                              that holds the 
                              portrait. He is 
                              nervous)
                         Of course, there're still a great 
                         many things I want to do with it --
                              (He takes a deep breath)
                         Here we go.

               He makes a decision and turns the canvas to them -- uncovers 
               the portrait. There it is!

               (NOTE: Dramatic revelation with CAMERA)

               Pause. Mathews walks slowly up to it and looks at it. There 
               is a longer pause. Adams watches him anxiously.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Well -- Well --

               Pause. Spinney rises and goes over to it.

                                     ADAMS
                              (to Mathews, nervously)
                         What do you think?

                                     MATTHEWS
                         H'mm -- h'mm --

               He studies it more closely. Spinney looks at it. A pause. 
               Adams looks at her. After a moment --

                                     SPINNEY
                              (in a strangely gentle 
                              voice)
                         Well, Adams, that's it all right.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (clearing his throat)
                         Yes -- yes, that's it.

                                     SPINNEY
                         You found what you were looking for.

                                     ADAMS
                         Of course it isn't finished --

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (softly)
                         No -- it doesn't really matter -- 
                         does it --?

                                     ADAMS
                         You like it then?

               A pause. Adams looks at Mathews, we see Mathews is very 
               touched

                                     MATTHEWS
                         You see, Adams, in the fifty years 
                         I've been selling paintings -- well 
                         in my business it's always a dream 
                         that someday you will come across -- 
                         shall we say -- a great picture. 
                         This is -- I feel now a sort of 
                         fulfillment of my -- well -- of my --
                              (he stops, unable to 
                              go on)

                                     SPINNEY
                         He means he likes it, Adams.

               Adams gives a deep sigh.

                                     ADAMS
                              (simply)
                         I'm glad.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         You remember my saying that there 
                         ought to be something eternal about 
                         a woman -- something that is not of 
                         the present, nor of the past? Well, 
                         here you have caught it -- It is the 
                         face of that same little girl -- and 
                         yet what you have seen in that face 
                         is without age -- or time.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (with a small smile)
                         Of course it isn't finished yet --

                                     ADAMS
                              (turning to her 
                              nervously)
                         No, it isn't --

                                     SPINNEY
                         Take it easy, Adams. It's a great 
                         picture.

               She smiles. Adams smiles back. A door slams. They turn around 
               and see Arne.

                                     ARNE
                         Excuse me for bursting in like this, 
                         but I know how glad you always are 
                         to see me.

                                     ADAMS
                              (approaching him)
                         That's all right, Arne. Come in. You 
                         know Miss Spinney, Mr. Mathews.
                              (to Mathews and Spinney)
                         My friend, Arne, has a new technique -- 
                         paints only with his thumbs.

               Mathews and Spinney look at each other.

                                     ARNE
                         Thumbs! That's old stuff. It's passe -- 
                         fini. And that brings me to the point 
                         of my visit: I'm turning to brushes 
                         again. Could you spare me -- say, 
                         half a dozen brushes, by any chance?

                                     ADAMS
                         Of course.
                              (as he goes to pick 
                              up a bunch of brushes 
                              and wraps them in 
                              paper)
                         I have lots of them.

                                     ARNE
                         My friend, you have a good heart, a 
                         noble soul, lots of brushes, but --
                              (with a gesture)
                         -- no talent.
                              (he sighs)
                         If I roll up my sleeves and out of 
                         sheer gratitude give you a couple of 
                         lessons in painting --
                              (he picks up a sketch 
                              or looks at one on 
                              the wall)
                         No, it wouldn't help.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (puts her hand on 
                              Arne's shoulder)
                         Look behind you and see what you 
                         think of that.

               Arne looks at her a moment, puzzled. Then turns, which brings 
               him face to face with the painting.

                                     ARNE
                         What's this?

                                     SPINNEY
                         Just a painting.

               A pause. Arne stares at it, not believing his eyes. Slowly 
               he approaches it as though hypnotized. He looks at it 
               carefully, then slowly looks up at Adams.

                                     ARNE
                         It's a masterpiece.
                              (quietly, sincerely)
                         I can't believe it... But yes, it's 
                         a masterpiece.
                              (he looks again at 
                              the picture, wipes a 
                              sudden, cold 
                              perspiration from 
                              behind his collar, 
                              rubs his forehead in 
                              painful agony; quietly)
                         Say, have you an aspirin, by any 
                         chance?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               173. LONG SHOT - EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT - SUMMER

               Adams is walking slowly along. He seems very happy and 
               content. As he walks we hear him humming Jennie's theme song. 
               The Park is deserted. The arc lamps are throwing bizarre 
               shadows across the road. He stops for a moment to look out 
               over the lake -- then slowly goes on.

               174. MED. SHOT

               as he continues his quiet walk, still humming. He approaches 
               the CAMERA. Suddenly he stops and looks and then hurries 
               forward.

               PAN WITH HIM toward the bench -- and gradually, as Adams 
               gets closer, we see -- out of the shadows -- rising - the 
               figure of a girl, Jennie. She is simply but beautifully 
               dressed in a travelling outfit. She is the most grown up we 
               have seen her. Her hair is up and we realize she is no longer 
               anything of a child. Adams stops a few feet away from her.

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie!

                                     JENNIE
                         Eben...
                              (they throw their 
                              arms around each 
                              other)
                         Somehow I knew I'd find you here.

                                     ADAMS
                         I've looked for you here so often.

                                     JENNIE
                         I had to see you -- tonight. You 
                         know I've just graduated from college 
                         and --

                                     ADAMS
                              (excitedly, breaking 
                              in)
                         Wonderful! Then -- we can be together 
                         always.

                                     JENNIE
                         I'm afraid we'll have to wait a little 
                         while longer. You see, my aunt is 
                         ill and wants me to go away with her 
                         for the summer.

                                     ADAMS
                              (disappointed)
                         Oh -- When do you have to leave?

                                     JENNIE
                         Tomorrow... I couldn't go without 
                         saying goodbye.

                                     ADAMS
                         Goodbye?

                                     JENNIE
                         It will only be for a few months. 
                         Anyway, we have until the morning -- 
                         and -- I think a little more.

               A little pause. They look at each other.

                                     ADAMS
                         I'll be lost without you.

                                     JENNIE
                         No, no -- Don't say that, Eben! We 
                         can't both of us be lost.

               Slowly he goes to her.

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie --

                                     JENNIE
                         Yes, Eben?

               She waits. He takes her hands.

                                     ADAMS
                         I love you.

                                     JENNIE
                         Do you? Do you really?

                                     ADAMS
                         I've always loved you. I always will 
                         love you -- always and forever...

               They kiss.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               175. EMBANKMENT AT THE EDGE OF THE HUDSON RIVER - NIGHT

               We see the broad expanse of the Hudson, the moon playing on 
               it here and there. Across, on the opposite side, the banks 
               of New Jersey.

               JENNIE AND ADAMS sit on the bank, looking out over the river.

                                     JENNIE
                         Look at the moonlight on the water. 
                         It makes a pathway across the river...
                              (then with a sigh)
                         The Jersey hills are over there, 
                         aren't they?

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes, in the distance.

                                     JENNIE
                         You say it sadly. Aren't you happy, 
                         Eben?

                                     ADAMS
                              (after a moment)
                         I've just been thinking... No matter 
                         how far away that kind of distance 
                         is, it can always be reached. Over 
                         there -- beyond the hills -- one can 
                         drive to it -- or north, among the 
                         pines -- or eastward to the sea. 
                         That is the only kind of distance I 
                         ever knew before. But now --
                              (he hesitates)

                         Now I feel there is another kind of 
                         distance. A crueler distance. The 
                         distance of yesterday and tomorrow. 
                         And I am frightened that there's no

                         I'll try, Eben.

               He looks at her, studying her eyes a moment, trying to have 
               faith, and trying to read in her eyes something that will 
               make him believe what reason tells him can't be true. He 
               takes her in his arms and buries his head on her shoulder.

               Jennie is seated as we have seen her before. Adams is painting 
               rapidly. There is a pause as the work goes on. Then --

                         Do you think sometimes people can 
                         know what lies ahead? I mean -- what's 
                         going to happen to them?

                         No, Jennie.

                                     JENNIE
                         I'm not so sure. You know how you 
                         feel sad about things sometimes -- 
                         things that haven't even happened. 
                         Perhaps they're things that are going 
                         to happen. Perhaps we know it, and 
                         are just afraid to admit it to 
                         ourselves.

               A pause. Adams is so busy painting he doesn't answer. Suddenly 
               Jennie's eyes start to close. We see she is sleepy.

                                     JENNIE
                              (drowsily)
                         I guess that's silly. I guess I have 
                         a funny mind.

               No answer. Adams paints on. Jennie's eyes close again. Her 
               head droops. She is asleep. After a moment Adams steps back 
               and looks at the painting.

               rushes to her and shakes her.

               Pause. Slowly, Jennie looks at him with a feeling almost of 
               reverence. Then she rises. Together they go and stand in

                              shudder)

               She puts her hand in Adams'; it is trembling a little. Adams 
               pats it, looks at her sympathetically.

               She has been very thoughtful during this.

                              uncertainly)
                         Don't let's talk about it any more.
                              (she walks away from 
                              him)
                         Tell me about --

                              landscape of Paris)

                         it together. It would be such fun!

               She sits and looks out the window. Adams crosses to her, 
               eagerly.

                         Oh, Eben -- I feel as though we were 
                         already there... as though we'd been 
                         spending our whole lives together...

               Adams takes her in his arms and kisses her.

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie, what is it that makes a man

                         they belong to each other?

               Jennie looks up at him adoringly, touches his lips with her 
               fingers. He kisses them, continues speaking, while Jennie 
               thoughtfully absorbs his words and considers them.

                         you, my darling.

               She cups his face in her hands.

                         hurrying to grow up.

               She presses her lips to his. He puts his arms around her and 
               holds her close. Suddenly there is a gust of wind, not too 
               great, behind them. The papers blow. Jennie rises.

                                     JENNIE

                         but I'm sure it will be for always.

               Adams has been looking at her hungrily, but with fear and 
               doubt. There is another gust of wind, this time much stronger 
               than the first. Jennie releases herself gently, speaks 
               casually.

                                     JENNIE
                         I'll get my things, Eben.

               She walks to the bedroom. Adams turns, closes the window, 
               looks out moodily as Jennie exits. The CAMERA MOVES UP TO A 
               WAIST FIGURE OF ADAMS.

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                         Oh, Eben. What a lovely scarf!

               183A. INT. BEDROOM - JENNIE

               RETAKE Jennie is slipping into her coat. She has the scarf 
               in one hand. We see clearly the door leading to the hall in 
               the b.g.

                                     ADAMS' VOICE
                         It's yours, Jennie.

                              (delighted)
                         A present? For me?

               But her excitement has faded somewhat, and as the CAMERA 
               MOVES UP ON HER we see a curious and rather half-frightened 
               sense of recognition.

               183B. INSERT - SCARF IN HER HAND

               RETAKE It is the same scarf that we have seen in the earlier 
               sequences.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK as Jennie, scarf in hand, walks a few steps 
               and looks at Adams. There is an expression of infinite 
               tenderness and love on her face.

               183C. LONG SHOT - ADAMS

               RETAKE He is staring moodily out the window; he does not see 
               Jennie looking at him.

                         I've been saving it for you.

               He turns, walks toward CAMERA (and Jennie) INTO WAIST FIGURE, 
               stops short as he looks. His face falls as he peers around 
               the room, realizes she is gone.

               183D. INT. BEDROOM

               RETAKE It is empty. The door to the hall is open.

               RETAKE Adams starts forward, realizes the futility, lowers 
               his head, advances slowly back towards the window, stops. As 
               he does, the rain starts to come down, and on the tableau of 
               Adams standing with his back to us, the rain behind him over

               184. THE PARK

               (already shot)

               It is Fall. The leaves have turned and there is the sombre 
               sadness of autumn in the air.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               185. GUS' LIVING ROOM IN A SMALL COLDWATER FLAT - FALL

               (already shot)

               A typically masculine room, sparsely but neatly furnished, 
               comfortable and homey. A Franklin stove, set in the fireplace, 
               burning coal, gives out a soft glow.

               Adams stands staring out of the window moodily. Everything 
               is quiet for a moment. Then Gus comes in, from an adjoining 
               room, presumably the kitchen, carrying two cups of coffee. 
               He sets one down and then walks over and sets the other one 
               beside Adams.

                                     GUS
                         Here y'are, Mack. Just as ordered.

               Adams looks around, absently. He smiles.

                         Oh -- thanks, Gus --

               He turns back to look out of the window. Gus gives him a 
               quick look and then, in silence, walks back and sits and 
               takes up his coffee. A moment's pause. He sips.

                                     GUS
                         Beautiful coffee.

                         coffee maker that I am, has saved me 
                         a lot of misery. Everytime a girl 
                         gets to pluckin' on my heart strings 
                         a little too loud -- I come home and 
                         make a cup of coffee -- and as I sip 
                         it I sez to myself, "Timothy Augustin, 
                         me bould bucko, what are you thinkin' 
                         of? When you can make coffee the way 
                         you do, what would you be needin' 
                         with a wife?"

                              no reaction. He 
                              decides to make 
                              another attempt)
                         Yes, Mack -- many's the time this 
                         coffee has saved me, an' right --

               Adams stares at Gus refusing to accept the thought. Another 
               idea strikes him and a slow smile breaks on his face.

                                     ADAMS

               They look into each other's eyes. Adams turns abruptly and 
               strides to the window. Gus hums a few bars of his song. Then:

                         keepin' in touch.

                         She was very fond of some of the 
                         Sisters.

                         Sure -- anyway, you'd be doin' 
                         something -- not just sittin' around.

                              (suddenly excited)
                         Okay, Gus -- it's a chance! Will you 
                         drive me out? I can pay you for it 
                         later.

                              (hurt)
                         It's a great pity you know nothin' 
                         about friendship...

                         Come on!

               The thought of action transforms Adams. He smiles.

                                     ADAMS
                         Gus, don't you wish you were as tough 
                         as you pretend to be?

               They start to make preparations for leaving, as we

               186. LONG SHOT - EXT. ST. MARY'S CONVENT - DAY - FALL

               It is the same scene that we have seen before, when Adams 
               went to see Jennie at the graduation exercises, and, as 
               before, we see a large group of young girls, dressed in 
               convent dresses, and a nun getting them into line.

               187. MED. SHOT - ADAMS

               He has entered and stands, as before, watching the scene. It 
               is as though it were happening for the first time. A slight 
               puzzled frown comes to his face.

               188. MED. LONG SHOT

               Of the girls approaching, with Adams in the foreground.

               189. CLOSE SHOT OF GIRLS

               passing by, while Adams stands at the side of the path, 
               searching their faces. He knows Jennie is not among them. 
               And yet --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               190. FULL SHOT - INT. CONVENT OUTER OFFICE - DAY

               A small, oblong, whitewashed room used as the outer office 
               of the Mother Superior. It is furnished with a couple of 
               dark, wooden benches, a desk and chair.

               At one end of the room Adams, his hands folded behind his 
               back, is looking out of a narrow, recessed window into the 
               sunny countryside.

               At the other end of the room, a door opens and a young Sister 
               enters.

                                     SISTER
                         Our Mother Superior will see you 
                         now.

                                     ADAMS
                         Thank you.

               PAN WITH ADAMS as he crosses and exits through the door held 
               open by the young SISTER.

               191. FULL SHOT - EXT. CONVENT FLOWER GARDEN

               The Mother Superior is watering the flowers. Adams enters 
               and goes up to her. She looks up.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Good afternoon. Mr. Adams?

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes --

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Be with you in one minute, Mr. Adams.
                              (pouring the water on 
                              the flowers)
                         Flowers are pretty well gone this 
                         time of year -- but I'm giving them 
                         a last chance. There!
                              (she pours the last 
                              of the water from 
                              the can on to the 
                              flowers, sets the 
                              can down, and looks 
                              up)
                         That ends it.
                              (she smiles)
                         Will you come with me?

                                     ADAMS
                         Thank you.

               They have a short walk toward the entrance. They go in.

                         Thank you.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                              (quizzically)
                         Now?

                                     ADAMS
                              (uneasily)
                         Well -- I wanted to ask you about a 
                         girl that graduated from here. I 
                         thought you might possibly have some 
                         information as to where she is.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         I might. We keep in touch with quite 
                         a few of the girls after they leave. 
                         What was her name?

                                     ADAMS
                              (almost afraid to 
                              speak)
                         Jennie Appleton.

               The Mother Superior starts slightly and looks at Adams 
               closely.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                              (softly)
                         Jennie Appleton.

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes. You remember her, don't you?

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Yes. Yes, I remember Jennie very 
                         well.
                              (again she looks at 
                              him closely)
                         Even though she wasn't of our faith, 
                         Jennie was one of my favorite pupils. 
                         A lovely girl with a strange, 
                         spiritual beauty and a kind of gentle 
                         sadness that always troubled me.

                                     ADAMS
                              (smiling)
                         That describes her perfectly, I think. 
                         Have you any idea where she is?

               A pause. The Mother Superior looks up at him, surprised and 
               a trifle bewildered.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Why -- Jennie died -- many years 
                         ago.

               Another slight pause. For a second a horrified look goes 
               over Adams' face. The Mother Superior sees it and adds 
               quickly, gently.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Oh, I -- I'm afraid I've shocked 
                         you.

               Adams dismisses the thought and recovers.

                                     ADAMS
                         Well, no... we're obviously not 
                         speaking of the same person. You 
                         see, the Jennie Appleton I mean only 
                         left here a few months ago. I haven't 
                         heard from her -- and I'm very anxious 
                         to find out just where she is. I 
                         thought she might have written you.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         There has only been one Jennie 
                         Appleton ever here -- in my time -- 
                         Mr. Adams.

               Another pause. Adams looks at her, bewildered.

                                     ADAMS
                         But -- that's impossible. I beg your 
                         pardon -- but I saw Jennie the day 
                         she left.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Oh -- did you know her family?

                                     ADAMS
                         No. I just know that they were killed 
                         in an accident.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         A wire broke? They were trapeze 
                         performers?

               Adams gazes at her, now completely bewildered.

                                     ADAMS
                              (in a whisper)
                         Yes --

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                              (gently)
                         I'm afraid it must be the same Jennie 
                         Appleton.

               A long pause. Adams looks at her, stunned.

                                     ADAMS
                         I -- I don't understand.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Would you care to have me tell you 
                         more about Jennie?

                                     ADAMS
                              (in a low voice)
                         Yes -- please --

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                              (after a pause, gently)
                         She was brought here by her aunt 
                         shortly after her parents' death. 
                         She was young, sensitive -- she loved 
                         life. We became great friends.
                              (she pauses)
                         I wasn't Mother Superior then so I 
                         had more time to spend with our young 
                         girls than I do now. Jennie stayed 
                         with us until she graduated -- and 
                         then her aunt took her up to New 
                         England for the summer. We 
                         corresponded a great deal.
                              (she pauses and leans 
                              forward)
                         Would you like to have me read one 
                         of her letters to you?

                                     ADAMS
                         Please.

               The Mother Superior gets up out of her chair.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         I was so touched by her letters that 
                         I saved them.

               193. MEDIUM SHOT

               Of the Mother Superior. PAN WITH HER to a large file. She 
               opens a drawer, searches a moment, then extracts a bundle of 
               letters held together with a silk ribbon. She handles them 
               carefully, the way one handles a cherished possession. She 
               slips the letter on top out of the bundle and opens it.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         This is the last one she wrote me.

               DOLLY IN on her.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                              (continuing -- as she 
                              reads)
                         "My dear Sister Mary of Mercy: We 
                         are returning very soon. The summer 
                         has been a very long and lonely one. 
                         How I want to see you again and sit 
                         and talk to you about all that has 
                         been worrying me!"

                                     ADAMS' VOICE
                         What was she worried about?

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                              (looking up)
                         What every young girl worries about -- 
                         the fulfillment of her life -- 
                         happiness and -- love.

                                     ADAMS' VOICE
                              (softly)
                         And she never found them?

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         No. You see, she was so young when...
                              (then gently)
                         She didn't have time.
                              (she turns back to 
                              the letter and reads)
                         "I know you tried to teach me how 
                         beautiful the world is and how it 
                         keeps on being beautiful every day... 
                         no matter what happens to us... But 
                         sometimes I have the dreadful feeling 
                         that this beauty will never be 
                         complete for me... that I will never 
                         find some one to love... who will 
                         love me. It's a thought that terrifies 
                         me, dear Sister, and I need your 
                         comfort and your wisdom to help me. 
                         Your loving Jennie."

               Slowly the Mother Superior folds the letter and looks at 
               Adams.

               194. MED. TWO SHOT

               of the Mother Superior and Adams who sits in his chair, his 
               anxious face turned toward her.

                                     ADAMS
                         Did Jennie... come back?

               195. PAN WITH MOTHER SUPERIOR

               as she crosses to Adams.

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         No -- she didn't.
                              (very simply)
                         That was the year when the terrible 
                         tidal wave hit the New England coast -- 
                         October fifth. I remember it well. I 
                         always receive communion for Jennie 
                         on that day.
                              (a pause)
                         I learned -- later -- that Jennie 
                         was in the habit of sailing out every 
                         day -- alone -- to a little cove 
                         near an abandoned lighthouse -- and 
                         during one of these trips the wave 
                         struck -- and that was the last any 
                         one ever saw of her.

               Suddenly Adams is on his feet. He is excited and desperate. 
               We feel that he already knows the answer to the question he 
               is about to ask.

                                     ADAMS
                         This cove -- this abandoned lighthouse -- 
                         where is it?

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         On Cape Cod -- near Sagamore.

                                     ADAMS
                         "Land's End Light!"

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Yes, that was the name.

                                     ADAMS
                              (with mounting 
                              excitement)
                         "Land's End Light"! That's where 
                         I'll find her!

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Jennie is dead, Mr. Adams. You must 
                         accept that fact -- hard as it may 
                         be to --

                                     ADAMS
                              (interrupting -- 
                              desperately and wildly)
                         I won't accept it! Don't tell me 
                         she's dead! She was in my arms three 
                         months ago -- not ten years ago! I 
                         love her and want her!

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                              (trying to calm him)
                         Don't doubt the ways of providence, 
                         Mr. Adams. What vision has been 
                         vouchsafed you, I can't say. But be 
                         sure it is for a reason beyond ours 
                         to know. You must have faith that 
                         there is a greater design -- a greater 
                         plan to the universe than we are 
                         able to comprehend. We know so little -- 
                         so very little. Be calm, Mr. Adams.

                                     ADAMS
                         Calm!

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Remember there are more things in 
                         heaven and earth than are dreamt of 
                         in our philosophy.

                                     ADAMS
                              (impatiently)
                         I don't want to seem abrupt -- and 
                         I'm grateful for your kindness -- 
                         but -- when did you say the wave 
                         struck the coast? October fifth?

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         That's right. October fifth.

                                     ADAMS
                              (as though to himself, 
                              thinking)
                         And today is October first --

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                         Yes --

                                     ADAMS
                         That leaves me four days --

                                     MOTHER SUPERIOR
                              (desperately)
                         But Mr. Adams. That October fifth 
                         was many years ago.

               Adams stops and turns to her. He seems suddenly calmer.

                                     ADAMS
                         Are you so sure? You say we know so 
                         little -- Then how can you say it 
                         happened many years ago? You say 
                         that Jennie's parents were killed. I 
                         found her sobbing on a bench the 
                         night it happened... You say she was 
                         a student here. I visited her here... 
                         You say she went to New England with 
                         her aunt. I was with her just before 
                         she left... Yes -- we know so little -- 
                         and yet now I know a little more. I 
                         know now the pattern of Jennie's 
                         life. But I also know I am part of 
                         it. She herself said that the strands 
                         of our lives were woven together -- 
                         and that neither time nor the world 
                         could break them. This I have faith 
                         in. Thank you, Mother. I must hurry. 
                         Thank you for your kindness.

               He turns abruptly and hurries out. Through the above speech 
               the Mother Superior has been looking at him with bewilderment, 
               as though at a revelation. As he leaves, she continues to 
               look after him, then moves over to the wall where, in a niche, 
               is the figure of Saint Mary. The Mother Superior crosses 
               herself and bows her head in prayer. (Get technical advice 
               on this last).

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               196. FULL SHOT - INT. MATHEWS' GALLERY - DAY - FALL

               Adams, carrying Jennie's portrait wrapped in brown paper, 
               comes hurrying into the gallery. He is wild-eyed and excited. 
               Miss Spinney comes up to him. (The whole mood and tempo of 
               the picture accelerates from this point on.)

                                     SPINNEY
                         Adams, where have you been keeping 
                         yourself --
                              (she breaks off and 
                              looks at him closely, 
                              seeing the state he 
                              is in)
                         What's wrong, Adams?

                                     ADAMS
                              (in short hurried 
                              words)
                         I'm going away. I don't know how 
                         long I'll be gone. Here's my portrait 
                         of Jennie. Will you store it for me 
                         until I come back?

                                     SPINNEY
                              (quietly, taking the 
                              portrait)
                         Where are you going?

                                     ADAMS
                         Up on the Cape -- a place called 
                         Land's End -- and I have to be there 
                         before October fifth. That gives me 
                         three days.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Three days for what?

                                     ADAMS
                              (excited)
                         I've found her, Spinney. I know where 
                         she's going to be, and don't you 
                         understand, I've got to be there 
                         waiting for her.

                                     SPINNEY
                         You're sure? Are you sure about all 
                         this?

                                     ADAMS
                         Of course I'm sure.

               Mathews enters from the other room.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Well, Adams, where have you been? 
                         I've a lot of commissions for you.

                                     ADAMS
                         In that case, perhaps you wouldn't 
                         mind advancing me a hundred dollars.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (looking at Spinney 
                              somewhat fearfully)
                         Well... uh.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Yes -- of course you can have your 
                         hundred dollars.

               She turns to the cash drawer.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         What's the matter, Adams, is something 
                         wrong?

                                     SPINNEY
                         Never mind that, Mr. Mathews, it's 
                         nothing you need concern yourself 
                         with.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (defeated again)
                         As you say, Miss Spinney.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (handing Adams the 
                              hundred dollars)
                         You're quite sure you want to make 
                         this trip, Adams?

                                     ADAMS
                         I've got to make it.
                              (taking the money)
                         Thank you, Spinney. Thanks for 
                         everything.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Paint me a little church while you're 
                         there -- Say, twenty by twenty-four -- 
                         a little white one with a big steeple. 
                         And don't drown yourself in the sea.

                                     ADAMS
                         Why would I do that?

                                     SPINNEY
                         I don't know. Men are fools enough 
                         to do anything. I don't trust the 
                         sea.
                              (she smiles)
                         I wouldn't go within fifty miles of 
                         it.

                                     ADAMS
                         You're tough. The sea would never 
                         get you.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (quietly)
                         It's the tough ones drown easy.

               She turns quickly away and out of the room. Adams starts to 
               the door, Mathews with him.

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes -- yes -- goodbye --

               He hurries out, as we --

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               197. INT. TRAIN - PROCESS - NIGHT - FALL

               Adams is sitting by the window, staring out into the night, 
               tensely. The train is going at full speed and the monotonous 
               melody of the wheels is heard, and blended with them, we 
               hear:

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                              (urgently)
                         Eben -- Eben -- Eben --

               The thundering of the train crossing a bridge drowns out her 
               voice, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               198. INT. MARINE HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT

               OPEN ON A BAROMETER which indicates "Fair" weather. PULL 
               BACK to reveal the Marine Hardware Store where Adams is 
               leaning over the counter talking to the old storekeeper. In 
               the foreground sits another old mariner, puffing at a pipe. 
               It is suggested that he be in silhouette with rim lighting, 
               with strong light on the face of the old storekeeper and 
               Adams, and the middle distance and other parts of the store 
               in deep shadows, for contrasting lighting effect. Through 
               the window we see that it is a very foggy night. All that is 
               visible, perhaps, is the mast of a sailing ship, or two of 
               them, on one of which lights swing slighty. (There is no 
               wind.) In the distance we hear the bell on a buoy and a 
               mournful fog horn.

               As we have PULLED BACK, we have seen a large calendar with 
               the single page revealing the date, October 4th, with the 
               numeral very large.

               We hear the dialogue after we've held the barometer for a 
               few feet and directly we start to PULL BACK.

               Adams' dialogue has a note of urgency in it by contrast to 
               the New Englanders who aren't going to be shaken out of their 
               customs and tempo and who are both old men.

                                     ADAMS
                         Hasn't there been any warning of the 
                         storm yet?

                              at the barometer, 
                              indicating it with 
                              his head to Adams)

                         barometer show -- if one was coming 
                         up?

                                     STOREKEEPER

                         afore it hit.

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes, I've heard of that hurricane.
                              (he turns back to the 
                              storekeeper)
                         Just about this time of year, wasn't 
                         it?

                              (to the mariner)
                         You say you didn't have much warning 
                         of that last hurricane?

                         I don't suppose either of you heard 
                         anything about a girl named Jennie 
                         Appleton?

                              storekeeper)

                              then shakes his head)
                         Nope.

               Adams turns and looks at the mariner, who's also thinking.

                                     ADAMS
                         Did you?

                         Nope.

               Adams paces a bit as he thinks (but don't let down his tempo 
               in contrast to theirs).

               beaten election button, but which is not too old to clearly 
               read the legend: "McKINLEY FOR PRESIDENT." The storekeeper

               There's a moment's silence. Then, Eke speaks quietly: From

               in another message which is a warning to beware of lulls in 
               the storm. The teletype operator holds the message in his

               208A. BAROMETER (SLIFER SHOT)

               Superimposed over this, we again see a ticker tape with the 
               warning about a hurricane (WORDS TO BE SUPPLIED BY RESEARCH 
               DEPT.). CAMERA ZOOMS DOWN to the word "hurricane."

               208C. CLOSE SHOT - WEATHER MAP (SLIFER SHOT)

               CAMERA PICKS UP the words, "U.S. WEATHER BUREAU" printed at 
               the top of the map and MOVES DOWN across the map to a pencil 
               which is just finishing the core formation of a hurricane.

               208D. TRICK SHOT - HURRICANE CORE (SLIFER SHOT)

               A couple of miles above the ocean. CAMERA SLOWLY WANDERS 
               along the threatening clouds until it comes to a break in 
               the clouds. Then, far below, we can see the peninsula with 
               the lighthouse. CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE DOWN toward the 
               peninsula.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE closer until we PICK UP the body of 
               Adams lying in the small stretch of sand among the rocks.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               210. CLOSE SHOT OF ADAMS - (NIGHT)

               He comes to, looks around slowly, trying to orient himself. 
               The hurricane is lashing the peninsula and lighthouse with 
               full force. Adams rolls over groggily, crawls across a small 
               stretch of sand, toward the protection of a huge rock.

               211-212. OUT

               213. WAIST-FIGURE SHOT OF ADAMS

               (already shot)

               He rises into the SHOT, stands against the rock, a little 
               groggy. He pulls himself together, looks TOWARD CAMERA, and 
               from right to left, then back again, peering to see if he 
               can find Jennie.

               213A. VIEWPOINT SHOT OF ROCKS AND WAVES - A SLOW, PANNING 
               SHOT TO MATCH ADAMS' LOOK IN SPEED AND DIRECTION

               (already shot)

               NOTE: This is not to be the spot where Jennie later appears.

               213B. BACK TO WAIST-FIGURE SHOT OF ADAMS

               (already shot)

               His eyes searching. He calls:

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie!...

               Nothing but the waves answer him.

               213D. BACK TO WAIST-FIGURE SHOT OF ADAMS

               (already shot)

               His eyes continuing to peer into the darkness. He becomes 
               aware of a banging SOUND coming from the lighthouse behind 
               him, and he turns away from CAMERA toward it.

               213E. LONG SHOT OF THE LIGHTHOUSE - (ADAMS' VIEWPOINT)

               (already shot)

               We see the doors banging in the wind.

               angle)

               (already shot)

               His hopes rise and he calls:

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie!...

               214. ANGLE SHOOTING THROUGH LIGHTHOUSE DOOR TOWARD THE BEACH

               (already shot)

               Adams can be seen in the background and we hear his call 
               from the distance:

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie!...

               215. BACK TO CLOSEUP OF ADAMS

               (already shot)

               He listens for a moment, is disappointed that there's no 
               answer, but decides to go up to the lighthouse to investigate, 
               and starts out, CAMERA PANNING HIM TO OPEN SPACE away from 
               rock in order to match the next cut.

               216-238. OUT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               Adams starts across the open space. A huge wave engulfs him 
               and he is thrown down with it. He pulls himself up again and 
               struggles up the rocks to the lighthouse. He jumps over the 
               chasm between the rocks and the lighthouse, climbs the ladder 
               and enters.

               239. EXT. LIGHTHOUSE

               (already shot)

               Adams descends the ladder and comes out on the rocks.

               (already shot)

               He looks out towards the peninsula and calls.

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie!

               IN B.G.

               TO BE SHOT

               Adams scrambles down the rocks, starts running in the 
               direction of the peninsula.

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE

               242A2. LONG SHOT

               (already shot)

               As Adams runs, a huge wave washes in behind him, just missing 
               him. Adams continues running, then stops in MED. CLOSE SHOT 
               and looks.

               242B-242C. OUT

               242D. VIEWPOINT SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN PENINSULA (SKETCH #2)

               RETAKE

               We hear Jennie's voice.

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                              (Sonovox effect)

               243. CLOSE SHOT OF ADAMS (SKETCH #3)

               RETAKE

               CAMERA MOVES IN ON HIM as his face lights up.

               244. VIEWPOINT SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN PENINSULA (SKETCH #4)

               RETAKE

               In the extreme distance Jennie appears. In this SHOT the sky 
               seems to take on an eerie mood. Also the appearance of Jennie 
               has a strange eerie quality. (Hilation effect to be used on 
               her clothes, as discussed in conference. Also for protection, 
               do alternates without this effect.) Jennie runs toward CAMERA.

               245. HIGH OVERHEAD MATTE SHOT (SKETCH #5)

               RETAKE

               The two tiny figures of Adams and Jennie run toward each 
               other.

               246. LONG SHOT - JENNIE (SKETCH #6)

               RETAKE

               As Jennie runs down the peninsula toward CAMERA, CAMERA MOVES 
               IN to meet her until she arrives in a CLOSE SHOT. She is 
               breathless from the exertion of the run down the peninsula, 
               but her face is radiant. She is triumphant in her struggle 
               to reach him.

               246A. LONG SHOT - ADAMS (SKETCH #7)

               RETAKE

               As Adams runs up the peninsula toward Jennie, CAMERA MOVES 
               IN to meet him until he, too, arrives in a CLOSE SHOT. His 
               expression is a mixture of excitement, joy, and frantic fear.

               247. CLOSE TWO SHOT AND OVER SHOULDER SHOTS

               RETAKE

               NOTE: Consider whether we should make an angle of Scene 247 
               for matting, so that we can see the sea beyond them rise as 
               the storm rises, rather than having to intercut.

               He takes Jennie into his arms. They kiss frantically.

               NOTE: Adams has been fighting the elements for hours, running 
               up and down the lighthouse, back across the rocks and 
               peninsula. He must be breathless and speak with some 
               exhaustion. Similarly, Jennie has been running down the 
               peninsula and has fought "to get back," and in her, too, 
               there should be a breathlessness and physical fatigue, mixed 
               in with her exultation.

                                     ADAMS
                         Oh, Jennie, Jennie! I was afraid I 
                         wouldn't find you!

                                     JENNIE
                         It's been such a long time... Let me 
                         look at you, dearest.
                              (she looks, studies 
                              his face)

                                     ADAMS
                              (kissing her again)
                         I'll never let you go again. Never!

               There is a sudden single gust of WIND, and suddenly Adams 
               remembers.

                                     ADAMS
                              (with some urgency)
                         Jennie, darling! The wave -- it's 
                         coming again --

                                     JENNIE
                              (still studying him)
                         It's still all right, whatever 
                         happens. That's what I had to get 
                         back to tell you.

                                     ADAMS
                              (shouting almost 
                              angrily)
                         'Whatever happens?' It's you I want, 
                         Jennie! Not just dreams of you!

                                     JENNIE
                              (going into his arms, 
                              throwing her arms 
                              around his neck)
                         Hold me close, Eben!

                              from him forcefully)
                         Jennie -- I beg you to believe me! 
                         The wave will strike again -- and

                         lifetime together if we make it...

                                     JENNIE
                         We have all eternity together, Eben... 
                         Can't you see? We were lonely -- 
                         unloved. We were meant for each other. 
                         Time made an error, but you waited 
                         for me, and so we found our love.

                              (bitterly)
                         And having found it, must we lose it 
                         again?

                                     JENNIE
                         No, no, Eben. We're just beginning! 
                         There is no life, my darling, until 
                         you've loved and been loved -- and 
                         then there is no death.

               TO BE SHOT

               Showing the rising storm.

               NOTE: Shoot this starting with a placid sea, so that we can 
               use two or three intercuts with Scene 247.

               249. BACK TO ADAMS AND JENNIE

               RETAKE

               They turn, Adams leading her.

               249A. EXTREMELY HIGH ANGLE MATTE SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN THE 
               PENINSULA

               TO BE SHOT

               In which we orient ourselves from the viewpoint of the rocks 
               they eventually reach. We see the sea rising. (In this angle, 
               Jennie and Adams come to the set that matches what is on the 
               film.)

               NOTE: This could be shot with doubles

               249B. ANOTHER SHOT OF THE RISING STORM

               TO BE SHOT

               249C. LONG SHOT (NOW ON FILM)

               (already shot)

               A huge wave washes over the rock in their path and stops 
               them.

                                     ADAMS
                              (WILD LINE)
                         We've got to go the other way round -- 
                         up over the rocks!

               250. LONG SHOT

               (already shot)

               They start up over the higher rocks. Another large wave washes 
               over the rocks.

               250A. MED. SHOT

               (already shot)

               As they struggle across the rocks. Again a large wave washes 
               over them.

               251. EXTREME LONG SHOT

               (already shot)

               As they make their way over the rocks. A huge wave comes in.

               251A. LONG SHOT

               (already shot)

               As the wave engulfs them and hurls them from the rocks.

               252. CLOSE SHOT OF LARGE ROCK WITH WATER POURING OVER IT

               (already shot)

               CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM THE ROCK to Adams lying prone, holding 
               Jennie by the hand. He pulls her up, rising to his feet.

               253-255. OUT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               256. MED. LONG SHOT - SHOOTING UP OVER JENNIE'S BACK

               (already shot)

               Adams pulls her up to the top of the rock.

                                     JENNIE
                         Please, Eben, I --

               256A. EYEMO SHOT - SHOOTING UP AT JENNIE AND ADAMS

               (already shot)

               Adams is urging her forward.

                                     JENNIE
                              (continuing)
                         I can't go on.

                                     ADAMS
                         You must, Jennie -- you must -- it's 
                         not much further.

               257. SHOT OF THE SEA

               TO BE SHOT

               Across the distant horizon we see a great wave rising.

               257A. MED. SHOT - LOW CAMERA ANGLE - SHOOTING UP ON CLIFF

               RETAKE

               Jennie, in f.g., is leaning exhaustedly against the rock. 
               Adams (double) is just in the process of completing hoisting 
               himself up a stiff rock like a mountain climber. There is a 
               great deal of spray, and the photography generally matches 
               the EYEMO SHOT.

               257B. CLOSER ANGLE

               RETAKE

               We see that he is in a safe and protected point. Rapidly he 
               braces himself and sinks to his knees as he goes to reach 
               down to Jennie.

               258. ANGLE SHOOTING DOWN PAST ADAMS AT JENNIE

               RETAKE

               In the b.g. and below (matte shot) we see far beneath the 
               rocks and the turbulent sea.

                                     ADAMS
                         Jennie! Quick! Take my hand.

               Jennie feebly grasps Adams' hand.

               259. ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE WAVE COMING

               TO BE SHOT

               The strange "sucking" noise accompanying it grows louder.

               260. CLOSEUP - ADAMS

               RETAKE

               As he is attracted by the SOUND and turns frantically. He is 
               horrified by what he sees and turns back fast to Jennie.

                                     ADAMS
                              (screaming)
                         Here it comes, darling! We've got to 
                         make it!

               261-263. CLOSE ANGLE - SHOOTING DOWN ON JENNIE: REVERSE ANGLE 
               SHOOTING UP ON ADAMS: BIG CLOSEUP - ADAMS, CUTTING OFF TOP 
               AND BOTTOM OF HIS HEAD: MATCHING BIG CLOSEUP OF JENNIE: ALSO 
               MASTER SHOT

               RETAKE

               Jennie is exhausted and barely able to return Adams' desperate 
               grasp of her hand.

                                     ADAMS
                              (grits his teeth; 
                              with wild desperation, 
                              his voice heard above 
                              the on-coming noise 
                              of the wave)
                         Jennie!

                                     JENNIE
                              (she is fading fast, 
                              but she manages with 
                              tremendous effort to 
                              smile and get out 
                              her last words)
                         Goodbye, my darling -- for a little 
                         while.

               The edge of the wave hits Jennie.

               264-269. INTERCUTS FOR THE ABOVE

               RETAKES & ADDED

               (a) LONG SHOTS and EXTREME LONG SHOTS of the wave hitting, 
               as previously planned.

               (b) PROFILE SHOT OF THEIR HANDS clasped, as Adams attempts 
               to pull her up. This should be made with him managing to 
               raise her a little and with her slipping back.

               Also with their hands separating as the water hits.

               Also with their hands separating without the water hitting.

               (NOTE: These should be made with Mr. Cotten's and Miss Jones' 
               hands, and not with doubles)

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               270-271. DAWN - THE SEA CALM - A PEACEFUL SHOT (AS SKETCHED)

               CAMERA PANS DOWN or otherwise reveals, by separate cut, if 
               necessary, the body of Adams stretched out in the protected 
               section of rock where we have last seen him. There is no 
               trace of Jennie.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               272-274. OUT

               Sequence omitted from original script.

               275. CLOSE SHOT - SCARF - INT. ADAMS' CABIN - DAY

               DOLLY BACK from the scarf, now lying on a small table by the 
               side of a cot. On the cot, wrapped in blankets, is Adams. 
               His face looks pale and drawn.

               AS CAMERA MOVES BACK further, Miss Spinney is revealed sitting 
               on the foot of the cot, a worried look on her face. Next to 
               her stands Mathews, nervously rubbing his hands.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (gently)
                         Hello, Adams.

                                     ADAMS
                              (focusing slowly)
                         Spinney!... What... are you doing 
                         here?

                                     SPINNEY
                         Mr. Mathews and I had to go up to 
                         Boston on business. We thought we'd 
                         look in on you.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (Uneasily)
                         How do you feel?

                                     ADAMS
                              (Haltingly)
                         I feel all right... I...

                                     MATTHEWS
                         Just take it easy.

                                     ADAMS
                         Why?

                                     SPINNEY
                         For heaven's sake, Adams. You've 
                         been out cold for five days. I told 
                         you not to try to drown yourself.

               There is an awkward pause while Adams looks from one to 
               another.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (quietly)
                         They found you on the rocks.

               Slowly, the realization of what had happened comes into Adams' 
               face. He turns away toward the wall.

                                     MATTHEWS
                              (To Spinney)
                         Maybe we'd better let him rest.

                                     ADAMS
                              (to Spinney)
                         Don't go away, Spinney.

                                     MATTHEWS
                         I'll get him a cup of coffee.

               He goes out.

               276. CLOSE TWO SHOT - SPINNEY AND ADAMS

               Spinney waits until she hears the door close, then she faces 
               Adams.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (gently)
                         Adams --

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes?

                                     SPINNEY
                         You saw Jennie again, didn't you?

                                     ADAMS
                              (simply)
                         Yes.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (gently)
                         For the last time?

                                     ADAMS
                         It wasn't the last time. Not really. 
                         I haven't lost her.

                                     SPINNEY
                         Then everything's all right?

                                     ADAMS
                         Yes, Spinney -- everything's all 
                         right now.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               277. INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - DAY (THE PRESENT)

               (NOTE: Technicolor to be used as decided later, but also to 
               be shot in Black and White).

               There are two or three girls (16 or 17 years old) standing 
               at the foot of the portrait, looking up at it (we do not 
               reveal the portrait). We are probably on a PROFILE of them 
               or SHOOTING FROM THE ANGLE OF THE PORTRAIT.

                                     FIRST GIRL
                              (reading inscription)
                         "Portrait of Jennie."

                                     SECOND GIRL
                         Isn't she beautiful?

               MOVE CAMERA OVER to reveal Miss Spinney just entering. She 
               stands looking at the girls who are obviously awe-stricken 
               and whispering about the portrait.

               278. ANOTHER ANGLE - THE GIRLS AND SPINNEY

                                     FIRST GIRL
                         I wonder if she was real?

                                     THIRD GIRL
                         Oh, she must have been.

                                     FIRST GIRL
                         Oh, well, what does it matter? She 
                         was real to him or she couldn't look 
                         so alive.

               Slowly we see Spinney turn and look at the girl. A smile 
               comes to her lips.

                                     SPINNEY
                              (to the girl)
                         How very wise you are.

               The girls look at her, startled.

               Slowly, the CAMERA STARTS MOVING IN ON JENNIE'S PORTRAIT and 
               faintly, as if a whisper, we hear:

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                         I think it's a fine painting, Eben. 
                         I think it will make you famous. I 
                         think some day it will hang in a 
                         museum and people will come from all 
                         over the world to see it. And -- 
                         maybe they'll even know me because 
                         of it.

               The CAMERA stops on the portrait.

                                     JENNIE'S VOICE
                         I love you, Eben. No matter if we're 
                         apart, we'll always be together.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END
