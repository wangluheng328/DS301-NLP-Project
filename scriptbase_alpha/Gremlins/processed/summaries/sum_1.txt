When Billy Peltzer is given a small creature called a Mogwai by his father, he is unaware of the carnage he is about to encounter.
There is a huge responsibility in looking after Gizmo as there are certain rules which must be followed.

When an accident occurs involving Gizmo and water, the next evolution stage of the Mogwai appears, and it isn't nice at all.
