Cameron is an ex-soldier on the run.
He stumbles onto a movie location at a beach resort, and megalomaniacal director Eli Cross compels him to take the job of a stunt man, to replace one who earlier drowned in a dangerous stunt.
While Cameron needs the cover offerred by the job and begins to fall in love with actress Nina Franklin, he worries that the fate intended for him by Eli is the same as the fate sufferred by his predecessor.
