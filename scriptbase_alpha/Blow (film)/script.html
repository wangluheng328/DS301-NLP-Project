</b>
<b>								 ON BLACK:
</b>
<b>	"A MAN MUST LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND THINK LUXURY."
</b>
<b>	FADE IN:
</b>
<b>	EXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY
</b>
	A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the
	Columbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and
	then another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny
	dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH.

<b>	CLOSER
</b>
	We realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel
	machetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE
	the South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained
	teeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their
	jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect
	the harvest.

<b>	EXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY
</b>
	Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized
	bales speed along the narrow road.

<b>	EXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY
</b>
	The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the
	leaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after
	armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a
	gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire.
	The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke
	streaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel
	ashes into the pot to cool the solution.

<b>	INT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY
</b>
	A primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the
	equipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized
	vats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport
	automatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is
	now a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash.

<b>	INT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY
</b>
	A conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine
	hydrochloride.  The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and
	stamped with a "P" before being thrown into duffel bags.

<b>	EXT. JUNGLE AIRSTRIP - COLOMBIA - DAY
</b>
	A small twin-engine Cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel
	bags and the plane takes off.

<b>	EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - NIGHT
</b>
	The Cessna touches down.

<b>	EXT. WORKSITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY
</b>
	The worksite is busy.  George is amongst other workers,
	working a summer job.  As George is taking five, he looks
	across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long
	way from being the boss.

<b>	INT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY
</b>
	George stands in line to register for college, wearing his
	Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair.
	The room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's
	"Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's
	transistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is
	uncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass
	partition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees.
	Something is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same
	cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie
	cutter faces.  He's a carbon copy.

<b>				REGISTRATION WOMAN
</b>		Next.

	It's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  "Twenty years of
	schooling and they put you on a day shift."  The words hit
	him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own
	reflection.

<b>				GEORGE (V.O.)
</b>		I was standing there, and it was like
		the outside of me and the inside of me
		didn't match, you know?  And then I
		looked around the room and it hit me.  I
		saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna
		live, what type of car I'd drive, who my
		neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I
		didn't want it.  Not that life.

<b>	EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY
</b>
	George sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a
	lunch box.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		There's something out there for me, Dad.
		Something different.  Something free
		form, you know?  Something for me, and
		college just isn't it.

<b>				FRED
</b>		That's too bad.  You would have been the
		first one in the family.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I know.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Alright.  You want me to get your old
		job back?  Because I could, you know, I
		could put in that word.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I
		just don't want...

	It's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like
	him.

<b>				FRED
</b>		What are you going to do?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I'm going to California.

<b>	EXT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY
</b>
<b>	SUPERIMPOSE: MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 1968
</b>
	George and Tuna, now 21-years old, struggle with their bags.
	Their new place is a tackily furnished, two-story apartment
	with small balconies and a view of the ocean.  As George and
	Tuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear
	on the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA
<b>	GONZALES, 21.
</b>
<b>				GIRLS
</b>		You guys need some help?

	George and Tuna share a look.

<b>				TUNA
</b>		I don't know about you, but I think
		we're gonna like it here.

<b>	EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY
</b>
<b>	SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
	Barbara and Maria introduce George and Tuna around to the
	Manhattan Beach regulars.  They are immediately accepted
	despite their ill fitting shorts and Tuna's unhip black
	socks.  The beach scene is one big party.  Lots of beer,
	music, bikinis, and good times.  By the end of the day,
	George and Tuna have a hundred new friends.

<b>				GEORGE (V.O.)
</b>		California was like nothing I'd ever
		experienced.  The people were liberated
		and independent and full of new ideas.

<b>				GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
</b>		They used words like "right on,"
		"groovy," and "solid."  The women are
		all beautiful and seemed to share the
		same occupation.

<b>				WOMAN #1
</b>		I'm a flight attendant.

<b>				WOMAN #2
</b>		I'm a flight attendant.

<b>				WOMAN #3
</b>		I'm a flight attendant.

	The weed comes out and is passed around.  Pipes.  Joints.
	Bongs.  In SLOW MOTION, Barbara takes a huge hit of grass,
	grabs George's face, french kissing him, and giving him a
	huge shotgun.

<b>	INT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY
</b>
	George and Barbara are sleeping late.  Their bodies
	intertwined beneath the sheets.  A slam of the front door
	wakes them up.  It's Tuna.

<b>				TUNA
</b>		Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two
		lovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you
		something.

	George and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the
	kitchen to find Tuna holding a brown paper shopping bag.

<b>				TUNA (CONT'D)
</b>		Figured it out.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Figured what out?

<b>				TUNA
</b>		You know how we were wondering what we
		were going to do for money?  Being how
		we don't want to get jobs and whatnot?
		Well, check this out.

	Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the
	kitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana.

	Barbara examines the reefer.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		Tuna, this is crap.

<b>				TUNA
</b>		I know it's not the greatest.  It's
		commercial.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		It's garbage.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal.
		What are you gonna do with all this?

<b>				TUNA
</b>		We sell it.  I got it all figured out.
		We make three finger lids and sell them
		on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've
		made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a
		lot of weed for our head.  What do you
		think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies
		and everything.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		You can't sell this to your friends.

<b>				TUNA
</b>		Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great
		idea and you guys have to be all
		skeptical.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		Look, if you really wanna score some
		dope, I got the guy.

<b>	EXT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY
</b>
	George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Are you sure this guy is cool?

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		You'll see for yourself.

<b>				TUNA
</b>		A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty
		queer.

	They walk in.

<b>	INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is
	California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at
	the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures,
	manicures.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Nothing like this back home.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		Derek!

	DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,
	especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by
	beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut
	and runs to embrace her.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		Barbie!

	Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all
	around.

<b>				DEREK (CONT'D)
</b>		So, this is the new man, huh?  He's
		cute!

	George and Tuna stick out there hands.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		George.

<b>				TUNA
</b>		Tuna.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie,
		he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll.
		Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect.
		Alright, girls, give me five minutes.

	Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

<b>				DEREK (CONT'D)
</b>		Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I
		want to talk to the boys alone.

	After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his
	playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now.

<b>				DEREK (CONT'D)
</b>		What can I do for you guys?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		We want some grass.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		I know what you want.  But, first of
		all, are you cops?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		Because if you are, you have to tell me.
		If not, it's entrapment.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		We're not cops.  We're from
		Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look
		like a cop?

<b>				DEREK
</b>		I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're
		very lucky you're friends of Barbie's.
		If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

	Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out
	from under a sink and sets it down in front of George.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What the fuck is that?

<b>				DEREK
</b>		It's your grass.

<b>				TUNA
</b>		Wow.  That's more than we had in mind.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or
		not?

	George and Tuna look at each other.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		We'll take it.

<b>	EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY
</b>
<b>	SERIES OF SHOTS
</b>
	Summer on the beach.  It's one big party.  George and Tuna
	are on the beach.  They are the new kings.  They smoke pot
	and drink brews.
	George and Barbara get close as do Tuna and Maria.  Slowly,
	George's clothes and hair start to look better, cooler.

	Derek is having a party out of a mini-van in the beach

<b>	EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - SUNSET
</b>
	George and Barbara sit by the water, watching the waves crash
	into the sand.  The sky is streaked with purple and red.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		This is it for me.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		What is?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Just everything.  You.  California.  The
		beach.  This spot right here.  I feel
		like I belong here, you know?  It just
		feels right.

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		You happy, baby?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah.  I am.

	George and Tuna have a hundred new friends.

</b>		Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two

		something.

	George and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the

</b>		Figured what out?

</b>		You know how we were wondering what we
		were going to do for money?  Being how

		Well, check this out.

	Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the

</b>		Nothing like this back home.

</b>		Derek!

	DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,

	and runs to embrace her.

	Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all

		Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect.
		Alright, girls, give me five minutes.

	Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

<b>				DEREK (CONT'D)
</b>		Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I
		want to talk to the boys alone.

	After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his
	playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now.

<b>				DEREK (CONT'D)
</b>		What can I do for you guys?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		We want some grass.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		I know what you want.  But, first of
		all, are you cops?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		Because if you are, you have to tell me.
		If not, it's entrapment.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		We're not cops.  We're from
		Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look
		like a cop?

<b>				DEREK
</b>		I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're

	Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out
	from under a sink and sets it down in front of George.

</b>		No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right.
		You fly home and get some rest.

</b>		Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in

</b>		Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they?
		I wanted to shoot myself.

</b>		Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they

</b>		I had a little problem in Chicago.
		Something about trying to sell a

</b>
	George and his COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY stand before the

<b>				GEORGE (V.O.)
</b>		Rule one: don't fight.  A trial will
		cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and
		the jury will chop off your balls and
		hand them to you on a platter.

<b>				JUDGE
</b>		George Jung, you have been accused of
		possession of six-hundred and sixty
		pounds of marijuana with intent to
		distribute.  How do you plead?

<b>				GEORGE (V.O.)
</b>		Rule two: plead not guilty and get
		bailed out of jail.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Your honor, I'd like to say a few words
		to the court.

	The court appointed attorney puts his head in his hands.

<b>				JUDGE
</b>		By all means.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		In all honesty, I don't feel like what
		I've done is a crime and I think it's
		illogical and irresponsible for you to
		sentence me to prison.  None of the real
		criminals of the world ever end up
		behind bars.  I mean, when you think
		about it, what did I really do?  Cross
		an imaginary line with a bunch of
		plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you
		say that I'm a thief, but where's the
		Christmas dinner for the people on
		relief?

	George stops when his attorney stamps on his foot.  The court
	officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles.

<b>				JUDGE
</b>		Those are very interesting concepts you
		have, Mr. Jung.
		Unfortunately for you, the imaginary
		line you crossed is real, the plants you
		brought with you are illegal, and what
		you did constitutes a crime.

</b>		What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not

</b>		Lawyer says he can plead it down to five

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		Two years.  George, I can't wait that
		long.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What?  You're not going to wait for me?

<b>				BARBARA
</b>		George, I went to the doctor.  I don't
		have two years.

</b>		Thank you.  Have you been getting the

</b>		Don't look at me like that.  What was I

	As George is led to the police car, Ermine follows.

</b>		You don't think people know you're a

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Your offense?  Why are you here?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I don't want to talk about it.

</b>		Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Not really, no.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		No?

</b>		I don't like a lot of conversation,

		I am arrested for stealing cars.  For

	see what Diego is doing.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What do you got there, Diego?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Nothing.  Just a little project.

</b>		What kind of project?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Never mind.  Not for you to worry.

</b>		You have your intrigues.  I have mine.

</b>		We ain't opening shit.

	Diego watches as the room reacts with laughter.  This ain't
	going to be easy.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Alright.  You're right.  I want to get
		out of this shithole as fast as I can.
		And I don't want to do this any more
		than you do.  But for me to walk early,
		some of you have to graduate.  You,
		forget about it.  You're hopeless, go to

	The room laughs again.

<b>				INMATE #3
</b>		Damn, homeboy, you got ruined.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		But the rest of you could get diplomas
		and get jobs when you're on the outside.

	The room looks at him.  They ain't buying it.

</b>		Shit, I'm in for life.

<b>				INMATE #2
</b>		I'm a criminal.  I ain't getting no
		motherfucking job.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		We can learn some criminal shit, too.
		Alright, I'll make you a deal.  What if
		half the time, we learn about George
		Washington, and the other half, I'll
		teach you how to smuggle drugs?

<b>				INMATE #2
</b>		Man, you don't know dick about smuggling
		no drugs.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I was arrested in Chicago with six
		hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I
		think that qualifies me.

	Diego looks up from his desk, suddenly very interested.

<b>				INMATE #1
</b>		How did you get a hold of six-hundred
		and sixty pounds of dope?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Flew it in from Mexico on a single
		engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal
		or not?

	They react.  They're in.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Alright, the first thing you need to
		know about smuggling drugs is that it's
		easy.  The DEA are a bunch of losers.
		They couldn't find their dicks in a

		fuck they're doing...

	intently to George's every word.  His wheels are turning.

		smuggling.  You are a magico, ah?

	George doesn't respond.

<b>				DIEGO (CONT'D)
</b>		I never believed you were a murderer.  I

		seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		You like to make the boundaries

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Good night.

</b>		In my country, I am a magico.  A man
		with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To
		take nothing and make it something,
		okay?  I have failed my dream, but I
		will accomplish.  That is why I am in
		your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom.
		But they do not take my dream.  Do you
		have a dream, George?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I would if I could get some sleep.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you
		accomplish your dream.  But yet you
		failed.  Why?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Because I got caught.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		No, my brother.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Because they caught me?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		You failed because you had the wrong

</b>		George?  What do you know about cocaine?

<b>	INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - DAY

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good
		thing going already.  Everybody smokes
		pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich
		man's drug.  It's too expensive.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		No, no.  That is where you are wrong.
		For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we
		buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN
		Miami, we sell for sixty.

	George's interest is piqued.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		That's over fifty-thousand dollars
		profit per kilo.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few
		times and retail, you're looking at two,
		three-hundred thousand.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Oh my G-d.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than
		a kilo of your precious marijuana.
		Everything is the same, George, except
		instead of thousands, you are making
		millions.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Now do you see what I am saying?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Getting it here is no problem.  Trust
		me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to.
		What about supply?  How much can we get?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Don't worry.  We will talk of

	executive type, lounge around the mini-suite.  Cesar still
	has that crazy look in his eye.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Three-hundred kilos it is, then.

	A beautiful Latin woman enters and kisses both Diego and
	Cesar.  Her name is INEZ, and friendly she is not.

<b>				DIEGO (CONT'D)
</b>		Has everyone met Inez?  This is George.
		I've told you about him.  And this is
		friend, Jack Stevens.

	The men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like
	ants before sitting down next to Diego.

<b>				DIEGO (CONT'D)
</b>		Try to be more respectful, darling.  My
		apologies.  But she is mistrustful of
		Americans.  Shall we proceed?  Let's
		hear it again, Mr. Stevens.

<b>				STEVENS
</b>		I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the
		Bahamas, and then to Medellin.

<b>				INEZ
</b>		Friday?

	Inez addresses Diego and Cesar only.  She speaks in Spanish.
	The conversation is about "Why Friday?"  Inez has some
	problem with it.  Diego explains.  And Inez is reassured.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Please, continue.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		We make the pick-up, refuel once more in
		the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with
		the mom and pop traffic.

<b>				CESAR
</b>		Why are you speaking?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Excuse me?

<b>				CESAR
</b>		You.  Your responsibility is over.  You
		do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You
		are not a distributor.  You introduced
		us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his
		airplane.  That is all.  You make a
		percentage.  A generous one.  And you're
		lucky to get that.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I see.  How much?

<b>				CESAR
</b>		Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo.
		For everyone.  For you, and you, and
		you.

	He indicates George, Diego and Jack Stevens.

<b>				CESAR (CONT'D)
</b>		There is no negotiation.  Three-million
		dollars.  That is all.

<b>				STEVENS
</b>		I want two.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Gee, Jack, a million each had such a
		nice ring to it.

<b>				STEVENS
</b>		No way.  I'm doing all the work.  Taking
		all the risk, and it's my plane.

	Diego and George look at each other.

<b>				STEVENS (CONT'D)
</b>		Hey, you guys don't have to do shit.
		Just sit back and collect your money.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		You good with this?

	Diego nods.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Alright.

	This is too much for Inez to handle.  She starts screaming
	machine gun Spanish.  Something about a "lousy two-hundred
	and fifty-thousand dollars," and how Diego is "such a coward"
	to give away all his money.  Diego is embarrassed but tries
	to remain calm.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		You will watch what you say.  Especially
		around George.  He is my brother and he
		speaks as good Spanish as you.

	But Inez is wild.  She starts in again, a log of "Putos
	(SOB's)", and "Cojones" and "Maricones (gay/sissys)."  Even
	Cesar is uncomfortable.  Diego stands.

<b>				DIEGO (CONT'D)
</b>		Okay.  That's enough.

<b>				INEZ
</b>		Get your hands off me.

	Inez takes a swing at Diego and catches him full across the
	face.  Time stops in the room.  Question.  What will Diego
	do?  Answer: SMACK!  Diego swings back and a full scale is
	on.  Cesar continues the conversation.  It's surreal.  As if
	Diego and Inez weren't beating the shit out of each other
	right in front of them.

<b>				CESAR
</b>		Do you have pictures of your kids?

<b>				STEVENS
</b>		What?

<b>				CESAR
</b>		I'll need to see them.  Also need their
		names and the names of their schools.
		We are trusting you with ninety million
		dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens.
		Without your children, there is no deal.

	Stevens thinks about it.  Kids as collateral.  Inez and Diego
	are still duking it out.  But Diego finally gets the upper
	hand and drags her into the bedroom.

<b>				STEVENS
</b>		Fine.  So if that's all, I'll be leaving
		now.

	Cesar walks him to the door.

<b>				CESAR
</b>		Don't forget the pictures.

	Diego calls from the other room.

<b>				DIEGO (O.S.)
</b>		George.  George, come in here.


<b>	INT. LA BELLE MER - BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
	Diego has put Inez in the bathroom and is holding the door
	closed.  She pounds and kicks and screams in frustration, but
	he pays no attention.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		What's the matter, George?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What's the matter?  We're moving three
		hundred fucking kilos and we're making
		dogshit.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		A million dollars for our first run is
		not bad, George.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might
		as well be hauling suitcases across the
		border.  We're getting screwed.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		I know.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		And what happens when these guys stop
		paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are
		going to cut us out.  Then where are we?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		That's my George, always thinking.

	The door is yanked open to reveal Inez.  She is in a rage.
	Diego slams it in her face.

<b>				DIEGO (CONT'D)
</b>		This is only part of the business,
		George.  A very small part.  Don't
		worry, there is so much more to do.
		Which reminds me, I need a favor from
		you.  I must go to Colombia.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What is it, George?  Because I have to
		get home.  I've got a parole officer
		waiting for me.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		I need you to go to Miami.

<b>	EXT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - MIAMI - 1977 - DAY
</b>
	George gets out of a taxi to find SEVERAL COLOMBIAN MEN
	hanging around outside an apartment.  He checks the address
	and moves over to the men.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I'm George.  Friend of Diego's?

	The Colombian men are not impressed.  They grab George and
	pull him inside.

<b>	INT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	George is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all
	start screaming at him in Spanish.  There seems to be a
	problem.  A man, ALESSANDRO, steps forward.  He is the one
	who speaks English.

<b>				ALESSANDRO
</b>		QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.

<b>				ALESSANDRO
</b>		Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains
		everything.  Open your mouth, George.

	George's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his
	face.  Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth.

<b>				ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)
</b>		Now, you listen to me.  Are you hearing
		me?

	George nods.

<b>				ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)
</b>		You see this?

	He indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of
	cocaine.

<b>				ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)
</b>		I've been holding this shit for him for
		three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't
		appreciate it.  You tell him I want my
		money by Friday.  Can you do that?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Um-hmm.

<b>	INT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY
</b>
	George sits on his bed, reading.  Two duffel bags are tucked
	away in the closet.  Ermine pokes her head in.

<b>				ERMINE
</b>		You have a phone call.

	George picks up the phone.

<b>				DIEGO (O.S.)
</b>		George.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you?
		It's been eleven days and these guys
		want their fucking money.

<b>				DIEGO (O.S.)
</b>		Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Well, you better get here fast.  I'm
		sitting on...

	George notices Ermine is loitering in the hallway,
	eavesdropping.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Hi, Mom.

	George acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys.  Get
		your ass up here.

<b>	INT. CARCEL DE VARONES - MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	It's a South American prison.  Diego is on the pay phone.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		It's a little hard to get away right

<b>	INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT
</b>
	George and Derek sit in the living room with MR. T, a hippie
	ish looking professor.  On the table sits various
	paraphernalia.  Scales, beakers, test tubes, and a hot box.
	George and Derek watch as Mr. T scoops some of George's
	cocaine and sets it onto the two-inch metal plate.

<b>				MR. T
</b>		What we're doing is measuring the
		purity.  Pure coke melts out a hundred
		and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety
		degrees.  Cutting agents melt much
		lower.  About a hundred degrees.
		Quality product starts melting at a
		hundred and forty degrees.  That's what
		I'm hoping for.

	Mr. T turns the dial.  120.  130.  140.

<b>				MR. T (CONT'D)
</b>		Good.

<b>	150.  160.
</b>
<b>				MR. T (CONT'D)
</b>		Jesus Christ.

<b>	170.  180.
</b>
<b>				MR. T (CONT'D)
</b>		Holy fucking Mary!  Jesus, fuck me
		running!  Where did you get this shit!

	At one-hundred and eighty-seven degrees, the white powder
	dribbles off the hotplate and melts away.

<b>				MR. T (CONT'D)
</b>		Damn!  Can I do a fucking line?!

	Mr. T puts his nose in the powder.  George pulls Foreal
	aside.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What did I tell you?

<b>				DEREK
</b>		It's great and everything, but what am I
		going to do with all this?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Sell it?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in
		two years, and you show up at my door
		with a hundred and ten pounds of
		cocaine?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Just sell it, Derek.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		Alright, but it's gonna take me a year.

<b>	INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT
</b>
	Money everywhere.  All over the floor, the counters, the
	chairs, and even in the sinks.  George and Derek count the
	money patiently, writing the dollar amount in yellow high
	lighter on the top of each stack, before wrapping it with a
	rubber band.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it.
		Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I think it's fair to say you
		underestimated the market there, Derek.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Touche.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		But to the victor belong the spoils.

	George divides the money.  There's a hell of a lot.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Half a million for you.  Half a million
		for me.  One-point-three five for the
		Colombians.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		Nice doing business with you, George.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?

<b>	INT. AIRPORT - MIAMI - DAY
</b>
	Immaculate in his white turtleneck and sunglasses, George
	walks with two aluminum cases.  He is greeted by Alessandro
	and his thugs.

<b>				ALESSANDRO
</b>		Greetings, Mr. George.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Where do you guys want to count?

<b>				ALESSANDRO
</b>		On the plane.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What plane?  We going someplace?  Where
		we headed?  You have your money.  It's
		all there.  What the fuck is going on?

	They usher him away.

	The blazer pulls into a long driveway.  They approach a gate
	where SHIRTLESS TEENAGERS with MAC-10's stand guard.  The
	gate opens.  YOUNG SOLDIERS open the door for George and
	roughly usher him over to a Jeep within the confine.  They
	frisk him top to bottom.  Diego is leaning against another
	Jeep and waits for George to be released.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		George, good to see you, my brother.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What the fuck is going on?  When did you
		get out of jail?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Pablo used his influence.  Now, George,
		watch what you say.  Everybody hears
		everything.  A lot of things get said
		and done that, well, let's just say this
		isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you
		know?  No offense, but you know what I'm
		saying?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do
		the talking.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Right.  Now who is the person in
		California?  The connection?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Just a friend.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind.
		We'll talk about it later.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah.  You do the talking.

	The sound of a young man, a MALETON, struggling can be heard
	in the distance.  From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges.
	He is singular in purpose.  He is handed a pistol and moves
	quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words.  And
	then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head.
	George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch.  Escobar is
	handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his
	hands, as he moves back.

<b>				LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
</b>		He will see you now.
		    (to Diego)
		Not you.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		There must be some kind of mistake.

<b>				LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
</b>		No mistake.  Mr. Escobar will see Mr.
		Jung alone.  You are to wait here.

	George hesitates.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		It's alright, George.  You go.

<b>				LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
</b>		This way, please.

	The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where
	the maleton was just shot.  George looks back at Diego as he
	is led away.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		So, this is the man who takes fifty
		kilos and makes them disappear in one
		day?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Actually, it was three.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		The man who gives us the airplanes.  The
		man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago.
		Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to
		open for us the gates of Hollywood,
		George?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		It would be my pleasure.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend.
		Welcome to my country.

	Escobar moves over to embrace George.  George returns it, and
	their hands come together.  George can't help it.  He
	reflexively looks at his hands.  Escobar understands.

<b>				ESCOBAR (CONT'D)
</b>		The man in the garden.  He was full of
		courage.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Un sapo?

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		Un rata - no good.  But he could have
		run, fled the country.  Gone to the
		policia.  But then his wife, his
		children, his parents, his friends, many
		people would die.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yes.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		But, never mind.  I am thinking we can
		do much together.  This problem with
		Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very
		silly business.  To release him from the
		carcel, it causes me much inconvenience.
		The fifty kilos could have been a big
		problem.  And I don't like problems.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my
		partner.  I do not do business without
		him.

	Escobar looks at him with a cold stare.  But George doesn't
	flinch.  His face reveals nothing.  Finally, a smile breaks
	across Pablo's lips.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		I like you, George.  You are loyal.
		That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe
		crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You
		are like me.  I look at you and I see
		myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yes, it is.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine
		for me in your country, George?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very
		good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let
		us drive.  We have much to talk about.

	Diego watches the two men walk outside.  Escobar throws an
	arm around George's shoulder.  Pablo hops into a Jeep and
	motions for George.  The bodyguards come running.  But Pablo
	waves them away.

<b>	EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY

	Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.  Before
	them is a stunning panorama.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		I like to come up here.  To make the
		decisions.  To be one with nature.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		It's beautiful.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		People tell me that I am crazy.  That my
		business will never work in your
		country.  What do you think, George?

	Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to
	respond in full.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What do I think?  I don't want my answer
		to be influenced by what I want, so I'm
		going to have to say I don't know.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do
		you want, George?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I want money.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Freedom.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		Power?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah, maybe.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		Family.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Sure.

		are right.  But money.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Money.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		And Diego?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Diego is my brother.

	Escobar looks at George a long time.  He's inscrutable.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		Good.  Take care of him, George.  I'm
		fond of him, but he is sometimes like a
		baby.  Keep an eye on him, okay?

<b>	EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - ENTRANCE - DAY

	George pull up in the Jeep.  Diego leaps to his feet.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Padrino.

	Escobar wraps his arms around Diego in an embrace.

	A duffel bag is unzipped, revealing bricks and bricks of

	the bricks.  A mound of white powder is brought up to a man's
	nose.  It's George who samples, and then it is sampled by the
	man he is doing business with.  The shot widens TO REVEAL all

	discrepancy in the count.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Three million.  I counted it twice.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.

	George starts to pick up the money.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I'm calling it three.

</b>		We're half a million off.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.

	George moves down the hall looking for a place to stack the

	No luck there, either.  George drops the money on the floor

	George steps into the empty lobby looking for Mirtha.  He

</b>		You better know what you're doing,

</b>		I like fire.

	She blows him a kiss from the adjoining lounge chair.  He
	blows one back.  She licks her lips and it's on.  He's out of
	the chair, pouring champagne over her tan body, and licking
	it off.  She squeals with delight.
	A table gets knocked over as they cause a commotion.  A hotel

</b>		Yeah.  Nice.

</b>		Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see

	They move along the rear of the house.  Classic cars line the

</b>		You come from my body, remember?  You're

		everything.  But I get the picture and I
		don't care.  I don't like it.  It's not

<b>	INT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY

	Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker.  His
	eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of
	the back of his pants.  He knocks the dust off his nose
	before moving outside.  George is on the porch, smoking a
	cigarette.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Three years.  How long have we been in
		business?  Three years.  Does she get to
		meet your connection?  Was she good
		enough?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be
		here any minute.  I'm trying to
		concentrate.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		I'm very angry with you, George.  Very
		angry.  You don't take me to California,
		but you take your bitch wife?  A woman?
		I understand you love her, but it was
		you and me who started this.  You and
		me.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What do you need my connection for,
		Diego?  What are you going to do with
		it?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's
		for peace of mind.  It's for the
		principle.

	George doesn't have time for this.  He checks the cylinders
	on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind.
	But Diego won't get off the soap box.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't
		telling you.  It's just business.  Now,
		shut up.  You're driving me crazy.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're
		driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What
		happened to our dream?

	A black sedan pulls up and FIVE PUERTO RICAN MEN approach the
	room.  George and Diego greet them and lead them inside.
	It's game time.  The atmosphere is charged with danger and
	everyone is acutely aware of everything.  The guys sit down,
	their guns bulging through the inside of their suits.  The
	suitcases are opened.  The rules are the same.  No English.
	No raising voices.  No sudden movements.  George offers their
	leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined.
	The count starts.  George and Diego riff through ten thousand
	dollar bundles.  Diego is still acting pissy.  He's mumbling
	to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around.  The
	guys keep a close eye on him.  Diego finishes a stack, throws
	one of the bags on the ground.  The conversation is in
	Spanish unless otherwise indicated.

<b>				TONY
</b>		Algun problema?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No no no... no problema, amigo.  El
		dinero esta todo aqui.
		Lleves las "llaves" y mas tarde lo

<b>				TONY
</b>		Que problema?  Nosotros esperamos.

	The pressure is getting to one of the hoods.  His name is
	BENNY.  He's got a crazy eye and he seems ready to snap.
	George resumes the count, but Diego won't get off it.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		    (English)
		You embarrassed me, George.  You make me
		look very bad.

<b>				BENNY
</b>		Que esta diciendo?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Nothing.  Todo esta bien.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		    (English)
		Everything is not alright.  I bring you
		in, and you slap my fucking face!

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		This is not the time, Diego.

	The men all reach for their pieces and all hell starts to
	break loose.

<b>				TONY
</b>		Hay algun problema?  Hablame!

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		    (English)
		You fucked me in front of my whole
		family!

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Fuck you...I didn't fuck you.

</b>		Maldita sea, que diablos esta diciendo?

</b>		Esta todo aqui, amigo...take the keys.
		Take 'em and go.

<b>				TONY
</b>		Que esta pasando aqui, jefe?

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le

	The guns are out and pointed.  It's out of control now.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Take it easy!  Everything's okay!

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas
		campesinos?

	George steps forward with the keys.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Take the fucking keys!

	BLAM!  Courtesy of Benny, George is hit.  The shoulder, the
	collarbone.  It's hard to tell.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is
		alright.  There's no problem.  Okay?
		This never happened.  No one has to know
		anything about this.  Diego, I want you
		to calmly tell them where the fucking

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.

	Tony very carefully takes the car keys.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No problem, gentlemen.  Goodbye.

	The men slowly back out the door.  George looks at Diego.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Derek Foreal.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		What?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Derek Foreal.  Derek Foreal.  Derek
		fucking Foreal.  Alright?  The answer to
		all your dreams.  Are you happy now?

<b>	EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

	George and Diego exit the terminal.  George's arm is in a

	Continental.

	The three men come together, and Diego and Derek are
	introduced.  The men's hands come together and the FRAME
	FREEZES on their handshake.

<b>	EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY

	Fred pulls into the driveway in his new car and honks the

</b>		Hello, hello.

<b>	INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - MIAMI - NIGHT
</b>
	It's a New Year's Eve party.  A lavish Colombian celebration.
	George and a very pregnant Mirtha move through the crowd to
	find Augusto.

<b>				AUGUSTO
</b>		I'm so glad you two could make it.
		Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You
		look like you're about to burst.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?

<b>				AUGUSTO
</b>		I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the
		bar.  And if you find her, tell her to
		come, it's almost midnight.

	As Mirtha leaves, Augusto throws his arm around George's
	shoulder.

<b>				AUGUSTO (CONT'D)
</b>		It's good you came down, George.  We
		need to discuss a few things.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Where's Diego?

<b>				AUGUSTO
</b>		He's not here, George.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah, well where is he?  And who is this
		Norman K. guy?  That's all anyone is
		talking about.  Norman K.  Norman K.  Do
		I know him?

	Augusto lets out a big laugh.

<b>				AUGUSTO
</b>		Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an
		island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From
		what they say, it is free and it's
		Diego's new home.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What?

	Augusto throws an arm around George's shoulder.

<b>				AUGUSTO
</b>		Let us walk.  From what I understand,
		Diego has bought a hundred and sixty
		acres, a marina, a hotel, and an
		airstrip.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Motherfucker works fast.

<b>				AUGUSTO
</b>		The word is that soon he is to be king
		of the middle empire.  He is doing
		multiple runs right now and using the
		island as a jump-off point.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		He what?

<b>				AUGUSTO
</b>		Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very
		busy man.  Along with many others.  You
		shouldn't stay away so long.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		That's impossible.  We can't be up and
		running.  Who's distributing?

	Augusto says nothing.  But the ball is dropping in Times
	Square.  10, 9, 8, 7...

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh, no.

	Happy New Year.  Streamers, confetti, and champagne.  George
	marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone.  He's
	steaming.  The music is up, so he has to scream.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Hello, Derek?  This is George.  Am I
		wearing lipstick?
		I said, am I wearing lipstick?  Because
		when I'm getting fucked, I want to make
		sure my face is pretty.  You're buying
		directly from Diego, aren't you, you son
		of a bitch?

<b>	INTERCUT
</b>
	Derek Foreal in full New Year's regalia, complete with party
	hat.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		I don't want to get caught in the middle
		of this.  That's between you and Diego.

	George's face scrinches in pain.

<b>				DEREK (CONT'D)
</b>		It's nothing personal, George.  Just
		business.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah.  I understand.  Just business.
		Right.  Fuck you.

	The song ends, and George is left standing there screaming.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		I bring you in, and this is how you
		repay me?  You little homo!  Hey, Derek?
		Derek?

<b>	INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - DINING ROOM - 1979 - LATER

</b>		Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va

</b>		El no va hacer nada.  Hay un problema.
		Aqui, hubo un error y nosotros lo vamos

<b>				BLANCA
</b>		No le escusches a mi yerno.  A el solo
		le importa la plata.

	Blanca reaches into her purse, pulls out an ice pick folded
	in a piece of linen cloth, and puts it down in front of
	George.

<b>				BLANCA (CONT'D)
</b>		Vos lo tenes que matar, ahorita mismo.
		De lo contrario vas a quedar como un

<b>				FAMILY MEMBER #3
</b>		Mejor dicho vos sos un aculillado.

</b>		Sabes que, vos no tenes pantalones.
		Nadie te va a respetar.  Usa esto.  Deja

		Diego.

<b>				AUGUSTO
</b>		Blanca, por favor.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va
		a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su
		tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta.
		El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar,

</b>		Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan!

</b>		Good to see you, George.  It's been a

<b>	INT. THE YACHT CLUB - SUNSET
</b>
	The Yacht Club is a tavern style bar that juts out over the
	water.  The crimson sky streaks the windows.  Diego looks
	like Che Guavera.  His hair is long, and a graying beard
	sticks through his gaunt face.  The bar has been taken over
	by Diego's BANDITOS.  Automatic weapons and PROSTITUTES
	accent this drunken setting.  George is escorted through the
	door by Cesar, and the room quiets.  All eyes on Diego and
	George.  Diego rises.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		George, I am happy to see you.  How are
		you, my brother?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No more brothers, Diego.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Of course we are brothers.  Why do you
		say that?   You hurt me, George.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		You fucked me, Diego.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		I did not.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		You went behind my back and you cut me
		out.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		No, I never.  I would not do that,
		George.  Never.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I talked to Foreal, Diego.

	There is a pause.  Diego's goons ready their weapons as Diego
	scoops up a cringer with his pinky and sniffs.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		Maybe you are right.  I did betray you a
		little bit.

	One of the men says something in Spanish and everyone laughs.
	George is furious.  He starts to tremble and his face turns
	red.

<b>				DIEGO (CONT'D)
</b>		Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo.  So sad, George.
		I stole your California connection.  So
		what?  Who introduced you to Pablo
		Escobar?  Me.  Who introduced you to
		your fucking Colombian wife?  Me.  Who
		protected you when my friend Cesar Roza
		wanted to slice your fucking throat,
		huh?  Who mad you millions and millions
		of dollars?  Me.  And what do I get in
		return?  This?  Accusations?  I have
		always given you everything, George, but
		that is over now.  This is my operation.
		My dream.  So go home, George.  Go back
		to your stupid little life.  You can
		sell half grams to your fucking

		are out!

	George lunges at Diego and is immediately grabbed.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		You'd better kill me now, Diego, because
		you're a dead man.

<b>				DIEGO
</b>		George, don't be so emotional.  This is

	They lead him away.

<b>	EXT. YACHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS

	George is getting the shit kicked out of him.  His teeth
	broken, kicked in the head, the body, the groin.  His arm
	stomped.  Blood and broken bones.  It's a king size beating.
	The men prop him up and Cesar reaches back and hits him with
	a haymaker.  CRACK.  George's nose is broken.  Blood spurts
	everywhere.  George is dropped to the ground, spit on, and
	left for dead.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I didn't come here to drink scotch.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		I see.  I'm sorry about this, George.
		I'm not happy about this situation.
		It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		You know why I'm here.  You know what I
		have to do.  I came here for permission.
		Out of respect, Pablo.  This is
		bullshit, he's making me look like a
		punk.

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a
		lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the
		money.  You were an excellent teacher,
		George.  When the student has learned
		well, the teacher is no longer
		necessary.  We must remember we have
		wives, friends, familia.  Even familia
		that has not been born.  But sometimes,
		we must forget as well.  I am like you.
		I must teach the lesson.  We want to
		teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We
		must remember that life is the teacher.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		You're saying life will take care of
		Diego?

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		Life will take care of everybody.
		Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo.
		You know the DEA knows about Norman's
		Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships
		Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's
		fucked up!

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		I'm sorry, George.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You
		and me, Pablo?  Are we good?

<b>				ESCOBAR
</b>		Of course, George.  We are beautiful.
		We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not

	Mirtha is on the birthing table and screaming in pain.  She's

	He and his saucer pupils hold Mirtha's hand in comfort.  The
	baby comes, and DOCTOR MICK BAY slaps it's behind and cuts
	the cord.  Tough ass Mirtha breaks down and sobs
	hysterically.  But something is wrong with George.  The color
	drains from his face.  He grabs his chest and falls over onto
	the floor.  The MEDICAL STAFF attends to him.

<b>				GEORGE (V.O.)
</b>		Watching my baby girl born did something

	A one-year-old Kristina is being coaxed by George to take her
	first steps.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Come on.  Come on, honey.  You can do
		it.  Come to Daddy.

	Kristina tries, stumbles.  Gets up again.  She looks like a
	drunk, but she's doing it.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Good girl!

	Mirtha enters.  She's all pinned out, dressed in Ungaro,
	Cartier, and dark sunglasses.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		She did that before.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No.  These are her first steps.  Watch
		her.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		But this is...

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		I said, I've seen it before.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Alright.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.

	The years go by and they are SUPERIMPOSED as they pass.
	George, clean and sober, enjoying family life.  Healthy and
	happy.  Mr. Mom.  Mirtha looks worse and worse as her habit
	becomes bigger and bigger.  As George and Kristina grow
	closer and closer, Mirtha is stepping out on the town.
	Blowing money right and left.  Shopping with Mirtha, buying
	clothes, furs, and diamonds.  As Kristina gets older, WE SEE
	her birthday parties.  George and Kristina wearing paper hats
	and eating ice cream.  She's two years old, she's three,
	four, five, six...

<b>	INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - 1985 - NIGHT
</b>
	The Eastham house is all done up for a party deluxe.  Fully
	catered, with bartenders, waiters, music, the works.  And of
	course the three c's, champagne, caviar and Colombians.
	George is laughing with Augusto and Martha Oliveros, but when
	Derek Foreal appears in the doorway, George excuses himself
	and walks over.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited
		me.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah.  She told me.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I
		feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I
		did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me.
		Cut me out, too.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I heard.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who
		my friends were.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		It's in the past.  I'm out of the
		business now, so forget about it.  No
		hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And
		besides, I'm sorry, too.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		You?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		For calling you a homo.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		That was out of line.

	George throws his arm around Derek's shoulder.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Good to see you, Derek.

	Mirtha runs in with a giant crystal punch bowl filled with
	mother of pearl.  She holds it over her head triumphantly.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Now let's fucking party, motherfuckers!
		Let's have some fucking fun.

<b>				DEREK
</b>		Jesus, is that Mirtha!?

	A very underweight Mirtha nervously runs around the party,
	shoving coke up everyone's noses.  She is gakked to the gills
	and out of control.  Her pupils a mile wide.

<b>				DEREK (CONT'D)
</b>		Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a
		cheeseburger or something.  What does
		she weight, eighty pounds?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's
		going to blow an O-ring.

	Singing.  The birthday cake is brought in, the candles are
	blown out and everyone cheers.
	Mirtha runs over to her husband, still holding the cocaine.
	She's sweaty, her hair matted down on one side.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Happy birthday, baby.  Do a line.

	She tries to push a line up his nose.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No, that's alright.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down
		for once.  It's your fucking birthday,
		for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking
		pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this
		big time drug dealer and wound up with
		the maid.

	Mirtha's loud now and making a scene.  He thinks about it.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No honey, I'm alright.

<b>				AUGUSTO
</b>		A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I
		95, north and south.  My brother-in-law.
		Happy birthday!

	Everyone raises their glasses.

<b>				EVERYONE
</b>		To George!

	A party guest comes running inside.

<b>				PARTY GUEST
</b>		Cops!  They're all over the place.

	The WAITERS, in their white jackets, exchange knowing looks.
	The BARTENDER comes out from behind the bar.

<b>				BARTENDER
</b>		Freeze!

	In an instant, all of the waiters' guns are out.

		Everybody on the floor!

</b>
	Police cars everywhere.  All the party guests are filed out
	the door, and are being led away.  Mirtha is dragged out,
	spitting and screaming.  George, in handcuffs, is pushed to a
	squad car.  He looks through the window to see a FEMALE
	POLICE OFFICER escorting Kristina out of the house.

	George, still dressed in his party clothes, sits at a desk.
	TWO DETECTIVES set a confession in front of him.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What's this?

<b>				DETECTIVE #2
</b>		It's your statement.  How it was all
		yours, the pound of coke was for
		personal use and none of the guests had
		any idea it was there, yeah, right.

	George looks through the papers.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I want my kid out of protective custody.
		Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my
		kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when
		they call me safe and sound.

<b>				DETECTIVE #1
</b>		No fucking way.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.

	The detectives ponder.

<b>				DETECTIVE #2
</b>		Do it.

	Detective #1 walks to the door.

<b>				DETECTIVE #1
</b>		George?  You better get yourself a good
		lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your
		ass to the wall on this one.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Oh hey, one more thing?

<b>				DETECTIVE #1
</b>		What's that?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Get me a six pack.

<b>	EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT
</b>
	It's the middle of the night.  George walks through a dark
	and lonely house.  He goes to the furnace, opens it up and
	sees that there are only five stacks left.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Fuck.

<b>	EXT. JUNG HOUSE - WEYMOUTH - PORCH - MORNING
</b>
	George pulls up to the front.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Hi.

<b>				FRED
</b>		I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.

<b>				ERMINE (O.S.)
</b>		Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell
		him he's not welcome here.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Mom.

	Ermine's back is to George.  She won't look at him.

<b>				ERMINE
</b>		Don't you dare step one foot in this
		house.  You're not my son, you hear me?
		I don't have a son anymore.

	She disappears into the house.  The sound of a door slamming.

<b>				FRED
</b>		She's angry.  It's all over the news.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going
		away for awhile.

<b>				FRED
</b>		You're not going to trial?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Good.

	They stand there and look at each other for a while.  There's
	a lot to say but nothing's coming out.  George hands Fred a
	gym bag.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Give this to Mom, will you?

<b>				FRED
</b>		Money.  You and your mother.  All the
		time chasing it.  I never understood it.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her
		happy.

<b>				FRED
</b>		Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?

	The two men throw their arms around each other and hold on to
	one another in the doorway of the old house.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Tell Mom, you know...

<b>				FRED
</b>		I'll tell her.

	George breaks away and moves to the T-bird.

<b>				FRED (CONT'D)
</b>		Take care of yourself.

</b>
	George sits at a desk in front of a Panamanian BANK EMPLOYEE.
	He slides his bank book across the table.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I'd like to make a withdrawal.

	The employee opens the book and gets a funny look on his
	face.  Nervous.

<b>				BANK EMPLOYEE
</b>		Excuse me, please.

	He gets up and moves to the BANK MANAGER.  They move to
	another MANAGER TYPE.  And another.
	And then everyone disappears behind closed doors.  Finally,
	the BANK PRESIDENT emerges and moves over to George.

<b>				BANK PRESIDENT
</b>		I'm afraid there is a problem, Mr. Jung.
		The banks have gone through a change, a
		nationalization.  I'm afraid your funds
		have been appropriated by the Panamanian
		Government...

	George starts to shake.  The bank president tries to explain,
	but whatever he says is unimportant.  George is paralyzed.

	is losing her mind.  Clara Blanca is cooking dinner.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		What are we going to do?!  What are we
		going to use for money?!

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for
		Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight.
		I'll do something.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer
		the question.  What do I spend?  What?
		How will we live?

	Kristina sits there.  She hears everything, so does Clara
	Blanca.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Not in front of the kid.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Don't give me that shit.  You just
		better do something.

	She storms into the bedroom and slams the door.  George
	stands there.  Awkward silence.  George goes to Kristina.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
		Don't be upset.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		What's happening to us?

	Tough question to answer.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I don't know.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		Are we gonna split up?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No, never.  Don't even think about that,
		it's impossible.  I love your mother.
		And you are my heart.  Could I live
		without my heart?  Could I?

	Kristina nods "no."  They embrace.

<b>	INT. GEORGE'S THUNDERBIRD - MIAMI - NIGHT
</b>
	The car moves along I-95.  George is driving while a jacked
	up Mirtha does a speed bump.  A cop is following in the
	distance.  It is not okay.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha.
		Be cool, will ya.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing
		cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your
		fucking problem?

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		My problem?  We're broke, that's my
		fucking problem.  And you're a fucking
		spy.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What?

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		That's right.  Always spying, always
		judging.  Everyone's laughing at you,
		you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck
		you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking
		faggot.  You must be fucking Diego
		because you're not fucking me.

	Mirtha grabs nuts.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Those are my nuts!

	George tries to fend her off.  The car swerves all over the
	road.  It's turned into a full scale fist fight.  The red
	lights of Florida's finest come up behind them and George is
	pulled over.

<b>	EXT. I-95 - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	Mirtha leaps out of the car, teary eyed, crazed and bloodied.
	The policemen step from their car.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine
		dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk
		right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker
		to jail!

	George sits behind the wheel.  He knows it's over.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		I'm divorcing you, George.  I'm getting
		custody of Kristina.  And when you get
		out next week, you're going to pay
		support and that's the end of it.
		Alright?  There's someone else.  I'm
		sorry.

	George just looks at her.  His face is stone.  But he is
	moved.

<b>				MIRTHA (CONT'D)
</b>		You should have taken better care of me,
		you know?  You've been away a long time.
		Four years.  Say something.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What do you want me to say?  I'm in
		prison.  You should know.  You put me
		here.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say
		something like that.  Always thinking
		about yourself.

	She moves away and drags nine-year old Kristina into the
	room.
	Kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated
	argument.  Through the glass, George can't hear the words but
	it's clear that Kristina doesn't want to be here.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		My baby.  She's so big.

	Mirtha forces Kristina over to the glass and keeps showing
	her, prompting her to talk.  Kristina stares at George
	through the glass.  Cool.  Defiant.  Angry.  She picks up the
	phone and speaks, every word an accusation.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		I thought you couldn't live without your
		heart.

	She drops the phone, walks away, and doesn't look back.

</b>		Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I
		was out.  I just wanted to see you.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		Well, here I am.  See?

</b>		How are you doing?

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		George, you just can't show up, tell me
		you love me, and have everything be

</b>		Dad.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		What?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		You can call me Dad if you want.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		I don't want, alright?  It's not funny.
		I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew

</b>		Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going

</b>		What do you want from me?

<b>				LEON
</b>		It's a four-man operation.  Two on the
		ground.  Two in the air.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Who's the co-pilot?

<b>				LEON
</b>		You're looking at him.  We provide the
		plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing
		spot, and take it to wherever you want
		it to go.  You provide the pick up point
		in South America, and are responsible
		for payment.  You assume all the bust
		risks.  We take sixty-five percent of
		all transportation fees, ten percent of
		the gross, plus our expenses.
		This is not a negotiation, so if this is
		okay with you, we can talk further.  If
		not, we can forget we had this
		conversation.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet
		everybody.

<b>				LEON
</b>		They're over at the booth.

	Leon leads George over.

<b>				LEON (CONT'D)
</b>		Gentlemen, this is George.  George, this

	George's eyes widen as he looks at the last man.  It's Kevin
	Dulli.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Holy shit, Dulli!

<b>				KEVIN
</b>		Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!

<b>				GEORGE (V.O.)
</b>		That was it.  Seeing Dulli after
		fourteen years sealed the deal for me.
		The rest was just details.  My end was
		roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina
		and I could have a good life for five
		hundred grand.  Start over somewhere.
		One final score.  That's all I needed.

</b>		Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's

</b>		Five-thousand per kilo.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		You mean, like a trip?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah, sure, whatever.

	Kristina thinks about it.

</b>		I don't know.  Maybe California.

</b>		California?  You can go anywhere in the

</b>		Yeah.

</b>		No.  I just kind of like the sound of

</b>		California, huh?

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		California.

	They turn a corner and arrive at Kristina's house.  Mirtha is
	standing in the doorway.

	He kisses his daughter goodbye.

</b>		Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?

</b>		You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to

</b>		Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love
		her, y'know?  I kind of want to have
		her.  I've been away for so long.  Make
		up for the missed time, you know?

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You
		haven't paid me one cent in child

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've
		got something going.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Yeah?  I better see some money out of

</b>		Yeah, you will.  Of course.

</b>		Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows

		you've got to talk to her.

</b>		Yeah.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		She's getting big.  Getting her own

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I know.  Well, that's all I really
		wanted to say.  So, okay, then.

</b>		Yeah!  Unbelievable.  Dulli, pour us

	George leaves the room.  The camera slowly pans back to the

	George is led into a small room and greeted by his lawyer,

</b>
<b>				ZIGMOND
</b>		Here's the deal, George.  You're not
		getting out.  I tried to get you
		furloughed, but your mother squashed it.
		Said it would only upset him.  I'm
		sorry.

	George takes it in.  Blinks.  The years have not been kind.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		How's he doing?

<b>				ZIGMOND
</b>		Well, he's out of the hospital, but
		there's not much anyone can do for him.
		It's just a matter of time.  Listen, I
		brought a tape recorder in case you
		wanted to say something to him.  That
		way he could hear your voice.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Right.

	Zigmond sets the tape recorder down and leaves the room.
	George stares long at the machine.  He pushes the record
	button and looks at the red light.

	Six-year old George runs through the leaves to the truck and

		"May the wind always be at your back and

	The apparition of Fred disappears and George is left alone

	George is led into the room where THREE FBI MEN await him.
	One of them is named FRED GARCIA.

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		How are you doing, George?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What do you guys want?

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		You hear about your old friend, Diego?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		What about him?

	Garcia tosses a newspaper onto the table.  The Miami Herald.
	Inside is a full page letter addressed from Diego Delgado to
	Vice President George Bush.  In the letter, Diego offers to
	make a deal.  In exchange for immunity, Diego will rat out
	the entire cocaine business.  Americans, Colombians, Noriega,
	Escobar, everybody.  Just let him free.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		He's going down, George.  It's election
		year.  We're not making any deals.

<b>				FBI GUY #1
</b>		He's never getting out.  Orders from the
		top.

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		So, how would you like to help us put
		him away?

<b>				FBI GUY #2
</b>		We've done our homework.  We know you
		hate this motherfucker.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I don't think so.

<b>				GARCIA
</b>		Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him.
		We've got him dead to rights.  But like
		I said, this is top priority so we're
		handing out free passes on this one.
		And the first one's got your name on it.
		Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong
		fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.

</b>		Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything
		okay with Kristina?

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Kristina's fine.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Is she here?  Is she coming?

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Is she here?  George, Kristina hates

		Did you hear about Diego?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yeah.

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said
		this thing with Diego is a disaster.
		He's giving up lab locations, names,
		bank accounts, he was very pissed off.
		Pablo said to take him down.  His exact
		words were "Fuck Diego."

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		He wants me to testify?  Is that what
		he's asking me to do?

<b>				MIRTHA
</b>		George, he wasn't asking.

	Mirtha gets up and starts to move away.

</b>		Thanks, Arch.

	They walk into the crowded courtroom.

<b>	INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - JACKSONVILLE - 1990 - DAY
</b>
	Packed.  Nuts.  Standing room only.  The courtroom buzzes as
	George is led down the center aisle and is handed off to the
	bailiff.  Over this we hear...

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Sir, please state your name.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I'm George Jung.  Spelled J-U-N-G.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		Thank you.

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yes, I do.

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		Do you see him here in the courtroom?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yes, he's sitting right there at the end
		of the table.

<b>				PROSECUTOR
</b>		Let the record state the witness has
		identified, Diego Delgado.

	The following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage
	style...

<b>				PROSECUTOR (CONT'D)
</b>		Mr. Jung, can you describe the
		circumstances of how you began talking
		about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Shortly after I arrived at Danbury
		Federal Correctional Institute I related
		to Diego that the crime I was in for was
		smuggling marijuana.
		Diego told me he had high level
		connections in Colombia and they needed
		to find someone to help them transport
		cocaine into America...

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		The first run was fifteen kilos, which
		we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard
		shelled suitcases.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
		cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way
		if there were any dogs in customs...

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack
		Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of
		cocaine per week into the United States
		via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly
		into North Carolina, we'd meet him there
		and drive it down to different
		distribution points...

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego
		Delgado was my only connection to
		cocaine from Colombia...

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Diego convinced me to keep most of my
		money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a
		close relationship with Manuel Noriega.
		In exchange for allowing us to keep our
		money there, we paid him a percentage.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		There was an 85% chance that if you
		snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it
		was ours. Initially with my LA
		connections, we invented the
		marketplace.  In 1977, there was no
		other real competition.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		The first year we made about 100 million
		dollars between us.  It was an expensive
		operation.  Eventually we built up to
		three different pilots doing multiple
		runs per week, connections on both
		coasts, everything was running smooth.
		We were like a corporation...

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		he was very anti-government.  He talked
		about revolution, forming his own
		country or island, he was looking for
		power as well as money.  I was just
		looking for money.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		He disliked the United States, thought
		it was a police state.  He hoped that by
		flooding the country with cocaine, it
		would disrupt the political system and
		tear down the morality of the country.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my
		connection, I met him back in 1968 when
		I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It
		was Foreal's marijuana connections that
		kicked off our cocaine market.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos
		to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got
		Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only
		a matter of months before he'd cut me
		out.

<b>				GEORGE (CONT'D)
</b>		I'm not sure how my relationship with my
		daughter and ex-wife have anything to do
		with this trial.  I mean we're here to
		talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?

<b>				CALIBANOS
</b>		Yes, we are Mr. Jung.

	We come out of the montage, the defense attorney Diego
	Delgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball
	weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning.

<b>				CALIBANOS (CONT'D)
</b>		Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon,
		correct?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Yes, I am.

<b>				CALIBANOS
</b>		Do you have any agreement or
		understanding whatsoever with the United
		States government in regards to your
		testimony?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		No, I cam here out of my own volition.

<b>				CALIBANOS
</b>		Excuse me?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Something about vengance being best
		served cold.

<b>				CALIBANOS
</b>		Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Excuse me?

<b>				CALIBANOS
</b>		Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or
		understanding with the United States
		Government in connection with your
		testimony in this case?

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no
		chance of parole.  Even if they cut my
		sentence in half I'll be seventy-three
		years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I
		don't know if the parole board, the
		judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself
		can get me out of here.  I have a really
		bad record, I'm not sure what's going to
		happen.

<b>				CALIBANOS
</b>		So you do have an agreement with the
		United States Government, Mr. Jung,
		correct?

	George can't respond.  Looks to Diego.  Looks from the jury,
	the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable.
	He feels suddenly sleazy.

<b>				CALIBANOS (CONT'D)
</b>		I thought so.  No more questions.

	Silence.  The judge tells George he can step down.  Calibanos
	laughs quietly with associates.  George is bummed.  He walks
	by Diego.  They look at each other.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		You shouldn't have taken the 30 million,
		Diego, I was out.

	George is lead away.

<b>				CLERK
</b>		The court calls Mr. Jack Stevens.

	Jack Stevens is lead to the stand.  WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

<b>	INT. CAR - 1999 - DAY
</b>
	The green of the New York State countryside drifts by as a
	brown Mazda moves along Highway 19.  Behind the wheel is a
	beautiful 20 year old woman wearing dark sunglasses.  She
	drives absently, her mind somewhere else.

<b>	INT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - 1999 - DAY
</b>
	The woman is buzzed through the double doors.  She moves to
	the MAN behind the desk and takes off her sunglasses.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		I'm here to see my father.

<b>				ADMISSIONS OFFICER
</b>		Name?

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		Kristina Sunshine Jung.

<b>	EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - LATE AFTERNOON

	The GUARDS are rounding up the other prisoners and escorting
	them inside, but George is still planting sunflowers.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		Hey, George, five more minutes, buddy.

<b>	INT. VISITOR'S ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	The admissions officer looks up from his paperwork.

<b>				ADMISSIONS OFFICER
</b>		Jung.

	Kristina grabs her papers and moves to the counter.

<b>				ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)
</b>		Belongings in here.

	Kristina empties her pockets and deposits her possessions
	into a locker box.  She is handed a key.

<b>				ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)
</b>		Feet on the blue line.

	Kristina stands on a blue piece of tape and the admissions
	officer buzzes open the giant metal door.  But Kristina
	doesn't move.

<b>				ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)
</b>		Miss?

	He presses the buzzer again, but she just stands there.

<b>				ADMISSIONS OFFICER (CONT'D)
</b>		Miss?  Something wrong?

<b>	EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - CONTINUOUS
</b>
	George turns around as a GUARD taps him on the shoulder.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		George?  George, come on.  You've got a
		visitor.

	George looks up to find Kristina being buzzed through the
	gate.  She moves through the open area and onto the grass
	quickly.  SLOW MOTION: Father and daughter come together at
	last in a long embrace.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		It's alright, Dad.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I didn't mean to...

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		I know, Dad.  I know...

	He hugs her hard.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I fucked up.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		Shhhh.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		I love you.  I love you so much.  You've
		got to know that.  You've got to know.

<b>				KRISTINA
</b>		I know, Dad.  I love you too.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		After everything.  After everything, the
		only thing left out of my whole life is
		you.

	Kristina looks at her father, smiles, and disappears.  There
	was no Kristina.  The guard continues to tap.

<b>				GUARD
</b>		George?  George, come on.  It's getting
		dark.

	George looks up to find a prison guard.  His name is GUS, and
	he helps George to his feet.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		But I have a visitor.

<b>				GUS
</b>		Not today, George.  Time to go back.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		But I want to put her name on the list
		for tomorrow.  My daughter.

<b>				GUS
</b>		Okay, George.

<b>				GEORGE
</b>		Because she's visiting me.

<b>				GUS
</b>		We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's
		lockdown time.

	The shadows grow long, and Gus leads George down a cement
	path that cuts through the grass.  The huge structure of
	Otisville looms dark against the sky, and Gus and George take
	the long walk back.

<b>	EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - DUSK
</b>
	Standing outside the fences, Kristina smokes a cigarette as
	she watches her father being led away.  After a few moments,
	she turns around, walks to her car and gets in.  Time to go
	home.  And as the brown Mazda pulls out of the driveway, the
	taillights turn red, growing smaller and smaller, until they
	finally disappear.
