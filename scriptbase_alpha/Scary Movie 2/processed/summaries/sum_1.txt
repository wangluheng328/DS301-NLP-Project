Megan Voorhees is possessed and two priests, Father McFeely and Father Harris, must drive the demon out, but the exorcism doesn't go as planned.
A year later, survivors Cindy Campbell, Ray Wilkins, and Shorty and Brenda Meeks, are at college, trying to forget the incidents that occurred last Halloween.
Cindy is falling for Buddy, who loves to give wedgies, and Ray is still confused about his sexuality.
Professor Oldman and his paralyzed assistant, Dwight, have decided to do a research study at Hell House, the house where the bad exorcism took place, and disguise it as a sleep disorder study.
Chaos starts as soon as Cindy arrives and meets the creepy caretaker with the funny hand.
But the house has some deep dark secrets that the group has to solve, even if they are scary or disgusting.
