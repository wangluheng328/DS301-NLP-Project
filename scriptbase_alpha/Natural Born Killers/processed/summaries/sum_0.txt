The misadventures of Mickey and Mallory: outcasts, lovers, and serial killers.
They travel across Route 666 conducting psychadelic mass-slaughters not for money, not for revenge, just for kicks.
Glorified by the media, the pair become legendary folk heroes; their story told by the single person they leave alive at the scene of each of their slaughters.
