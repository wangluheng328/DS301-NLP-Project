Mickey Knox (Woody Harrelson) and his wife Mallory (Juliette Lewis) stop at a roadside caf√© in the New Mexico desert.
A group of rednecks (Richard Lineback, Kirk Baltz, and an uncredited James Gammon) arrive and one begins sexually harassing Mallory.
She briefly encourages him before beating him to a pulp.
Mickey and Mallory then murder all but one of the diner's patrons, culminating in a morbid game of Eeny, meeny, miny, moe to decide who lives and who dies.
After executing the waitress Mabel (O-Lan Jones), the couple ensures that the only survivor remembers their names (which is their modus operandi) before they embrace and declare their undying love.
Note that Owen Traft, participant in later scenes and an alternative ending to the movie, is in the roadside cafe and fades out before the "action" occurs.
