In Pittsburgh, overwhelming evidence convicts Lara Brennan of killing her despised boss.
For three years, while she's in county jail, her husband John cares for their young son and pursues appeals.
When she loses, John decides to break her out.
He consults a successful escape artist turned author, and he starts planning: he'll need to disrupt jail routine, get IDs and passports, know how to evade a dragnet, find a destination, and squirrel away cash.
Then, he gets word that Lara will be transferred to prison within the next three days.
He's out of time, and the cops are no dummies.
How can he do the impossible?
