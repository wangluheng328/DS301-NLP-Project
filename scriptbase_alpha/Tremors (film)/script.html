<b>         1     EXT.   DESERT VALLEY - DAY                                   1
</b>
               The high desert -- absolutely silent -- a vast, hard land-
               scape stretching away to distant mountains.  The silence is
               broken by hoof-beats.


<b>         2     EXT.  EDGAR'S PLACE - DAY                                    2
</b>
               It's a simple cabin dwarfed by a big, ramshackle barn.  EDGAR
               DEEMS (60s), a weathered desert rat of a hermit, is walking
               his donkey around in circles.

               Now, rattling toward them down an endless dirt road, comes an
               old, sun-bleached Buick.  It stops and out leans OLD FRED
               (70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora.  The two friends nod.

<b>                                          OLD FRED
</b>                            How's she doing?

<b>                                          EDGAR
</b>                            She wants to lay down.  I'm a
                            little worried.

               Old Fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots.

<b>                                          OLD FRED
</b>                            Well, I brung her something I know
                            she likes.

<b>                                          EDGAR
</b>                            Damn, Fred, you can't give away all
                            those.

<b>                                          OLD FRED
</b>                            Forget it.  I got vegetables coming
                            out my ears.  Usually the varmints
                            eat up half my crop, but lately I
                            ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a
                            jack-rabbit nowheres.

<b>                                          EDGAR
</b>                            If that ain't the truth.  And I
                            count on them for a little bit of
                            stew meat...Thank you, Fred.

               Edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Here you go, Justine.  Look what
                            Fred brought you.

<b>                                          OLD FRED
</b>                            We playing cards tonight?

<b>                                          EDGAR
</b>                            I think I'm gonna be sitting up
                            with her.

<b>                                          OLD FRED
</b>                            I'd do the same.  Well, catch you
                            Thursday.

<b>                                          EDGAR
</b>                            You bet.

               The men nod, and Old Fred drives off.

               CLOSE-UP of the donkey's hooves thumping along as Edgar leads
               her to the barn.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Let's get you out of the sun for a
                            spell.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            I'll get you some fresh water.

               But, suddenly, we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its
               hooves and braying.  Edgar turns, concerned.  Now we hear an
               odd sound.  Distant thunder?  The wind?  The donkey gets more
               and more frantic.

               The barn shudders violently.  Frightened birds explode from
               the eaves.  Dust puffs from every old seam.  Roof shingles
               rain down.  Edgar stares in amazement.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            ...some kind of <u>earthquake</u>!?

               Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild
               panic.

                                          EDGAR (cont'd)
                            Justine, hang on! I'm coming!

               Edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors.


<b>         3     INT.  EDGAR'S BARN - DAY                                     3
</b>
               Dust swirls through the air.  But -- the barn in empty.  No
               donkey.  Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench.  He staggers
               back, and covers his nose with a handkerchief.  Then he sees,
               splattered across the walls -- <u>blood</u>!

<b>                                          EDGAR
</b>                            What in the name of Jehovah...?

               He raises his arms above the door frame.  When he lowers them
               he's holding a 12 gauge shotgun.  He races outside, ready to
               shoot, but there's nothing -- as far as the eye can see.


<b>         4     EXT.  CLIFFS - DAWN                                          4
</b>
               The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000
               feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau.  At the
               top of the cliffs, silhouetted against the dawn, a lone cow-
               boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise.  As
               we MOVE IN, we realize he's actually peeing over the cliff.

               This is VALENTINE MCKEE (25).  Smart and good looking, Val
               has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly.  He
               coasts through life, following the path of least resistance
               -- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on
               the edge of civilization.  But lately he's beginning to
               wonder why he hasn't accomplished more in his 25 years.

               As a few sleepy cows gaze at him, sleepy Val shuffles over to
               his battered old pickup truck.  A hand-painted sign on the
               door reads: "V &amp; E -- All Type's of Job's."  Indeed, the
               pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every
               conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his
               partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag.  Val raps on the
               side of the truck.

<b>                                          VAL
</b>                                   (softly)
                            Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is
                            your wake-up call.  Please move
                            your fat ass.

               No response from the sleeping bag.  Val stares at the cows
               chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea.  He
               gently steps onto the truck's running board, then suddenly
               starts jumping up and down as hard as he can, rocking the
               truck violently.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
<b>                            STAMPEDE!  EARL, GET OUT OF THE
</b><b>                            WAY!
</b>
               The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it.  It tumbles
               out of the back of the pickup.  While Val laughs uproar-
               iously, EARL BASSET (43) claws his way out of the bag, looks
               around wildly, and finds himself staring at three motionless
               cows.

</b>                            You dumb shit.

               Earl is a good-ol' boy who has lived his life just like Val,
               drifting from job to job.  He knows why <u>he</u> hasn't accom-
               plished anything, and often tries to impart his hard-won
               wisdom to Val, but the last thing the younger man wants is
               advice.

               Earl stretches.  The men begin a silent ritual:  Earl gropes
               through his pockets for a cigarette, but only finds a
               lighter.  Meanwhile, Val digs in his pockets, coming up with
               cigarettes, but no lighter.  Typical of these two, each guy
               always has half of what he needs.  Eventually they sort it
               out,  trading the necessary implements.

               Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on
               the tailgate.  But it's cold.

               Earl raises his fist.  This is The Challenge, and it instantly
               triggers the partners' conflict-resolution technique.  They
               solve all disputes using the children's game of "scissors,
               rock, paper."  Earl raises his fist in response.  The game is
               played swiftly and silently -- one, two, three.  On three,
               Val mimes "paper" (open hand.  Earl mimes "scissors" (two
               extended fingers).  Scissors cuts paper.  Val has lost.  He
               shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank.

                            Well, when I'm your age I'll

               Val guides the truck down a tortuous, rocky, almost impas-

               short brown hair, small brown eyes, so-so chest, legs hidden

               Val flips down the truck's sunvisor.  Tapes to it are snap-
               shots of nearly identical blonde bimbos.  Val points to one.

               The pick-up rattles toward a tiny, utterly isolated high
               desert hamlet -- a few dozen houses and mobile homes fighting
               for shade in the vast landscape.  Its most prominent feature
               is an aging wood-frame water tower, perhaps 25 feet high,
               near the center of town.  A sign PANS into view --
               "PERFECTION -- Pop. 14."

               Val and Earl head past the water tower for Pham Van's General
               Store, Perfection's main gossip stop and only business.  The
               store's sign, in English <u>and</u> Vietnamese, reads: "Groceries,
               Haircuts, Post Office, Town Hall, <u>VIDEOS</u>!"  Val and Earl park
               next to a camouflage-painted, large-tired Blazer.

               Just then they spot MELVIN, the town's surly teen-aged pain-
               in-the-ass, coming toward them, mindlessly bouncing a
               basketball off the hoods of parked cars.  As he nears their
               truck:

               But he steers clear of their truck.

               Inside, the energetic Vietnamese owner, PHAM VAN, presides
               over his all-purpose establishment: part general store, part
               barber shop, part saloon.

               At the bar are BURT GUMMER and his wife HEATHER, two no-
               nonsense survivalists who have settled in Perfection to await
               the coming apocalypse -- a nice enough couple, but there's a
               hint of paranoia around the edges.  Burt is shoving a box of
               cartridges across to Pham.

                            points.  I ordered hollow points
                            and that's what I want.

               When Val and Earl enter, Pham automatically pops the tops on
               two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach
               the bar.  Everyone exchanged nods.

               Heather and Pham laugh.  Burt smiles patiently.  Just then
               the compressor in Pham's ice cream freezer comes on.  It's a
               loud chug-chug-chug sound mixed with a high-pitched squeal.

               He starts toward the compressor, but Earl heads him off.

               As they turn to go, Val does a take, amazed, as he spots a
               decorative bleached-out cattle skull displayed on the counter
               -- with a $29.95 price tag.

                            was: we were ripping you off.

               Suddenly a car alarm blares from outside.  Burt's out the
               door in a flash.  The others follow.

               Burt races out and shouts at Melvin who back guiltily away
               from Burt's camouflage Blazer.

               Burt angrily switches off the alarm.  Val and Earl laugh as
               they climb into their truck.

               At one end of town, Earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a
               scoop-loader blade through a choking cloud of dust, scouring
               out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole.  Val sights
               down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit.  The job
               is done.  He signals Earl to cut the engine.  Both men have
               kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with
               dust.

               Nearby is an old battered truck trailer -- the massive, solid
               steel kind used for heavy rock hauling.  Tires flat, mired in
               dried mud and weeds, it hasn't been used in years.  Now it
               provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee.

               NESTOR CUNNINGHAM drives up, surveying the pit with approval.

                            rain.  Lemme have your bill.

               Earl and Val start fishing in their pockets for pen and
               paper.  Earl comes up with various pieces of paper, Val with
               three or four pens.  It's a moment before they realize each
               has the other needed implement.  Earl writes out the bill
               during:

               They amble over to their truck.  Earl takes the driver's side
               -- and starts fishing in his pockets for the key.

               CLOSE ON a stencilled sign: PHAM VAN'S U-RENT -- CESSPOOL,
               SEPTIC TANKS.  PULL OUT to see Val and Earl have rented a
               portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted).  The aged
               machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo.  The
               intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more
               tape than hose.  Grimacing Val threads the slimy hose down
               through the open top of Viola's cesspool.

               Beside them is Viola's well-kept mobile home on a low hill
               not far from Pham Van's store.  Well-kept flower gardens

               Earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump

               POW!  GOOOOSH!  The gurgling intake hose ruptures, showering

               Val and Earl's beat-up mobile home is just down the street
               from Pham Van's store.  Val and Earl, now in cleaner clothes,
               march out resolutely.  Val has a portable TV in one hand and
               a framed COORS beer sign in the other.  Earl unhooks the
               clothes line and dumps it, clothes and all, into the back of
               their truck, on top of the rest of their belongings.

               They stare at each other for a moment.  This is it.  No going
               back.  They leap into the truck.  As they drive off, Val leans
               out and yanks their wooden nameplate ("E. Basset -- V. McKee")
               off the mailbox.

               They haven't gone fifty yards when they spot NANCY STERNGOOD
               (40s) working in front of her house.  The guys pull their

               Nancy spots them and beckons excitedly.

               They stop beside Nancy.  While they talk, Nancy's daughter,
               MINDY (9), comes bouncing along on her pogo-stick, listening
               to her Walkman and slowly circling the truck.

               On its way down from the high desert, the lonely road now
               winds through a twisting, narrow canyon.  A county highway

               CARMINE and HOWARD, repair a slide-damaged section of the
               road, Carmine breaking up asphalt with a jackhammer.  Val and
               Earl pull up, hand them each a beer, and speed away, shouting:

               a monster, ferocious dog comes galloping out to chase their
               truck.  Earl gives the dog the finger.

               from below.

               Higher and higher Val climbs.  He tries not to look down.

               He's approaching Edgar from below and behind.  As he gets
               nearer he begins to notice forboding details: one of Edgar's
               shoes is missing, half the trouser led is torn off.. Edgar is
               strapped to a girder by his belt, his shotgun gripped in his
               hands.  A swarm of flies buzzes away.

               up truck.  Val, Earl and Megan talk in subdued tones.

               Fred is still hoeing.  In the nearby pen his sheep start
               acting restless.  He eyes them.  What's up?  We hear a
               strange muffled sound.  Unseen, behind him, at the far end of
               the garden, his scarecrow mysteriously tilts.

               Old Fred keeps hoeing.  He stops, his foot is caught in the
               dirt.  Suddenly he is yanked knee-deep into the ground!

               They are passing the shack.  Earl suddenly realizes:

               CLOSE ON the pick-up's tires skidding to a stop.  PULL OUT to
               see we're back at Old Fred's.

</b>                            What are you doing?

               Earl is staring wide-eyed.  Val follows Earl's gaze and is
               aghast when he sees --

               The sheep pen -- it's a ghastly, bloody mess.  Scattered on
               the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads
               are all that remain of the flock.

               Val and Earl leap out of the truck to investigate.

               Earl dashes into Fred's house.  Val checks around outside.
               Earl comes back out.

               Then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden --
               Old Fred's hat.

               Still looking all around, Val squats distractedly to pick up
               the hat.  He and Earl stumble backward in shock.

               OLD FRED IS STILL WEARING HIS HAT!!  His mangled face stares
               up at them, eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace.

               using the noisy jackhammer.  Val and Earl drive up.

                            I'm serious!  I'd high-tail for
                            town if I was you!

               Val and Earl speed away.

</b>                            Yeah...

               But he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel
               pry-bar to keep within easy reach.

               Carmine goes back to work, pounding the asphalt with the
               jackhammer.  Suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the
               road, something soft.  We hear a strange, unearthly shriek
               from underground.  A weird orange goo gushes up around the
               blade.  Then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a
               harpoon stuck in a whale!  Carmine gets tangled in the jack-
               hammer's air-hose and is dragged along, shouting for help.

               Howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub-
               brush.  He hears Carmine screaming.

<b>                                          HOWARD

                            Where are you?

               But now there is only silence.  Howard crashes through the
               brush.  All he finds is the torn end of the air-hose -- which
               suddenly sucks down into the ground.  He's momentarily
               staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep
               looking.  He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground.  Then
               something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots
               out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny
               strength!  Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away.

               He clambers back onto the road.  But almost immediately
               cracks form in the pavement around him.  More beak-things
               break through the asphalt between him and his truck.

               He dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment.  He
               clings precariously to a tree root, looking down -- where'd
               they go?  Suddenly the dirt around him begins to "bubble."
               Several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him
               head first into the embankment.  Then the embankment gives
               way, crashing down onto the road, taking with it a nearby
               telephone pole and snapping the lines.

                            to stop us now.  Everybody we know
                            between here and Bixby is already
                            dead.

               Earl points ahead and screams:

               Val brings the truck to a squealing stop.  Ahead: the
               collapsed embankment completely blocks the road.  It's
               totally impassable.  The cowboys are dumbfounded.

                            Are we asking too much of life?

               But Val is in no mood for philosophy.  He leaps out and peers
               into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed,
               emergency lights still flashing.  There's nobody in it.  He
               starts looking around.

                            Val!  Val!

               Val looks where he's pointing -- Howard's bloodstained
               hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide.  Val gets the
               point.  Looking around for the unknown assailant, he eases
               back into the truck.  Earl already has a pistol in his lap
               and is digging through the glove compartment.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Where are the bullets?  Don't we
                            have any goddamn bullets?

               Val quickly jockeys the truck to turn it around on the narrow
               road.  But as he backs into the hillside, we hear a strange
               grating clunk from underneath.  When he tries to pull
               forward, the truck won't move.  The engine stalls.

               They both lean out.  The rear tires are clear.  Val restarts
               the truck and tries to pull forward, rocking the truck
               against some unseen pull.  Smoke wells up from the clutch.

               Val slams the truck into low-range four-wheel-drive and revs
               it.  The tires dig in, fighting for traction -- and suddenly
               the truck lurches free.  We hear an eerie shriek mingled with
               gear and engine noise as Val angrily roars away.

               axle of their truck and trailing out behind like a nightmare
               wedding decoration -- a sex foot long, grotesque, fleshy,
               tentacle.  The end gripping the axle looks like a vicious,
               razor-sharp beak or hook.  The trailing end is mutilated,
               oozing orange goo -- as though the creature was torn in half.

</b>
               In the vast desert night a single floodlight illuminates Jim
               and Megan's partially finished house.  Their station wagon is
               parked out front.  A country and western tune drifts to us
               from it's radio.

               As we MOVE CLOSER, we see the floodlight is powered by a
               small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away.

               Jim and Megan, both exhausted, unload a big stack of roofing
               shingles from their station wagon.  Jim starts to lift a
               package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate.

                            that sky all the time.

               Just then the whirring of the generator becomes strangely
               muffled.  The floodlight flickers.  Now the generator dies.
               Darkness engulfs them.  The car radio music drones on
               incongruously.

               Jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the
               generator.  Megan lies back, taking a welcome breather.
               After a moment:

               Baffled, he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight.  Megan
               joins him.

                            It was right there.  There's the
                            cord.

               The severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone-shaped
               depression in the dirt where the generator sat.  He hands her
               the flashlight and kneels.  We watch tensely as he probes the
               loose earth with his hands.

                            here.

               Megan grabs his shirt, trying to pull him back.

               Suddenly, about ten feet away -- WHOOMP!!  The generator
               shoots up out of the ground!  Jim and Megan dive for cover as
               it sails through the air, and crashes to earth.  They stare,
               transfixed.  The generator is dented and bent almost beyond
               recognition -- and covered with oozing slime.

               We again hear that mysterious rumbling sound.  Jim stops,
               sweeping the flashlight around them.

               She hustles him bodily toward the car during:

               Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground!  Megan is thrown
               off balance and tumbles to one side.  The flashlight falls,
               lighting them at an eerie low angle.

                            Something's got me!!

               We hear sickening CRUNCHES from below the earth.  He SCREAMS
               in excruciating agony.

                            Oh, God!  Get me Out!!  GET ME OUT!!

               He struggles wildly, but just sinks further down!  Megan
               slides a 2X4 over to Jim.  He grabs it like a drowning man,
               trying to keep himself from being pulled down.  But he's
               pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps!

               His head is going under.  Megan desperately tries to dig the
               smothering earth away, but she's losing.  Now only his arms
               are above ground.  She pulls with all her might, but he sinks
               inexorably down, down.  She's pulled flat on the ground.
               He's gone.

               The next instant, a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the
               earth, missing Megan's face by inches.  She scrambles back
               frantically.

               LOW CAMERA pursues Megan toward the car, just missing her as
               she dives in through the open tailgate.  She slams it after
               her.  The talons rake across the car, scratching the glass.

               Megan tumbles into the front seat.  Thank God the keys are in
               the ignition.  She starts the engine.  But outside the "snake
               things" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly.  A rear
               tire is totally shredded just as:

               Megan floors it.  The car lurches forward but the mutilated
               tire falls apart.  The wheel rim digs into the loose earth
               and the car is stuck.  With no other recourse, Megan locks
               the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of
               the car, panting, sobbing.  The radio is still playing a
               happy cowboy tune.  She peeks out.  They gave up?  She's
               safe?  Nothing happens for a moment, then --

               The car starts to shake and shudder!  Dust wells up around the
               windows.

               Outside we see a bizarre sight.  The earth around the rear of
               the car is "boiling," dirt flying in all directions -- and
               the car starts to <u>sink</u> <u>into</u> <u>the</u> <u>ground</u>!!

               Megan wildly honks the horn!  The car looks just like a ship
               going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully.  The
               back windows shatter, dirt pouring in!  Megan smashes the
               windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out
               on the hood.  But there's no hope.  The car keeps sinking,
               titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a
               precarious perch on the grille -- sinking, sinking.

               Out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the
               same hopeless phrases:

               skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky.  The

               view -- and then Megan's scream floats across the desert.

               Earl pulls their old Smith and Wesson revolver and battered
               Winchester rifle out of the pick-up truck.

               of scissors-rock-paper.  Earl loses.  He hands Val the rifle.

                            don't need it.

               Heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands
               it to Earl.  Suddenly there's a blood-curdling SCREAM!  The
               door to Pham Van's flies open.  Out staggers Melvin, wrapped
               in Pham Van's hook-tentacle, writhing in apparent agony.

               People scatter like sheep.  Burt and Heather have guns
               trained on him in an instant.  Then everyone realizes it's a
               sick joke.  Melvin collapses with laughter.  Burt is livid.
               He almost shot Melvin.  He charges over and yanks the kid to
               his feet, screaming:

                            somebody's gonna kick your ass.

               Pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle.  As people
               calm down, Val and Earl gaze nervously at the vast desert
               before them.

               They ride out to an adlib chorus:  "Keep your heads down;"
               "Go careful, boys;" "Keep a sharp lookout;" etc.

               Val and Earl ride along, very tiny in the vast, lonely
               landscape, and very on edge.  Constantly looking all around.

               Faint Country and Western radio music drifts to them.
               They're nearing Jim and Megan's house.

               No answer.  He opens the door and peers inside.  Behind him
               Earl steps out of the half-finished house and shrugs.  Nobody
               around.  Wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows.
               Strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly.

                            Oh, man, I hate this shit.

               They walk briskly to their horses.  Earl snatches Heather's
               rifle from its saddle scabbard.  Val pulls out the
               Winchester.  Earl tries to reassure himself.

                            Twitty coming from?

               They focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it, keeping
               constant watch in every direction.  The ground here is all
               torn up like the sheep pen -- and the music is coming from
               <u>underneath</u>!  What the hell is going on?

               Val scrapes at the dirt with his boot -- and finds the
               headlight of Jim and Megan's station wagon, still on, glaring
               up at him.  He drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt,
               revealing more of the car's grille and hood -- and blood -
               soaked dirt which sticks to his hand.  He leaps away,
               frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants.

</b>
               Val and Earl are riding at full gallop.  They race alongside
               a concrete-lined flood-control ditch and veer off to follow a
               barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch.


<b>         51    EXT.  DESERT - BARBED WIRE FENCE - DAY                       51

               They ride along the fence during:

</b>                            <u>Why</u> would they do it?

               Suddenly the horses stop short.  In a frenzy they wheel
               around, rear up, refusing to go on.  The cowboys fight to
               control them.

               But Earl's already drawing his rifle.

               He draws his rifle.  They look wildly in all directions at
               once -- but there's nothing, only empty desert.

                                          VAL (cont'd)
                            But I don't see anything!

               They keep staring.  The horses keep pacing nervously.  Then
               -- Earl's horse rears wildly and falls!  Earl goes flying.
               Val wheels around wildly, dismounts and runs to Earl, who's
               bruised and winded but basically unhurt.  They think Earl's
               horse just tripped.

                                          VAL (cont'd)

                            What about the hor...?

               Their eyes bulge.  Several "snake things" have engulfed the
               horse's head, sucking, crushing, slurping.  Val's horse goes
               berserk and gallops for the horizon.

                                          EARL (cont'd)

               Suddenly they realize what that means -- the thing could
               come up under <u>them</u>!!  The cowboys scramble frantically away.
               But nothing pursues them.  They pause, glancing back
               nervously.

               Val raises his rifle and takes a well-aimed shot, hitting one
               of them.  Orange goo spurts out.  We hear a deafening shriek
               as all the "snake things" instantly zip back underground.

               Then -- A HUGE MOUND OF EARTH RISES UP UNDER VAL AND EARL!!
               The cowboys tumble down its side, Val losing his rifle.  They
               roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound.

                                          VAL (cont'd)

                            There must be a million of them!!

               The mound of earth turns toward them.  The ground splits open
               and out rises -- a huge head!

<b>                                          EARL

                            Nope...just one.

               The monster is a horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine!
               Its head is eyeless, utterly alien, covered with tough boney
               plates which close together to form a cork-screw point.

               The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless
               terror.  The creature slides toward them, pushing through the
               earth like a whale through water.  Now it opens its mouth --
               but it's like a grotesque flower, boney plates spreading open
               like petals, revealing a huge, slimy, fleshy, oozing orifice!
               And inside the mouth, a ghastly multi-tentacled tongue!
               These are the "snake things," not snakes at all but actually
               the horrid hook-tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag
               their prey!

               The monster snorts and snuffs, throwing up plumes of dust,
               sounding like a horrendous pig.  It sinks into the earth and
               charges!  We see the hump of earth move toward them faster
               and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper.

               Val and Earl leap sideways and run along the fence.  The
               creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below.
               All we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle.

               The cowboys keep running.  The creature regroups and charges
               after them, hitting each fencepost in turn, sending weird
               sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire, making almost
               musical twanging sounds.  Val looks back.

</b>                            It's gaining on us!!

               And as if that weren't enough, Earl points to more trouble
               ahead.

               The fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch, an eight
               foot wide gap yawning dead ahead.  The creature churns like
               a locomotive from behind.  They'll have to try to jump!  They
               strain desperately for every last fraction of speed.

<b>                                          EARL

               They leap and -- they don't do it!!  They smack into the
               opposite side of the ditch, clawing frantically at the lip,
               only to tumble to its sloping bottom.  A split second later
               the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the
               foot-thick concrete wall!  The wall CRACKS AND BULGES OUT!  A
               hook-tentacle flops out through one of the cracks!  Terrified
               Val and Earl scramble away.  But the wall holds together.

               And the, strangely, all is quiet.  The tentacle lays dead
               still.  Eventually, the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a
               little closer, still panting, exhausted, jumpy.

               And now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the
               concrete.

               He suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast.

                            You FUCKER!!

               They allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter,
               only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down
               the concrete wall behind them.  They whirl to see Rhonda, up
               on the opposite side of the ditch, staring down at them.
               She's lugging a bunch of her equipment, including a small
               folding shovel.

                            This is important, you know.  This
                            is like, well, let's say it, it's
                            probably the biggest zoological
                            discovery of the century.  The
                            century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.

               We can hear a shovel digging up above, and now Val shouts:

                            Just look at what we caught here!

               Earl and Rhonda climb up.  CRANE UP with them to REVEAL the
               whole animal!  Val, digging excitedly with Rhonda's shovel,
               is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's
               tail.  The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is
               partially uncovered, in king-sized bas-relief.

                            seismos working overtime?

               She nods, stepping down to study the creature.  The body is
               stream-lined, cigar-shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at
               its thickest.  It's covered with <u>hundreds</u> of short, rear-
               pointing, retractable spikes.  Rhonda gingerly jiggles one.
               It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger.

                            It must push itself along with
                            these.  Hundreds of them pushing at
                            once.  That's how it can move so
                            fast.  I mean this thing was
                            tripping sensors all over the
                            valley.  No wonder I couldn't...

               A chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence.  She springs
               down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out
               her seismograph printouts.  She studies them frantically
               during:

               The guys looks at each other.  One thought immediately springs
               to their minds.

               While they bask in their fame-to-be, Rhonda continues to
               study the print-outs, coming to a terrifying conclusion.

                            Some kind of crane with lifting
                            straps.

               But Rhonda interrupts -- now really scared.

               Val and Earl shut right up.  Earl edges up a fencepost.  Val
               sidles up onto a rock during:

               Rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts, pointing out
               jagged ink lines on the graphs, comparing different ones.

                            seismographs all over the valley.
                            If you compare the different
                            readings, there have to be five.
                            Here's one at two o'clock
                            yesterday, but here's another one
                            three miles away at the same time.
                            So that's two.  Now, here...

               The men leap from their perches and hustle her in the
               direction she came from.

               She indicates what to most of us would be a hill, dotted with
               huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big
               mushrooms.  The trio jogs toward the hill.

               En route to the truck, they pass near one of Rhonda's
               seismographs.  Suddenly Earl stumbles as one leg drops knee-
               deep into the ground!  He screams.  Val wheels and bodily
               yanks him up.  They back away from the small hole in the
               ground, calming a little as they realize:

               Rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well -- the soft
               scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper
               cylinder.  She whacks Val on the shoulder and points
               speechlessly at it.

               She doesn't have to explain.  All three of them dash dash for:

               The remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the
               boulders.  Val, Earl, and Rhonda scramble over the wood, up
               onto the rock and stand there tensely.

               In a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the
               base of the rock.  The monster's slimy hook-tentacles slither
               out, searching the rock base.  Shuddering, the humans move as
               high as they can, well out of reach.  The tentacles slip back
               beneath the earth.  Everyone breathes a sigh of relief.

               Rhonda points.  They can see the roof of her truck, maybe a
               hundred yards away through the boulders.  Val and Earl think
               about it.

               Val gets an idea.  He grabs a post from the dilapidated fence
               and cautiously slips down near the boulder's edge.

               Val nods.  Dead silence as he reaches way out with the post
               and scrapes it on the ground.  Almost instantly the creature
               roars up, grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and
               lashing tentacles, nearly hooking Val's hand.  Val
               practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety.

               Our heroes are silhouetted against a huge, spectacular,
               desert night sky.  After a very long pause:

               The silhouettes shift, Val and Earl moving down one side of
               the rock, and Rhonda down the other.  We can no longer see
               them.  We just head zippers zipping down -- then soft sighs
               of relief from Val and Earl.  Then:

               Rich orange sunlight creeps silently across the deathly still
               desert.  Earl is already awake.  Val is curled up without his
               jacket, shivering.  He wakes with a start.  Where the hell's
               his jacket?

               Rhonda wakes slowly.  She's surprised to find herself wrapped
               in Val's jacket.  Touched by his chivalry, she embarrassedly
               hands it to baffled Val.

               Val glances at Earl, who looks away.  Who, me?

                            No problem.  Anytime.

               Earl gropes through his pockets, coming up with only
               cigarettes.  Val fishes in his own pockets, finding only
               their lighter.  They exchange items and light up during:

                            out there.

               This time he tosses a piece of wood out onto the sand.  With
               soft rustling, a bulge forms in the earth, moves over to the
               wood, then subsides.  Rhonda starts looking around during:

                            on a sprint.

               Rhonda gives up on them.  She goes over and pulls a long
               cross rail from the fence during:

                            Running is what you do when the
                            plan fails.  You're not even trying
                            to come up with a plan!

                            You guys know how to pole vault?

               They watch in surprise as she hefts her pole, checks the
               balance, eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder.  Then
               she charges between them, plants her pole and vaults smoothly
               over to the next boulder, maybe fifteen feet away.  The
               creature surfaces where her pole touched down, but too late
               -- a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area, the disappears
               into the ground.  Val and Earl glance at each other,
               <u>impressed</u>.

                                          RHONDA (cont'd)
                            We just stay where it can't get
                            us...on these residual boulders.
                            My truck's parked right next to
                            one.

               Earl rushes to grab a couple more fence rails.

               Val just stands staring across at Rhonda -- his horizons are
               broadening.  Earl stuffs a fence rail into his hands.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                                   (pointedly)

                            pole-vaulting?

               Earl takes a deep breath and goes for it, vaulting across to
               Rhonda.  Val follows.

               Through the shimmering heat in the distance we see the
               strange sight of the three figures vaulting from boulder to
               boulder.


<b>         61    EXT.  BOULDER FIELD - RHONDA'S TRUCK - DAY                   61
</b>
               Val, Earl and Rhonda pole-vault their way toward the truck.
               Finally they're at the nearest boulder, but the truck is
               still ten feet away.

                            go fast.  I say we all jump together.

               Rhonda and Val nod.  Rhonda grips her car keys in her teeth.

               They all vault in unison, landing in the truck bed.  Rhonda
               scrambles up, slides open the cab's rear window, and begins
               wriggling through headfirst.

                            us much time...

               Dust explodes around the rear of the truck!  Hook-tentacles
               snake up on all sides, narrowly missing Val.  He and Earl
               grab whatever's handy, pounding at the tentacles with
               expensive instruments.

               Rhonda's only half way through the cab window, still hanging
               headfirst into the cab.  She frantically starts the truck,
               dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist.

               As the truck roars away, one tentacles manages to tear off the
               the muffler.  The engine thunders like a tank.  Val and Earl
               sit back, sighing in relief, then react when they see
               Rhonda is driving upside down and blind.

               Rhonda skids her noisy truck to a halt in front of Pham Van's.

               Val leaps out and jumps into his pick-up truck.  He searches
               for the key.

               Val holds out his hand for the key.  Earl tosses it to him.
               Val drives off.  We FOLLOW Rhonda and Earl as they drive the
               other way, toward Viola's.

                            too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't
                            quite sit still for it, though.
                            Had too much vinegar in his system.

                            a million.

               Rhonda sees straight through Earl's clumsy attempt at match-
               making.  She can't help but smile.  Earl grins sheepishly.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            All right, I'm about as subtle as

                            period.  Cosmic radiation was much
                            higher then...so they mutated...and
                            they got so big they just sank
                            right into the ground and fell
                            asleep... But now continental drift
                            has brought them to the surface,
                            ready to be harvested by the

               We hear an a eerie SHRIEK from outside.  Something shoots in
               through the window, striking Earl in the chest!!  Earl flails
               frantically at it -- but it's only Melvin's basketball.  We
               glimpse Melvin outside, doubled over with laughter.  Earl

               dodges it.

               We're CLOSE on Melvin as he circles around the back of Pham
               Van's, bouncing his basketball, mischief in his eyes.  We can
               hear the townsfolk inside.

               Then, to Melvin's astonishment, the steady rhythm of his
               bouncing basketball suddenly stops.  The ball just goes flup
               and doesn't bounce back up to him.  He looks down.  No ball!
               Just swirling dust at his feet.

               Everyone jumps as we once more hear an ear-shattering SHRIEK

               Val and Earl are well ahead of the other townsfolk as they
               march around to the side of Pham Van's.  But where's Melvin?
               Nothing out here but the oppressive, hot desert silence.
               Then they hear a soft shuddering whimper -- from above.
               There's terrified Melvin, halfway up a telephone pole,
               clinging to it desperately.

               Val and Earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each
               other, realizing instantly what's up.  Without a word they
               leap desperately in opposite directions.  Like a breaching
               whale, a creature roars up through the earth right where they
               were standing, great mouth gaping open, slimy tentacles
               lashing in all directions.

               The townsfolk scatter, some heading for their homes,
               including Viola and Nestor.  Others scramble over each other
               as they pile back into Pham Van's.  The telephone pole
               shudders.  Melvin falls and scampers for the nearest hiding
               place, a corrugated tin storage shed near Pham Van's.

               Miguel and Pham shut up.  Then we hear something new -- the
               building itself creaking and groaning like a ship.  The
               liquor bottles behind Pham Van's bar vibrate and clink.  The
               creature is moving beneath the building.  The people freeze
               like mannequins.  Now we can hear its pig-like snorting.
               Pham Van and Miguel react as the awful smell percolates up
               through the floorboards.  Val signals them to keep quiet.
               Finally, the creaking stops.

               Rhonda addresses the group in an intense whisper:

               Everyone stands stock still -- and sweats.  But, then, slowly
               we become aware of a faint, yet oddly familiar sound.
               Squeak, squeak, squeak -- Mindy on her pogo stick!  They all
               scramble to the windows.

               Thoughts of personal safety vanish as the horrified people

               asphalt!  Then it is sucked down like so much spaghetti!

               Nancy rushes into frame, hugging Mindy.  Val signals her to
               be quiet.  They sit uneasily.  Where's the creature?
               Suddenly the pogo stick erupts out of the earth right in
               their midst!

               Val runs one way, Nancy and Mindy the other, heading up the
               street toward their house.  Val scrambles up onto his pick-up
               truck!  The creature rams the truck, rupturing a tire.  As it
               shakes the truck violently, Val spots Rhonda and Earl, now
               standing uncertainly halfway between him and Pham Van's.

</b>                            Go back, for chrissake!

               Rhonda and Earl hesitate.

                            suck that truck down!

               But Earl now hears something behind them!  Down the street,
               a little wall of cinder blocks framing Viola's driveway
               suddenly topples over.

<b>                                          EARL

               CAMERA charges toward them.  Earl swerves toward Pham Van's,
               but Rhonda is cut off!  She heads toward the next nearest
               haven:


<b>         78    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     78
</b>
               The storage shed where Melvin is hiding.  It sits in a
               vacant, weed-choked lot.  Crashing through the weeds, Rhonda
               has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up
               short and slams face down in a cloud of dust!

               She can't get up!!  Something's got her!  She's caught in an
               old rusted barbed wire fence, lying almost flat, hidden in
               the weeds.  Some strands have come loose and are curled up
               like vicious concertina wire.

               Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in
               under her!  She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles
               snake up, missing her by inches!  She keeps rolling-crawling-
               scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but
               gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire.  She
               freezes.  The creature feels around where she was.

               She calms herself, pulling gingerly at the wire, working
               tensely to free herself but --

               The creature's mouth slams shut on the fence.  Like a spider
               sensing something caught in its web, the monster knows it's
               on to something.  Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare
               three feet of fence, then the creature lunges up and out,
               swallowing that three feet in a big "gulp" and yanking Rhonda
               violently toward it!  She screams, pants ripped, legs slashed
               and bleeding!  GULP!  She's dragged even closer.

               The truck shakes and shimmies as Val's creature tries to pull
               it down.  Val sees that Rhonda's in trouble.  He searches
               frantically for a weapon -- and finds one -- a CHAIN SAW!  He
               leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground
               running, yanking furiously on the saw's starter cord.


<b>         80    EXT.  STORAGE SHED - DAY                                     80
</b>
               Rhonda is in a dead panic, thrashing helplessly in the barbed
               wire.  The beast takes another gulp of fence, wrenching her
               within inches of a probing hook-tentacle!  Suddenly we hear a
               nasty ROAR as Val's chain saw swings in, slicing the squirm-
               ing tentacle in half, spraying gore everywhere!  The creature
               unleashes an unearthly shriek, and the other tentacles
               recoil.  The severed one writhes like a beheaded snake.

               Val yanks off Rhonda's boots.

<b>                                          VAL
</b>                            Come on!  Outta your pants!

               She frantically claws at her belt.  But in mere seconds:

<b>                                          RHONDA

<b>                            LOOK OUT!
</b>
               Tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence.  Val
               grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly, but this time the
               hook-tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp.  It
               slams to the ground, motor dying.  The monster readies itself
               for the lunge that will suck Rhonda in.  Val grabs her under
               the arms and pulls.  Rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her
               wire enmeshed pants.

               The creature lunges!  Rhonda pulls free!  She and Val tumble
               backward.  The creature gets only a mouthful of Rhonda's jeans.

               The next instant the second creature explodes up through the
               ground right next to fallen Val and Rhonda!  They roll
               sideways, come up running, and sprint for Pham Van's along an
               old wooden sidewalk.

               Earl flings open the front door.  Val and Rhonda race toward
               the porch.  Right on their heels the creature ripples the
               boards like an ocean wave!

                            Just run!  Run like screaming fuck!

               They dive through the open door of Pham Van's.  The rippling
               boards zoom on past it.  Earl quickly eases the door shut.

               It's a tense, edgy group.  Every movement made is in slow
               motion, every word is a whisper.   They gaze grimly out the
               windows at the silent, deserted, heat-shimmering main street.

               Val gingerly dabs iodine onto the cuts on Rhonda's legs.
               She doesn't even wince.

               She smiles at him.

                            So, is that one of your usual jobs,

               She gazes at him.  He looks away.  Over at the bar, Pham
               holds up a new pair of pants for Rhonda.

<b>                                          RHONDA
</b>                            Oh, thank you.

               Grateful for something to do, Val eases over to get the
               pants.  Rhonda looks after him.  Then she becomes aware of
               someone staring at <u>her</u>.  It's Earl, giving her a big Cheshire
               cat grin that says "What did I tell you?"

               Pham hands the pants to Val.  Then Pham and Miguel reach
               simultaneously for a sods bottle and -- knock it over!  It
               rolls all the way down the bar as a flurry of desperate hands
               try to stop it.  No good.  It rolls off the end and -- CRASH!

               Everyone freezes.  Sure enough the building shudders.  Floor
               boards creak and bend as searching tentacles thump and scrape
               along under the floor.  People close their eyes, not even
               breathing.  Finally the noise subsides.  Everyone relaxes --
               a little.

               Up the hill across from Pham Van's, the old trailer looks

               Everyone turns away from the windows, gingerly sitting down,
               glumly pondering this possibility.  There is a long silence.

               Then suddenly -- ROAR!  The silence is shattered as Pham
               Van's big freezer compressor suddenly comes on.

               Pham runs to the freezer.  Its on/off switch is buried behind
               stacks of soft-drink cases.  He tears at them like a madman,
               toppling them this way and that.  Earl and Val join him.

               But right behind Pham, the floor BUCKLES UP, a monster's
               snout BURSTING THROUGH and engulfing one of his legs!  The
               creature starts to back down into the jagged hole, dragging
               screaming Pham with it.  Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Miguel grab
               Pham's arms but are no match for the monster.  It shakes and
               spins him like some gigantic dog, effortlessly throwing them
               off, relentlessly pulling Pham down.

               The hole in the floor is <u>too</u> <u>small</u> <u>for</u> <u>Pham</u> <u>to</u> <u>fit</u> <u>through</u>!
               As one leg goes down, the other is bent hideously backward.
               Pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him, bones
               snap, ribs crack.  The others grab him again but are utterly
               helpless.  With vicious, powerful jerks the creature yanks
               his man mangled body down.  The last thing we see is his foot,
               now folded back past his head, and he's gone.

               Val is wild with helpless anger.

               The floor bulges up in another place!  A second creature!
               Then a third, coming RIGHT UP UNDER THEM!  Earl sprawls onto
               the bar.  Rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the
               store, knocking groceries everywhere.  Val and Miguel climb up
               shelves which cover the rear wall of the store.

               The whole building shakes and shudders, dust powdering down
               from the ceiling.  Flailing tentacles are everywhere,
               slashing open food packages; clouds of flour fill the air!

               Val spots a hatch in the ceiling.

</b>                            Everybody!  This way!  The roof!

               Earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves.  Val and Miguel
               slide sideways till they're beneath the hatch, then use the
               shelves as a ladder, climbing up to the hatch.  Val pounds on
               it frantically.

               In the middle of the store, Rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf,
               trying to get closer to where Val is.  Soon she reaches the
               last one, balancing precariously.  But a creature tips over
               the first one!  The shelves topple like dominoes, crashing
               toward Rhonda.  She is half catapulted, half jumps right
               through an open window, ripping through the screen.

               Val sees what's happened.  With maniacal strength he smashes
               open the hatch and climbs out onto --

               Val rushes to the edge of the roof shouting:

               He looks down where Rhonda fell.  She's not there.  He hears
               a whistle and is relieved to see:

               Rhonda is perched as high as she can get on the water tower
               near Pham Van's.  It's maybe twenty-five feet tall, a simple
               wood frame holding a big galvanized tank.  The wooden legs
               stand on big concrete anchors buried in the ground.

               Melvin peers terrified out the shed door, up at the guys on
               Pham Van's roof.

               It's too late.  Wham!  A creature strikes.  The little shed
               shudders, dust puffing from every old seam.  In a split
               second Melvin has climbed to the shed roof.

               Nancy and Mindy peer to the window, surprised to see the men

               The store shakes and shimmies.  We hear the monster's
               thunderous crashing from below.

               Burt and Heather's place, about a mile from town, is no-
               nonsense, functional, ugly -- unpainted concrete walls, no
               yard, chain-link fence.  Burt and Heather drive up in their
               big Blazer and park right beside the house.  Hot and tired,
               they climb out, each carrying a heavy, scoped hunting rifle.
               Burt peers toward Perfection through binoculars during:

               The town is a very strange sight.  It's as though an
               invisible flood were in progress, driving people to high
               ground.  We see: Rhonda perched on the water tower; Val, Earl
               and Miguel on the store roof; Nancy and Mindy on their roof;
               Melvin on the storage shed; Nestor on his roof.

</b>
               Val, Earl and Miguel gaze out at the town, trying to concoct
               a plan.   Suddenly Earl perks up.  The men speak softly.

<b>                                          EARL
</b>                            Hey, here's the plan: Nestor's
                            Cadillac.  His tires are nine
                            hundred sixteens.  We sprint for
                            it, grab the spare, put it on our

               Val stares at him, incredulous.

               Suddenly, down in the store, Pham Van's CB radio squawks
               loudly.

<b>                                          BURT (V.O.)

               The building shudders as the creatures again smash through
               the floor inside, looking for the source of the noise.  Val,
               Earl and Miguel scramble to the edge of the roof.

               The CB radio sits on a shelf near an open window.  Tentacles
               are feeling along the wall just below it.  Val appears out-
               side the window -- upside-down.  He snatches the radio and is
               hauled straight up out of frame.

               Miguel and Earl haul Val by the feet back up onto the roof.
               Val quickly turns down the CB volume.

               A peculiar cross between bomb shelter and blue-collar den,
               Burt's wood-paneled basement has all the comforts for post-
               Apocalypse living.  Burt talks on his CB.

               A few feet away Heather works at their ammunition reloading
               bench.  She dumps a few hundred empty cartridge cases into a
               case cleaner and switches it on.  It HUMS loudly as it
               vibrates.

               The groping tentacles swiftly suck back below the floor.
               TILT UP to see out the window some distance away, a couple of
               old trash cans topple over as the creature streaks past
               beneath them, making a bee-line for Burt's.

               Hearing that warning, Burt and Heather go into a well-honed
               drill.  They grab their hunting rifles and take positions at
               basement windows.  Burt scans with the binoculars.  He sees
               nothing.  He glances at Heather.  She shrugs.  Nobody coming.

               Val is frantic.  How do you explain these things?

               Burt and Heather exchange looks.  Has Val gone nuts?  Then
               they hear a low RUMBLE, growing louder and louder.  Tools
               hanging over the work bench start to shake; the decorative
               cow skulls on the wall rattle; the overhead lights sway --
               and then -- everything stops.  Dead silence, except for the
               humming of the case cleaner.

               THEN THE WALL MOVES!!  The wood paneling bulges slightly.
               Nails pop out.  The wall is pushed again; the paneling
               cracks.  A cow skull falls.  Burt and Heather level their
               rifles and --

               A huge creature pushes right through the wall!  Fully half
               its bulbous, spiked body writhes into the center of the
               room, great multi-part jaws drooling open, hook-tentacles
               lashing out.

               The CB goes dead.  The men stare numbly.  Then, drifting
               across the desert, a soft popping sound.  The men perk up;
               they know what it is -- distant gunfire.

               The gunfire is DEAFENING as Burt and Heather blast away.
               Globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds, and the creature
               pulls back a little.  The couple keeps firing until magazines
               are empty.  The creature lunges forward again.

               haven't seen until now -- a wall <u>covered</u> with guns -- hand
               guns, long guns, riot guns, flare guns, antique guns,
               military guns, elephant guns.

               Heather grabs an HK-91 assault rifle, slams in two magazines,
               bottoms taped end to end, and opens fire!  A hook-tentacle
               snags her boot, yanking her right off her feet.  Burt pumps
               out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun,
               severing the tentacle.  Heather is on her feet in an instant.
               She expertly flops her double magazine over, loading the full
               one taped upside-down to it, and opens fire again.  Burt
               grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins her.  They lay down
               massive fire, virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and
               smoke.  Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the
               room.

               The guns are empty.  THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING!  They back
               down the wall, desperately grabbing weapons one after
               another: a lever-action, a magnum handgun, even a flare gun
               which Heather fires right into the creature's mouth.
               Shrieking in pain, the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING
<b>               TOWARD THEM!
</b>
               Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something
               between them and it.  Burt smashes open a fancy glass case
               holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun.  He slams in two
               gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter.  He fires.
               The concussion literally shakes the building.  The recoil
               slams Burt back against the wall.

               The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster.  Great
               gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or
               something.  The beast convulses grotesquely, then collapses,
               deflating like a beached whale.  Burt and Heather stagger
               together and hug each other fervently.  They stare dumbfounded
               at the massive dead horror.  Burt suddenly shouts vehemently:

               Burt and Heather peer from their fortress-like roof.  Burt
               spots earth bulging up near the foundation of his house.

                            One second, Val.

               He grabs the elephant gun and takes two well-aimed shots --
               two deafening BOOMS which echo off the distant mountains.
               But the bullets bury themselves harmlessly in the dirt.  The
               bulge in the dirt moves calmly away and sinks from view.
               Heather shakes her head.

               The men are disappointed.  That's not what they wanted to
               hear from Burt.  Then Earl perks up and grab the CB mic.

               But Rhonda interrupts, pointing urgently from the water
               tower.

                            something.

               Val, Earl and Miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look
               down where she's pointing --

               A creature is running its tentacles along the building's
               foundation.  It's a strange, more studied movement than we've
               seen before.

<b>                                          VAL

               They all stare nervously down as the tentacles feel their way
               along the wall, moving toward a corner of the building.
               Suddenly Miguel spots something down the next wall.

</b>                            Hey, there's another one coming!

               Another set of tentacles is feeling along the adjacent wall.
               The two creatures meet at the corner, their tentacles touch-
               ing rather like ants' antennae.  They they submerge; tenta-
               cles zipping into the earth.  Nothing happens for a moment.

               Then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple
               of feet.  Clapboard siding splits.  A warped window shatters.
               (We don't see the creatures, only the effect of their shoving
               from below).  The men nearly lose their balance.  Then the
               corner sinks back down.

               Nancy and Mindy are still huddled on the roof.  They don't
               make a sound.  They're startled when the house suddenly
               groans and tilts as creatures give it a tentative shove.
               Nancy and Mindy frantically cling to the peak of the smooth
               roof.  The picture windows shatters.  We hear beams POP and
               CRACK, dishes CRASH off shelves.  The front screen door
               swings open.  At last the house slowly settles back down.

               The roof warps, Spanish tiles shatter and rain down on the

               This causes a flurry of activity.  Tentacles snake around

               A hump of dirt raises near the base of the house.  Burt jerks
               the rifle to his shoulder and squeezes off a shot.  The hump
               moves away from the house.

                            be dead long before you get back.

               Still moving away, the hump of dirt passes under the side-
               walk, rippling the flagstones gently.

                            together!  Now!

               The hump of dirt passes under Burt and Heather's truck,
               rocking the vehicle slightly.

                            get everybody.  Just hang on tight.

               The truck's security alarm starts BOOPING!  Burt and Heather
               stare down helplessly as the noisy truck is furiously
               attacked by the frenzied creatures.  Dust flies as metal rips
               and tires shred.

               Val Earl and Miguel listen in disbelief to the distant truck
               alarm.  It finally sputters and dies.

<b>                                          HEATHER (V.O.)
</b>                            Val, we're going to have to forget

                            Yeah, Heather, we got you.

               They've hit rock-bottom.  They sit in helpless, desperate
               silence.

               Over on the storage shed roof, Melvin is losing it:

               Miguel nods in agreement.  Val and Earl stare at him,

               Val just stares at her.

               Then -- CRASH!  The store shudders, creaks, and groans.  The
               creatures are back.  One corner of the store lifts up, beams
               splintering.  Then another corner lifts up!  The roof tilts
               like the deck of a storm-tossed ship.  From now on the
               monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly.
               Hanging on tight, the men peer over the edge.

               Val glares at him.  Earl's obviously determined.

                            Ready when you are, Miguel!

               Earl positions himself, nervous as hell, ready to leap at the
               right moment.

               Miguel leans out precariously and pulls the tractor's starter
               cord.  Nothing.  On the second try it starts.  He slams it
               into gear and sends it out toward open desert.  The store
               shakes under Miguel, almost knocking him off the window sill,
               as two humps of dirt pursue the noisy tractor.

               A "spout" of dust erupts near the foundation as the creature
               beneath zooms away toward the new sound.  Nancy whispers:

               The CB radio squawks:

               Earl is poised to leap.  Val steps up and slaps him on the
               back.

               Val instantly elbows Earl hard in the stomach.  As Earl
               doubles over, Val springs off the edge of the roof.

               We see Val running for all he's worth -- and there's the
               bulldozer at the edge of town a <u>long</u> way away.

               Val charges across the vast open area that separates him from

               Val's crunching boots seem incredibly loud in the sudden

               totally out in the open, halfway to the bulldozer.  Should he
               run back or go forward?  He decides to go for the bulldozer.

               All four creatures are now heading for Val.  INTERCUT four

               Val hears her and stops dead.  So do the creatures.  Maybe
               twenty feet away, their giant snouts poke up out of the
               ground: one, two, three, four.  Val stands trembling.  The
               creatures softly shuffle back and forth, searching blindly
               for him, hook-tentacles feeling everywhere.  One tentacle
               sweeps toward Val's boot.  He manages to lift his foot just
               in time, letting the tentacle pass beneath it.  He balances
               precariously like a flamingo.

               Rhonda kicks and shouts.  But it's obvious they need some-
               thing louder.  She spots the aging outlet pipe coming from
               the water tank.  Bracing herself, she kicks at it with both
               feet.  It finally gives way at a rusted joint.  A torrent of
               water blasts out, thundering into the dirt.

               A mass of tentacles and snouts swirl through the big puddle

               The water tower is starting to tilt seriously.  Water spills
               over the top edge of the tank, drenching Rhonda.

               Val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to
               jerry-rig a hitch to the semi trailer.   Now he scrambles
               back into the driver's seat.  He guns the engine, wrenching
               the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds.
               Ancient tires disintegrate.  Rusted wheels screech and
               complain -- but it moves.  Val lets out a whoop and heads
               full-tilt for town.  He's suddenly shocked as he sees:


<b>         148   EXT.  WATER TOWER - DAY                                      148

               Rhonda's in big trouble.  She scrambles to the high side of
               the tower platform.  The tower's going to tip over at any
               moment!  It's roof slides off and crashes into the street!

               On Pham Van's, Miguel and Earl are tearing apart the swamp
               cooler, throwing pieces of it off the roof, trying to
               distract the creatures, but they can't compete with the noise
               from the water.

               In BG the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed --
               an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour.

               The tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose,
               sliding off its platform, nearly carrying Rhonda with it.
               She ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank
               splatters like an enormous egg below, sending a small tidal
               wave down the street.

               The remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty-five
               degrees.  The bulldozer grinds closer and closer.  Rhonda
               tries to climb up, but the jostling and shuddering of the
               tower keeps her dangling precariously.  Suddenly she falls!

               And lands in the dirt.  The creatures zero in on her!  She
               turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching
               bulldozer.  The blade is only inches off the ground but Val
               swiftly raises it, lifting Rhonda high into the air just
               above the grasping tentacles!

               As Rhonda climbs down into the cab, Val heads the bulldozer
               over to Pham Van's and stops.  Almost as soon as he does,
               creatures attack, a frenzy of tentacles grabbing at all sides
               of the massive earth-moving machine, slithering into the
               treads.  Val and Rhonda watch this nervously as Earl and
               Miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective
               steel belly of the semi trailer.

               Val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer
               roaring forward.  It effortlessly tears loose from the
               tentacles, grinding one to pulp in its treads.  The creature
               shrieks in pain.  The humans cheer!  At last they've got the
               upper hand!

               The flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature
               roars up inside.  The walls buckle out.  The whole structure
               sags.  Melvin scrambles to peak of the roof.

               As the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed, the
               walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a
               pancake.  Melvin has lost all self control and just keeps
               screaming.  Val pulls along side, jumps down onto the tread,
               and reaches out to Melvin.  But just as they join hands, the
               creature hits the roof from beneath, dragging it several
               feet.  Val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with Nelvin
               on the roof!

               The creature slams into the roof repeatedly, but the
               corrugated metal is both light and resilient.  It bends, but
               the frustrated monster can't get enough "bite" to tear
               through it.  Val and Melvin straddle the peak of the roof,
               trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up, buckling like a
               bronco.

               Earl scrambles into the bulldozer driver's seat and heads
               after them at full throttle, the big diesel roaring.

               Melvin and Val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer, but just
               before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like
               some mad flying carpet, carried from beneath by a creature!
               Val hangs on like a rodeo rider, struggling to keep fear-
               crazed Melvin from tumbling off.

               The roof zigs and zags, spins and twists.  Melvin and Val
               won't be shaken loose.  Earl does his best to head it off,
               but it's hard to predict which way the roof will scoot next.

               The rood careens alongside the edge of a dirt-walled drainage
               ditch, then suddenly skitters sideways and plunges over the
               edge.  Melvin and Val tumble to the bottom.  As they jump to
               their feet:

               Val sees, almost right above them, an exposed pipe which
               spans the ditch.  He shoves Melvin toward it.  They leap up
               and grab the pipe, pulling their legs up as high as they can.
               An instant later, the creature blasts through one wall of the
               ditch, roars past beneath them and burrows into the opposite
               wall!

               Earl brings the bulldozer to a thundering stop next to them.

               Nancy and Mindy huddle together on their roof.  The upraised
               scoop blade of the bulldozer comes INTO SHOT with Val riding
               it.  He helps them step across into it.

               Burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical
               pipe to which his TV antenna was anchored.  Heather works
               with the sections Burt has already cut off.  She is filling
               them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering
               the ends shut -- they're making bombs.

               Then they hear rumbling.  What is it, more creatures?  They're
               surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption
               approaching.

                            God damn!  Armored transport!

               Val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so he's about even
               with Heather and Burt.  A creature occasionally slams into the
               underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer, rocking them
               slightly, throwing up clouds of dust.

<b>                                          VAL
</b>                            Let's go you two.  We're headed for
                            the mountains.

</b>                            In a minute.

               He grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse.  He cuts off a
               length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs
               during:

<b>                                          VAL
</b>                            Come on, Burt, we can't hold still
                            long.  They're damn smart and
                            getting smarter by the minute.

               Burt hefts the finished bomb.

<b>                                          BURT
</b>                            That's fine.  We've got some new
                            things to teach them.

                            just like a boat!

               Just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways, creatures
               digging dirt away beneath it.  Earl guns it forward out of
               the depression they're making.

                            still.

               Burt and Heather are impressed.  They rush around the
               rooftop, gathering food, ammo, guns, the finished bombs,
               handing them to impatient Val who hands them down to people
               in the semi trailer during:

                            way, right?

               He holds up to rifles to Heather, the HK91 assault rifle and
               another elephant gun.

<b>                                          BURT

                            carry anyway.

               Burt nods.  Everyone on the bulldozer and semi trailer shouts:

                            Let's go!

               Dust flies up.  The bulldozer tilts.  Earl guns it forward
               again.  Heather and Burt grab a few more things and leap down
               into the semi trailer.

               Earl pilots the strange looking contraption out into the
               desert.  Burt and Heather watch their fortress-home recede.

               The bulldozer easily lumbers along the really rough road we
               saw Val and Earl's truck struggle over the other morning.

               As they come closer we see Burt and Heather riding "shotgun,"
               he sitting out in the bulldozer's scoop, she on the rear of
               the semi trailer, elephant guns at the ready.  Val, Earl and
               Rhonda are in the cab.

               It's late afternoon, sun casting dramatic shadows across the
               beautiful desert.  We are WIDE on the bizarre vehicle,
               resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs, nearing
               the mountains ahead.

               As they scan the desert, the people are feeling like they may
               get out of this after all.  Earl calls back to the people in
               the semi trailer.

               As they top a gentle rise, Burt excitedly points ahead.

               Everyone cheers.  But then Heather points up ahead to one

               Earl shoves the throttle all the way.  The engine screams.

               We MOVE IN through the cloud of dust.  Dirt is flying by the
               ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground.  A huge
               mound of the tunneled-out dirt is already piled high.  The
               creatures are digging a tunnel -- but why?

               We watch the bulldozer rumbling along.  It seems unstop-
               able.  The mountains and safety are barely a mile away --

<b>               INTO AN UNSEEN PIT DUG JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE!

               The machine ends up half-buried at a steep angle.  The semi
               trailer is right on the edge of the pit.  Everyone is shaken,
               bruised, bloodied.  Val, Earl and Rhonda look frantically for
               Burt, who was riding out front in the scoop.  They're
               relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit.  Val hauls
               him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer.
               As they come to rest, Val slowly realizes what's happened.

               The idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies.  There is a
               moment's crushing silence.

               Then the dreaded digging begins.  Dust boils up around the
               semi trailer -- creatures digging from below!  The semi
               trailer shakes and shudders, slowly sinking.  The people
               huddle together in sheer panic.  Val and Earl grab the
               nearest of Burt and Heather's guns and fire wildly, hope-
               lessly, down at the dirt.  Ricochets whine into the distance.

               Burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his
               pipe bombs.  He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the
               fuse, looking for a target.

               He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into

               creatures.  The semi trailer instantly stops shaking.  The
               creatures have stopped digging.  All is quiet.

               The people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer, looking
               all around.  Then:

               with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like
               soldiers out of a trench -- they charge across no-man's-land.

               Melvin runs like a demon.  He tries to shoot at the first
               thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over -- empty.

               Enraged, he doubles his speed, trying to overtake Burt.

               Mindy can't keep up.  Nancy tries to pull her along.  Val and

               Big slabs jutting this way and that -- a rock iceberg in a
               sand ocean.  The people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy
               and relief.  Melvin charges up to Burt:

               Burt's line gets a laugh from people, but then tentacles
               burst up on all sides of the rock, probing, feeling.  The
               effect is instantly sobering.  Burt swiftly grabs out his
               remaining bombs -- six of them -- and holds one ready.  But
               they're in no immediate danger.

               The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val, Earl,

               Everyone stares in surprise at normally quiet Nancy.

               There's a long, grim silence.  Everyone sits glumly.
               Finally, Burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it:

               In the open desert, a rock lands.  Then another.  Val and
               Rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop.

               Val, Earl, Rhonda, and Burt have moved away from the main
               group to another section of the rock outcrop where
               intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion.

               Earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of Burt's
               knapsacks.  Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way
               behind a ledge.  Meanwhile, Val and Rhonda keep throwing
               rocks.  Soon, the ground shifts.

               Burt has his coil of fuse.

               Burt nods, expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and
               snipping it off.  As he stuffs it into the bomb:

                            My cannon.

               The bomb is ready -- it's moment of truth.  Earl digs in his
               pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it.  Val nervously
               leans over to light the fuse, but then frowns as he sees how
               Earl is holding the rope.

               Val shakes his head and lights the fuse.  Earl whirls the
               bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso, and lets it fly out
               as far as he can.  Then he starts pulling it back in along
               the ground like a fishing lure.  Rhonda stares at her watch
               as they all sink down behind the protective boulder.

               Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb.  A
               tense two seconds later -- KABOOOM!  Bullseye!  It's a
               volcano of gory creature parts.  They splatter all over!  The

                            didn't wise up.

                            Nope, there!  That's one.

               Rhonda shakily lights the fuse.  Val heaves the bomb out and
               starts trolling.  The creature swallows it.  Everyone drops
               down behind the boulder, Val impulsively grabbing a second
               bomb. They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature
               suddenly <u>spits</u> <u>its</u> <u>bomb</u> <u>back</u> <u>out</u>!  It sails back right over
               their heads.  It strikes the rocks above them, skittering
               down a crevice and landing in -- BURT'S PILE OF BOMBS!

               Val, Earl, and Rhonda scatter.  Burt dives backward over a
               rock ledge.

               BABABAMMM!!  All the bombs explode, throwing rocks every-
               where.  The creatures streak away.  Val, Earl and Rhonda
               sprawl into the dirt, half stunned.

               When the panic is over, Val and Earl realize where they are --
               fifty yards out in open desert!  So is Rhonda, off at an
               angle from them!  Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop.

               And the creatures are coming back fast!

               The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop, but the
               creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhonda's
               path, the other two cutting Val and Earl off!  The creatures
               roar toward their easy prey!

               Val and Earl freeze.  The ground bulges as the creatures
               "skid" to a halt not ten feet from them.  Rhonda stands stock
               still some fifty feet away, eyeing her own creature.

               Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather
               sizes up the situation.

</b>                            Make noise.  Everybody!  COME ON!

               Everyone starts hopping up and down, yelling, screaming, and
               clapping.  Burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks,
               firing a pistol into the dirt.

<b>                                          BURT

</b>
               The crowd keeps up the ruckus.  The creatures are distracted
               by the noise, but <u>this</u> time they don't automatically go after
               it.  Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that.
               But they just stay where they are.  Their hook-tentacles
               slide out, feeling all around.  Earl whispers:

<b>                                          EARL
</b>                            They're not falling for it!

               Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun.

               But before she can fire, the creatures mysteriously sink from
               view.  Val, Rhonda, and Earl remain frozen.  What the hell is
               going on?  Nothing happens -- then --

               A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda.  It sinks
               back down as fast as it appeared.  It's like the creature
               suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then
               submerged again.  Another hump rises and falls right near Val
               and Earl.  There's a pause as the men whisper:

<b>                                          VAL
</b>                            They're...they're trying to make us
                            move!

</b>                            Or just knock us over.  Look, use

                            them all.

               The creatures try another random "barrage" of humps, some
               coming perilously close.  They know they'll eventually topple
               their prey.  One comes so close to Val and Earl that pebbles
               roll down its sides into their boots!

</b>                            So, we get back on that rock and in
                            three days we're dead anyway.

                            I want to live for the three days.

               More humps rise and fall.  Val gives in.  He signals Rhonda,
               gesturing with the bomb.  She understands.  He'll set it off,
               driving away the creatures, and they'll all run back to the
               outcrop.

               Val digs for the lighter.  Doesn't have it.  Earl digs for
               it, too.  But <u>he</u> doesn't have it either!  They go dead pale.
               How can that be?  They look across fifty feet of deadly open
               ground -- trembling <u>Rhonda</u> holds up the lighter!

               Over on the outcrop, Burt shouts:

<b>                                          BURT
</b>                            What's wrong?  Use the bomb, for
                            Godsake!

               Val signals to Rhonda to throw the lighter.  She nods.  But
               just before she does, A HUMP STARTS RISING DIRECTLY UNDER
               HER!  She fights to keep her balance -- struggling to keep
               from taking that single step which will instantly tell the
               creatures where she is.

               But there's no hope.  The hump jerks higher.  Her boots slip
               down the gravelly side!  Instantly the creature twists toward
               her, its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt.  She screams
               and dashes for Val and Earl.  They run to meet her.  The
               other creatures surface.  The trio is cut off from the rock
               outcrop!

               Val and Earl link up with Rhonda and they all run madly while
               Rhonda tries to light Val's bomb fuse.  But suddenly Val
               yanks the bomb away.

               He veers off in a new direction.  Startled Earl and Rhonda
               have no choice but to follow.  As they desperately try to
               catch up to Val:

               Earl looks up ahead.  They're headed right for --


<b>         169   EXT.  THE CLIFFS - DAY                                       169
</b>
               The massive cliffs.  Earl's eyes bug out.  In seconds they'll
               be right at the brink with nowhere to run.

</b>                            This better be one great plan!

               As they skid to a stop at the very brink, Val breaks off the
               bomb fuse, leaving only one inch of it.  He whirls to check
               the progress of the advancing creatures.

               He holds the bomb out to Rhonda.  She instantly tries to
               light it.  He grabs her wrist so hard it hurts.

</b>                            Not yet, not yet...

               The charging creatures are almost underfoot.  Finally Val
               pulls Rhonda's hand over to light the fuse.  Instantly he
               hurls the bomb as far as he can, <u>behind</u> the creatures.

</b>                            Too far!  You threw it behind them!

               The ground opens under their feet!  Tentacles snake toward
               Val and Earl.  A horrid mouth clamps onto Rhonda's boot.  She
               screams as it starts to pull her down.

               WHOOOM!!  The bomb explodes!  The creatures shriek in pain,
               instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the
               painful shock wave in the only direction they can --

               <u>Right</u> <u>out</u> <u>through</u> <u>the</u> <u>face</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>cliffs</u>!!  The huge,
               shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid-air for a moment,
               their grotesque bodies undulating in pain.  And then they
               fall!  And fall and fall -- a thousand feet!

               The creatures land on massive jagged rocks, exploding like
               immense, horrid watermelons.  Multi-colored gore festoons the
               whole cliff face.

               TILT UP to see three tiny figures standing at the top of the
               cliff.

               Val peers down at the distant creatures for a long time.  Then
               he notices Earl and Rhonda are staring at him.  Where the <u>hell</u>
               did he get an idea like that?  After a moment:

               They turn and head back toward the others.  They laugh as
               they realize how stealthily they are walking.  Val starts
               taking big, exaggerated stomping steps.  Rhonda and Earl
               follow suit.  The trio goes off arm in arm, stomping merrily.

               Val and Earl roll two scavenged truck wheels down the street
               toward their own truck; which is up on jacks, two wheels

               An awkward pause.  Finally she extends her hand to them.  Val

<b>                                          EARL
</b>                            You're not civil, you're glum.  We
                            got the world by the tail with a
                            downhill pull and all of a sudden
                            you go glum on me.

               Earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            Oh my God.  She got to you.  You <u>do</u>
                            like her!

</b>                            Somebody paying you to do this?

<b>                                          EARL
</b>                            She just practically asked you for
                            a date.  What the hell is wrong?!

               Val glares at Earl for a moment.

<b>                                          VAL
</b>                            Earl, get real.  What does she need
                            with a guy like me?

               Earl is dumbfounded.

<b>                                          EARL
</b>                            What was that?  All this time she's
                            not good enough for you.  Now,
                            suddenly, you're not good enough for
                            her?  God, my work is never done.
                            <u>You</u> don't decide is you're
                            worthless, <u>she</u> does.  But you gotta
                            give her a chance!

               Val lowers the jack letting the truck down.

<b>                                          VAL
</b>                            Earl, I'm not gonna make a fool of
                            myself!  You got that covered.

               Earl stands there fuming, mind racing.  A last ditch idea
               hits home -- we see a devilish glint in his eye.

<b>                                          EARL
</b>                            Fine, make the mistakes I did.
                            I think I'll just be playing this
                            hand myself.

</b>                            She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both
                            helped her out.

<b>                                          VAL
</b>                            You are so full of shit...

                            ain't as narrow-minded as you.
                            I'll lay odds she's looking for
                            character in a man.  For my part,
                            I'd be proud to have her.  I'd
                            goddamn worship her.

               Earl hops into the truck.

                                          EARL (cont'd)
                            I'm going out there right now, help

                            seismo-jiggers.  Whatever she
                            wants.  Who the hell <u>knows</u> what'll
                            happen?

               Earl starts to drive off.  Val springs into the passenger
               seat.  Through the truck's rear window we see Val raise his
               hand in The Challenge.  They do a round of scissors-rock-
               paper -- but it's a tie.  They go again.  Another tie.  They
               keep playing and tying as they drive off into the distance
               and we --
