The ambitious Eve Harrington gets close to the great and temperamental stage artist Margo Channing and her friends Karen Richards and her husband, the play-writer Lloyd Richards; her boyfriend and director Bill Simpson; and the producer Max Fabian.
Everybody, except the cynical critic Addison DeWitt, believes that Eve is only a naive, humble and simple obsessed fan of Margo and they try to help her.
However, Eve is indeed a cynical and manipulative snake that uses the lives of Margo and her friends to reach her objectives in the theater business.
