Broadway legend Margo Channing, aging but not gracefully, has everything: a successful career, close friends, a man who loves her.
She also has a 'fan' named Eve Harrington, who manages to worm her way into Margo's life, in order to "study her like a blueprint".
Eve's sweet facade is soon seen through by a number of people, most quickly by theater critic Addison deWitt, who decides to become her mentor.
Eve achieves her goal of Broadway stardom, leaving a trail of unhappiness, but ultimately contentment, behind her.
