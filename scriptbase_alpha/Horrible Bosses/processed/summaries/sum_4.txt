Nick, Dale and Kurt are three ordinary guys who work different jobs and deal with abusive bosses.
Nick works in a financial firm for Dave Harken, who after suggesting to Nick that he is in line for a major promotion, ends up awarding the position to himself.
Dale is a dental assistant and is engaged, but his boss, Dr. Julia Harris, threatens to tell his fiancee that they had sex unless he actually agrees to have sex with his own boss.
Kurt enjoys his job, but after his boss, Jack Pellitt, dies, his cocaine-addicted son, Bobby, takes over, and threatens to fire Kurt unless he fires a few other coworkers that he simply wants gone.
In such rough economic times, quitting is not a viable solution, so the trio eventually decide they would be better off if their bosses were gone... permanently.
With the aid of a so-called "murder consultant", the trio devise a plan to kill their bosses in a way that they don't get caught.
However, things don't go according to plan, and the trio find themselves running from the law, and for their own lives.
