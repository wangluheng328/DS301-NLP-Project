Nick (Jason Bateman), Kurt ('Jason Sudekis'), and Dale ('Charlie Day') are three ambitious friends whose main thing they have in common is that each one's daily grind is more horrifying than the next.
Nick is a financial analyst who's in line to become an executive at his firm.
Unfortunately Nick works for Dave Harkin (Kevin Spacey) who's an abusive, controlling, and manipulative psychopath who's out to make Nick's life miserable.
Kurt had a job working for a family owned chemical company run by Jack Pellit - a boss he really liked ('Donald Sutherland') but unfortunately Pellit dies and leaves the company to his unhinged, intolerable, cocaine abusing son Bobby ('Colin Farrell') who threatens to run the company into the ground and squeeze every last cent of profit from it he can.
Dale is a dental assistant and wants nothing more than to get married and be a loving and supportive husband - and that dream is about to come true.
But his sexually harassing boss Julia (Jennifer Aniston) makes things difficult when she threatens to tell Dale's girlfriend that they slept together.
The three hate their jobs but quitting isn't an option in this economy.
Thankfully with the help of several beers and a hustling ex-con (Jamie Foxx), they devise a seemingly foolproof plan to off their bosses and make it look like an accident.
Unfortunately the most fool proof plans are only as good as the "brains" behind them.
