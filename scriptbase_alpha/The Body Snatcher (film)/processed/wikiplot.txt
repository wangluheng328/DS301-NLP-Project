The year is 1871 in Edinburgh.
A mother stands in mourning over her little son's grave.
A medical student, Donald Fettes, reassures her that her son's body is secure in its final resting place.

Mrs. Marsh visits the house of Dr. MacFarlane.
She is seeking a cure for her daughter Georgina, who is paralyzed from the neck down.
Dr. MacFarlane calls upon Fettes, one of his students, to examine the girl and see what can be done.
Afterward MacFarlane suggests surgery for the girl, but he cannot perform the operation himself because his teaching position disallows the practice of medicine.
Mrs. Marsh is devastated by this.

Later that night, Fettes confesses to the doctor that he is forced to give up his medical studies because of lack of funds.
The doctor offers Fettes a job as a lab assistant to help with an experiment he is planning.
The doctor also confides to Fettes that not every cadaver that is dissected by him or the students comes directly from the local morgue.

Fettes is awakened in the middle of the night by a loud pounding on the door.
It is John Gray, a local taxi driver by day and grave robber by night, who has arrived to deliver another corpse to the doctor.
It is the body of a young boy.

The next day, Fettes is strolling near the cemetery when he sees the same woman in mourning that he met earlier.
The woman is carrying a dead guard dog that had been watching over her son's grave.
Fettes feels remorse and regrets his involvement in the procurement of cadavers.
He gives a letter of resignation to MacFarlane, but the doctor refuses to accept it.
The doctor claims that experimenting on human specimens is utterly necessary for the progress of medical science.

MacFarlane and Fettes go to the local inn to meet with John Gray.
Gray taunts MacFarlane.
Fettes mentions the case of Georgina Marsh.
Gray mocks the doctor for not performing the surgery, implying that he lacks the skill to do it.
Gray threatens to expose MacFarlane's "dark secret" if he doesn't perform the surgery.
The doctor surrenders to the pressure.

MacFarlane later tries to renege on his promise to perform the surgery, claiming that he lacks an adequate spinal specimen to use for practice.
Fettes remedies this by asking Gray to get another human specimen for the doctor.
While visiting Gray, Fettes gives a coin to a blind street singer.
He is shocked when Gray arrives later at the lab with a corpse that resembles the singer.

Fettes shows MacFarlane the body and accuses Gray of murder.
The conversation is overheard by Joseph, the doctor's other assistant.
MacFarlane tells Fettes that he could be arrested as an accomplice, and advises him not to notify the police.

Georgina recovers from the surgery, but she is still unable to walk.
MacFarlane is tortured by his failure.
He goes to the inn to console himself with drink.
Gray torments the doctor and teases him about their "secret".

Joseph visits Gray and blackmails him, demanding money for his silence about the body snatching operation.
Gray tells Joseph the story of Burke and Hare, two infamous murderers who were hanged for procuring bodies for Dr. Knox, MacFarlane's mentor and predecessor.
When Gray is finished telling his tale, he lunges and strangles Joseph.
Later he delivers the body to MacFarlane's lab as a "gift".
MacFarlane angrily confronts Gray.
Meg, MacFarlane's housekeeper and secret wife, recalls that Gray admitted to robbing graves during the Burke and Hare trial to shield the real perpetrator, MacFarlane.
Meg warns Fettes, and tells him to leave town immediately before he becomes another MacFarlane.

MacFarlane offers Gray money to stop tormenting him and to dissolve their association.
Gray refuses to take the money, and vows that the doctor will never be rid of him as long as he lives.
MacFarlane attacks Gray and the two men struggle.
The doctor beats Gray to death.

Fettes meets with Mrs. Marsh and Georgina.
As Fettes and Mrs. Marsh discuss their disappointment in the result of Georgina's operation, the girl hears horses nearby and stands up to see them; the operation was a success after all.
Fettes rushes to tell MacFarlane the good news, but Meg tells him that the doctor has gone to another town to sell Gray's horse and carriage.

Fettes finds MacFarlane at a tavern in that town.
The doctor tells Fettes that he plans to rob a freshly dug grave.
Fettes sees no alternative than to assist the doctor.
During a terrible storm that night, they commit the deed.
They load the unearthed corpse onto Gray's carriage.

As they drive through the storm, MacFarlane believes he hears the voice of Gray taunting him from the back of the carriage.
He stops the carriage and orders Fettes to check the body.
When he uncovers the body and shines a light on it, MacFarlane sees Gray's corpse.
The horses, spooked by the storm, bolt.
The carriage breaks loose and falls over a cliff with MacFarlane and the corpse.
Fettes looks down at the wreck, and sees the dead body of MacFarlane.
Next to him lies the corpse of a woman.
