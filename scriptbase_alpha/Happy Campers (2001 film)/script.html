                         HAPPY CAMPERS

                         A SCREENPLAY (?)
                         BY
                         DANIEL WATERS (!)











                                                  THIRD DRAFT

                                                  OCTOBER 1998














          NOTE FROM THE PERSON WHO'S PUTTING THIS ONLINE:

          HERE IS AN EARLY DRAFT OF THE SCREENPLAY.
          IT FEATURES A HIKE INSTEAD OF A HURRICANE AND
          A SINGLE GOD-LIKE NARRATOR INSTEAD OF A SERIES
          OF SUBJECTIVE, IN-CHARACTER NARRATORS.  THERE'S
          A LOT MORE PETER STORMARE (OBERON) IN THIS.

          FOR THE ONLINE TEXT VERSION OF THIS EARLY DRAFT,
          ALL "DELETED SCENES" AND "DELETED DIALOGUE" WILL
          BE MARKED WITH RIGHT-MARGIN BRACKETS: ----&gt;                      ]

          DIFFERENCES IN DIALOGUE (REWRITES, ETC), SLIGHT
          CHANGES TO ACTION, LOCATIONS, AND ANY RE-ORDERING
          OR "CHOPPING UP" OF SCENES ARE NOT MARKED AT ALL.

          ALL THAT'S MARKED IS <u>WHAT'S MISSING</u> FROM THE
          FILM AS RELEASED...



















     EXT.   THE LAKE OF THE CAMP--DAY                                      ]
                                                                           ]
     A brief, majestic trek across a placid lake to...discarded            ]

     An unsettling glide through a cabin packed with overflowing           ]
     trunks and torn apart bunks...empty of children.                      ]

     INT.   CAFETERIA--DAY                                                 ]

     A cafeteria looming like a ghost ship, bereft of people,              ]
     but decked out in the gooey remains of a food fight.                  ]

     EXT.   A PATCH IN THE FOREST--DAY

     A tangled weave through a neglected gallery of trees, each
     carved with a heart, + sign, lovers' initials, and an
     apostrophied year.

     EXT.   ANOTHER PATCH OF THE FOREST--DAY

     The viewer dizzys deeper into the woods before emerging into
     a clearing to behold the enigmatic image of SEVEN ACTUAL
     HUMANS-- not boys and girls, not quite men and women--
     aggressively dressed to fit their very different
     personalities. The Humans-in-question stare forward while
     standing upon a log that is balance beamed across a ditch.

                        THE SMOOTH VOICE OF A NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It was the first summer of the 21st
               century. Wendy, Wichita, Talia,
               Donald, Adam, Jasper, and Pixel were
               to spend it as camp counselors. The
               world would be changed forever. Kind
               of. Not really.

     EXT.   CENTER OF CAMP--DAY

     The seven characters are now seen situated atop an array
     of large rocks surrounding a flagpole. They have all been
     straight-jacketed into the same identity-squelching light-
     blue shirt and all hold a glossy booklet that has a cute
     counselor couple and a cuter Camper joyously roasting hot
     dogs on its cover.

     A HARSH MALE VOICE sneers from a loudspeaker atop a small             ]
     structure nearby.                                                     ]
                                                                           ]
                        HARSH LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (O.S.)                     ]
               ...no smoking, no drinking, no                              ]
               climbing the mountain, no cursing,                          ]
               no playing favorites, no sexuality                          ]
               of any possible dimension...                                ]
                                                                           ]
     Irreverently ignoring the harsh voice, the instantly                  ]
     charismatic WICHITA and his overwhelmingly acerbic college            ]
     pal, TALIA, entertain themselves over the workbooklet cover.          ]
                                                                           ]
                        TALIA                                              ]
               Am I the only one disturbed by this                         ]
               cover?  The way counselor's holding                         ]
               his weenie...                                               ]
                                                                           ]
                        WICHITA                                            ]
               ...the way the camper is holding                            ]
               his little bun. Total Kiddie porn.                          ]
                                                                           ]
     An almost painfully adorable fellow counselor, later to be            ]
     revealed as WENDY, turns to give them a Sh-h-h gesture                ]
     causing them to further unmuffle their giggling.                      ]
                                                                           ]
                        HARSH LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (O.S.)                     ]
               ...and to quote the moving words                            ]
               of the workbooklet: "You'll learn                           ]
               the true meaning of responsibility                          ]
               while creating memories that last                           ]
               a lifetime."                                                ]
                                                                           ]
                        WICHITA AND TALIA                                  ]
               Wow.                                                        ]

     Two buses screech up out of nowhere. The counselors jolt
     their skulls toward an opening bus door.

     JUMP CUT

     The viewer pulls out from a T-shirt displaying a crappy mall-
     computer-photo of a Happy Kid to see the SHIRT-WEARING KID
     HIMSELF, clinging to a bus door, WAILING his reddened eyes
     out.  Moving off, one takes in the panorama of rabidly
     freaked-out CAMPERS and beleaguered COUNSELORS.

     Immediately most noticeable is a warped, sparkle-haired fairy
     later to be known as PIXEL, who floats throughout the scene
     sticking different colored band-aids on every camper and
     counselor. Oasis-of-adorability Wendy overgloriously leads
     a seated circle of singing, clapping campers into song.

                        WENDY AND CAMPERS
                    (Frito Bandito tune)
               "Aye-aye-aye-aye, in China they never
               grow chilly, So sing me another verse
               that's worse than the first and make
               sure it's foolish and silly..."

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.)
               Rightly or wrongly, for better or
               worse, the counselors defined
               themselves quickly. No one more so
               than Wendy. First week of camp, the
               perky girl who knows all the rules
               and all the songs is pretty much
               Queen.

     EXT.   THE WOODS--FLASH FORWARD DAY                                   ]
                                                                           ]
     Wendy looks up a wiggling rope, cheering an unseen climbing           ]
     camper. The Camper body SLAMS down out of frame. Wendy aims           ]
     a "Don't give up" cheer downward.                                     ]

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.)
               Wendy's monarchy of relentlessly
               daisy-fresh enthusiasm could not
               possibly last. Or could it?

     EXT.   CENTER OF CAMP--FLASH FORWARD DUSK                             ]

     Wendy is lowering a flag reading DAY 4 while booming out              ]
     a hymn to camp spirit. A semi-circle of other counselors              ]
     stare dumbfounded.                                                    ]

               Uh, Wendy dear, the kids are back                           ]
               in the cabins...                                            ]
                                                                           ]
                        WENDY                                              ]
               Oh please, you silly geese, like                            ]
               you need to be a child to do the                            ]

     Wendy re-blasts into song. Snorting out smiling surrender,            ]
     the other counselors slowly warble along with her.                    ]

     EXT.   CENTER OF CAMP--PRESENT DAY

     The bandaid fairy Pixel adhesives Wendy and the rest of the           ]
     circle. She then flutters over to stick TWO CAMPER BOYS,              ]
     who are both LATINO, but of highly different income brackets.         ]
                                                                           ]

     The Upper Income Spanish Kid detonates in an "Aah" of                 ]
     laughter.  The Lower Income Spanish Kid glumly checks the             ]
     paper and makes a surly exit. Donald comprehends the                  ]
     situation with an agonized body heave. He wallops the                 ]
     clipboard against his forehead then turns to a NASTY GIRL.            ]

                        NASTY CAMPER GIRL
               This camp sucks shit!  A good counselor
               is supposed to know when we eat and
               where are the horses and why--Fu--
               uck!

     A burst of blood pours from the losing-it girl's nose. The
     freaked-out Donald Duck backs away into the flagpole.

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.)
               Donald Dark liked to think of himself
               as a witty, intelligent young man
               trapped in a geek's body.

     Donald claps his hands trying to rouse his volleyball team.           ]
     A ball thunders right into his face. His team bursts into             ]
     laughter. Donald weakly smiles.                                       ]

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.)
               Unfortunately, and Donald Dark had
               known this for years, a witty,
               intelligent young man in a geek's
               body is still a geek.

     EXT.   OUTSIDE BOYS' CABIN--FUTURE NIGHT

     Donald and some other male counselors patrol past some
     cabins, casually wielding flashlights. A SLEEPWALKER GIRL
     shuffles in the background.

                        DONALD
               I had a sleepwalker at my last camp.
               Important thing's not to panic...so
               anyway, like I was saying, once the                         ]
               campers found out my full name was                          ]
               Donald Dark, their brilliant minds                          ]

     girl.  Donald spins away right into Talia. She snickers as            ]
     he scrambles away.                                                    ]

     A Jewish non-princess oozing an urban sharpness, Talia goes
     to light a cigarette. Realizing the potential no-no factor,
     she pockets the cig with a sigh, then notices a SAD LONELY
     GIRL plopped on a rock, backpack against chest.

     With a deep breath, Talia approaches and crouches beside
     the Sad Lonely Girl.

                        TALIA
               You look a like you could use a

     Blossoming, the No-longer-lonely girl gallops off, leaving
     Talia gaping. Talia's buddy Wichita sidles up with a chuckle,
     throwing an arm around the rising-in-defeat Talia. They watch
     No-longer-lonely girl being tucked into the circle of
     handclappers.

               College was entertaining, Wichita,
               but after 40 days and 40 nights of
               this, I really think we're going
               to get to know each...

               Ooh look, time to confiscate my first
               water balloon...

     Wichita dutifully withdraws his arm and bolts off, leaving
     Talia in a contorted dangle. She straightens with an exhale.
     Behind her, a Camper Boy is nailed to the ground by a
     backpack jettisoning from the back of the bus. 

     THE BACK OF THE BUS 

     ADAM, a severely muscular counselor of the fascist mode,

               Like any good fascist, Adam truly
               believed his brand of counseling

     sensitive but subversive JASPER.

               Cinnamon or spearmint or both? 

     The Crying Kid devolcanoes into a sniffle to clasp a gum
     stick magically appearing out of Wichita's hand. Wichita
     gently pushes the boy off and points.

     Wichita struts off. The relaxed Jasper's eyes follow him
     along with a subversively admiring smolder. 

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.)
               Jasper was seemingly shy, but

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.)
               Jasper was the sensitive counselor,
               the one the campers seeked out to
               discuss the biggies. He had an
               uncanny ability to notice pain and
               get it in the open.  "In the open"
               was Jasper's favorite place to be.

               mean-- 

     Suddenly, the Sleepwalk Girl collides into the babbling
     Donald causing him to screech. 

     EXT.   THE CENTER OF CAMP--PRESENT DAY 

     Breaking his concentration, Pixel puts a band-aid on Jasper's
     arm, then whisks forward to stick a SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BOY,
     who immediately explodes into tearful shrieks. Jasper cringes
     at the renewed noise pollution. 

                        SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BOY
               She touched me!  She touched me! 

                        WICHITA
                    (shouting back) 
               Meet Todd!  From our cabin! 

     Jasper laughs. Pixel, meanwhile, flees from the scene of
     the crime to a new area where she resumes her mysterious
     band-aid sticking. 

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.)
               The gung-ho cute counselor...The
               hard-ass control freak...the
               sensitive gay counselor...and then
               there were those who could not be
               glibly categorized. To name 
               one...Pixel. 

     INT.   THE MESS HALL--FUTURE RAINY NIGHT

     A BOOMBOX POUNDS a sultry TECHNO tune. Pixel and the girls
     of the camp have taken shelter in a cafeteria with rain
     battering about outside. A line of girls of different sizes
     and ages are grinding to the music, unbuttoning their jeans.
     The other girls are cheering their heads off, throwing
     quarters at their feet.

                        PIXEL
               Come on, this isn't the hokey-pokey,
               a-che the body...that's it...Let's
               hear some noise out there!  The ladies
               dance for tips and tips only!

                        STRIPPING GIRL                                     ]
               How's this empowering, again?                               ]

                        PIXEL
               No, no, not one arm at a time, grab
               the bottom of the shirt with both
               hands, that's it. Feel the heat...

     Backs turned, the girls tug their shirts up their spines.
     A LOOKOUT GIRL turns from a splattered window.

                        LOOKOUT GIRL
               Wendy!

     Wendy enters the mess hall.  She collapses her soaked umbrella
     to reveal the vision of Pixel in charade mode with the girls
     crumpled together in fake rapture. Wendy frowns suspiciously.

                        CAMPERS
               A movie...two words...first
               word...sounds like...

     Wendy again gives off an uncomprehending stare. This time             ]
     toward Pixel meticulously painting strangely erotic tattoos           ]
     on a line of their cabin's girls.                                     ]

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               Pixel gleefully answered all the
               dirty questions a good counselor
               would uncomfortably ignore. It was
               dangerous to try and figure Pixel
               out. She herself wisely never tried.
               Others would. 

     EXT.   CENTER OF CAMP--PRESENT DAY 

     From a distance, Pixel can be discerned colorfully trotting
     through the grand tableau of first day activity. Back turned
     to the viewer, Wichita steps in before this image. 

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               As strange as Pixel may have seemed,
               the camp's real wild card was
               Wichita.

     Two groups of Campers rip on the same rope in a vicious bout          ]
     of tug of war.  Veins-a-poppin, Adam wails at his team on             ] 
     one side while Wichita calmly traverses next to his group.            ]

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.)
               Here was a someone who did not care
               about workbookleted activities. Here
               was someone who had anarchy in his
               eyes. Here was someone. Period. He
               played it low-key that first week...

                        WICHITA                                            ]

     Wichita's team immediately-giddily lets go of the rope,               ]
     sending Adam's "winning" team into an ugly crash.                     ]

     EXT.   THE BEACH--FUTURE DAY

     Zen amidst a lake of activity, Wichita sits on the pier,
     writing in a brilliantly scruffy journal. 

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR 
               No one could see into Wichita's soul,
               but at least it was clear that he
               had one. He had an effect on
               everyone, even those thought to have
               no feelings...

     In a canoe, being paddled by campers, Wendy looks up from             ]
     a her own diary (pink polka dots) to study the enigmatic              ]
     counselor.                                                            ]

     A VIEW THROUGH BINOCULARS of the Day One panorama. 

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               A collection of individuals separated
               from regular society eventually
               becomes something more than a
               collection of individuals separated
               from regular society. It becomes 
               one mammoth living organism.
               Different traits of different people
               feeding off and flowing into each
               other--the naive and the perverse,
               the brutal and the sweet, the
               overconfident and the overwhelmed--
               all coming together to form one
               singularly special whole. 

     EXT.   OUTSIDE OF OBERON'S OFFICE--DAY

     Binoculars withdraw through venetian blinds in the window
     of the office structure. 

                        SMOOTH NARRATOR (V.O.) 
               An organism made up of 70 screaming
               kids counseled by young adults at
               the most fucked-up point in their
               lives is a monster well worth a
               glance. Welcome to Camp Bleeding
               Squaw. 

     EXT.   THE CENTER OF CAMP--DAY 

     A deafening whistle rattles everyone into a camp-wide flinch.
     All turn to get a view of OBERON, the camp's terrifying,
     fully Full Metal Jacket Camp Director, marching from his
     little fortress, growling into a high-tech headset. 

                        OBERON 
               Campers, welcome to Camp Bleeding
               Squaw!  I'm Big Chief Oberon. Fun. 
               I like it. You think I don't?  I do.
               But Fun without structure is chaos
               and chaos is not fun--Now everybody
               rip off their band-aid! 

     All shapes and sizes of campers (and counselors) reach to
     their bandaged body parts and tear away with the same AAH
     sound. Red, Blue, Green, and Purple dots are revealed upon
     each character's skin. 

                        OBERON 
               Yes!  It has begun!  I declare war!  Color
               War!--all the way to our Fortieth Day! 
               Welcome to the thrill of competition
               and the joy of making others cry. 
               I want Reds here, Greens there, Blue
               across from them and the Purple team
               against the flagpole! 

     A perfect four-section-split of Counselors and Campers
     swiftly surrounds the volcanic camp director. 

                        OBERON 
               This new turn of events brings up
               an interesting question: Who's got
               more Camp pride? 

     With absurd reflex enthusiasm, each side screams out their
     color. Red!  Purple!  Donald turns to Wichita.

                        DONALD
               Something tells me he can't hear us.

                        OBERON
               I can't he--ar you!

                        WICHITA
               Not bad, Donald Dark.

     Both sides screech out their colors even louder. Wendy, eyes
     closed in a religious fervor, leads the Red side. Oberon
     turns, getting off on the manic reverberations behind him. 

                        OBERON
               One more time! 

     There is sudden silence except for the lone shout of Wendy
     bleating out "Red, red, red." Completely mystified, Oberon
     and the viewer spin around to see AN EPILEPTIC GIRL having a
     trembling-on-the-ground fit, unnoticed by the soulfully
     shut-eyed Wendy. 

                        WENDY
               Red!  Red! 
                    (opening her eyes)
               Whoopsy. 

     The African-American SuperCounselor silently rockets down
     to hold and steady her. Everyone else just gapes. 

                        OBERON 
               Haven't you people ever seen an
               epileptic camper before?--
               Counselors, get these Injuns into
               the cabins and then onto the
               Activities!  Fun!  Now!  Move it! 

     Oberon clicks a mammoth stopwatch and shrieks his whistle. 

     EXT.   CAMPFIRE--NIGHT 

     Camp Director Oberon's seething, whistling face slam-cuts
     into the image of a roaring bonfire. Oberon's body reveals
     itself around the inferno, doing a circular storyteller
     stroll.  Huddled and bundled, the campers have settled into
     something approaching paying attention. 

                        OBERON 
               But even more than the taste of
               S'mores, he enjoyed the taste of
               camper flesh. 

                        THE CAMPERS
                    (delightedly sarcastic)
               Ooooh! 

     A COLLECTION OF COUNSELORS 

     stand outside the campfire circle, waging a loudly whispered
     conference, led by Wendy. 

                        WENDY 
               Well, the first week of camp has
               swhooshed on by and I thought this
               a perfect time to finally pow-wow.
               I think we should discuss-- 

                        TALIA 
               We need more ritalin. Can't we just

                        DONALD 
               I'm having "Billy" problems again.
               He turned today's food fight into
               a fork fight.

                        WENDY
               Instead of getting all mad at
               Donald's Tasmanian Devil Billy, have
               you people ever thought of getting
               all <u>glad</u> at him-- making him feel 
               a part of things. The workbooklet

               Don't mean to interrupt, Wendy dear,
               but isn't that the little buckaroo
               eating a sandwich of communion
               hosts...

     ANGLE ON THE CAMPFIRE 

     A feral, dirty-blonde boy, BILLY, is indeed disturbingly
     chomping into a sandwich piled high with communion hosts. 

     THE COUNSELORS 

     laugh, except for Wendy.

               Wendy, I think as a counselor, you

                        WENDY

               Next to "boring," "Sucks" is the
               most painfully overused word in the
               current English language. I thought
               if I could reverse the meaning of
               "sucks" so it means something
               positive, I don't know...It would
               be vaguely revolutionary. It's kind
               of my social experiment for the
               summer. "Suck" is historically a
               nice word-- sno-cones, your

     Turning from the youngsters, Wendy incongruously loses her
     smile, staring down to her hand's insane shorthand. One can
     almost feel the buzzing in her brain. Suddenly, a marshmallow
     she is lazily roasting bursts into flame. She quickly blows
     it out...then slowly, spookily squeezes the burnt marshmallow
     into her scribbled hand, taking the pain. 

     Wichita scans to this strange image. He quickly snatches
     up a blanket and a canteen. He bounds to Wendy and swathes
     her paw as they speak. 

                        WICHITA 
               What in the hell did you do that for?

               I-unno...Don't worry, I had
               everything on the hand memorized. 

                        WICHITA 
               That's not what I was worried about. 

     On the other side of the campfire, Talia squints the flames
     to see Wichita comforting Wendy. She gulps.

     Talia gives off a "You got me" snort/laugh as the campers

     their flashlights to an EVER-LOVELORN CAMPER GIRL, AMBER,

     INT.  THE MESS HALL--NIGHT 

     A seemingly unnoticed SOBBING GIRL sits beside Wichita and
     an unraveling Talia in the completely empty cafeteria.

               check." Or some fucking thing. 

     Talia bolts off, holding in a nervous breakdown. Wichita
     heavily sighs, then looks down to the sobbing girl seemingly
     for the first time. 

                        WICHITA 
               I'm sorry, honey, I completely forgot
               why you're crying...

                        SOBBING GIRL 
               Because BLUBBERING GIBBERISH. 

                        WICHITA 
               Uh, I see. Gum? 

     Wichita produces from his pocket a pack of gum. Instantly
     unweeping, the girl takes the goods and wraps her arms around 
     Wichita's neck. He carries her off.

     EXT.   CENTER OF THE CAMP--THE NEXT DAY 

     An echo of the screams die over the image of Wendy warbling
     a delightful camp tune as she tugs up a flag with the number
     8 on it to the top of the pole. 

     EXT.   BY THE LAKE--DAY 

     Wichita and Adam are jogging-fierce by the lake. 

                        ADAM 
               Can't you just give her a violent
               ugly fuck so she won't bother you
               anymore...

               Talia is one of my best friends,

               voting...

     Wichita and Adam immediately brake to see Pixel do a skinny-
     dip dive off the pier. They deadpan blink until, out of a
     loudspeaker on a nearby tree, the shrill sound of revelry
     fills the air. Pixel cuts off her mermaid-cavorting and the
     guys hit the dirt. 

                        ADAM 
               Talk about flipping the script. That

     INT.  OBERON'S OFFICE--DAY 

     Oberon punches a cassette player button comically cutting 
     off the revelry right in the middle. He snarls into his head-
     set, making a commandant pace of his pristine office with 
     its guidebookshelf and its huge cardboard timetable display.

               Mess Hall.  Nine minutes. Move it! 

     INT.  THE MESS HALL--DAY 

     The entire camp is belting out a Song in somewhat chilling
     unison, clapping hands and stomping feet. They are being
     commandeered by Wendy, who stands on a chair at the front
     of the cafeteria.

     counters with a dazed wave back to her despised nemesis.

     OBERON 

     bulldozes into the Mess Hall, piercing a whistle through
     his megaphone head-set. Everyone straightens into Triumph-
     of-the-Will symmetry. Oberon does an Indian hand-raise.

     Wichita cuts off to stare at Wendy stretch over to a radio. 

     WENDY 

     turns on an energy-sapping, Whitney Houstonesque ballad that
     will haunt our counselors the entire summer. 

                        WENDY 
               I love this song!

     glowers toward her, not unamused.

               I hate this song. 

     Wichita unzips a fanny pack at his waist and begins to tug
     out a water balloon as the boys coo in excitement. He quickly
     re-zips as Wendy turns to him with a look of real affection.
     Wichita is affected by his effect on her. They awkwardly
     wave.

     a water balloon whips past her right into the radio causing
     it to static. The sunbathers shriek. 

     Wendy swerves to the sight of Wichita and the boys cackling
     away. Wendy doesn't know whether to shout in anger or
     amusement. A frog grib-bits at her feet. She smiles. 

     Wichita and the boys continue to whoop it up with intentional
     gold-medal-win exaggeration. Wendy, with the Sunbathing Girls
     as giggling chorus, rushes up and puts a frog down Wichita's
     trunks. 

     Wendy races off. The boys "Whoa!" The girls "Yes!" Wichita
     wrenches the beast out with an impressed chuckle. He narrows
     his eyes to Wendy bounding like a doe into the woods, then
     slowly looks down to the frog. He breaks into a dash.

     EXT.   THE FOREST--DAY 

     Wichita pants into the woods; the crackling bramble at his
     feet and the croaking frog in his hand are the forest's only
     sounds.  Wichita weaves his vision tree to tree trying to
     lock on to his target--he scans a blur of bikini darting
     behind a cedar. He heaves forward.

     An envious Donald and a coed cluster of campers have entered
     into the brush, berating each other with shushing sounds.
     Like one multi-legged beast, they rustle toward Wichita. 

     Wichita swings around a tree (with an ancient heart and
     initials carved upon it) to see Wendy lying in wait against
     the next tree over, seemingly unaware of Wichita's presence
     behind her. 

     As Wichita panthers forward, Wendy bites her lip and closes
     her eyes. Wichita carefully reaches out to the bikini bottom, 
     clenching his teeth, dangling the frog. 

     Catching discreet sight of this strange image, the boys and
     girls slam to a gasping halt. 

     Talia and her hikers, from a ridge above, catch another angle
     of this perverse-act-posing-as-an-all-in-good-fun-prank. 

     Wendy's suit is ever-so-slightly pulled back. Wendy gulps.
     Wichita gulps. The frog moans as it is gently lowered into...

                        OBERON
               What kind of nauseous fucky-fuck
               ritual is this? 

     Almost magically appearing in the middle of the forest,
     snarling through his headset, Oberon sends everyone into
     trembling fear.  Wichita drops the frog to the ground. It 
     hops away.

                        OBERON 
               Wichita...I should have known this
               was going to happen!  Et tu, Wendy?
               And look at all of you, the giddy
               witnesses!  I command a complete camp
               lockdown until <u>dawn</u>!  No one is to
               leave their cabin and no one is to
               say one word about this incident 
               or the entire subject of sexuality
               until I can concoct proper
               punishment!  Move it!

               Call me conservative, but I'd rub
               my penis on the faces of all the
               ladies before bestowing the final
               honors to the divine Ms. Berry's
               lovely visage.

               Yowza--Only a virgin could answer
               that fast.

               It's okay, Donald Dark dude, I'm
               waiting until I find the right girl,
               myself...

                        ADAM 
               "The right girl?" I thought we were 
               talking about sex. Pardon my French,
               the right girl means one avec a
               pussy.  Guys are different. You know
               how a girl feels like a whore if 
               the guy's only in it for the poon.
               What women fail to understand is
               that a man feels equally ashamed 
               if the relationship is based on just
               talking and sharing feelings. 

                        DONALD 
               Do you realize if the women of
               America would have just heard what
               you said...

               They wouldn't be a bit surprised..

     INT.  WENDY AND PIXEL'S CABIN--NIGHT 

     Having crossed the Rubicon of sobriety, the female counselors
     swagger about the cabin acting like males. They have each 
     put something in their pants to create bulges. 

                        PIXEL 
               You know what da problem with women
               is?  They're all bitches. 

                        THE OTHER GIRLS 
               Fu-uck yes...

                        TALIA 
               You know what I hate; a woman says
               yes to going out to dinner wich-you,
               right?  Orders chips and salsa and
               appetizers and shit. Then on the
               way home when you whip it out, she
               gets all...

                        AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPER-COUNSELOR
               I like big-ass titties!

                        TALIA 
               Man, why you dissin' me with your
               non-sequitur bullshit. 

                        AFRICAN-AMERICAN SUPER-COUNSELOR
               Sorry G. Now I ain't going down on 
               no woman. Belly button low as I go. 

                        PIXEL 
               But dude, dude, dude, the babes go
               crazy for dat shit. Especially when
               you're just wiggling your tongue
               all around, having no idea what
               you're doing, without a single clue
               about a woman's body...

     The girls laugh uncontrollably (except for a just-smiling
     Wendy). A banana falls out of Talia's shorts. 

                        TALIA 
               Man asswipe, you made my enormous cock
               fall off...

               juicy dump.

               Wendy, men aren't that disgusting! 

     INT.  WICHITA AND JASPER'S CABIN--NIGHT 

     Donald makes a triumphant re-entry into the cabin to lounge
     upon Jasper's bed. 

                        DONALD 
               That was one of the five great shits
               of my life. You know, when you start
               off with incredible resistance, then
               <u>pow</u>, two, neat packages that you
               barely have to wipe. I need a hug. 

                        BIG STONER LUG 
               Man, I had a Grande yesterday. I
               didn't know whether to flush it or
               put it through college. 

     Finishing a patrol, Jasper huffs into the room, setting down
     his flashlight. There is a moment of awkwardness. Donald
     a-little-too-quickly bounds up from Jasper's bed. 

                        JASPER 
               Oh God...that's it? I'm "the gay guy."
               Every time I walk into a room, 
               everyone is going to...

                        ADAM
               Hey, nobody asked you to be a 
               homosexual. You can't complain about
               being treated gay when you are gay.
               While we're on the subject, do you
               have your Camp physical results? 

                        JASPER 
               The only toxic asshole in this cabin
               is you...Wichita, Wichita, why are
               you hanging around with us clowns,
               when you know you how badly Wendy
               wants to be your wonderwall...

               Gee guy, coming from you,
               that's..disturbing. Wendy and 
               I...come on. I believe in nothing.
               She believes in everything. I listen
               to Reznor, she listens to Barney. 
               I watch...

               entire camp is in quarantine because
               of you two. Now instead of slipping
               in a frog...

               she was a virgin--you know where 
               I'm going with this. 

                        JASPER 
               You are to be executed at Dawn
               anyway.  Might as well commit the
               crime. Go to her, Wichita...

     INT.  WENDY AND PIXEL'S QUARTERS--NIGHT 

     The viewer pulls away from Wendy's incredibly reddening face
     as Pixel and the others go into their own tease-fest. Talia
     makes a sad, UNNOTICED EXIT out the door. 

                        WENDY 
               Me and Wichita?  Don't be ridiculous.
               That guy thinks he's so "alternative"
               with all his brooding and his...He's

     Pixel pulls Wendy up and paws through her hair. The Super-
     Counselor puts a thermos in her hand.

               Wendy, don't be afraid to get a
               little stupid and contagious. The
               kids don't understand that this is
               our summer, too. We shouldn't have
               to put our lives on hold to be their

     Pixel suddenly wrenches the door separating the counselor
     quarters from the rest of the cabin, a cabal of eavesdropping
     girls come toppling out. 

     INT.  WICHITA AND JASPER'S QUARTERS--NIGHT 

     A tangle of boys are sprawled on the ground. Wichita is
     holding the door open. All the boys, except a tugged-up-by-
     Wichita Eric make a break for it. 

                        WICHITA 
               Eavesdropping, eh?  Hear anything good? 

                        ERIC

               Man, it's not like I don't know about

     Adam, and even unfortunately Donald and Jasper erupt into
     cackles. Eric manages a pained stranger-in-a-strange-land
     smile.  Wichita gives him a pat, motioning to the "men".

     to be heading toward the top of the stairs. 

     EXT.   OUTSIDE THE BOYS CABINS--NIGHT 

     Wichita confidently walks right at the viewer. He is revealed
     to be heading toward the bottom of the stairs. 

     ON THE STAIRS 

     Wichita and Wendy face-to-face in the middle of the
     staircase, letting out a drama-deflating laugh. 

                        WENDY

                        WICHITA

               Gimme, gimme...So what you gals talk
               about? 

     They pass the thermos cup/cap back and forth. 

                        WENDY 
               Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance
               of the right to vote...

                        WICHITA 
               Yeah, we talked about sex, too.
               Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.

                    (post-sheepish laughter) 
               We had fun. I even got along with
               Talia-- for about three minutes.
               I don't know why she hates me so

     INT.  MESS HALL--NIGHT 

     Talia sifts through a table of mail, some of it already
     shredded open. She weighs a package in her hand, then rips
     it.  She depressingly devours the brownies inside. 

     EXT.   THE STAIRS--NIGHT 

     Wichita and Wendy are quite cozily seated side-by-side in
     the middle of the staircase. 

                        WENDY 
               Ann Taylor would have paid a lot
               more, but I wouldn't trade this
               experience for the world. Sometimes
               the first time you understand
               anything is when you have to explain
               it to someone younger-- You think
               I'm a big dork don't you? 

                        WICHITA 
               I think your passion is terrific.

                        WENDY 
               I think your condescension is even
               better. 

     Wichita cackles, further nestling against Wendy. They take
     each other's hand. 

                        WICHITA 
               We have more in common than you
               think, Wendy dear. I loved summer
               camp when I was young and I love 
               it now. It's important. Between
               school, family, friends, pot,
               playstations, basic cable, and the
               goddamn Internet, it's possible to
               go your whole life without listening
               to your soul. Out here, in nature,
               away from the shit, surrounded by
               reminders of who I once was...I get
               recharged. Now who's the dork? 

                        WENDY 
               Gosh, this is really a great
               conversation--I can't believe I said
               that out loud. 

                        WICHITA 
               You know, this reminds me of the
               time we were talking about something
               and then just started kissing...

     Wichita and Wendy melt into each other and begin kissing,
     softly-softly, then deeply-deeply. 

     INT.  OBERON'S OFFICE--NIGHT 

     Oberon suddenly awakens. He bounces up from a cot in his
     pristine office and begins violently sniffing. 

     EXT.   THE STAIRS BETWEEN THE CABINS--NIGHT 

     Wendy and Wichita lie back on the landing in the middle of
     the staircase, going into a full-on, side-to-side make-out
     session.  Wichita's hand begins a smooth ascent beneath
     Wendy's shirt.  Wendy breaks off. 

                        WENDY 
               Do you really not believe in God? 

                        WICHITA 
               It's okay, there's a lot of things
               I don't believe in...

     Definitely not in conversation mode, Wichita burrows back
     into Wendy but she winds away again. 

                        WENDY 
               What else don't you believe in? 

                        WICHITA
               Talking while kissing. 

     Thinking he has suavely defused the situation, Wichita swoops
     yet again. Alas, Wendy grimly sits all the way up. 

                        WENDY                                              ]

                        OBERON 
               I'm not against the occasional camp
               romance, but...I can feel
               it...Nocturnal Activities. Little
               rapists and their little whores...Who
               goes there? 

     He raises his mighty flashlight to...Sheila, the Sleepwalker
     in the middle of another eerie somnambulistic trek. Oberon
     sighs, then readjusts his beam...as the Sleepwalker
     shockingly/obliviously drifts by Wichita and Wendy clawing
     each other on the forest floor. 

     Oberon blinks. Oberon howls. Oberon gets hit by lightning.

     FADE TO BLACK 

     Over black, revelry is heard.

     INT.   OBERON'S OFFICE--DAY 

     A painted fingernail presses off the familiar revelry tape.
     Wendy is revealed to be situated in Oberon's office, wearing
     his head-set. Her enthusiasm seems a bit forced. 

                        WENDY 
               Rise and Shine, campers and
               counselors.  Today, unhappiness is
               not an option.  Mess Hall. Nine
               minutes. Please. 

     Wendy removes the head-set with a sigh. As narration kicks 
     in, she drifts over to the office cot where a dazed, scraggly-
     bearded Oberon lies. Wendy begins feeding him oatmeal.

     INT.   WENDY AND PIXEL'S CABIN--MORNING 

     Wendy twitches in restless slumber. 

                        OBERON NARRATION (V.O.)
               The would-be lovers were in pain.
               Their cabinmates were not much
               help...

     Pixel (in a bizarre new haircut) tinkerbells over from her
     side of the room and predatorily curls beside sleeping beauty
     Wendy on her bed. 

                        WENDY
               What are you doing? 

                        PIXEL 
               Nothing. 

     Pixel's fist does a gopher rumble beneath Wendy's T-shirt.
     As if withstanding torture, Wendy hangs tough. 

                        WENDY 
               You know you just do this for shock
               value. It's not shocking. 

                        PIXEL 
               When did pretending to be bored
               become a sign of superiority?  Are
               you mad at me for giving the cabin
               new haircuts or are you just still
               miserably pining for Wichita's
               lightning rod? 

                        WENDY 
               Geez, what time is it?  I have to go
               feed Big Chief Oberon...You're right,
               I miss him. Wichita, that is.  I
               really want to be with him, but I
               can't bring myself to--Are you a
               lesbian or are you...

                        PIXEL 
               I didn't realize I had to declare a
               major. 

                        WENDY 
                    (to Pixel's hand)
               Why do you even like me? 

     Confronted with a real response, Pixel withdraws her hand             ]
     and unwinds up and over to her own bed.                               ]

                        PIXEL 
               You remind me of me when I was...I
               guess I was never like you. So cute.
               So questioning. 

                        WENDY 
               I'm not a nai-ive little...

                        PIXEL 
               Uh-huh. 

     Wendy fumes as the Endlessly Muttering Girl appears in the
     doorway, wearing the new Pixelesque haircut. 

                        MUTTERING GIRL

                    (to watch) 
               On that note, my morning swim...

     Wendy sighs as Pixel scampers off. The girls of the cabin             ]
     all awaken with the same kooky haircut (a severe, petite              ]
     braid dangling about the temple.)                                     ]

     INT.   WICHITA AND JASPER'S CABIN--NIGHT 

     Finishing a late run, Wichita de-hustles into the counselors'
     quarters to where Jasper is regarding a board of pressed
     flowers that spell I LOVE YOU. 

                        JASPER 
               No, they're not from Wendy. 

                        WICHITA

     on-Jasper Dorothy recoil behind a tree.                               ]

                        JASPER 
               I guess it was too much to ask that
               it would somebody older...and maler.
               Like you. 

                        WICHITA 
               Hey, I thought I wasn't your type. 

                        JASPER 
               Wichita--you're everybody's type.
               But seriously, don't worry about
               it. I get my occasional crushes. 

                        WICHITA

               Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ]
               modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]

                        JASPER 
               Goodnight. 

     Wichita moves toward his bed. Jasper jokingly follows him.
     They both laugh as Jasper retreats.

               and excitement of the opening weeks
               gives way to dull routine, but after
               finding and losing the thrill of
               romance, the organism that was Camp
               Bleeding Squaw seem to wither and
               die faster than usual. 

     The image of Wendy vibrating atop the chair, leading a cheer,
     repeats itself. 

                        WENDY 
               Hey campers, how about a morning
               YEE-HO! 

                        CAMPERS
                    (feebly) 
               Yee....Ho. 

     The image repeats again. 

                        WENDY 
               Hey campers, I think it's time for
               a morning YEE-HO! 

                        CAMPERS 
                    (barely perceptible) 
               yeeho.

     EXT.   CENTER OF CAMP--DAY 

     A flag reading DAY 21 hits the top of the flagpole. Wendy
     is revealed to be pulling it, sadly mumbling her familiar
     flag raising song. 

     INT.   WICHITA AND JASPER'S CABIN--DAY 

     Wichita watches Wendy walk away from the flagpole way in
     the distance. He turns to see Eric slide off his top bunk
     to chat up his pal Stanley in the bunk below. 

                        ERIC 
               That was a bummer, Stanley--your
               parents not coming to parents day--
               you all right? 

                        ERIC FRIEND STANLEY 
               Yeah, I'm fine. My Mom had to work.
               I'm fine. 

     Wichita, impressed at the interchange, spins a baseball at
     an oncoming Eric, who catches it. 

                        WICHITA 
               That really sucked, Eric, what you
               did, asking him that...

                        ERIC 
               Oh thanks, it was nothing...

                        WICHITA 
                    (to watch) 
               You know, I think I left something 
               by the lake. Could you check it out--
               You'll know it when you see it...

                        ERIC
               Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...

     EXT.   BY THE LAKE--MORNING 

     Guitar music accompanies Eric's pumped trek. He spurts from
     some trees and stops dead at the sound of a splash. Pixel
     is unwinding in the water, luxuriating in her ritualistic
     skinny-dip. A traumatized (in the best sense) expression 
     is frozen upon Eric's face. 

     INT.  THE MESS HALL--DAY 

     Strumming a guitar before the crowd, Wendy is revealed to
     be responsible for the soundtrack. She finishes off,
     seemingly commenting on the previous scene. 

                        WENDY 
               Isn't Fun great?  It's the first day
               of last half of camp, so let's start
               with the biggest YEE-HO yet. YEE-
               HO! 

     The cafeteria crowd does not even attempt a response,
     completely wrapped in their own conversations. Wendy grits
     up some strength and belts out louder, pulling out a gold
     flyer. 

                        WENDY 
               Boy oh boy and girl oh girl, looks
               like I'm going to have to tug out 
               my super-secret summer weapon!  I think
               I have two words that will turn some 
               of those frowns upside down.

     (wearily wearing sunglasses).

               awesome in here or is it just me!

     Talia and Donald share a moan. Donald raises up his hand              ]
     for a high-five.                                                      ]

     campers freak away, Talia jolts toward her.

     Wendy pivots around, her face has spookily swelled up. The
     surrounding children immediately explode into watching-a-
     monster-movie, finger-pointing wails of fear and amusement.

     Ryan-style, sprinkled with frog's blood. 

     Some counselors are huddled in a nearby trench. They watch
     Troublemaker Billy fall to the ground, laughing.

                        JASPER                                             ]

     WICHITA 

     stands staring out the other edge of the mountain. His back
     turned to all the ferocious activity. The soundtrack goes 
     silent for Oberon's narration.

                        OBERON NARRATION (V.O.)
               Much like a little boy who throws
               sand at the girl in the sandbox
               because he likes her, Wichita had
               helped turn the mountain into a
               rumbling volcano that had almost
               given Wendy a nervous breakdown. 
               A good time was had, but it was now
               time to move on. To start to take
               responsibility. To deal with the
               implications of the photograph on
               Wendy's wall...

     Sounds of chaos come back. Wichita finally turns and tanks
     forward, making sharp scans to the pockets of anarchy around
     him. Darkening clouds. Traumatized campers. The blood-stained
     statue of Donald. The wailing wake around a froglike crater.
     Talia helping hemorrhaging Hayley down the hill. Laughing
     Billy.  Zombie Mutant Wendy. 

     Wichita exchanges nods with a rather familiar girl. The
     rather familiar girl goes into the throes of a very familiar
     epileptic fit immediately sobering everyone. 

     However, the creature that will not die, the monstrously
     swollen Wendy continues to hobble forward. 

                        WENDY 
               You know I think I forgot to remember
               that I'm allergic to bee stings. 

     Thunder ripples the air. Wendy faints. Wichita slides to
     catch her in a picture-perfect pose. 

     INT.  INFIRMARY ROOM--DUSK 

     Rain pounds outside. Her head bloated to an almost sci-fi
     degree, Wendy moans away on a cot. Wichita is by her side,
     surrounded by some of the other counselors. 

     ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CURTAIN 

     Trying to rip open a tampon, Talia is crouched before a
     standing, shivering Hayley. Both are crying. 

                        TALIA 
               Whew, that wasn't a period. That
               was an exclamation mark. You know,
               Hayley, behind every great woman
               is a great first menstruation
               anecdote. 

                        HAYLEY
               I hope so...

                        TALIA 
               This is...this is...a very special
               moment...

     Talia and Hayley look to each other, and without stopping
     the flow of their tears, break into a cathartic laughter.

     INT.  DONALD'S QUARTERS--DUSK 

     Donald unlocks a drawer and throws in his condoms atop an
     another load of unopened condom boxes. He plops a shiny porno
     mag atop them all and relocks the drawer. Wichita pokes in 
     (Worshipping Eric noticeably loiters behind). 

                        WICHITA
               Howdy Pouty. 

                        DONALD 
               I was pretty confident that I was
               going to blow it with Talia, but
               I must say, I outdid myself. 

                        WICHITA 
               She's still pissed at me and took
               it out on you. We should have taken
               it slower. It's hard to operate in
               the woods. Much easier in, like a
               club.  Tell the girl you've got to
               go do something, leave her view,
               take way too long until she is
               worried that you're not coming back.
               Just as she starts feeling awful,
               you come up from behind and touch
               her neck...

                        DONALD 
                    (smiling in admiration) 
               You are the prince of the darkness. 

                        WICHITA                                            ]
               Yeah. I should put all my shit in                           ]

                        DONALD 
               The funny thing about this Talia
               thing is I wasn't even really
               that...The person I really like--
               I probably shouldn't be admitting
               this...

                        WICHITA 
                    (breaking from trance) 
               I'm in the picture on Wendy's wall.
               Niagara Falls. Family trip. Little
               Wendy foreground. Me background.
               What are the odds on that one? 

                        DONALD 
               Uh, yeah, that's...wow. 

                        WICHITA 
               I couldn't tell her...it's, it's
               too major...Jesus, I'm starting to
               believe in God and what's worse I
               think I like the guy. The lightning
               bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy
               and I--we're meant to be. I'm right,
               right?  I have to see her...

                        DONALD
                    (deflated) 
               Say Hi for me. 

     Donald stands to watch Wichita and Eric exit, then glances
     to his campers. One of them, in Donaldish glasses, paces
     back and forth, staring at a scrap of paper. 

                        DONALD
               What is it, Cosmo? 

                        COSMO, THE DONALDISH CAMPER
               I don't know...this girl...gave me
               this note...she wants to meet by 
               the creek tonight...I don't know. 

     Donald launches down and grabs Cosmo by the shoulders. 

                        DONALD 
               Camp Eberhardt. Anne Wilson, lovely
               Anne Wilson. She was the only camper
               to have a lifeguard's license so 
               she was the only one allowed to take
               out a canoe without supervision. 
               She asked me to come with her for 
               a post-bonfire spin around the lake
               and I said no. I was young, I was
               nervous, I didn't really like canoes--
               I said no. If I would have gone on
               that canoe, I'd be a different 
               person, I know it. Successful, 
               happy, assertive.  I'd be a
               nearsighted Wichita. You think
               you're a kid so your decisions don't
               matter now.  They do. They all do.

     INT.   INFIRMARY ROOM--NIGHT 

     A radio is playing "Oh, my Unforgettable Summer Love." The
     monstrously swollen Wendy, half-awake, murmurs affectingly
     along with the song. Wichita is revealed standing in the
     doorway watching her. He briefly murmurs along, too. His
     ruggedly casual look has smoothed into one of a tamed tiger. 

                        WICHITA                                            ]

               Would have been cooler if I had died.                       ]

     In the throes of an eloquent delirium, Wendy, almost
     comically, tries to rise up on the cot, but can't. 

                        WENDY 
               I have to get up. Still more to do.
               That boy hates Asian people. That
               girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer
               by dropping a plate on her hand.

                        WICHITA 
               You're seriously wonderful. 

     Wendy starts to feel a little self-conscious, touching her
     hair....and then her warped visage. 

                        WENDY 
               Hey...You have to get out of here.
               I'm...having a bad face day. Don't

               Only dropped you twice...                                   ]

     They pause to inhale the intoxicating romantic tension. 

                        WENDY 
               Isn't this the time where one of
               us says something deeply offensive
               to the other one...We're just so
               different. 

                        WICHITA                                            ]

                        WENDY 
                    (trying to be flippant) 
               Yeah, why should we let our actual
               personalities get in the way of us
               falling in love?

                    (trying not to be flippant) 
               Exactly. 

     ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DIVIDER 

     A BOY AND A GIRL COVERED IN POISON IVY SPLOTCHES lie in their
     beds on the other side of the divider. They are unbearably
     holding in a huge burst of laughter. 

     BACK TO WENDY'S SIDE OF THE DIVIDER 

     Wichita glides into an intimate kneel beside Wendy's bed. 

                        WICHITA 
               Todd was out there blocking the                             ]
               entrance. You would have been proud                         ]

               enough to walk around...

               And you'll be happy to know I'm going
               to drop my Snow White and the Seventy
               Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...

                        WICHITA 
               I was thinking...if we could mesh
               my way of thinking with your way                            ]

                        WENDY 
               I love you. Don't say I love you,
               too. I hate that--"love you, too." 

                        WICHITA 
               I know what you mean. But it doesn't
               put me in too great a position...

                        WENDY 
               Don't worry, you...

     Wichita brings his head down upon Wendy's mutated one for
     a kiss. 

                        WICHITA 
               God, you're beautiful. 

                        WENDY                                              ]
               Thank you, my love.                                         ]

     The kids on the other side of the divider let loose with 
     a huge ream of laughter. Wendy happily-grouchily chastises.

                        WENDY
               Fuck off.

                        WICHITA 
               I should leave. You probably need
               your rest. 

                        WENDY 
               Probably. 

     Wendy suddenly throws back the sheets and projects out of
     the bed. Wichita chuckles and gives breathless chase. 

     EXT.   ON TOP OF THE HILL--NIGHT 

     This moment of passion turns into the sight of a FULL MOON, 
     complemented by the HOWL of an animal. The viewer's viewpoint
     DRIFTS DOWN to see that the howl comes from a wild-haired
     OBERON, seen from the back, in a mountain man frock.

     to where a post-coital Wichita and Wendy are artfully
     entangled among some bushes, watching the couple below.

     Wendy giggles. Wichita gently kisses her.

     Troublemaker Billy is wailing as loud as a gagged person
     can.  Hence the strange noise. His arms are tied around a
     tree. A Tennis racquet is pressed against his bare chest
     by one Adamesque camper, while others, using Brillo pads,
     severely scrape skin poking out. Adam observes. 

                        ADAM 
               It's called "Pink waffle"--perhaps 
               before your time--Brillo pad scraped
               against the skin popping out from 
               a pressed down tennis racquet. Okay,
               that's enough! 
                    (a chuckle) 
               I'm only kidding. More. 

     The Brilloing gets fiercer. The muffled moans get louder.
     Pixel suddenly appears, pushing everyone out of the way.
     Tennis racquet batted away, Billy's stomach indeed resembles
     a pink waffle. Adam's Henchmen tear the boy away with them. 

                        PIXEL 
               Sadist!  I can't believe I thought
               you could change--This is your idea 
               of discipline?  You're a monster.  That
               kid is going to be traumatized for...

                        ADAM 
               About three days. I'm a monster.
               He's a monster. Actually, we're both
               just guys. I don't expect you to
               understand that I...

     Surprising Adam, the viewer, and herself, Pixel unzips Adam's
     pants and reaches her hand inside. She determinedly strokes
     and Adam helplessly quivers. 

                        PIXEL 
               No really, keep talking, I ree-ally
               want to hear what you have to say,
               you're just so eloquent...

                        ADAM 
               Why are you...don't stop...why? 

                        PIXEL 
               "Why?" If I asked questions like
               that, I'd never make love-"love"--
               Damn you, Damn this, damnit!

     Pixel and Adam tug at each other's clothes.

               assistance in finding that
               important...thingie in the storage room.

                        WENDY
               Oh my gosh, why didn't you say
               something earlier...

     Holding in laughter, Wendy and Wichita solemnly move off
     from the table toward a storage room at the back of the Mess
     hall.  Most of the campers and counselors subtly stop 
     speaking and eating to behold them as the operatic music 
     creeps back on.

                        OBERON NARRATION (V.O.) 
               As always, everything revolved around
               Wendy and Wichita. They were the
               plant on the classroom windowsill,
               fed and watered by enthusiastic
               teachers and children.

     A special pan is made across the unrequited lovers Donald,
     Jasper (big patch of hair missing at his temple), and Pixel,
     who sighs down to a shockingly relaxed Adam dozing on her
     lap.  They all sadly blink as Wendy and Wichita animatedly
     unlock the storage door and disappear inside. 

                        OBERON NARRATION (V.O.)
               It's so much fun to watch it grow
               and grow...but these classroom plants
               always have a way of getting too 
               big...beyond control...

     INT.   STORAGE ROOM--DAY 

     Wichita naughtily backs Wendy into the sizable storage room.
     She gleefully half-fends off his frisky prods beneath her
     blouse and down her shorts. 

                        WENDY 
               Do you really think we're fooling
               anyone? 

                        WICHITA 
               Do you really think I care? 

                        WENDY                                              ]
               You're bad...                                               ]
                                                                           ]
                        WICHITA                                            ]
               We're bad...                                                ]

     Wendy surrenders into a kiss. The couple crushes back against
     a wood table. 

     INT.   STORAGE ROOM--ANOTHER DAY 

     With no tentative giggling foreplay whatsoever, Wichita and
     Wendy hungrily bash through the storage room door and
     immediately launch into each other. They do a Postman-Always-
     Rings-Twice collapse up atop the table and begin clawing 
     each other's clothes off. 

     INT.   STORAGE ROOM--YET ANOTHER DAY 

     Passion down to a clinical science, Wendy and Wichita swiftly
     but calmly enter the storage room. With military precision,
     Wendy removes her shorts, lies back on the table, and lifts
     her tennis shoed feet into the air. Wichita removes his shirt
     and fiddles with his pants. They converse as if they were
     playing Scrabble. 

                        WICHITA 
               She got a little poison oak and
               started screaming for assisted
               suicide. 

                        WENDY 
               Be nice. Her father died in that
               TWA flight the government shot 
               down...You know I'm going to be in
               the city next week. My mom says it's
               okay that I stay overnight at your
               dorm...It'll be nice to see you in                          ]
               a different shirt.                                          ]
                                                                           ]

               Oh, I didn't tell you. I wear this                          ]
               all year round. The chicks dig it...                        ]

                        WENDY 
               It's going to be strange. Having
               to plan "dates" and....
                    (suddenly unreclining)
               Something wrong?  What's up? 

                        WICHITA                                            ]

               What's not up. Guess my mind is on                          ]
               the end of camp and all that.                               ]
                                                                           ]

                    (attempted smile)                                      ]
               Yeah. Serves us right.                                      ]

     EXT.   FOREST CAMPFIRE--NIGHT                                         ]
                                                                           ]
     Oberon, beard larger than ever, is familiarly sifting through         ]
     Wichita and Wendy's respective Journals. The pages are barren         ]
     of new writing. He eventually clings up some of the campers'          ]
     journals as well. Blank as well.                                      ]
                                                                           ]
                        OBERON NARRATION (V.O.)                            ]
               So much was happening, so quickly,                          ]
               no time to process it for both                              ]
               witnesses and participants. The                             ]
               journals, so often packed with                              ]
               scribbled spiritual groping, were                           ]
               now completely blank.  Constant                             ]
               activity, be it archery or fucking,                         ]
               without introspection is dangerous.                         ]
               It causes a brain clot, even worse                          ]
               a clotting of the soul. Bleeding                            ]

               of-balance, but then, if you've ever
               been to a summer camp, you know how
               matters most astonishing, tragic,
               and wondrous are not worked out until
               the very last day.

     Gravely rising, Oberon clumps the diaries into his arms and           ]
     kicks dirt over the campfire.                                         ]

     EXT.  CENTER OF CAMP--DAY

     A very different Wendy--tougher, older, not quite wiser--
     dutifully raises, while smoking a cigarette, a ragged flag
     marked 40. A pack of campers can only-very-briefly be seen            ]
     making a wild Lord of the Flies run in the b.g.                       ]

     INT.  THE MESS HALL--DAY                                              ]
                                                                           ]
     The MESS HALL is a mess. Loud and dirty with a black eye              ]
     or two, the campers race around from table to table in                ]
     rhythmic chaos.  Boys and girls eat together--some of them            ]
     on the floor.  The counselors are too ethereally de-energized         ]
     to do anything actively disciplinary.                                 ]

     BY TALIA'S TABLE

     In perfect syncopation, the Bombshellettes, with a similarly          ]
     coiffed Vanessa musketeered between them, saunter across              ]
     the mess hall. A much more bohemian Hayley passes by the              ]
     trio. The two ex-friends do not even acknowledge each other           ]
     enough to ignore each other.                                          ]
                                                                           ]
     Hayley brakes before the uncharacteristically counseling
     counselor Talia, who is surprisingly holding court with a
     group of awed campers. Talia is almost unrecognizably
     unbrittle and earth motheresque (flower in hair!). Hayley
     attaches a string of Arts and Crafty beads around her mentor.

                        OBERON NARRATION (V.O.)
               Oh, I almost forgot about Talia.
               She did the most shocking thing of
               all: She became a camp counselor. 

                        TALIA                                              ]

     WICHITA 

     is fixing the wires of the headset with surprising
     determination. Wendy peeps up, trying to be more suave than
     she is. 

                        WENDY 
               Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem 
               to reach the top shelf in the storage
               room. Could you...

                        WICHITA
               Not now, Wendy. 

                        WENDY 
                    (softening) 
               This isn't about "doing it." I just
               think we need to talk some things
               out privately before...

     Not registering her, Wichita bounds upon the chair and barks
     into the working head-set. 

                        WICHITA 
               Does this camp suck or does this
               camp suck?

                    (joyously) 
               This camp sucks!

               They tried to tame us...They forced
               us to make their bead necklaces and
               run their sack races, but we
               rebelled!  We made our own camp!

               Sorry Jasper, this handshake is as

     Post-handshake, Jasper takes the ball from Todd, who waddles

     Todd's chest. The ball semi-comically hangs in the air

     mouths. Jasper rips out a piece of dental floss and                   ]
     confidentially brings it up to his mouth. Wichita has a               ]
     flicker of doubt.

     out, adorably hapless.

     EXT.   OTHER SIDE OF MESS HALL EXTERIOR--DAY

     Wichita rounds the outside of the mess hall, tossing the              ]
     football to himself, humming. He gets a glimpse of Wendy              ]

     recoils back, letting the football drop to the ground.

     Wichita eavesdrops, absolutely enthralled.

               Wichita--the Thomas Twins are

               them run into the forest. Can you
               help me? 

     EXT. THE WOODS--DAY 

     In alluring bathing suitage, face scrunched in mock-concern,
     Pixel leads Wichita through the forest. She stops in a
     clearing for some borderline bad acting. 

                        PIXEL 
               Hmmm...I wonder where those two
               rascals could be...

     Wichita gives a glance to a nearby massive Oak.

     BEHIND THE OAK

     Wendy eeks around the back to see Wichita move closer to
     Pixel, who is nastily fingering her bathing suit straps.

     Wichita abruptly yanks Pixel into a passionately passionless
     kiss. His eyes are wide open. So are Pixel's. She watches
     Wendy quiver out from around the tree in shock.

                        WENDY                                              ]

     Wichita tears Pixel away with a cold stare. He closes his
     eyes, swallows hard, then turns to see Wendy bolt away.

     Talia rushes off. "Kumbaya" ends and is replaced by a robust          ]
     punk ditty. The couples go into tribal writhing.                      ]

     The abandoned Wichita's attention is pulled to the sight 
     of Eric planting his dance partner on a chair. With queasy
     awareness, Wichita watches Eric give her an "I'll be right
     back" gesture.  The mentor's eyes follow the protoge to the
     punch bowl where Eric flirts with some other girls. 

     Wichita scans back to Eric's dance partner beginning to feel
     restless and unwanted. After a squirming beat, Eric finally
     neck-touches the Girl from behind. Wichita sadly realizes,
     just as the viewer does, that he has taught Eric well. Dark
     Wendy breaks Wichita's concentration, clutching a lantern
     and the fateful thermos.

     Sucking a cigarette, Wendy puts the lantern and the thermos
     in the crevice of a large rock. She sulks to the side of
     the creek as Wichita nervously skips rocks across the water.

               It's funny, when I first met you
               I thought you were such a weirdo...I

               But, but that was before we started

               how I cried when Peepers died. I

               And this Peepers was your...dog?  If
               it makes you feel better, I probably
               wasn't paying attention. 

                        ADAM 
               That doesn't make me feel better!
               Why are you being like this?

               you the ultimate male fantasy--sex,

     Adam spins Pixel by her elbows, slamming her spine against
     a tree. She lets off a more amused-than-angered yelp. 

     EXT.   OUTSIDE THE BOYS' CABINS--NIGHT 

     Donald sweeps up post-dance debris. A radio sputters. 

                        RADIO ANNOUNCER (RADIO)
               You keep requesting it. We keep
               playing it-- "Oh, my unforgettable
               Summer Love." 

     The overpoweringly overplayed ballad again cuts into the 
     air.  Donald sadly warbles along with it--then angrily stomps
     up and begins changing channels. But every channel is playing
     some part of the song. He bangs off the radio. But the song
     can still be faintly heard from his cabin. 

     INT.  DONALD'S CABIN--NIGHT 

     Donald bashes into his room. A nightstand radio has been
     left on-- the ballad wails to a crescendo. Donald batters
     the radio and rends open the desk drawer full of unopened
     condom boxes. 

     Donald dunks the drawer contents onto his bed. He then whips
     open his closet, revealing yet another awesome array of
     condomage--pristine boxes lined up like an encyclopedia set. 

     EXT.   OUTSIDE THE BOYS CABINS--NIGHT 

     Donald flaps out a bedspreadful of prophylactics to the
     ground and wrenches up the microphone. 

                        DONALD                                             ]

               asleep and get out here!                                    ]

     Donald meticulously removes a single condom and glides to
     a water pump. He fills the rubber with water as the Male
     Campers plow from the cabins and the females cascade down
     the stairs.

     LATER OUTSIDE THE BOYS CABINS 

     Donald marches before a perfectly positioned military
     regiment of campers. Very Kurosawa. Rubbing sleep from her
     eyes, Talia floats in from the back, dazed at the epic sight. 

                        DONALD 
               All the magazine polls say that the
               trait most looked for in a lover

               anything better to do tonight. Are

     Raising a water weapon into the air, the campers erupt into
     a terrifying roar. Led by Id-unleashing Donald, the soldiers
     besiege the forest. 

     Talia holds in a laugh and then is handed a condom weapon             ]

     EXT.   ADAM AND PIXEL'S PATCH IN THE WOODS--NIGHT 

     Adam's hands launch up to Pixel's neck and begin squeezing. 

                        ADAM 
               You think you're so...but you're
               just...

     Adam tries to tighten his stranglehold...but he is suddenly 
     obliterated by a fleet of swooshing water balloon/condoms.
     Pixel's laughter is cut off as she too is bombarded by the
     camper commandos. 

     Billy makes a particularly severe throw. Adam grabs his eyes
     in pain.

               Damnit, spermicidally lubricated! 

     EXT.   AN UNSEEN AS YET PART OF THE WILDERNESS--NIGHT 

     The demon campers bound up over a ridge. Suddenly, they halt, 
     silencing their deafening battle cry. Before them, Jasper
     and the Cook are necking on a blanket in the woods. 

     Everyone blinks, then instantly goes back into terrorist-
     mode, projecting their water balloonage down upon the gay
     lovers with equal-opportunity malicious glee. 

     Side by side, Caleb and Dorothy the Crush-girl, drop their
     unthrown balloons with a tragic thud. The savages retreat
     past them, wailing in delight. 

     EXT.   BY THE ROCK BY THE CREEK--NIGHT 

     Wendy's fingers spider around the noxious thermos. She takes
     it out from the crevice and unscrews the lid. She then pours
     herself some hemlock.

     Wendy brings the cup to her lips. A brilliantly precise water
     balloon spectacularly smashes it from her hands. 

     Eric turns to a beaming Todd.

               Great shot!  Todd, I think we finally

               Now! 

     The two boys and the rest of the camp rabidly turn and launch
     a water balloon blitzkrieg at the traumatized leads. Talia 
     enthusiastically fires away at Wendy, while Donald
     satisfyingly scores direct hits upon Wichita.

     INT.  WENDY AND PIXEL'S PART OF THE CABIN--DAY 

     Wendy and Pixel are engaged in a deep, open-mouthed kiss.
     Wendy's face contorts away into a snicker. 

                        WENDY 
               I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly.
               Like kissing a girl. 

                        PIXEL 
               Clever observation. Go back to
               Wichita.  Oh that's right, you can't. 

     A wobbly Wendy lights up a cigarette and begins to pack.
     And to cry. Pixel exhales, with a twinge of self-anger. 

                        PIXEL 
               ...sorry...

                        WENDY 
               This is not the way it was supposed
               to-- I was going to start writing 
               a children's book using input from
               all-- I don't even like smoking! 

     The flustered Wendy stomps her cigarette. She proceeds to
     pluck and pack her family pictures from the wall. 

                        PIXEL 
               One day they'll find a cure for AIDS.
               They'll never find one for sex. It's
               kind of funny, most movies and
               stories with a bunch of camp
               counselors has some serial psycho 
               in the woods with a chainsaw who
               systematically butchers everybody
               one by one. 

                        WENDY
               Yeah. And? 

                        PIXEL 
               It's just funny...who needs a serial
               psycho in the woods with a chainsaw
               when we have ourselves. 

     Wendy gulps at Pixel's words, then turns back to the wall.
     HER NIAGARA FALLS PICTURE HAS BEEN RIPPED. The image of the
     boy she never knew was Wichita has been torn off. 

     EXT.   WOODS LEADING INTO THE CENTER OF THE CAMP--DAY 

     Burning across the forest, mumbling to himself, Wichita pulls
     out the ripped-off image of his Young Self and DEVOURS IT 
     IN HIS MOUTH. 

     The deadened counselor emerges into the madness at the center
     of camp which can't help but resemble the madness of Day 
     1.  Wichita drifts forth taking in the scattered sights of
     baggage-grappling campers and counselors trading goodbye 
     hugs before humming buses. Eric scampers before Wichita. 

                        ERIC 
               There you are!  Man, I don't know how
               to thank...

                        WICHITA 
                    (grabbing Eric's shoulder)
               Eric...You can't be like me. You
               have to be better. I'm not the guy
               you think I am...

                        ERIC 
                    (having none of it) 
               Of course you are. You don't know
               what I was like before I met you.
               You're like the best counselor ever. 

     Eric breaks from Wichita's guilty grip and bustles to his
     pals.  Jolting them all, Oberon kicks Stanley's overflowing           ]
     duffel bag.                                                           ]

     Jasper and Pixel hug goodbye. Andrew pops up behind Jasper
     for a farewell of his own. 

                        ANDREW 
               I'm gay. Like you didn't know. 

                        JASPER 
               Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten.
               You shouldn't even be having thoughts
               like...

                        ANDREW 
               You mean you didn't have any gay
               thoughts when you were my age...

               Well, uh...Promise me you won't do

                        ANDREW 
               Did you wait until you were 18? 

     Jasper lets off an involuntary spark of laughter that means           ]

     Across from that pair, Jasper makes eye-contact, through
     the window, with a sour Caleb. Caleb gives him the finger,
     mouthing the word "Fag." Jasper sadly grits his teeth.
     Dorothy, the Crush Girl sits herself next to Jasper and
     silently, tenderly, puts her head on his shoulder.

     Pixel is craftily unPixelating a line of girls--scissoring
     off the mini-braid from each girl's hair (a pile forms in 
     the dirt) and rubbing-alcohol-cotton swabbing off each girl's
     tattoo. She sees Adam moodily staring upon her from the bus.
     She gives him a pinkie wave.

     In one sweeping gesture, Adam twists out and yanks the
     Computer Image T-shirt Boy inside. The doors close
     instantaneously behind and the bus roars away. Wendy runs
     up beside it, but can't catch up. She turns to the other
     bus with dread as Wichita can be seen clambering inside.

     All eyes turn to a head-down Wendy thudding up the bus steps
     and clumping down the aisle. The viewer can quickly discern
     that the only open seat is next to a lone, brooding Wichita,
     but Wendy is in denial. She shuffles all the way to the back
     of the bus before retreating forward.

     As if the seat were covered with needles, Wendy descends
     next to Wichita. The bus immediately begins to lumber
     forward. The ex-lovers stare straight ahead.

     Oberon watches the buses rumble away. He clicks off his

     Turning to the zombie tableau of Wichita and Wendy, would-
     be cheerer-upper Donald wobbles up with his camera. 

                        DONALD 
               Oh no, I'm sorry, I refuse to go
               out with this doom-and-gloom. I'm

               individuals.  Hold on, let's get 
               a kid in here...

     Not really taking his eyes away from the camera, Donald
     latches a child's arm in the aisle. With a shudder of fear,
     Donald realizes he has grabbed Don't-Touch-Me Todd. Donald
     cringes for a scream, but Todd calmly curls into a seated
     position between the caught off-guard Wendy and Wichita. 

                        DONALD 
               Now stop pretending you didn't have
               any good times...Shooting stars.

     their heads up and form a valiant, bittersweet smile.
