<title>"An American Werewolf in London" -- by John Landis</title>

<pre>



<b>     FADE IN
</b>
<b>1    MAN'S FOOTPRINT
</b>
     on the moon.

<b>     EXT. MOON
</b>
     Camera begins to pull back slowly, straight up - the
     song "Moon Shadow" by Cat Stevens begins.  Once we are
     high enough to see the entire moon, the main title is
     superimposed.

               An American Werewolf in London

     We continue to retreat from the moon, looking on as it
     grows farther from us, continuing credits until the
     full moon is the size it appears to us from earth.

<b>2    EXT. CROSSROADS ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
</b>
     Tree branches enter into the frame, the camera pans
     down and we see a truck approaching.  We are at a
     crossroads in the moors, looking sinister enough to
     have earned their literary reputation.

     The truck stops at the crossroads, the DRIVER,
     mustached and wearing tweeds, boots, and a muffler,
     climbs down.

     "Moon Shadow" ends.


<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
     Loud bang of the back grating on the truck as it slams
     down.  Revealed among the sheep are two rudely-awakened
     young American boys.  They look exhausted.  They both
     carry backpacks, two American kids on a jaunt in
     Europe.  They are both in their late twenties.

     It is very cold and they clamber out of the truck none
     too happily.  Pushing sheep aside they step out and
     stretch.

<b>     JACK GOODMAN AND DAVID KESSLER
</b>
     They've been cramped for hours.

<b>                         TRUCK DRIVER
</b>               Here, lads, East Proctor and
               all about are the moors.  I go
               east here.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Yes, well thank you very much
               for the ride, sir.  You have
               lovely sheep.

<b>                         TRUCK DRIVER
</b>                    (as he clambers back
                     up on his truck)
               Boys, keep off the moors.
               Stay on the road.  Good luck
               to you.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Thanks again!

     He drives off.  LONG SHOT of the two boys as the lorry
     pulls away.  Surrounding them are the moors.  They put
     on their packs, David points to the signpost pointing
     towards East Proctor.

<b>     EXT. ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
</b>
     As they walk, their breath visible:

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Are you cold?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Yes.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Good.

     They walk on, finally:

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Jack.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               David.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               You're not having a good time
               are you?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Oh, I don't know.  I mean look
               around.  Isn't this a fun
               place?

     The camera shows us the moors - desolate, cold,
     foreboding.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Well, I like it here.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I'm sorry.  Northern England
               first, Italy later.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Right.

     They walk on.
<b>                         JACK
</b>               Do you think she'll meet me in
               Rome?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I think Debbie Klein is a
               mediocre person with a good
               body.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Debbie is not mediocre and she
               has one of the great bodies of
               all time.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               She's a jerk.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You're talking about the woman
               I love.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I'm talking about a girl you
               want to fuck, so give me a
               break.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Well, anyway, do you think
               she'll be there?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I don't know.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (like an announcer)
               Rendezvous in Rome starring
               Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein.
               The love affair that shocked
               Europe!  See torrid lovemaking
               at its most explicit!  See
               Jack and Debbie expose their
               lust in the sacred halls of
               the Vatican!  Never has the
               screen dared....

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               If you don't stop, I'm going
               to kill you.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I have to make love to her.
               It's very simple.  She has no
               choice really.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               It just fascinates me that you
               can spend so much energy on
               someone so dull.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               It is impossible for a body
               like that to be dull.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               We've known Debbie what, since
               the eighth grade?  How many
               years of foreplay is that?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               She says she `likes me too
               much'.

     David just laughs and laughs and laughs.


<b>                                                  DISSOLVE
</b><b>                                                  TO:
</b>
<b>3    EXT. EAST PROCTOR MAIN STREET - NIGHT
</b>
     David and Jack entering East Proctor.  It is brightly
     moonlit.  East Proctor consists of a few shops, all
     closed, a petrol pump and a pub.  East Proctor has a
     very small population and the place looks empty.  David
     and Jack enter the middle of town and look about.  The
     camera sees what they see.  A few shops, dark and
     shuttered.  Light and laughter come from the pub.

<b>4    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
</b>
     Its traditional shingle shows a ferocious wolf's bloody
     head on a pike, and tells us the pub's name, "The
     Slaughtered Lamb".

<b>                         JACK
</b>               The Slaughtered Lamb?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed fox head on a
               spear as their symbol?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               That's a wolf's head.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Of course, The Slaughtered
               Lamb.  Why else would they
               have a severed wolf's head on
               a spear as their symbol?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               That's not a spear.  It's a
               pike.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               A severed wolf's head on a
               pike as their symbol.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               David, before we go in there I
               want you to know that - no
               matter what happens to us -
               it's your fault.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I assume full responsibility.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Okay.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Shall we?

<b>5    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
</b>
     The pub was apparently "modernized" sometime in the mid-
     fifties.  Its traditional Englishness combines with
     greasy stainless steel and glass.  It is populated by
     mostly pale young men with longish hair.  Several older
     men are ruddy complexioned and sport large mustaches.
     Four or five are watching a chess game.  Two men are
     playing darts.  The conversation is loud and there is
     often laughter.  But there is something unsavory about
     these people.  A look of leanness and poverty.  They
     seem inbred and somehow sullen.  We establish the types
     and the general level of noise in the room.

     The door opens revealing David and Jack.  There is dead
     silence and all are staring in a not friendly way at
     the two boys who are made uncomfortable by all the
     strange attention.  They give each other a "what?"
     look, then turn to the assembled populace.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Hello.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Nice to see you.

<b>     FACES
</b>
     Silent and staring.

<b>     DAVID AND JACK
</b>
<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (smiles)
               It's very cold outside.  May
               we come in?

     The WOMAN BARKEEP nods.  The boys walk carefully over
     to a table and very self-consciously remove their
     packs, place them on the floor, and sit down at the
     table.  There is a long, awkward wait.  The Woman
     finally comes over to them.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Do you have any hot soup?

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               No.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Well, do you have any coffee?

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               No.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Hot chocolate?
<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               We've got spirits and beer.
               If it's something hot you
               want, you can have tea.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Then you have some hot tea?

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               No.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Oh.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               But I can heat some up for you
               if you'd like.

<b>                         DAVID &amp; JACK
</b>               Yes, please.

     As the Woman turns to prepare the tea, everyone resumes
     what they were doing; talking, drinking, playing chess
     and darts, and the boys breathe easier.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Nice looking group.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Listen, at least it's warm in
               here.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Look at that.

<b>                                                  CUT TO:
</b>
<b>     JACK'S P.O.V.
</b>
     On the wall is painted a red pentangle (a five-pointed
     star) and on either side burns a yellow candle.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               What about it?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               It's a five-pointed star.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Maybe the owners are from
               Texas.

     The Woman brings them their tea.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to Woman)
          Remember the Alamo?

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               I beg your pardon?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               He was joking.  Thank you.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               Joking?  I remember The Alamo.
               I saw it once in London, in
               Leicester Square.

     Jack and David look startled.  One of the CHESS PLAYERS
     explains:

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               She means in the cinema, that
               film with John Wayne.
                    (turns to board)
               Checkmate.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Oh, yes, of course.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Right, with Laurence Harvey
               and everybody died in it.  It
               was very bloody.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               Bloody awful if you ask me!

     This sends everyone into gales of laughter.  Jack and
     David smile politely.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               Here, Gladys, Tom.  Did you
               hear the one about the
               crashing plane?

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               No, but we're about to.

     Laughter.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               You be quiet, woman, and let
               me speak.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>                    (heavy sarcasm)
               Quiet, everyone!  Hush!  Shhh!

     Uproarious laughter.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               All right, laugh then.  I
               shan't tell it.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               Oh, come on, tell us.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               No.  You've had your chance.

     The men all coax him to tell the joke.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to David)
               Ask them what the candles are
               for.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to David)
               Listen, that's a pentangle, a
               five-pointed star.  It's used
               in witchcraft.  Lon Chaney,
               Jr. and Universal Studios
               maintain it's the mark of the
               wolf man.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (to Jack)
               I see.  You want me to ask
               these people if they're
               burning candles to ward off
               monsters.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to David)
               Right.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (to Jack)
               Wrong.
     The drinkers have gotten the Chess Player to tell the
     joke as everyone knew he would.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               Oh, all right.  There was this
               airplane over the Atlantic on
               its way to New York.  It was
               full of men from the United
               Nations.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               That's very funny, that is.

     Uproarious laughter.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (to David)
               Go on, ask them.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (to Jack)
               You ask them.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               Here now, let me finish!  So
               halfway over the ocean the
               engines run low on petrol so
               they have to lighten the
               plane.  So they heave out all
               the baggage, but it's still
               too heavy.  So they chuck out
               the seats, but it's still too
               heavy!  Finally this Froggy
               steps up and shouts "Viva la
               France" and leaps out.  Then
               an Englishman....

<b>                         DART PLAYERS
</b>               Hear!  Hear!

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>                    (undaunted)
               ...steps up and shouts `God
               save the Queen!' and leaps
               out.  But the plane is still
               too heavy.  So the Yank
               delegate from Texas steps up,
               shouts, `Remember the Alamo!'
               and chucks out the Mexican.

     This is apparently the funniest joke the inhabitants of
     East Proctor have ever heard.  The laughter is
     uproarious, choking, knee-slapping, incredible.  As the
     Chess Player goes to take a drink of beer, the Dart
     Player gasps out...
<b>                         DART PLAYER
</b>               Remember the Alamo!

     ...causing the Chess Player to spit out his beer
     causing even harder laughter.  Complete hilarity.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Excuse me, but what's that
               star on the wall for?

     Dead silence.  A dart lands in the wall.  David and
     Jack are understandably bewildered.  The villagers look
     hard indeed.

<b>                         DART PLAYER
</b>                    (angry)
               You've made me miss.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I'm sorry.

<b>                         DART PLAYER
</b>               I've never missed the board
               before.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Jack, we'd better go.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               What do you mean?  I'm
               starving.

<b>                         DART PLAYER
</b>               There's no food here.

     The villagers look threatening and David's voice is a
     bit urgent.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Apparently so.

     The boys pick up their backpacks and move uncertainly
     for the door.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>                    (to men)
               You can't let them go.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (worried)
               How much do we owe you?

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               Nothing, lads.  Go, God be
               with you.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Uh, thank you.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               Wait!  You just can't let them
               go!

<b>                         DART PLAYER
</b>               Go!  And stay on the road.
               Keep clear of the moors.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Yes, well, thanks again.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               Beware the moon, lads!

     David pushes Jack out.

<b>6    EXT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
</b>
     It is very cold.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               What the hell was that all
               about?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I don't know.  Let's see if
               there's an inn or something up
               the road.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Beware the moon?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Come on, I'm freezing.

     They start up the road into the night.

<b>7    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
</b>
     It is quiet.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               You can't let them go.

<b>                         DART PLAYER
</b>                    (angry)
               Should the world know our
               business?!

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               It's murder then.

<b>                         DART PLAYER
</b>               Then murder it is!  It's in
               God's hands now.

     The wax drips from the Pentangle's candles onto the
     floor.

</b>
<b>8    EXT. A ROAD ON THE MOORS - NIGHT - DAVID AND JACK
</b>
     walking on the road surrounded by darkness.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               That was weird.  I guess
               leaving was the best idea.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I don't know.  Now that we're
               out here and it's three
               degrees, I'm not so sure I
               wouldn't rather face a blood-
               thirsty mob.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Well, not quite a blood-
               thirsty mob.

     They keep walking.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               What do you think was wrong?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I have no idea.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Maybe that pentangle was for
               something supernatural.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I see and they were too
               embarrassed to talk about it,
               because they felt so silly.
     There is a flash of lightning that sends a ghostly
     illuminating sheet of light over the boys' faces.  The
     clap of thunder follows loud and rumbling.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Please don't rain.

     Downpour.  The boys are walking in a deluge.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Of course.

     They walk getting soaked.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Say, David....

<b>                         DAVID

     Jack spreads his arms and sings.

<b>9    INT. THE SLAUGHTERED LAMB - NIGHT
</b>
     The rain is loud on the roof and beating on the
     windows.  The gathered continue to drink, play chess
     and darts, but all are silent and contemplative.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               Perhaps they'll be safe in the
               rain.

     The Chess Player slams his hand on the table.  Shouts:

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               No one brought them here!  No
               one wanted them here!

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               You could have told them!

<b>                         DART PLAYER
</b>               Are you daft?  What do you
               think they'd say?  They'd
               think us mad.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               Listen!

     The rain is subsiding.  There is a very faint howl.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               Did you hear it?  We must go
               to them.

<b>                         DART PLAYER
</b>               I heard nothing.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               Nor I.

     The camera lingers as the Chess Player's hard face
     shows the man's struggle.  Another howl.  The Chess
     Player turns suddenly.

<b>10   EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
</b>
     David and Jack are now completely out of sight from
     East Proctor surrounded by darkness and wet.  There is
     a light drizzle.  They are standing, listening.  The
     drizzle stops.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Did you hear that?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I heard that.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               What was it?

     David begins to walk, Jack with him.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Could be a lot of things.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Yeah?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               A coyote.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               There aren't any coyotes in
               England.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               The Hound of the Baskervilles.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Pecos Bill.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Heathcliffe.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Heathcliffe didn't howl.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               No, but he was on the moors.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               It's a full moon, `beware the
               moon'.

     Another howl, this one long and loud.  It is a very
     inhuman noise, terrifying, and closer this time.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I vote we go back to The
               Slaughtered Lamb.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Yeah.

     They are both visibly worried and walk briskly back
     from where they just came.  Although after a bit of
     fast walking they are getting nowhere.  They stop out
     of breath.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               We're lost.

     Another bloodcurdling howl.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Shit!  David, what is that?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I don't know.  Come on.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Come on, where?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Anywhere!  I think we should
               just keep moving.

     A growl.  A low guttural growl comes from out of the
     darkness.  We stay on the boys, but we hear something
     out there.  It starts to walk.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               It's moving.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               It's circling us.

     And indeed it is.  The boys strain to hear its four
     footfalls and they turn slowly, following it.  A snarl.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Fuck.

     We hear the wolf-monster stop (for that's what it is -
     we know it's there even though we've not seen it).  It
     sits breathing heavily.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               What's the plan?

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (nervously)
               Plan?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (not too relaxed
                     himself)
               Let's just keep walking.

     They do and David keeps talking as they walk.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               That's right, a lovely stroll
               in the moors.  Tra-la-la,
               isn't this fun?

     The thing stalking them seems to speed up.  The boys
     hesitate as they sense it run past them.  It stops.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               It's in front of us.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Do you think it's a dog?

     Jack and David strain to see what waits ahead of them.

<b>     BOYS' P.O.V.
</b>
     Something is waiting in the darkness.  Its hulking
     shape is barely discernible, but its eyes glow eerily
     and its breath is visible.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Oh shit.  What is that?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               A sheep dog or something.
               Turn slowly and let's walk
               away.

     The boys keep talking as they move faster and faster.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Nice doggie.  Good boy.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Walk away, Jack.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Walking away, yes, sir.  Here
               we are walking away.

     They are in a full-out run by now.  After a few minutes
     flight they stop, panting.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               See anything?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               No.

     A moment of quiet, then a howl.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               It sounds far away.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Not far enough.  Come on.

     They walk briskly.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Jack?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Yeah.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Where are we going?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I'll tell you when we get
               there.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Well.  I'm glad we...WHOAA!!

     David shouts as he slips suddenly in the mud, scaring
     Jack, and us, and himself a great deal.  He lays
     startled on the wet ground for a moment, then he and
     Jack laugh.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You really scared me, you
               shithead.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Are you going to help me up?

     Jack takes David's extended hand to help him up when
<b>     THE WOLF MONSTER SPRINGS!
</b>
<b>     EXT. MOORS - NIGHT
</b>
     The lunging beast brings Jack down in one fell swoop.
     David falls back on his ass.  Jack is screaming and
     struggling as he is torn to shreds.  David scrambles to
     his feet and runs in complete panic.  Jack's screams
     and the wolf's roars combine.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Jesus fuck!  David!  Please
               help me!  Please!  David!
               Shit!  Help me!  Oh God!

<b>     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
</b>
     David runs and runs.  Finally he falls, out of breath.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Jack?  Oh my God, Jack!

     He gets up and runs back to find Jack a torn and bloody
     mess on the ground.  He stares in horror.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Jack....

<b>     EXT. NIGHT - VARIOUS FLASH CUTS
</b>
     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  The camera adopts David's P.O.V. as
     he fights the dark savage shape on top of him.  Fangs
     clamp down on his shoulder when shots ring out and the
     hulking form rolls off of him.

<b>     EXT. ROADSIDE ON THE MOORS - NIGHT
</b>
     David, dazed and bloody, looks and sees the men from
     The Slaughtered Lamb armed with shotguns and torches
     running towards him.  Looking over at his attacker,
     instead of a wolf he sees a very old, naked man laying
     in the mud riddled with bullet holes.  As the villagers
     crowd around, David falls back and faints.

<b>                                                  FADE OUT
</b>

<b>     FADE IN
</b>
<b>11   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     David is in a small, clean and very white hospital
     room.  He lays on his back in bed, his shoulder
     bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma.
     There are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and
     face, but he really doesn't look too bad.  He opens his
     eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look
     around, but is unable to because of the pain.  He calls
     out....

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Jack?!

     ...and passes out.  However his shout has fetched a
     nurse.  She is ALEX PRICE, very English, very
     beautiful.  She goes to the bed.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Mr. Kessler?

     She looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her
     thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Mr. Kessler?

     David remains unconscious.  Another young nurse, MISS
     GALLAGHER, comes in.

<b>                         MISS GALLAGHER
</b>               He all right?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes, I should think.  He
               called out just now.

<b>                         MISS GALLAGHER
</b>               He's an American, you know.
               Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch
               round one of those Embassy
               fellows to see him.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Chart says he's from New York.

<b>                         MISS GALLAGHER
</b>               I think he's a Jew.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Why on earth do you say that?

<b>                         MISS GALLAGHER
</b>               I looked.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (smiles)
               Really, Susan, I don't think
               that was very proper, and
               besides, it's common practice
               now.

     A voice startles the girls.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Yes, Miss Gallagher, Miss
               Price is quite right.

     DR. HIRSCH enters.  He is an older man wearing the
     customary lab coat.  A very commanding and reassuring
     presence.  The girls are embarrassed.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried
               out a minute ago.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Miss Gallagher, surely you
               must perform some function
               here at the hospital.

<b>                         MISS GALLAGHER
</b>               Yes, Doctor.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Then get on with it.

<b>                         MISS GALLAGHER
</b>               Yes, Doctor.

     She exits.  Dr. Hirsch begins to examine David.  Alex
     watches.  Dr. Hirsch turns to Alex.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Can I be of service, Miss
               Price?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Dr. Hirsch?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Go about your duties.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes, Doctor.

     She starts to exit.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Oh, Miss Price?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes, Doctor?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               What exactly did he call out?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               He said `Jack'.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               That would be Jack Goodman,
               the boy who was killed.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               What happened to them?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               The police report said an
               escaped lunatic attacked them.
               He must have been a very
               powerful man.  Although I
               really don't see that it is
               any of your concern, Miss
               Price.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               No, sir.  Of course, sir.
               Good day, Doctor.

     She exits as Dr. Hirsch continues his examination,
     looking into David's eyes.

<b>12   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY
</b>
     The camera is handheld, running furiously through the
     almost dense greenery.  On the soundtrack are the
     footfalls and heavy breathing of the runner.  The
     camera abruptly stops and turns, sharply looking about,
     the panting continuing.  The breathing gets louder and
     harder, then too loud when we:

<b>13   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     David opens his eyes quickly, the silence and whiteness
     contrast sharply with the preceding fantasy.  Standing
     beside the bed are Dr. Hirsch and MR. COLLINS.  Mr.
     Collins wears a bow tie and is holding a briefcase.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Hello, David.  I am Dr. Hirsch

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               You're in a hospital in

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               London?  Where's Jack?  I had
               a strange dream.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               I should think so after your

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               The guy I was with.  Is he all

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH

               Now, David, I want you to
               prepare yourself; your friend
               is dead.
     David jolts up in bed and shouts.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               What?

     The sudden exertion and strain hurt.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Ow, shit!

     He sinks back down.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Jack's dead?

<b>                         MR. COLLINS

               in Grosvenor Square.  Both Mr.
               Goodman's parents and your
               parents have been notified of
               your injuries and everything's

<b>                         MR. COLLINS

<b>                         MR. COLLINS
</b>                    (distraught, clutching
                     his briefcase)
               I realize how upsetting this
               must be for you, Mr. Kessler,
               but please try to refrain from
               hysterics.

     David continues shouting and struggling.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Prepare a hypodermic, please,
               Miss Price.

     The shot is administered and David is held down by Dr.
     Hirsch and Alex until his breathing becomes more
     normal.

<b>                         MR. COLLINS
</b>               Now, Mr. Kessler, try not to
               excite yourself.  Everything
               has been arranged.  I shall
               come back to check on your
               progress and send a report to
               your parents.  The police have
               requested to interview you and
               I have given them permission
               to do so.

     Dr. Hirsch walks Mr. Collins to the door.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Thank you very much, Mr.
               Collins.  He'll rest now and
               I'm sure everything will be
               fine once he's adjusted.  He's
               had quite a shock.

<b>                         MR. COLLINS
</b>               These dumb-ass kids never
               appreciate anything you do for
               them.

     Mr. Collins exits.  Dr. Hirsch crosses back to the bed.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               How long have I been here?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               You've been unconscious since
               you were brought in two weeks
               ago.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Two weeks?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               You've suffered some rather
               severe cuts and bruises, lost
               a bit of blood, but nothing
               too serious; black and blue
               for a while.  You'll have some
               dueling scars to boast of.
               That lunatic must have been a
               very fierce fellow.  They say
               a mad man has the strength of
               ten.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (softly, as the drugs
                     take hold)
               Lunatic?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Now we've just given you a
               pretty strong sedative, so try
               to get some rest now.  Miss
               Price will see to your needs.
               Rest now.

     Dr. Hirsch watches as Alex straightens David's covers.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (softly)
               It wasn't a lunatic.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (puzzled)
               I beg your pardon?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               It was a wolf.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (bends down close
                     to hear)
               What?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               A wolf.

     David passes out.  Alex looks to Dr. Hirsch.
<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Did he say a wolf?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes, I believe he did.

     Dr. Hirsch regards David thoughtfully.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH

     He rises to greet the two police officers, one tall,
     the other rather pudgy.

     Lt. Villiers shoots the sergeant a withering look.

               Maybe not.  No thanks.  Maybe
               later.

               We understand the Kessler boy

     Lt. Villiers glares at McManus.

<b>15   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     David sits up in bed.  Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus
     stand by his side.  Dr. Hirsch sits observing.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I'm sorry if I conflict with
               your report, but Jack and I
               were not attacked by a man.

<b>                         LT. VILLIERS
</b>               So you've said.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               He may have a point,
               Lieutenant.  Two strong boys
               would be able to defend
               themselves against one man.

<b>                         LT. VILLIERS
</b>               Sgt. McManus, are you
               suggesting that David and Jack
               were, in fact, attacked by
               some animal and that the
               officialdom of East Proctor
               has conspired to keep it a
               secret?  We have an autopsy
               report on the murderer who was
               shot in the act by the local
               police.  We have two witnesses
               to the crime.  You'll forgive
               me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider
               your testimony as coming from
               someone who has gone through a
               terrible shock.

                         SGT. McMANUS
               Lieutenant, the boy seems
               pretty lucid to me and....

<b>                         LT. VILLIERS
</b>               And what, Sergeant?

                         SGT. McMANUS
                    (defeated)
               I don't rightly know, sir.

<b>                         LT. VILLIERS
</b>               That is precisely my point.
               David, as far as we are
               concerned, the matter is
               closed.  We won't trouble you
               any further.  Good day.

     The lieutenant goes for the door.  The sergeant smiles
     at David and follows.

<b>                         LT. VILLIERS
</b>               Doctor.

     The cops exit.  Dr. Hirsch crosses to David's bed.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               There were witnesses?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               So they said.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               How could there have been
               witnesses?  It was so dark.
               We were running and I fell and
               Jack went to help me up and
               this thing came from
               nowhere...I don't understand
               what they're talking about.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               In time I'm sure it will all
               come back to you.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Doctor, my memory is fine.
               It's my sanity I'm beginning
               to worry about.

     Again the handheld camera is running furiously through
     the woods.  Heavy breathing and the sounds of the
     runner crashing through the foliage.  The camera runs
     for a while then suddenly stops short near a tree.
     David abruptly enters frame, animal-like, the tenseness
     of a startled cat.  His head makes sudden movements,
     looking about.

<b>     CLOSEUP
</b>
     of his flared nostrils and perked up ears accenting his
     animalness.

<b>     DAVID
</b>
     takes off and now we run with him.  He runs fast and
     gracefully, taking long strides and leaps.  We run with
     him faster and faster sharing in his exhilaration.  We
     see him completely as the animal, study his movement
     and grace as if watching a gazelle.  Suddenly he stops
     again, alert, listening.  He moves with stealth, slowly
     he pushes some leaves aside.

<b>     CLOSEUP
</b>
     of his eyes.

<b>     DAVID'S P.O.V.

     Several deer in the forest; they sense something and
     freeze, the camera noting a fawn next to a doe.  The
     buck turns his head, feeling the danger.

     as it is leapt upon, its terrified face leaving frame

     with blood.  He howls in triumph.

     The lights are subdued and David's asleep.  The door
     opens, a shaft of light penetrates the room.  Miss

</b>               Yes, well these should help

     appropriate background actions.  Behind the Nurses'
     Counter, Alex is typing some forms and an older,
     obviously senior nurse is filling some paper cups with
     different sizes and colors of pills she is taking from
     the drug cabinet.  She is MRS. HOBBS, the chief nurse.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Has he been refusing food?

<b>                         MRS. HOBBS
</b>               Nothing quite as dramatic as
               that, Miss Price.  He just
               doesn't eat enough of what is
               put before him.  He suffers
               from nightmares.  I'd think he
               just needs a hand to hold.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.

     Alex takes the cups handed to her and makes her way
     down the hallway, pausing a moment to straighten her
     appearance.  She enters.

<b>19   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - DAY
</b>
     A ward with seven or eight beds in it, all occupied.
     She goes to a little Pakistani boy named BENJAMIN.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Hello, Benjamin.

<b>                         BENJAMIN
</b>               No.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               No what?

<b>                         BENJAMIN
</b>               No.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Well, all right then, be that
               way.  Here, swallow this.

<b>                         BENJAMIN
</b>               No.
     Alex pours a glass of water, gives the pill to Benjamin
     who promptly takes it and then drinks the water,
     handing Alex back the glass.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Feeling better?

<b>                         BENJAMIN
</b>               No.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               The doctor will be round
               later.  Would you like a
               picture book to look at?  We
               have some lovely funny Beanos.

<b>                         BENJAMIN
</b>               No.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Right.

     She exits, pausing in the hall to speak to a black
     Jamaican ORDERLY pushing a cart of lunch trays into
     Benjamin's ward.

               I'm an orderly, not a bleeding

               about, but I've little say

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Thank you.

     Alex holds up her head and proceeds to David's room.
     She hesitates, then peeks in.

<b>21   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     The curtains are drawn and David's lunch waits
     patiently on its tray alongside of the bed.  David is
     apparently asleep.  Alex enters softly.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (softly)

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               You haven't eaten your lunch.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I'm not very hungry, thank
               you.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               I'm afraid you have to eat
               something.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Please, really.  I'm not
               hungry.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               You put me in an awkward
               position, Mr. Kessler.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               How is that?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (she shakes the paper cup)
               Well, you're to take these
               after you've eaten.  Now what
               kind of nurse would I be if I
               failed in so simple a task as
               giving out some pills?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Leave the pills.  I'll take
               them later.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Sorry.

     She opens the curtains, daylight fills the room.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Aw come on, Miss Price!

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Call me Alex.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Aw come on, Alex!

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               Mr. Kessler?

     David is getting interested.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Call me David.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Shall I be forced to feed you,
               David?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               This is absurd.  I'm not
               hungry.  I don't want any
               food.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Right.

     Alex efficiently removes the covers from the dishes and
     sits on the edge of the bed.  Taking knife and fork in
     hand, she neatly cuts David's food into pieces.  David
     watches all this amused.  She places a napkin under
     David's chin and holds up his first bite on his fork.
     David folds his arms and refuses to open his mouth.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Let's try a little harder,
               shall we?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Will you give me a break?

     Alex grabs David's nose forcing his mouth open quickly,
     shoving the fork in it.  David is startled, but amused
     and chews his food slowly and swallows it.  Alex holds
     up another bite.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Will I have to take such
               drastic action again, David?

     David opens his mouth obediently.  Alex almost smiles.
     She feeds him for a while; they are both sizing each
     other up.  Finally:

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               May I have a glass of milk?

     Alex smiles.

</b>
<b>     FADE IN
</b>
<b>22   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY
</b>
     Again we are running fast and faster.  David again
     running naked, flying through the green forest.  He
     stops suddenly, ears perked, he looks about and then we
     hear Jack's o.s. screams.  The voice of Jack screams:

<b>                         JACK (O.S.)
</b>               David!  David!  Please help
               me!  Oh God!  David!  Oh my
               God!

     David turns in blind panic, he runs (and we run with
     him) desperately trying to find the source of Jack's
     screams.

     He comes to a clearing in the woods, light streaming
     through the tall trees.  Jack's screams halt in mid-
     word.  David looks in disbelief at the clearing.  There
     is a hospital bed with someone in it.  It is the same
     as David's.

     David walks toward it slowly.  The figure in the bed
     lays still.  It grows dark, very dark, and David looks
     up at the full moon.  There is a howl identical to the
     one heard earlier back on the moors.  David approaches
     the bed slowly, fearfully.  We hear ocean noises on the
     soundtrack, the sound of crashing surf.  David reaches
     out to pull back the covers, lightning and thunder
     cause him to hesitate for a second.  Silence.  The
     camera remains on David as he pulls off the covers.
     His face registers total disbelief and increasing
     horror.

     We cut to the bed to find - DAVID.  He lies there, pale
     white with purple lips and death pallor.

     The camera begins to move in on the corpse of David.

     Cut back to the standing David's terrified face; then
     continue until David's death mask fills the screen.
     The face remains still for several beats, then suddenly
     opens its bright yellow eyes and red mouth revealing
     fangs in a bloodcurdling wail which carries over in
     the....

     Mrs. Hobbs hears David's screams and efficiently calls
     out....

<b>                         MRS. HOBBS
</b>               Orderly!  Miss Gallagher!

     Miss Gallagher and an ORDERLY appear at once.

<b>                         MRS. HOBBS
</b>               Orderly, go at once to twenty-
               one and restrain the patient.

     The orderly exits.

</b>               Miss Gallagher, remain here at

     She exits.

<b>24   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</b>
     It is bright, daylight, and Dr. Hirsch gazes
     thoughtfully out the window.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               You've never had bad dreams
               before?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (upset)
               Sure, as a kid.  But never so
               real.  Never so bizarre.

     Dr. Hirsch crosses over and sits on a chair by the bed.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Did you get a good look at the
               man who attacked you?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I've told you, it wasn't a
               man.  It was an animal.  A big
               wolf or something.  A rabid
               dog.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>                    (chewing on his glasses)
               Yes.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've
               been traumatized, but Jack was
               torn apart.  I saw him.  A man
               can't do that to someone with
               his bare hands.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               You'd be surprised what
               horrors a man is capable of.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Did you see Jack?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               No.  In fact, your wounds were
               cleaned and dressed before you
               arrived here.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Did you talk to the police in
               East Proctor?  Did the cops go
               to The Slaughtered Lamb?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               I really don't know.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Then why the hell are you so
               quick to disbelieve me?  You
               yourself said it must have
               taken incredible strength to
               tear apart a person like that.
<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>                    (rubs his forehead)
               David, please.  The police are
               satisfied.  I'm certain that
               if a monster were out roaming
               northern England we'd have
               seen it on the telly.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               You really think I'm crazy,
               don't you?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Believe me.  The Hound of the
               Baskervilles was an invention
               of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's.
               And if you'd read the bloody
               book, you'd find that Holmes
               discovered your house of hell
               a fraud, a fake.

     There is an awkward silence as David sits and Dr.
     Hirsch is embarrassed at raising his voice.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Now really, David.  You're far
               too intelligent to go on this
               way.  When you return to
               America I want you to seek out
               a competent psychiatrist or
               psychologist or something and
               stop this nonsense.  You'll be
               leaving this hospital in three
               or four days, please remain
               sane.  At least until you are
               no longer our responsibility.

     Dr. Hirsch goes to the door.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Dr. Hirsch?
                    (pause)
               I'd rather not be by myself.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Of course not, David.  I'll
               fetch in young Miss Price.

     Alex sits next to David's bed.  Her shoes are off and
     she has her feet tucked up under her legs on the chair.
     The room is dark except for the lamp by which she
     reads.  She is reading A Connecticut Yankee in King
     Arthur's Court by Mark Twain.  David is asleep.  Alex
     reads for a bit, then puts down the book and yawns.
     She gets up and stretches, a big spreading arms and
     feet, fingers and toes stretch.

<b>                         DAVID

<b>                         DAVID

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               I've just started it.  My

     They look at each other.

<b>                         ALEX

<b>                         DAVID

</b>               I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               It's okay.  I want to talk to
               you.

     They sit and look at each other for a while longer.

<b>                         DAVID

<b>                         ALEX

               A Connecticut Yankee in King
               Arthur's Court by Samuel L.
               Clemens.  This is after the
               preface but before chapter
               one: A Word of Explanation.
               You all right?

               Ahem, A Word of Explanation.
               It was in Warwick Castle that
               I came across the curious
               stranger whom I am going to
               talk about.  He attracted me
               by three things: his candid
               simplicity, his marvelous
               familiarity with ancient
               armor, and the restfulness of
               his company - for he did all
               the talking.  We fell together
               as modest people will in the
               tail of the herd....

<b>26   INT. KESSLER HOME - NEW YORK - NIGHT
</b>
     We are at David's parents' house in New York.  His
     FATHER sits reading the paper in the living room as his
     younger BROTHER and SISTER watch "The Muppet Show" on
     television.  We can see past the small dining nook
     where David sits doing homework and into the kitchen
     where his MOTHER is washing the dishes.  A peaceful
     lower, middle class setting.  All is tranquil and
     secure.  There is a loud pounding on the front door.

<b>                         FATHER
</b>               I'll get it.

     The pounding continues.

<b>                         FATHER
</b>               All right, all right!  Hold
               your horses.

     (The following happens with shocking speed.)  When he
     opens the door, four beings open fire with machine
     guns, blowing him away.  The sudden burst of violence
     is terrifying and unrelenting.  The four rush into the
     room and the family looks at them in fearsome surprise
     for these men are not human at all, but loathsome,
     bestial demons dressed as Storm Troopers.  One kicks in
     the television and fires into the kitchen, blasting
     David's mother.  David rises but is forced back into
     his chair by one of the things and held there.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Stop!

     He watches in horror as his little brother and sister
     scream in terror before they are brutally murdered.
     The monstrous Storm Troopers then set fire to the
     rooms.  The one holding David pulls a knife and quickly
     slits David's throat.

</b>
     David bolts upright in bed and looks around, trying
     desperately to gain his bearings.  He sees that Alex is
     asleep in the chair by his bed, Connecticut Yankee
     folded on her lap.  He makes a deliberate effort to
     calm himself.  He considers waking her, then decides
     against it.  He turns on the lamp by his bed and
     reaches over to take the book from Alex's lap.  David
     takes the book as gently as possible, but Alex wakes up
     anyway.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (yawns, smiles)
               Hello.  You all right?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I'm sorry I woke you up.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Don't be silly.  Can I get you
               something?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               No, thank you.  Just keep me
               company for a while.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               That's easy enough.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I keep having these really
               terrible dreams.  They are
               getting worse and I can't seem
               to stop them.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David, your dreams will stop.
               You'll leave England and your
               bad memories; and then this
               will all fade away.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Will you come with me?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (taken aback)
               What?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (smiling)
               I'm serious.  You don't know
               me and I know nothing about
               you.  We have a perfect
               relationship.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Now, David, I said I would
               keep you company, but I meant
               right here and now.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Will you think about it?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               How did we get from your bad
               dreams to my taking a holiday
               with a patient?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (big grin)
               Not just a patient -- me.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               You're being awfully forward,
               aren't you?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Forgive me, I'm trying to
               cheer myself up and an affair
               with a beautiful nurse seemed
               like just the thing to do it.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (smiles)
               All I am to you is a sex
               fantasy then?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Now I'm embarrassed.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Good.  I thought for a moment
               I was the only embarrassed one
               in the room.

     There is an awkward pause.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Where were we in the book?

     Alex is relieved for something to break the tension.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (looking through
                     the book)
               Let me see here.

<b>     FADE IN
</b>
<b>28   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
</b>
     The black Orderly hustles in with David's breakfast
     tray, busily setting up the tray on the table over the
     bed.  He awakens the sleeping David with his activity.

<b>                         ORDERLY
</b>               Ah you're up.  Good morning
               and a good day to you.  We've
               quite a meal for you here this
               morning.  Bacon, oatmeal,
               orange juice, and toast with
               jam.  Good stuff there.  Now
               eat it up and I'll be back for
               the dishes when you've
               finished.

     The Orderly exits.  The drowsy David, who has been
     trying to fully wake up during the Orderly's speech,
     notices his exit.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Good morning.

     He looks at his food none too happily.  He sticks a
     spoon into the bowl of oatmeal and tastes is gingerly.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (in mock English accent)
               Please, sir, I want some more.

     He settles down to eating, reaches over to butter his
     toast and drink his juice.  While he eats, we hear
     Jack's o.s. voice.

<b>                         JACK (O.S.)
</b>               Can I have a piece of toast?

     David looks over to the o.s. Jack.  Jack, behaving
     relaxed and normal, sits in the chair last occupied by
     Alex.  However, Jack's appearance makes his casual
     manner all the more surreal.  He is as we left him
     butchered on the moors.  He is covered with dried mud
     and open wounds.  Huge glistening gashes abound on his
     body.  His face is scratched, his throat is badly torn,
     and his hair is matted with blood.  In several spots he
     has already begun to rot.  He is a remarkably gruesome
     sight, but his physical state seems not to affect him
     at all.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (pleasantly)
               Nice to see you.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (unbelieving)
               Get the fuck out of here,
               Jack.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Thanks a lot.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (horrified)
               This is too much.  I can't
               handle this.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I'm aware that I don't look so
               great, but I thought you'd be
               glad to see me.

     Jack gets up and takes a piece of toast from David's
     tray as David watches amazed.  Jack returns to his seat
     and takes a bite out of his toast.  David stares at
     Jack horrified.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               David!  You're hurting my
               feelings.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (astounded)
               Hurting your feelings?  Has it
               occurred to you that it may be
               unsettling to have you rise
               from your grave to visit me?
               Listen to me, I'm talking to a
               hamburger!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I'm sorry to be upsetting you,
               David, but I had to come.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (aghast)
               Aren't you supposed to be
               buried in New York someplace?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Yeah.  Your parents came to my
               funeral.  I was surprised at
               how many people came.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (resigned)
               Why should you be surprised?
               You were a very well-liked
               person.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Debbie Klein cried a lot.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I can't stand it.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               So you know what she does?
               She's so grief stricken she
               runs to find solace in Rudy
               Levine's bed.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Rudy Levine the shmuck?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Life mocks me even in death.

     Jack takes another bite of toast.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (to himself)
               I'm going completely crazy.

<b>                         JACK
</b>                    (loud)
               David!

               What?!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               David, now I know this may be
               hard for you, but I have to
               warn you.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (shouting)
               Warn me?  Will you get out of
               here, you meat loaf?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I'm a grisly sight, it's true;
               but I love you and that's why
               I'm here.  You've got to know.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               If you love me so much, Jack,
               you'll realize how
               disconcerting it is to share
               one's breakfast with the
               living dead!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               We were attacked by a

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (covers his ears)
               I'm not listening!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               On the moors, we were attacked
               by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Shut up, you zombie!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I was murdered, an unnatural
               death, and now I walk the
               earth in limbo until the
               werewolf's curse is lifted.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (incredulous, furious)
               What's wrong with you?  Shut
               up!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               The wolf's bloodline must be
               severed.  The last remaining
               werewolf must be destroyed.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Will you be quiet?!

     Jack rises and comes closer to David.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               It's you, David.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               What?!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You survived and now you shall

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               What are you talking about?  I
               won't accept this!  Get out!
               God damit!

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Remember what that guy at The
               Slaughtered Lamb said?
               `Beware the moon.'

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Beware the moon.  The full

<b>                         DAVID

               Jack, please go away.  Please
               go away.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You'll stalk the streets of

     laying in bed rocking from side to side, crying softly.
     He is alone.  Alex rushes over, removes the tray, sits
     on the bed and hugs David.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David?  David!

     David pulls away sharply, his head jerking about wildly
     until he focuses on Alex's face and begins to breathe
     easier.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David, what's wrong?

     David smiles and kisses her, a real kiss.

</b>                    (quietly)

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               A werewolf?

     Alex holds David a moment then realizes where she is
     and backs off a little.  David composes himself.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Are you better now?

<b>                         DAVID

     David takes Alex's hand.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               My friend Jack was just here.

<b>                         ALEX

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Yeah.  He says that I will
               become a monster in two days.
               What do you think?

<b>                         ALEX

               about the possibility of your
               becoming a monster in two days
               or about visits from dead

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I was dreaming again?

<b>                         ALEX

</b>                    (resigned)

               watch the telly while I take a

     Alex enters the room and David whistles softly, rocking
     on his heels.

<b>37   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

     David and Alex stand facing each other under the stream
     of water in the shower.

     shoulders.  David and Alex kiss again and again and....

     David and Alex in a passionate, orgasmic kiss in Alex's

               Good.

     Alex props herself up on one elbow.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David, you don't honestly
               believe that in reality your
               friend Jack rose from the
               grave to breakfast with you?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I was awake and he was in my

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               But, David.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (firm)
               I wasn't hallucinating.

     Pause.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (smiles)
               Tomorrow is the full moon.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               That's good, Alex.  Reassure
               me.

     Alex begins kissing David's neck.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               It's all right, I know I'm
               being insane.

     She kisses his shoulders, then his chest.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Okay, okay.  I'm properly
               reassured!

     Alex is now kissing his stomach, her head gradually
     lowers from frame.  David reaches back over his head to
     hold onto the headboard of the bed.

<b>     INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Alex is asleep holding David.  David carefully lifts
     her arm and gets out of bed.  He is naked.  He tiptoes
     out of the room and goes to the bathroom.

<b>39   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     David lifts the toilet seat and pees.  He winces,
     hoping the steady stream doesn't awaken Alex.  When
     he's finished peeing he goes to the sink.  The medicine
     cabinet door over the sink is open.  When David closes
     it he (and the audience) is terrified to see Jack
     reflected standing behind him.  (Note: This is a big
     scare.)  Bloodied and horrible, Jack has continued to
     rot and looks even worse than when we last saw him.
     David chokes out a strangled cry, closes his eyes
     tightly and then reopens them.  Jack is still there in
     the mirror.  When David turns around Jack is standing
     in the doorway.

<b>                         DAVID

                     finger)

</b>               Don't be an asshole, David.
               Come here.

     David, clearly troubled, follows Jack into the living
     room.

<b>40   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM
</b>
     Jack sits down and motions for David to sit also.  He
     does.  David's conversation is in whispers, so as not
     to wake up Alex.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               What are you doing here?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I wanted to see you.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Okay, you've seen me.  Now go
               away.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               David, I'm sorry I upset you
               yesterday, but you must

     The pub is less crowded than when we were here last.
     The Dart Player is behind the bar cleaning glasses, the

     enters and crosses to the bar.  As he removes his
     gloves:

     The Woman comes in from the back.

     Dr. Hirsch crosses and joins the Chess Player at his
     table.

<b>                         CHESS PLAYER
</b>               Oh, yes, yes.

     Dr. Hirsch points to the pentangle on the wall.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH

               Oh, that's been there for two
               hundred years.  We were going
               to paint it out, but it's
               traditional, so we left it.

               No, no, hardly.  I work in the

     The Dart Player and Chess Player exchange a look.

</b>               He was talking about

<b>45   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY
</b>
     We find Alex and David in an embrace by the front door.
     Alex is dressed in her nurse's uniform and David has
     jeans and a T-shirt on.  He is shoeless and obviously
     not going out.  Alex pulls away.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Let me go now, you'll make me
               late.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Anything.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Tell me that it's silly of me
               to be apprehensive.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               It's silly of you to be
               apprehensive.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Werewolves simply do not
               exist.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (serious)
               David, do you want me to stay

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Yeah, I do, but go to work.

     He opens the door and they both go outside.

     walk to the sidewalk.  It is rather chilly.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Listen, if you get too
               anxious, call me at the

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Okay.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               I've left those pills for you.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               A doper werewolf.

     They kiss again.
<b>                         ALEX
</b>               I'm off.  There's food in the
               fridge.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               See you later.

     Alex goes off, turning for a last wave.  David stands
     looking after her when a LITTLE GIRL walking a dog
     passes by.  The dog, on seeing David, begins to growl
     and snarl.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (to dog)
               What did I do?

     The dog begins barking ferociously, the little girl
     tugging on his leash.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Thanks a lot, dog.

     He realizes just how cold he is outside and runs back
     up the steps to find the door locked.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Wonderful.

     Cut to shot of David's bare feet on the cold stone.  He
     mutters to himself, imitating a newscaster.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               An American werewolf was found
               frozen to death today in the
               heart of London, England.

     He looks around and sees that there is a small window
     ajar on the side of the flat about eleven feet off the
     ground, which can be reached by climbing a brick wall,
     which he does but not without damage to his bare toes.

     At the top of the wall is a cat that begins to hiss on
     seeing David.  The hair stands up on its arched back
     and it glares at David, hissing and spitting.  David is
     disturbed by the cat's hostile behavior.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               What did I do, cat?

     The cat is really acting fierce.  When David goes to
     pat it cautiously, it screeches and runs away.  David
     is, by this time, not amused.  David manages to pull
     himself into the window.

<b>47   INT. ALEX'S BATHROOM - DUSK
</b>
     David awkwardly enters the bathroom through the tiny
     window.  Finally getting both feet on the ground, he
     steps to the sink and regards himself in the mirror.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (weakly)
               Snarl.  Growl.  Grrrr.

     He examines his mouth, touching his canines carefully.
     After a while he sighs and goes into the kitchen.

<b>48   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK
</b>
     David goes straight to the fridge and opens it.  He
     closes the fridge and walks into the bedroom.

<b>49   INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DUSK
</b>
     He lays down on the bed.  After a few beats of staring
     at the ceiling, he rises and goes back into the
     kitchen.

<b>50   INT. ALEX'S KITCHEN - DUSK
</b>
     He reopens the fridge.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I'm not hungry.

     He closes the fridge and walks into the living room.

<b>51   INT. ALEX'S LIVING ROOM - DUSK
</b>
     David turns on the television.  On Thames is a soccer
     match.  On BBC 1 is some truly insipid children's
     program, and on BBC 2 is a soccer match.  David
     switches off the television.

     He sits on the chair nervously, drumming his fingers
     and humming.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (singing)
               `Moon River, wider than a mile
               I'm crossing you in style,
               Someday....'

     David gets up, goes to the front door, and flings it
     open.  It is getting dark.  David views this fearfully,
     but still not completely convinced.  He goes back
     inside and we note that the front door is not
     completely closed.  He goes back into the bathroom and
     looks into the mirror.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Fee fi fo fum, I smell the
               blood of an Englishman.

     He goes back into the living room and paces round and
     round the room like a caged animal.

<b>52   INT. CHILDREN'S WARD - NIGHT

     Alex is back with Benjamin, the little Pakistani.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               How are we feeling tonight?

<b>                         BENJAMIN

</b>                    (smiling)
               Benjamin, have you ever been
               severely beaten about the face
               and neck?

<b>                         BENJAMIN
</b>               No.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               I thought not.

     She tucks him in.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               You sleep now and have sweet
               dreams.

<b>                         BENJAMIN &amp; ALEX
</b>               No!

     For the first time, Benjamin smiles.  As Alex tucks him
     in, we can clearly see the full moon outside through
     the window.

<b>53   INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT
</b>
     David sits reading Connecticut Yankee when he suddenly
     clutches his head in pain.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Jesus Christ!

     He stands in agony, the book falls to the floor.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (screams)
               What?  Christ!  What?

     He begins sweating profusely, clinging to the sides of
     his head.  He trembles violently.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I'm burning up!  Jesus!

     He rips at his shirt, tearing it off.  His body is
     dripping wet.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (shouts out in
                     pain and fear)
               Jack!?  Where are you now, you
               fucker!?!

     As a new spasm of pain wracks his body, he cries out in
     anguish.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Help me!  Somebody help me,
               please!  Jack!!

     David's hair is wringing wet.  He screams and grabs at
     his legs.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (pleading, whimpering)
               I'm sorry I called you a meat
               loaf, Jack.

     New bolts of agonizing pain wrack through David's body.
     He grabs at his pants, pulling them off as if they are
     burning him.
     Standing naked in the center of the room, David gasps
     for air.

     He falls to his knees and then forward on his hands.
     He remains on his hands and knees, trying to master his
     torment; but it's no use.  On all fours he gives
     himself over to the excruciating hurt and slowly begins
     to change.

     The metamorphosis from man into beast is not an easy
     one.  As bone and muscle bend and reform themselves,
     the body suffers lacerating pain.  We can actually see
     David's flesh move, the rearranging tissue.  His mouth
     bleeds as fangs emerge.  His whole face distorts as his
     jaw extends, his skull literally changing shape before
     our eyes.  His hands gnarl and his fingers curl back as
     claws burst forward.

     The camera pans up to show the full moon outside
     through the window.  David's moans change slowly into
     low guttural growls.  We hear the four footfalls as the
     WOLF begins to walk.  As the camera pans back over the
     room, we see the front door pushed open and hear the
     Wolf padding off into the darkness.


<b>54   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

     A taxi pulls up in front of a block of flats.  An
     attractive couple gets out.  The Man pays the driver
     and the cab drives off.

<b>                         WOMAN
</b>               Which one, Harry?

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               Come on.

     Harry takes her hand and leads her around the side of
     the flats.  The apartments back up to a park and the
     two walk around to the rear.  The park is dark and
     quiet.

</b>               No.  Here we are, Sean's is
               the one....

     THE WOLF SPRINGS!  Before the Woman can scream, the
     Wolf whirls around and goes for her throat.  We can't
     see clearly, but we see enough to realize how large the
     Wolf is and that its wolfen features are twisted and
     demonic.  The Wolf savagely devours its two victims.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH

     Dr. Hirsch waits on the phone, finally hanging up.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               He's not there.

     Alex grows worried.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               He's not?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Alex, has David persisted in
               his werewolf fantasies?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Well, yes, but he seems to be
               more upset by the death of his
               friend.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Has his friend appeared to him
               again?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               What did he say?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David says Jack comes to warn
               him.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Warn him?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong?  Is
               this more serious than I know?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               I tried to investigate the
               attack.  There are no records.
               The case was closed and now
               they've `misplaced' the file.
               David's lacerations were
               cleaned and dressed when he
               arrived here and yet
               supposedly no doctor examined
               him before I did.  The Goodman
               boy is already in the ground
               so he's no good to us.  So I
               went to the pub in East
               Proctor where I was convinced
               of two things.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               They were lying.  There were
               no witnesses, no escaped
               lunatic.  The whole community
               is hiding the truth of what
               actually happened up there.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               And what else?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               I think the village of East
               Proctor is hiding some dark
               and terrible secret.  I'm
               convinced that, like David,
               they believe in this werewolf.

     Alex is flabbergasted.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               You've absolutely no idea
               where David might be?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               No.  He knows no one in
               London, besides me.  I
               shouldn't have left him alone.

     Suddenly.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Surely you're not
               suggesting....

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               David has suffered a severe
               trauma.  I myself witnessed
               some form of mass neurosis in
               East Proctor.  If all the
               villagers believe that Jack
               Goodman was killed by a
               werewolf, why shouldn't David?
               And then it follows that if he
               survived an attack by a
               werewolf, wouldn't he himself
               become a werewolf the next
               full moon?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>                    (bewildered)
               Dr. Hirsch?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Oh, I don't mean running about
               on all fours and howling at
               the moon.  But in such a
               deranged state he could harm
               himself, or perhaps others.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               What shall we do?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Let's call the police and see
               if they can help us find our
               wandering boy.

     The bombed-out ruins of this unsavory part of London
     are stark and uninviting in the moonlight.  Three old
     DERELICTS are huddled around a trash can fire trying to
     keep warm.  A skinny dog is tied up beside them.  Its
     ears perk up and he growls in warning.

     An unearthly howl shatters the night.  We've heard this
     sound on the moors.

<b>                         DERELICT #2
</b>               That's not Winston.

<b>                         DERELICT #3

     He points out into the night.  They strain their eyes -
     something is approaching them.  They can just make out

     A train SCREECHES to a halt.  (A scare.)  We are in the
     tubes of London.  Only one passenger disembarks and the
     train goes off, leaving him alone in the cavernous
     hallways.  The PASSENGER is a young man, rather well-
     dressed.  He looks about the platform, then at his
     watch.  He walks up to a vending machine to buy a
     Cadbury Chocolate Bar.

     thoughtfully, wondering if he had heard something.
     Satisfied that he is alone, he begins his walk down one
     of the long serpentine tunnels that make up London's
     tubes.  He feels he's being followed and turns slowly
     to look.  There is no one and he continues, concerned
     about his imagination.

</b>
     The Passenger reaches the landing and walks briskly
     down the long tunnel marked "Escalator to Street
     Level".  He is being followed.  He hears it and we hear
     it.  He stops, frightened.

     beginning to panic.

</b>               I can assure you that this is

     He looks around wildly.

     Reaching the escalator, he begins to run up the moving

     defeated, the blood trickling from his nose.

     It is early morning and all the animals are aroused.
     We cut around to roaring cats, screeching monkeys, and
     panicky birds, etc., until we come to the Wolves' cage
     where we find David, naked and curled up on the ground
     by the cage, asleep.  David wakes up slowly.  He is
     completely naked, his body dirty, with several
     scratches on his torso and legs.  He yawns and
     stretches, makes a face, and with his finger picks
     something distasteful from his teeth.  He also notices
     something under his fingernails and as he goes to clean
     them, he suddenly does a complete Stan Laurel
     discovering where he is.  He puts his hands over his
     eyes.

</b>               Wake me up, Alex.

     He slowly peaks through his fingers; he's still there.
     He stands up and looks around.

     The zoo opens and women with prams and children hustle
     about.  David sees them coming towards him, notes his
     lack of clothes, and decides it would be better for all
     concerned if they did not meet.  He looks around for a
     suitable hiding place and dashes behind some bushes.
     He crouches down so that he can't be seen, scratching
     himself on a thorn.

     Alex sits holding David's torn T-shirt.  She is trying

               nothing.  Thank you, yes,

     now more worried than ever.

     David is still behind the bushes.  He looks to see if
     the coast is clear, then stands up and parts the

     gets dressed as Alex watches in amazement.  David is
     excited, even euphoric.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Alex, I've lost my mind.  I
               woke up at the zoo!  But you
               know what?  I feel terrific!

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               The zoo?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Waking up at the zoo, that's
               not so insane.  Having no
               clothes on?  That's insane.
               What did I do last night,
               Alex?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Don't you remember?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I said goodbye to you.  I was
               locked out of the flat.  I
               climbed the wall and came in
               through the bathroom window.
               I started to read and then I
               was naked at the zoo!
                    (big smile)
               I guess I am out of my fucking
               mind.

     Alex sits next to him and puts her arm around his
     shoulders.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               I worried about you.  We
               didn't know where you were.

     David kisses her, a desperate kiss, and she kisses back
     with equal passion.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Where did you get that coat?

     David laughs.

<b>73   INT. DR. HIRSCH'S OFFICE

</b>
     The phone rings.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               I'll get it.

     Alex goes to the phone.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Hello?

     The telephone conversation is intercut between Alex and
     Dr. Hirsch.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Alex, have you heard anything?

     Alex speaks softly so that David won't hear her.
<b>                         ALEX
</b>               He's here.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>                    (excited)
               Is he all right?  Why didn't
               you call me?  Where was he?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               He doesn't remember.  He woke
               up at the zoo.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               The zoo?  Is he rational?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes, he is.  He's very excited
               and confused, but he's not
               crazy, if that's what you
               mean.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Have you read the papers
               today?  Have you listened to
               the radio or television?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               No, why?

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Is David acting strangely?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               No, not really.

     Dr. Hirsch considers.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Could you get here without any
               trouble?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes, I should think so.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Right.  Now listen carefully.
               I want you to bring David
               here.  I want him in my care.
               I'll notify the police that
               we've found him.  It is
               imperative that you bring him
               straight to the hospital.  Do
               you understand?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Yes, Doctor.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               You're certain he's lucid?
               You won't need any help?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               He's fine.  We'll come right
               over.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Shall I send a car?

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               No, a cab will be faster.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               I expect you shortly.

     Dr. Hirsch hangs up, checks a piece of paper, and then
     dials again.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Yes, Scotland Yard?

     Alex is signaling for a taxi.

</b>               My body feels alive, alert.  I

     A taxi pulls up; Alex opens the door.

               mutilated.  A real maniac this
               one.

<b>                         DAVID

     The cab pulls to the sidewalk.

     David gets out of the cab.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David, wait!

     She hurriedly hands the Driver some money and takes off
     after David.

<b>                         ALEX

     He turns and faces her.

<b>                         DAVID

               going to the police.

     David takes off walking briskly down the street.  Alex
     has to jog to keep up with him.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David, please be rational.

<b>                         DAVID

               Nothing to look at.  Move

     He begins to cry.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Leave me alone!

     He runs out into the street.  Cars slam on their

               Hello?  Rachel?  Just say yes,
               you'll accept the charges.
               Just say yes, Rachel.  Is Mom
               or Dad home?  Where are they?
               Where's Max?  You're all
               alone?  Mom and Dad wouldn't
               leave me alone when I was ten.
               No, not ten and a half either.
               I'm still in London.  I'm all
               better.  Look, would you tell
               Mom and Dad that I love them?
               I don't care, Rachel, just do
               it for me.  Okay?  Good.  And,
               Rachel, don't fight with Max.
               Well, try.  Look, kid, please
               don't forget to tell Mom and
               Dad I love them.  I love Max
               and you, too.  Well, I do.
               No, I'm not being weird, you
               little creep.  You promise?
               Okay.  Be a good girl.  I love

     He hangs up in profound depression.  Leaving the booth
     he sees an outdoor clock.  It is 4:15.  He sighs, then
     catches sight of something.

<b>81   EXT. CINEMA - DAY - DAVID'S P.O.V.

     There stands Jack, now truly rotted and ghastly.  He's
     pretty much dried out, a third of his face gone
     revealing the grinning skull.  He waves to David.  Jack
     points inside the theater and goes in.  David smiles,
     walks across the intersection, and up to the box
     office.

<b>                         TICKET LADY
</b>               Two and a half quid, please.

     David reaches in his pocket.  All he has are traveler's
     checks.

<b>                         DAVID

     A film (to be determined) plays on screen.  The small
     theater is mostly empty.  A few snoring BUMS and wide-
     eyed CHILDREN are scattered about.  Jack sits in the
     last row in the shadows.  He waves to David.  David
     goes and sits next to him.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Hi, Jack.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Hi, David.

     They sit for a while watching the screen.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               What can I say, Jack?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               You don't have to say

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Aren't you going to say, `I

<b>                         JACK
</b>               If I was still alive, I

<b>                         DAVID

</b>                    (apologizes quickly)
               I didn't mean it.  I don't
               know what I'm saying.  I'm not
               even sure it was me who killed
               those people.  I don't
               remember doing it.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               What about the zoo?

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Well, even if I'm not the
               wolfman, I am crazy enough to
               do something like that.  I
               mean, here I sit in Leicester
               Square talking to a corpse.
               I'm glad to see you, Jack.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               I want you to meet some
               people.

     Sitting down the row from Jack is a man, GERALD
     BRINGSLY, completely in the shadow.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               David Kessler, this is Gerald

</b>               Hello.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Gerald is the man you murdered
               in the subway.  We thought it
               best you didn't see him as
               he's a fresh kill and still
               pretty messy.

               Yes, I do look most
               unpleasant.

     The camera pans down to show the blood dripping from
     the seat to a puddle on the floor.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (horrified)
               Why are you doing this to me,
               Jack?

<b>                         BRINGSLY
</b>               This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea.
               He is your good friend,
               whereas I am a victim of your
               carnivorous lunar activities.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (appalled)
               Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry.  I
               have absolutely no idea what
               to say to you.

<b>                         BRINGSLY
</b>               You've left my wife a widow
               and my children fatherless.
               And I understand that I am to
               walk the earth one of the
               living dead until the wolf's
               bloodline is severed and the
               curse lifted.

     Bringlsy leans forward almost into the light, he
     glistens.

<b>                         BRINGSLY
</b>               You must die, David Kessler.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               David, this is Harry Berman
               and his fiancee Judith Browns.

     The two victims lean forward from their seats next to
     Mr. Bringsly.  We can just make out that Harry has one
     arm missing.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               And these gentlemen are Alf,
               Ted, and Joseph.

     The Three Derelicts sit next to Harry and Judith.  All
     are slick in the darkness, the light from the screen
     illuminating their gore.

               You must take your own life!

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               That's easy for you to say -
               you're already dead.

<b>                         BRINGSLY
</b>               No, David.  Harry and I and
               everyone you murder are not
               dead.  The undead.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>                    (to Jack)
               Why are you doing this to me?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Because this must be stopped.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               How shall I do it?

<b>                         JUDITH

<b>                         DERELICT #1
</b>               Not sure enough.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               I could hang myself.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               If you did it wrong, it would
               be painful.  You'd choke to
               death.

<b>                         DERELICT #3
</b>               So what?  Let `im choke.

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Do you mind?  The man's a
               friend of mine.

<b>                         DERELICT #3

<b>                         BRINGSLY
</b>               Gentlemen, please.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               A gun.

<b>                         DERELICT #1
</b>               I know where he can get a gun.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Don't I need a silver bullet
               or something?

<b>                         JACK
</b>               Be serious, would you?

     David puts his head in his hands.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Madness.  I've gone totally
               mad.

<b>                         HARRY
</b>               A gun is good.

<b>                         JUDITH
</b>               You just put the gun to your
               forehead and pull the trigger.

<b>                         BRINGSLY
</b>               If you put it in your mouth,
               then you'd be sure not to
               miss.

<b>                         DAVID
</b>               Thank you, you're all so
               thoughtful.

     As the conversation continues, the camera pulls back
     from the grisly tableau.  David grabs his head
     suddenly.

     David is dripping wet and shaking violently.  Three

     Roars and screams come from inside the theater.  The

     The Ticket Taker enters the theater.  The movie
     continues on screen, but all else is quiet.  He
     cautiously continues down the aisle.  He sees something
     and makes his way towards it.  He looks down in horror.

     One cop stays with the lady, the other rushes inside.

<b>89   INT. CINEMA - NIGHT

     The cop enters a side door to find several bloodied
     corpses.  He hears something, looks over to see the
     Wolf hunched over a victim.  The Wolf turns, eyes
     blazing, mouth dripping with blood.  We see it clearly
     for the first time.  It is truly a hound from hell, its
     wolfen features a hideous sight.  Its eyes fierce,
     burning green.  The Wolf roars and starts for the cop.
     The cop rushes out and slams the door behind him.

     Police cars arrive, sirens blaring.  Officers are
     pushing the crowd back as other men help hold the door
     closed against the Wolf's battering.

     Wolf, eyes blazing.  It leaps on Lt. Villiers, savaging
     him.  The crowd falls back in panic.

     The Wolf runs into traffic, a cab swerves to avoid
     hitting it and plows into fleeing pedestrians hurling
     one through a shop window.  Mass confusion as orders
     are shouted and the police pursue the Wolf.

     It runs down an alleyway into a cul de sac.  It stops
     in the darkness, blocked by a brick wall.  The Wolf
     whirls around, defiant, roaring.  The cops quickly
     barricade the entrance to the alley.

<b>94   INT. TAXI - NIGHT
</b>
     The taxi is halted by the traffic jam in Leicester
     Square.  Police vehicles roar past.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David!  It's David!

     She jumps from the car before Dr. Hirsch can stop her.


<b>95   EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT
</b>
     The police arrive with weapons and efficiently ring the
     alley.  Alex runs to them.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               Let me through!

<b>                         COP
</b>               Stand clear, miss!

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               I must get through!

     Alex dodges the cop and runs into the alley.  The
     officers shout after her.  Dr. Hirsch reaches the
     police line.

<b>                         DR. HIRSCH
</b>               Alex!

     Alex walks towards the dark end of the alley.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David?  Is it you?  Is it
               true, David?

     She's almost to the end.  The Wolf lays in wait in the
     shadows.  The police raise their weapons.

<b>                         ALEX
</b>               David?

     THE WOLF REARS UP.  In that brief instant, Alex
     realizes it will kill her.

<b>                         OFFICER
</b>               Fire!

     The guns blaze.  The Wolf falls dead.  Alex leans on
     the wall, numb.  The cops, Dr. Hirsch, and Sgt. McManus
     run to the dead Wolf only to find David, naked and
     riddled with bullets.  Alex begins to weep.

<b>                                                  FADE TO:
</b>
<b>     BLACK
</b>
<b>     END CREDITS OVER BLACK
</b>
     SONG: The fifties rock version of "Blue Moon".
