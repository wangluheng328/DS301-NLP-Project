Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are deported from London to the house of an eccentric professor during World War II.
They find life in the house extremely dull, until Lucy discovers a wardrobe that leads to a magical world called Narnia, where animals can talk and all are ruled over by the wise and benevolent lion Aslan.
The others don't believe her at first, but soon all of them go through the wardrobe and discover all is not well in Narnia.
The land is being kept in a perpetual winter by the evil White Witch, Jadis, who turns anyone who doesn't obey her into stone.
The children join Aslan and the animals loyal to him in an attempt to vanquish Jadis.
