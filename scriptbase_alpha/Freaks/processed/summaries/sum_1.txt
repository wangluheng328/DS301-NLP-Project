A traveling circus has a wide variety of acts, including a number of sideshow curiosities based on some unusual physical attributes.
They include midgets, limbless people, pinheads, conjoined twins, a bearded lady, and a half man/half woman.
There are many interpersonal interactions between the entire troupe, those interactions which are generally amiable, although there are some who treat the curiosities merely as freaks.
However, there are few romantic relationships between the "normal" troupe members and the curiosities.
One of those exceptions is the budding romantic relationship between Hans and Cleopatra, one of the midgets and a trapeze artist respectively.
What Hans is unaware of is that Cleopatra only fosters that relationship because of the expensive gifts he lavishes on her, while in reality she carries on with who is probably the antithesis of Hans physically, Hercules, the muscle man.
A fellow midget, Frieda, who was once engaged to Hans and who she still loves, believes Cleopatra's interest in Hans is solely to make fun.
But Frieda inadvertently provides Cleopatra with some information which changes Cleopatra's resolve instead to marry Hans.
Hans' fellow sideshow curiosities do whatever they need to protect their dignity and that of one of their own.
