The central story is of conniving trapeze artist Cleopatra, who seduces and marries sideshow midget Hans after learning of his large inheritance.
At their wedding reception, the other "freaks" announce that they accept Cleopatra in spite of her being a "normal" outsider; they hold an initiation ceremony in which they pass a massive goblet of wine around the table while chanting, "We accept her!
We accept her!
One of us!
One of us!
Gooble-gobble, gooble-gobble!"
The ceremony frightens the drunken Cleopatra, who accidentally reveals that she has been having an affair with Hercules, the strong man.
She mocks the freaks, tosses the wine in their faces, and drives them away.
Despite being humiliated, Hans remains with Cleopatra.

Hans soon becomes ill. Cleopatra had poisoned his wedding wine, and she continues to slip poison into his medicine, planning to inherit his money and run away with Hercules.
Another circus performer, Venus, overhears the conspirator couple discussing the murder plot and tells Hans and the other freaks.
In the film's climax, the freaks attack the evil pair during a storm, wielding guns, knives, and other sharp-edged weapons.
Hercules is not seen again (although the film's original ending had the freaks castrating him; the audience sees him later singing in falsetto).
As for Cleopatra, she has become a grotesque, squawking "human duck."
The flesh of her hands has been melted and deformed to look like duck feet and her lower half has been permanently tarred and feathered.

In an ending MGM threw in later for a "happier ending", Hans is living a millionaire's life in a huge house.
Venus and her clown boyfriend Phroso visit, bringing Frieda, to whom Hans had been engaged before Cleopatra swooped in.
Frieda comforts Hans when he starts to cry, assuring him that she knew he hadn't wanted the revenge to get that severe.
