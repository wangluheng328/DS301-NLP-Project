Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is an unemployed 23-year-old hipster in a going-nowhere garage rock band who is dating an underage 17-year-old high school girl, Knives Chau (Ellen Wong).
He is completely self-absorbed and oblivious anyone else's needs but his own until one day Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) becomes the object of his obsessions for basically no reason.
Ramona is a shrill, unlikable, damaged hipster who is only likable to Scott.
No one knows what her past is, but Scott will find out very soon as he tries to make Ramona his new girlfriend, cheating on his devastated underage girlfriend.
Before Scott can begin dating Ramona, he must prove himself by defeating the league of her seven exes who control her love life.
They will do anything to get rid of and destroy any new boyfriend Ramona may consider.
If Scott wants to find true love with Ramona, he must defeat all seven, faster than you can say "career ender"
