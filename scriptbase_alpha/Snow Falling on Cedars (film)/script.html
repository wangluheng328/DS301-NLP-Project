   <title>"Snow Falling on Cedars", early, by Ronald Bass</title>



   <pre>








<b>                         SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS
</b>







                                                   Ronald Bass
                                                   First Draft Screenplay
                                                   March 3, 1997





<b>     EXT. THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - NIGHT
</b>
     Fog.  Penetrated only by sound.  The LAPPING of sea at a drifting
     hull.  Tendrils of mist part, revealing...

     ...a face.  Strong and blond and handsome.

<b>     SUPERIMPOSE:  SEPTEMBER 15, 1954
</b>
     LONG ANGLE...from below, we watch CARL HEINE, high on the cross
     spar of his mast.  He has pulled a SHUTTLE of TWINE from his rubber
     overalls, and is LASHING a LANTERN in the cloud of mist, as MAIN
<b>     TITLES BEGIN...
</b>
     ANGLE...the tiny, meticulously neat cabin.  Empty, silent.  A tin
     COFFEE CUP on the counter's edge.  The battery well open, revealing
     two large BATTERIES in place.  PAN to...

     ...the deck of this sturdy stern-picker.  The fishing net stretched
     from the huge DRUM into the sea.  Keep PANNING to the bow, where...

     ...Carl stands with his kerosene lantern and his air horn, watching
     as another BOAT comes slowly out of the mist.  The silhouette of a
     FISHERMAN, holding a long fishing GAFF.  As fragments of fog part,
     we CLOSE on the figure's face, to see...

     ...his eyes.  They are Asian.  SMASH CUT to...

<b>     EXT. THE SUSAN MARIE, SHIP CHANNEL BANK - MORNING
</b>
     Blinding sun.  Our boat bobs lifeless on placid water.  As CREDITS
     CONTINUE, two figures slowly reel in the massive net.  SHERIFF ART
     MORAN is painfully thin, unimposing, methodical.  Only the eyes
     reflect his disquiet.  His young deputy, ABEL MARTINSON, cuts
     anxious looks between his mentor and the sea.  As the net brings
     silvered salmon across the gunnel, CUT to...

     ...the cabin.  Tidy as before.  Only two things have changed.
     CLOSE on the tin coffee cup, which now lies OVERTURNED on the
     floor.  PAN above the open battery well, where a third MARINE
     BATTERY now stands next to the wheel.  CUT to...

     ...the stern, as the raveling net LIFTS from the water's surface...

     ...the face of Carl Heine.  Turned to the sun.  SMASH CUT to...

<b>     INT. CORONER'S LAB - DAY
</b>
     WHITE fills the frame.  A hand PULLS back the blanket-shroud
     revealing Carl's face.  As CREDITS CONTINUE, tilt up to the
     coroner, HORACE WHALEY, gazing down.  A shading of regret behind
     the professional mask.  A series of QUICK CUTS...

     ...Whaley's hand pulls the SHUTTLE of TWINE from Carl's pocket...

     ...examines the open, empty KNIFE SHEATH at Carl's belt...

     ...Carl's wrist, its WATCH stopped at 1:47...

     Whaley bends over Carl's body, presses on his solar plexus,
     watching pink FOAM rise from Carl's mouth and nose.  And then.
     He sees something more.  His fingers gently pull back the hair
     from above Carl's left ear, to reveal...

     ...a skull wound.  The bone caved in.  Four inches across.

<b>     EXT. SAN PIEDRO ISLAND - DAY
</b>
     Snow falling on cedars.

<b>     SUPERIMPOSE:  DECEMBER 6.
</b>
     The heavens descend softly onto our island.  Exquisite, silent,
     hypnotic.  An epic snowfall inspiring awe at our frailness against
     the limitless scope of nature.  As CREDITS CONCLUDE, a series of
<b>     QUICK ANGLES...
</b>
     ...cars pirouetting, skating on their tires, past an abandoned
     school bus, where kids throw snowballs at is windows...

     ...Fisk's Hardware Center, its endless queue of orderly citizens
     waiting stoically for their snow shovels and kerosene...

     ...the harbor, with its moored fleet of tiny fishing vessels
     blanketed as if by volcanic ash, a pair of teenage lovers building
     a snowman at the edge of a dock, she pushes the boy into the water,
     and he rises laughing, steam rising from his clothes...

     ...undulating strawberry fields of pure white, untouched and
     flawless as the Sahara...

     Finally, to a public building, cars gathering as best they can,
     people streaming up snow-laden steps to the entrance, and as we
     FOLLOW them, SMASH CUT to...

<b>     INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</b>
     CLOSE on impassive EYES.  They are Asian.  We have seen them
     before.  PULL BACK to see...

     KABUO MIYAMOTO.  Early 30's, dark blue suit, clean shirt.  He sits
     ramrod straight, utterly motionless, expressionless, the eye of a
     storm of movement in...

     ...the assembling COURTROOM.  A packed gallery of buzzing locals,
     the scent of anticipation.  A bank of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS,
     cosmopolitan in attire, bearing themselves as jaded dignitaries
     from the civilized world.  As we PAN their ranks...

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     It was the first murder trial on
                     the island in thirty-one years.

     ...we look over the right shoulder of ISHMAEL CHAMBERS, early 30's,
     dark, a rugged, somber man jotting notes on a pad which rests on
     his right leg.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Our only newspaper was the San
                     Piedro Review, a four-page weekly
                     that I operated alone.

     He glances blandly at his nonchalant colleagues.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     What, I wondered, could the Seattle
                     boys know of the hearts of these
                     people...

     To the JURY BOX.  Truck farmers, grocers, fishermen, in sober
     neckties.  A waitress, a secretary, fisher wives in Sunday dresses.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Neighbors, sitting in judgement.
                     On their neighbor.

     To the neighbor.  The ramrod-still defendant.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Kabuo Miaymoto sat with the rigid
                     grace of a Samurai warrior.  As if
                     detached from his own trial.

     Ishmael writing on the pad balanced precariously on his knee,
     until...

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Did he know how dangerous his demeanor
                     could be?  With this jury.

     ...it falls with a CLATTER of pages.  He reaches with his right
     hand, replaces the pad on his thigh.  Around him, CAMERAS are being
     swung to the ready.  Ishmael looks to see...

     ...a slender WOMAN of refined beauty, entering the courtroom.
     A few flashes POP, and Ishmael's right hand retrieves a venerable
     box camera from beneath his seat, as his notepad falls once more,
     unheeded.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Hatsue Miyamoto had been without
                     her husband for 77 days.

     Ishmael pivots, and we understand his struggle with the notepad.
     For he is forced to rest his camera on the stump of his amputated
     left arm, its empty sleeve pinned at the elbow.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     He was in jail.  When his baby son
                     learned to walk.

     Through his VIEWFINDER, we see HATSUE take her place in the first
     row.  And sensing her presence, her husband turns.  Their eyes
     meet.  A string of FLASHES...

     But none from Ishmael.  He hesitates.  As if considering whether he
     will violate this woman's privacy.  The camera lowers.  HOLD on his
     face...

<b>     INT. COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY
</b>
     MATCH CUT to Hatsue's face.  Staring, impassive, empty.  PULL BACK
     to see that she sits alone on a wooden bench by the courtroom door.
     Her hands rest delicately on the purse in her lap.  Her demeanor as
     removed from this place as is her husband's.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Earlier, I noticed her in the
                     corridor.

     PULL BACK to see him alone, in shadow.  It is more than a notice.
     Ishmael stares with fixed intensity at the motionless woman, as
     she gathers her thoughts.  A moment of decision.  He approaches.
     Stops, respectfully, at a distance which will not invade her
     personal space.  And softer than we might have imagined...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Are you all right?

     She turns her head only slightly.  It is enough.  Her voice quiet
     and firm at once...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Go away, Ishmael.

     There is no anger.  Only directness and resolve.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Please don't be like th...

                               HATSUE (softer)
                     Go away.

<b>     INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</b>
     PAN the back of the courtroom.  Twenty-four citizens of Japanese
     ancestry fill the last row, dressed in their most formal clothes.
     Shades of Atticus Finch.  As one, the Japanese-Americans watch...

     ...the prosecutor, ALVIN HOOKS, a crisp, even dapper man.  There is
     a quickness about the eyes, a tendency to sharpness of manner, that
     he works carefully against...

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     ...four inch gash, skull crushed,
                     and your thought was, what...?

     JUDGE FIELDING, tall and gray and rawboned, leans on his elbows,
     his eyelids droop slightly, a deceptive masking of keen attention.

<b>                               HOOKS (O.S.)
</b>                     That he...fell?  Hit his head on
                     the gunnel going over?

     The witness is Sheriff Moran.  He answers as if this were a sincere
     question.  As if he had never heard it before.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Well, Carl was six-four, went 235.
                     He was a grizzly bear and an able
                     seaman...

     Ishmael watching.  Thinking on that.

<b>                               MORAN (O.S.)
</b>                     For him to just...go over.  Crush
                     his skull like that on the way in...

     HOLD on Ishmael.

<b>     INT. TEAM BUS - DAY
</b>
     Teenage BOYS in football uniforms.  They ride with their helmets in
     their laps.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     He was a mountain, all right.
                     Anchored the line for us little
                     fellers.

     CLOSE on Carl and Ishmael at 18, riding together.  Ishmael, dark
     and rugged even then, is scarcely little.  But dwarfed by the blond
     giant at his side, who glares out the window, at...

<b>                               CARL
</b>                     Chambers.  Y'see the geese?

     ...snow geese landing in low flooded wheat.  The grace of it holds
     both boys.

<b>                               CARL
</b>                     Picture'd be nice.  In your pa's
                     paper.

     Ishmael nods absently.  They stare, side-by-side.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Lucky I got the camera in my
                     helmet.

     They never look at each other.  They never smile.  But you can
     almost hear one in...

<b>                               CARL
</b>                     Careful, Chambers.  That was almost
                     a joke.

     Hooks now stands with his polished shoe up on the witness podium.
     Like chatting with the Sheriff across the back fence...

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     And you weren't there, when the

                     to tell Mrs. Heine.

     And his glance inevitably goes to the first row behind the
     prosecutor's table.  Taking the glances of the jury with it.
     SUSAN MARIE HEINE is pretty and blonde and full-bodied in her
     modest black dress.  Composure and dignity.  Against her grief.

<b>     EXT. HEINE HOME - DAY
</b>
     Moran climbs from his vehicle, as Carl's young SONS dash around the
     corner of the house.  Seeing the Sheriff, they stop cold.  Silent,
     shirtless, barefoot.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Hey there, men.  Is your mother
                     home a-tall?

     He spits his Juicy Fruit into a wrapper.  And as the younger boy
     nods across the distance...

<b>                               SUSAN MARIE (O.S.)
</b>                     Sheriff Moran, hullo.

     She has appeared in the doorway, smiling, spittle-marked baby's
     diaper across her shoulder.  And he smiles back.  Tells the boys...

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     You go on and play, now.

     But they don't.  So he follows into her entryway, closing the door
     behind him.  And at the foot of her curving staircase...

<b>                               SUSAN MARIE

     Too quick.  He stops himself.  And she sees that.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     It's why I'm here.  I'm afraid I
                     have some...very bad news to tell
                     you, the...worst...kind of news.

     She looks at him, uncomprehending, the smile only beginning to
     fade, before...

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Carl died last night.  In a fishing
                     accident.  In White Sand Bay.

     She only blinks.  As if translating the words from a foreign
     language.

<b>                               SUSAN MARIE

                     in his net.

     And with these words, a slack, blank look crosses her face, and she
     stumbles back one step, sitting down HARD on the bottom stair of
     her curved staircase.

     He doesn't know what to do.  She digs her elbows into her lap, and
     begins to rock, very slowly, wringing the diaper in her hands.  Her
     face is more terrible than tears.  It is frightened.  She murmurs
     to herself, so that we can barely hear...

<b>                               SUSAN MARIE

     CLOSE on Hooks, nodding.  As if, slowly, digesting something in his
     mind.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     So, no...immediate suspicion,

                     don't talk at all to each other

     Ishmael walking down the sunlit wharf.  Purpose in his stride...

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     A gill-netter works through black
                     nights with only himself to talk
                     to.  And learns to be silent.
                     They were lonely men and products
                     of geography.

     Up ahead, the Susan Marie has been brought to dock.  Moran stands
     chatting with a knot of six or seven FISHERMEN.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     ...men who, on occasion, realized
                     that they wished to speak, but
                     couldn't.

     As he arrives, Moran smiles a thin greeting.  Not happy to see him.
     Of course, neither is anyone else.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Figure you'da heard by now.

     Ishmael shakes his head in silent helplessness.  WILLIAM GJOVAAG, a
     sunburned, big-bellied, tattooed gill-netter, clamps on his damp
     cigar butt.

<b>                               GJOVAAG

                               ISHMAEL (to Moran)
                     You see Susan Marie?

                               GJOVAAG (disgusted)
                     Well, what <u>can</u> she do?  Jesus Christ.

<b>                               ISHMAEL

     Everybody laughs.  It is all good-natured, sort of.

</b>                     Like the Sheriff, I did not work

                     to Ship Channel Bank, was Jim Ferry,

                     Ain't this just an accident?

     Moran finds his eyes drifting to Ishmael's.  Which are right there,
     waiting.  Moran looks away.

     ANGLE...Ishmael and Moran, walking alone back up the wharf.  The
     Sheriff is worried.  Finally...

     SEE him now.  NELS GUDMUNDSSON, attorney for Kabuo Miyamoto, stands
     beside his impassive client.  Nels is 79, blind in his left eye, a
     little shaky.  His body is winding down.

<b>                               MORAN

                     in the <u>middle</u> of the floor, like I
                     said.  And with a fella so neat as
                     Carl, that did seem peculiar.

     And Nels begins to walk toward him.  Limping, as he comes.

<b>                               NELS

     will do the same.

                     wonder.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     You have to wonder.

     And lets that sit.  Scratches his neck.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     You found three batteries, you

                     And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor.
                     Correct?

<b>                               MORAN

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Now I did some measuring down at
                     the chandlery.  A D-6 is one inch
                     wider than a D-8.  It would be too
                     large for the deceased's well.

<b>                               MORAN

                     ting.  You could see the side flange
                     was banged away to make room for
                     the D-6.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     But he had a spare D-6, you said.
                     Right there.  Why not use that?

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     It was dead.  We had it tested.
                     Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he
                     had to use it.

     Ah.

<b>                               NELS

                               ABEL (coughs)
                     Look, Art's gonna want me t...

                               KABUO (ignoring him)
                     You look beautiful.

     Abel grasps his arm.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I look terrible.  Don't sit so
                     straight like Tojo's soldier.  The
                     jury will be afraid of you.

     He thinks about that.  Abel tugs him.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Okay, I'll hide under the table
                     from now on.  That make you happy?

     And for the first time.  He smiles.  And seems suddenly very
     American indeed.  She stares back, her heart in her eyes.  Abel
     tugs harder, but he can't budge the defendant.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     I'm not going until you smile.

     But she doesn't.  So his fades.  One last look.  And he lets Abel
     lead him away.

     HOLD on her.  Watching him go.

<b>     EXT. MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
     Stars above a desert.  Wind gusts.  PAN barbed wire, rows of dark
     barracks blurred by swirling dust, to...

     ...a fragile tar paper structure, its 'walls' rippling pre-
     cariously.  And inside, to see that it is...

<b>     INT. BUDDHIST CHAPEL - NIGHT
</b>
     ...a makeshift sanctuary.  Candles, offerings of fruit.  A young
     COUPLE together before a Buddhist PRIEST.  Kabuo and Hatsue.
     Becoming one.

<b>     INT. BARRACKS - LATER
</b>
     A cramped, ramshackle room.  Dust blowing through gaps in the
     flimsy beams.  Kerosene light.  FUJIKO IMADA hangs the last of
     the woolen army blankets to divide the room in half, as her four
     youngest DAUGHTERS watch.  We PUSH THROUGH the blankets to the
     other side, to see...

     ...the newlyweds.  Standing at a window in their wedding clothes.
     Kissing.  Slow and full.  Until she whispers into his ear...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     They'll hear everything.

     And her young husband turns.  Speaks to the curtain.

                               KABUO (loud)
                     There must be <u>something</u> good on
                     the radio!

     She giggles.  His hands trace her body.

                               KABUO (louder)
                     Wouldn't some <u>music</u> be nice?

     And in a moment.  The MUSIC begins.  Glenn Miller.  A song that
     sent our boys off to war.  And our young American prisoners...

     ...begin to undress each other.  Her slender fingers find the
     buttons of his shirt, deftly undoing it, as he kisses her face.
     He unclasps her dress.  And as it falls from her shoulders, falls
     to the floor, we PUSH INTO her eyes, and...

     INTERCUT her MEMORY of...

     ...a beach.  Two 10-year-old CHILDREN floating on the water.
     Clinging to a wooden box, with a glass bottom for fish-watching.
     The girl is Asian.  The boy is not.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Ishmael.  See the yellow one?

     And the boy wriggles around, leans over the box, as if seeking a
     better view.  And KISSES the girl.  Full on her startled mouth.

     BACK TO...the newlyweds.  On their cot now.  Close together.  Naked
     and hungry for each other.

                               KABUO (loud)
                     Can the music be <u>louder</u>, please?
                     We can't hear so good in here!

     The girl laughs soundlessly.  And as the music BLARES, he has slid
     his body above hers.  A whisper...

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Have you ever done this?

     A whisper back, sure and strong...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Never.  You're my only.

     And as he enters her.  As she holds him close with all her
     strength.  Her lips breathe into his ear...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     ...so right.

<b>     INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</b>
     Hatsue watching her husband disappear through a door.  RACK FOCUS
     to see across the way.  A man stares at her.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Course, we grew up together.

<b>     INT. IMADA PARLOR - DAY
</b>
     Hatsue at 12, sits with an OLD WOMAN who guides her silently,
     exquisitely, through the ritual of the tea ceremony.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Her mom had this Mrs. Shigemura
                     come on Wednesdays.  Teach her
                     how to be Japanese.

     The woman turns the cup in her hands.  One-quarter turn.  Bows
     slightly, as she presents the tea.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Dances, calligraphy.  Doing her hair.
                     How to sit without moving...

<b>     EXT. HOLLOW CEDAR - DAY
</b>
     Hatsue and Ishmael, both 12, are sprawled on the ground, sheltered
     in the hollowed-out base of a cedar tree.  They watch the rain as
     it pummels the woods around them.  She is speaking, carefully,
     thoughtfully.  He listens with complete attention.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     She would tell me stories of
                     this woman and her lessons.  As
                     if complaining, or at least ex-
                     plaining her world...

     He shifts his position, his body brushing against hers, which makes
     him reflexively pull away.  She seems not to notice.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     But I always fantasized.  The
                     lessons were for me.

<b>     INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Hatsue sits at a bedroom mirror.  Mrs. Shigemura watching
     analytically, as Hatsue weaves her hair into a thick plait.

<b>                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
</b>                     No.  You must never look at a man
                     directly.  This is <u>part</u> of grace.

     The girl smiles a small sour smile.  Speaks quietly...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I don't think the boys on this
                     island.  Are impressed.  By grace.

     The old woman studies her without irritation.

<b>                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
</b>                     Hakujin know nothing of life, Hatsue.

     Apparently, the girl has heard this before.

<b>                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
</b>                     This is why they fear death.  Because
                     life here is separate from Being.

     The girl takes a long pin.  Begins carefully to fasten her hair.
     Breaking eye contact with the mirror.

<b>                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
</b>                     It is why they have no soul.

     Is the girl even listening?  The old woman's voice never rises.
     Remains patient.

<b>                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
</b>                     Life embraces death, includes it.
                     This truth brings tranquility.  You
                     must see yourself...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     ...as a leaf.  On a great tree.

     No irony in the girl's voice.  No disrespect.  The old woman reads
     the young face in the mirror.

<b>                               MRS. SHIGEMURA
</b>                     The pin.  Could be better placed.

<b>     INT. SAN PIEDRO REVIEW - DAY
</b>
     CLOSE on 12-year-old Ishmael.  Neutral eyes.  Eating an apple.  A
     horrific CLANGING surrounds us.  The clash of metal on metal.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     My lessons came from my father.  They
                     were different.  Or seemed so, at the
                     time.

     See ARTHUR CHAMBERS now, at the printing press, an enormous lime
     green contraption, with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast-
     iron housing.  The shrieking of metal and gears recalls an ancient
     locomotive.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     He operated the Review alone, with
                     an integrity and passion for principle
                     that made him a figure of respect.  If
                     slightly larger than life.

     Arthur is a large, rugged man, with round gun-metal rimmed
     spectacles and garters on his shirtsleeves.  He wears the soft,
     perpetual smile of an Oxford Don, as he gracefully ducks in and
     out of the machine, inspecting plates and printing cylinders.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     He never spoke of wanting me to
                     succeed him.  And, in truth, it was
                     the last job on earth I thought I'd
                     ever want.

     The boy rises now.  Sets his apple carefully aside.  And under his
     father's supervision, takes his place operating the press.  His
     arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     When I was five, he casually mentioned
                     that if his sleeve got caught in the
                     press, he'd be instantly popped open
                     like a child's balloon, and splattered
                     across the walls.

     Watch Ishmael running the monster, coolly, efficiently, with
     complete concentration.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Even his bones would disappear, to
                     be discovered later on the floor,
                     as strips of white confetti.

     Arthur turns away, lest his son feel a lack of confidence.  Picks
     up the boy's apple.  A crisp BITE.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Which, of course, made me certain that
                     life would have no meaning until I
                     could run that teakettle.

<b>     EXT. MAIN STREET, AMITY HARBOR - SUNSET
</b>
     Arthur and Ishmael, now 17, strolling Main Street in the midst of
     what seems a festive carnival.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     He was, for better or worse, the
                     only God in my life.  I guess it's
                     our nature to resent those we know
                     we can never measure up to...

     They are passing modest parade floats, booths with food and games.
     A genial crowd of farmers, fishermen, families, both races
     heedlessly mingling.  A community.  Arthur unselfconsciously slips
     his arm over the shoulder of his tall son.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     ...which keeps us from accepting
                     the warmth.  The way we should.

     Up ahead, a crowd has gathered at the steps of the courthouse.
     Something's up.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Every summer, after harvest, the
                     Strawberry Festival was Dad's favor-
                     ite story to cover.  Good news was
                     his preference.  Making him an oddity
                     among journalists.

     As we approach, we see a ceremony begin at the top of the
     courthouse steps.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Highlight was crowning the Strawberry
                     Princess.  Always a Japanese girl,
                     sort of an unwitting virgin sacrifice
                     to the concept of racial harmony.

     We are there now.  Arthur pulling down the same box camera Ishmael
     would use years later.  Focusing up at the MAYOR, as he places the
     crown on the radiant young girl...

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Senior Year.  It was Hatsue.

     And as the applause ripples through the crowd.  As the Strawberry
     Princess acknowledges her subjects, her eye falls on...

     ...Ishmael.  She drops him a wink.  And a special wave.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     She winked at me.  In public.
                     Which was unusual.

<b>     EXT. SOUTH BEACH - DAY
</b>
     Two 14-year-olds alone on a beach.  Digging for clams in the mud.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I had kissed her once, when we
                     were ten.  Looking at fish through
                     a glass-bottomed box.  It was just
                     an impulse, and no big deal.

     Ishmael pulls back from the deep hole, to make room for Hatsue to
     reach down.  We can see her fingers explore the shell of the dug-in
     geoduck clam.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     He's still got a good grip.  We
                     need to dig more.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     At school, she kept mostly to the
                     Japanese kids, and sort of ignored
                     me.  As if all of our times alone
                     together...in the hollow cedar,
                     everywhere...were a secret.

     They are digging now, together.  Carefully.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I told myself that was good.  That
                     it made our friendship special.  And
                     didn't mean she was ashamed of it.
                     Necessarily.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Easy.  Slow is best.

     Gently, she begins to dislodge the clam from its lair.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I thought about her.  Sometimes,
                     all the time.  I knew I was unhappy.
                     But I knew if I told her...

     She lifts it clear.  And as she admires its size and roughness with
     her fingertips.  As she washes it in the shallows.  He watches her
     movements.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     It might be a mistake.  I could
                     never correct.

                               ISHMAEL (quietly)
                     I like you.

     The words make her turn.  Not startled, exactly.  Alerted.  But
     neutral, without affect.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Do you know what I mean, Hatsue?
                     I've always liked you.

     There is no answer.  He leans slightly closer, and she looks
     down.  This is the moment.  Afraid and driven, he moves slowly
     to her face.  And puts his mouth against hers.  She lets him and,
     encouraged, he pushes harder, making Hatsue...

     ...lose her balance, and planting a hand beneath the water to
     support herself, eyes closed too tightly, she kisses Ishmael for a
     long moment, before...

     ...leaping up, snatching her clam pail and running AWAY down the
     beach like a deer.  He stands slowly.  To watch her go.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I knew in my heart that we would
                     love each other forever.

     His face is slack and unsmiling, but he is helpless with happiness.
     Contemplating this truth.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     The way she kissed me.  She knew
                     it, too.

<b>     EXT. IMADA FARM - DUSK
</b>
     Ishmael crouching at the edge of the farm, in near-darkness.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     She avoided me for a week.

     Across the distance, the screen door opens, light slips across the
     porch.  Hatsue appears with a wicker basket, to take the laundry
     from the line.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     So this way, I could see her
                     without...bothering anyone.

     He watches, rapt, as she unpins and folds the clothes, clenching
     the clothespins in her teeth.  Then reeling the line again, elegant
     hand over elegant hand...

</b>                     I was certain everything would
                     work out.

     She corrals the long sweep of her hair, knotting it deftly, before
     heading inside.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     And frightened.

<b>     EXT. STRAWBERRY FIELDS - DAY
</b>
     Children working fields in sunlight.  Kneeling in the rows.  Hatsue
     with a half-dozen Japanese girls, her hair loose, her face lightly
     sheened with sweat.  She works with efficiency and grace, filling
     her flat.

     Three rows away.  Ishmael watches.  The fear not far beneath the
     surface of his quiet, dark features.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     By two weeks, I knew I had made
                     the defining mistake of my life.

     Hatsue's gaze drifts slightly in this direction, and Ishmael looks
     DOWN rapidly at his work.  Cheeks burning, certain she is watching.
     Which she is not.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I'd ruined everything.

     LATER...end of day.  The young pickers turning in their flats as a
     gentle rain begins.  Hatsue counts her money, slips it into her
     pocket, and...

     ...runs lightly off, into the growing rain.  Ishmael sees.
     Stricken to his soul with longing.  And indecision.

<b>     EXT. CEDAR GROVE - DAY
</b>
     Hatsue, drenched, alone with her thoughts in the protection of
     the hollow cedar.  The rain is driving now, and she glances up.
     At something we don't see.  And watches it.  Finally...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     You followed me, huh?

     PULL BACK to see him.  Rain pelting off his poor soaked form.  She
     is waiting for an answer.  So...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Sorry.  It sort of...happened, I
                     just...I followed you.  I'm sorry.

     She pulls her hair behind her ears.  A movement which stretches her
     body.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I'm all wet.

     She starts refastening her hair now, looking away.  He comes
     inside, crouches as respectfully far from her as he can.  Which is
     close.  He watches her, watches her, and...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I'm sorry I kissed you on
                     the beach.

     No reaction.  As if she hasn't heard.  Now his heart is beating
     straight through his chest.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Let's just forget about it.
                     Forget it happened.

     She picks up her damp straw hat.  And, eyes down, tracing a finger
     around its brim...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Don't be sorry.  I'm not sorry
                     about it.

     His heart bursts within him.  And he struggles to keep it from his
     face.  Even though she isn't watching.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Me neither.

     She turns her face to him, and offers a small smile.  It is
     genuine, and therefore dazzling to the boy.  She lies back on
     the ground.  Her eyes so unafraid and direct.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Do you think this is wrong?

     He swallows.  Staring at her lying there so comfortably.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     The best part was that there was a
                     'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Your friends would.  Your dad would
                     kill me with a machete.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael.
                     He'll slice you up with a ceremonial
                     sword.

     Ah.  Better.  They are both grinning now.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     My mom.  Would be the problem.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Why?  We're only talking.

     Her eyes flicker.  The synapse that a woman can offer a man.

                               HATSUE (softly)
                     Sure.

     And touches his hand.  With her fingertips.  The barest whisper...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I can't hear you.

     Thus invited, he leans down over Hatsue.  Kisses her mouth with all
     the tenderness in him.  This time, her eyes close gently.  And her
     body arches slightly, into his.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     We kissed for half an hour, that
                     first time.  And I knew there would
                     never be another day like it.

     Rain POUNDING now.  A curtain of water, sealing them from the
     world.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)

<b>     INT. COURTROOM - DAY

     CLOSE on Ishmael, once more in the row of reporters.  Absently
     kneading the stump of his amputated arm.  The way some men drum
     their fingers.

<b>     INT. HEINE FARMHOUSE - DAY
</b>
     Etta twenty years younger, watches stoically from the parlor
     window, as her husband CARL SENIOR strools the strawberry fields
     with Kabuo's father Zenhichi.  Carl is a huge rawboned man, and
     puffs a pipe as Zenhichi stops, sweeps his arms this way and that.
     Etta knows trouble when she sees it.

<b>     INT. KITCHEN - LATER
</b>
     Etta pours her husband's coffee.  It is very quiet.

<b>                               ETTA
</b>                     Don't sell, Carl.  You'll regret it.

                     pouch of fancy pipe tobacco?

     She walks about the kitchen with her arms folded.  Too upset to
     be still.

<b>                               CARL SR.

                     down to it.

     Etta turns sharply.  Glares at the big man.  He just blinks
     blandly, puffs his pipe.  She can see this ship has sailed.

<b>                               ETTA

<b>     INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
     Carl Sr. and Zenhichi sit at the table.  There is coffee.  But it
     is untouched.  Etta watches by the stove.

<b>                               ETTA (V.O.)

                     gonna cart 'em off.

     Carl lights his pipe.  Compassion in his broad weathered face.

                               CARL SR. (softly)
                     Eight days.  It ain't right.

<b>                               ZENHICHI

                     can't use.  Soften us up about those
                     two payments still to come.

     And sure enough, Zenhichi produces a neat stack of bills.  Puts
     them on the table.

<b>                               ZENHICHI

                     like this.

     The small man spreads the bills out.  On the table.

<b>                               ZENHICHI

                     you come here hopin' on?

     Zenhichi keeps his anger within.  His face is stone.

<b>                               ETTA (V.O.)
</b>                     I spit on him, and he's pretending
                     it didn't happen that way.  How could

</b>                     No, thank you.  Take money, please.

     But Carl is staring at his wife.  She stares right back.  Carl
     turns, slides the money toward Zenhichi.

<b>                               CARL SR.
</b>                     Etta's been rude to you, and I

<b>     INT. PARLOR - TWILIGHT

     Silence.  Palpable.  Two figures sit at opposite ends of this
     darkening room, each under a lamp.  Carl Sr. is reading the paper.
     His face is stone.  Etta at a small writing desk strewn with bills
     and ledgers.  Her face is angry.

     A screen door opens.  Slams shut.  Big footfalls coming.  No one
     looks up.

     His heart is pounding.  He waits.  Waits.  Weapon at the ready, he
     pushes THROUGH the dense foliage to see...

     ...the 15-year-old German SOLDIER, splayed on the forest floor, his
     chest torn and bloodied.  Kabuo's gaze LOCKS with the boy's.  The
     young soldier's empty left hand reaches out in a a plea, and as
     Kabuo steps forward, the boy's right hand comes suddenly...

     ...INTO view, metal GLINTING in motion, as Kabuo...

     world.  Only the small barred one in the cell door.  As the
     manacles fall away...

     cot.  Opens the cigar box filled with chess pieces, two cigars,
     a Snickers and a Baby Ruth.  He puts the candy bars by Kabuo's
     pillow, a silent gift.  Begins to set up the chessboard.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     What makes you think I play?

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Your daddy played.  I asked, down
                     at the Japanese Community Center.
                     You smoke cigars?

     And offers one up, rough and black.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     I'm not sure.  I better check
                     down at the Center.

     Kabuo smiles only with his eyes.  Nels nods, maybe you better.
     Lights his own cigar.  Puts the matches and the other cigar at
     Kabuo's side.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     White or black?

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     You mean, do I like to take the
                     offensive?  Or hang back and wait.

     That seems answer enough for Nels.  He turns the board around to
     where he has white, and makes the first move.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Nice.  When two fellas understand
                     each other.

     Kabuo picks up the cigar.  STRIKES a match.

<b>     ...........................................................
</b>     white.  Kabuo moves a black bishop.  Nels' eyes shoot around the
     table.  He reaches and KNOCKS OVER Kabuo's black king.  Kabuo
     blinks, studies the board silently.  Then smiles.

     He unwraps the Snickers bar.  Breaks it in half.  Hands one piece
     across to his lawyer.

<b>     SERIES OF ANGLES...
</b>
     RAPID CUTS, different days, Nels in different suits, chess pieces
     in different positions, each time Nels reaching to topple Kabuo's
     king.  The last time...

     Kabuo has to study the board for a beat.  Shakes his head.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     You must think I like losing.

</b>                     I think you like learning.

     And leans his old bones back against the hard wall.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Me, too.  That's why I come.

     Pulls out two cigars.  Kabuo looks at them.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Bet there's a few things you
                     could teach me.  Kendo, for one.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Sure.  I could take a fishing
                     gaff and split your head open.
                     Right above your left ear.

     No smile.  Steady gaze.

<b>                               KABUO

                     never ask.  If you did it.

     Hands one cigar.  Across the chessboard.

<b>                               NELS

                     kill.  When there's a reason.

                               KABUO (very quiet)
                     Guess I am.

     Takes the cigar.  Rolls it between his thumb and forefinger.

<b>                               NELS

                     Jury sees what I see.  More often
                     than not.

     Reaches stiffly.  Kabuo bends toward him.  Accepts the flame.
     Takes a puff.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Prosecutor thinks.  What was

                               KABUO (simply)

     and helpless.

<b>     INT. ISHMAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</b>
     Through glass, snow is tumbling in endless cascades, the world
     dwarfed by a descending heaven.  A sound, a strange soft CLICK.
     PAN across...

     ...the small, well-kept bachelor apartment.  Neat stacks of books
     on the floor, catching the overflow of shelves crammed full.
     Someone likes to read.  Another soft CLICK.  To...

     ...the kitchen now, along the floor.  An awkward high-top SHOE, its
     buckled straps above elastic LACES that fasten across the instep.
     The shoe steps on a crude wooden PEDAL.  And we hear another CLICK.
     PAN up along a vertical strip of mesh WIRE to...

     ...a plywood CONTRAPTION, held by a partially closed drawer.  A
     piece of spring steel holding a set of NAIL CLIPPERS.

     Ishmael inserts his pinkie carefully.  CLICK.  Finishes clipping
     the fingernails of his only hand.  And looks out.  At the magic of
     white.

<b>     EXT. HOLLOW CEDAR - DAY

     Safe within their haven, the 18-year-olds kiss and hold each other
     urgently.  Their tongues exploring each other's mouth, her legs
     open beneath her skirt, pressing her body up against him.

                     from the things that upset her.

     ANGLE...later, they lie so quietly.  Her head nestled in the crook
     of his arm, he gently plays with her hair.  Her face so still, so
     thoughtful and grave.

                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)
                     You don't have to be so tragic,

     of her worries.  He draws a breath...

     He reaches.  Touches this face that he loves with all his heart.
     Forces up a smile.

     She leans up.  CROSSES her eyes in a goofy expression.  Then kisses
     his mouth.  When she pulls back...

     And she studies this boy.  Knowing more than he can ever
     understand.  And chooses to whisper...

<b>     INT. IMADA FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Hatsue and her older daughter are setting the farmhouse table, as
     snow drifts down beyond the window.  Plates and flatware.  Glasses
     and napkins.  Slowly, in silence, as if a ritual bonding mother and
     daughter.  She glances to the next room...

     ...her mother Fujiko plays with the babies.  Her father HISAO reads
     the paper.  Smoking his pipe.

     And Hatsue is motionless for a moment.  Watching him.

<b>     INT. IMADA FARMHOUSE - DAY
</b>
     CLOSE on Hatsue at 18, staring with silent anger greater than her
     fear.

                               HISAO (O.S. shaky)
                     We are loyal.

     PULL BACK to see the room.  Hatsue and her sisters side by side,
     staring at the table.  On it rests a shotgun, four boxes of shells,
     a ceremonial sword.  An FBI AGENT, a small man in a dark suit, is
     tagging each item.  He wears a light, perpetual, insincere smile.

<b>                               FUJIKO

                     these things.

     Fujiko at her husband's side.  She is quietly indignant.  He is
     frightened.

                               AGENT (overly casual)
                     Well, they'll hold this stuff for
                     a little bit, then ship it back to
                     you.  It's nothing to worry about.

     And walks over to the tansu, a chest of drawers, and begins to
     remove items...

<b>                               AGENT

                     country, it appears.  Very high class.

     And lays it on another table.  Next to a bamboo flute, a stack of
     shakuhachi sheet music.

<b>                               AGENT
</b>                     These are real nice things.

     Hisao sees his wife's sudden alarm.  And, as respectfully as he can
     manage...

<b>                               HISAO

                     we have to take.

     And sees on the sofa, an open album.  Strolls over.

                     scrapbook.  For her memories.

     So he picks it up.  Doesn't see Hatsue stiffen with repulsion, as
     he wanders, thumbing through it, toward the hallway...

                               AGENT (calling out)
                     Wilson?  Don't go pawing through
                     the underwear!

     And chuckles.  He knows they appreciate a joke.  It means there's
     nothing to be afraid of.  Stops turning pages now.  Looks up, his
     eyes moving until they find Hatsue.

<b>                               AGENT

     The soft slamming of a screen door.  Another AGENT, large and
     shambling in his too-small suit, is carrying a crate.  And a
     telling look.

                               AGENT #2 (quiet triumph)
                     Dynamite.  Twenty-four sticks.

     And the crate BANGS onto the table.  Just beside the kimono.  Lifts
     out two sticks and holds them high.  Proof.

<b>                               HISAO
</b>                     You must believe.  This for tree
                     stumps.  For clearing land.

     The small man's smile fades now.  First time.  And his eyes fix
     Hisao before he speaks.  As if reading his mind.

<b>                               AGENT
</b>                     Maybe.  Maybe.  But this is still
                     bad, y'see.

     Fujiko slips her hand into her husband's.  To give him strength.

<b>                               AGENT
</b>                     It's illegal contraband, you were

     Slight shrug.

                     take you to Seattle.

     Fujiko's breath catches.  One of the daughters whimpers.  The
     silence hangs thick and frightening.  The bigger agent unhooks a
     pair of handcuffs from his belt, but...

<b>                               AGENT

     The younger girls are crying now, clinging to their sisters.  The
     agent regrets this.

     Ain't that right?

     He puts his hand on Hisao's arm.  Not roughly, but much firmer than
     the ease of his voice...

     Her voice so loud, so insistent.  Her sisters are afraid for her.
     To have shown such disrespect.  They look down at their hands.  Or
     away, as if not hearing.

     And he blinks.  As if waking from a dream.  Everything has stopped.
     Her face is strong and yet overflowing with regret.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     No.  No.  It isn't right.

     So he draws away.  Stunned, uncomprehending.  Watching with blank
     eyes, as she stares up at him.  Then, with dignity and tenderness,
     he helps her dress, his eyes awkwardly away from hers...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     It felt right to me.  It felt
                     like getting married.

     She draws her legs up.  Kneeling now, putting her hands on his
     face...

     But no words come.  No words.  Until...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I'll write you.

     And KISSES him fiercely, and BOLTS up before he can grab her,
     RUNNING off like a deer, while he...

     ...kneels.  His mouth open.  Like a silent scream.

<b>     EXT. AMITY HARBOR FERRY - MORNING
</b>
     An army truck pulls up behind several others in cold morning air.
     Hesitantly, looking in all directions, Fujiko, Hatsue, and her four
     sisters climb from the truck, to see...

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     On Monday, March 30, 1942, the
                     United States Army graciously
                     transported the Imada women to
                     the docks.

     ...a ferry, the KEHLOKEN, stands waiting.  Soldiers are dis-
     tributing tags for luggage and coats.  The evacuees, mostly women,
     stand in the cold, trying to smile bravely for each other.  And
     lined against the railing...

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Lifelong neighbors came to watch.
                     Curiosity masked as kindness...

     ...a cluster of white islanders gawking as their Japanese neighbors
     file toward the ferry.  A middle-aged woman waves to Fujiko, who
     casts her eyes down, refusing to acknowledge the greeting.  And
     just as they reach the gangway...

     ...Hatsue sees Ishmael, who stands at an unobtrusive distance,
     among a group of students.  She pauses.  Her eyes hold his for a
     heartbeat...

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     ...with some exceptions.

     The wisp of a smile.  And she is gone.

<b>     EXT. IMADA FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
</b>
     Hatsue comes alone onto the white-blanketed porch.  Snow is no
     longer falling.  She takes out a cigarette, lights it impassively.
     The mannerisms make her seem fully American, despite the porcelain
     impenetrability of her Asian exterior.  She closes her eyes, and...

     ...draws deep on the smoke.  The act seems to cause her pain.  When
     the eyes open, they are frightened, unguarded.  Nowhere to turn.
     The next puff looks desperate, and she FLIPS the cigarette out onto
     the snow.  Jams her hands in the pockets of her parka, stamps her
     feet against the cold, the helplessness.  And looks out...

     ...strawberry fields, endless and white, shimmering in filtered
     moonlight, become...

<b>     EXT. MANZANAR INTERNMENT CAMP - NIGHT
</b>
     ...a moonlit DESERT.  PAN the barbed wire, the distant barracks,
     the desolation.  Come to...

     ...two women walking alone.  The younger one glancing at her mother
     as they go.  Fujiko's eyes unreadable, stare implacably ahead.
     The barracks, everything, in distance behind them.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     You think we're far enough
                     away now?

     No sarcasm in the voice.  She lets the words carry her irony.
     Her mother stops.  Looks at her so directly, so strong.  Even her
     tough-minded daughter flinches slightly.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Mom, whatever this is, they don't
                     keep <u>war</u> secrets this carefully.

     Fujiko thinks that over.  Nods.

<b>                               FUJIKO
</b>                     Secrets are hard to keep.

     She goes over to a large, flat rock.  Sits down.  Pulls two sheets
     of paper from her coat.  And waits.  As her daughter comes and
     crouches at her feet.  Fujiko clears her throat.

<b>                               FUJIKO
</b>                     This letter.  Was opened.
                     By mistake.

     And watches.  As the shard of fear penetrates her daughter's mask.
     Silence.  Then...

                               FUJIKO (reads)
                     'My love.  I still go to our
                     cedar tree in the afternoons every
                     day.  I shut my eyes, waiting.'

     Hatsue has turned to stone.  To ice.  Wind blows.

                               FUJIKO (reads)
                     'I smell your smell.  And I dream
                     of you.  And I ache for you to come
                     home.  So I can hold you and feel
                     you near.'

     Fujiko scans the page silently.  Turns to the second...

                               FUJIKO (reads)
                     'After all these years that we've
                     been together, I find you're a
                     part of me.  Without you, I have
                     nothing.  All my love, forever...'

     And looks up.  Her eyes calm, quiet.

<b>                               FUJIKO
</b>                     The neighborhood boy.  Who taught
                     you to swim?

     The look holds.  And holds.

<b>                               HATSUE

                               FUJIKO (so quiet)
                     How deceitful of me.

     Anger only at the edges.  Like finely-honed steel.

<b>                               FUJIKO
</b>                     How can I ever hope.  For your
                     forgiveness.

     The wind swirls a cloud of dust between them.  They seem not to
     notice.

<b>                               FUJIKO
</b>                     I have written this letter to
                     the boy's parents...

     She pulls out a single page.  Hands it down to her daughter.
     Hatsue's eyes move quickly over the words.

<b>                               FUJIKO
</b>                     Attraction is no crime, certainly
                     among children.  The dishonor
                     lies in the concealment.  From
                     your families.

     Watches her daughter reading.  And quietly...

<b>                               FUJIKO
</b>                     I know that you know this.  I know
                     you have suffered.  Even if the
                     hakujin could not.

     Silence.  Hatsue's eyes cast down.  She folds the page.

<b>                               FUJIKO
</b>                     There will be no further letters.
                     No contact of any k...

     And stops.  Because Hatsue is TEARING the page in two.  She looks
     up.  Into her mother's shock.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     One more letter.  I will write
                     it.  You may read it, and send
                     it for me.

     Her mother's anger fades.  Into interest.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I deceived more than you.  I
                     deceived this sweet boy.  And
                     myself.  It was never love.

     Never love.  The mother's face changes.  There is understanding,
     acceptance.  Even pride.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I will work hard.  To earn your
                     forgiveness.

     A sigh.  A sadness deep, beyond her years.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I can never hope for his.

<b>     INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT
</b>
     Mother and daughter enter their crude quarters.  They find Hatsue's
     sisters sitting on the wooden floor, watching...

     ...a team of young MEN, working with tools and pieces of lumber.
     One is building shelves, two others, a chest of drawers.  Their
     leader kneels tacking scraps of tin over the knotholes on the
     floor.  One girl beams at her mother...

<b>                               SUMIKO
</b>                     These boys are buildings us
                     a mansion!

     The leader grins and rises.  Bows slightly to Fujiko.  He is, of
     course...

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     I'm Kabuo Miyamoto, Mrs. Imada.

     The woman smiles.  Bows slightly in return.

<b>                               FUJIKO
</b>                     We are in your debt, Miyamoto-san.
                     How are your parents, your family...?

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     My father is sick with the camp

                     Don't speak of dept, please, we
                     just want to help.

     And glances.  To the eldest daughter.  In the doorway.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Hi, Hatsue, remember me?

     She looks back, without expression.  There is much on her mind.
     His smile is handsome, easy.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     I was a senior when you were a
                     junior.  But I've seen you around.

     She tosses her hair free of the parka.  Gathers it in her hands.
     Saying only...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Hello.

     Can't win a smile, but he doesn't seem to mind.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Nice to see you.

<b>     EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE REAR PORCH - NIGHT
</b>
     Ishmael steps from the building onto the rear porch.  He draws from
     his coat a black CIGAR.  Box of matches.  The cigar goes into his
     mouth.  With amazing dexterity...

     ...he slips a single match from the box, turns his face to the
     wall, and still palming the box, STRIKES a match on the buckle of
     his belt, bringing it smoothly to the cigar for a few critical
     puffs before the match dies.  He turns toward...

     ...the fields.  Stretching treeless, endless, seemingly to the
     horizon.  Bathed in filtered moonlight, they become...

<b>     EXT. TARAWA ATOLL - NIGHT
</b>
     ...the shimmering Pacific.  We are with Ishmael in an LCVP landing
     craft, as his platoon enters Tarawa lagoon.  Bobbing past two
     DESTROYERS firing in waves at the beach.  Ishmael and his platoon
     mates watch with adrenaline-fueled fear as amphibious tractors draw
     fire on the sand, one exploding in flame.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Her letter reached me on the North
                     Island of New Zealand.  So I had a
                     month to think it over...

     Men around him are shouting, cursing, jostling against each other,
     frightened out of their minds, as SHELLS POUND the ocean, horrify-
     ingly huge and near.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I wrote her four times.  'I hate

                     Hatsue, I'll hate you always!'

     Suddenly their craft runs AGROUND on the hidden reef.  They are
     still 300 yards from shore.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I never sent the letters.  I wanted

     The SQUAD LEADER goes over the side, Ishmael and others follow,
     struggling with 85 pound packs.  As Ishmael hits the water, the
     squad leader is SHOT in the face, a man five yards from Ishmael has
     the top of his head BLOWN AWAY, men are DROPPING in numbers under
     the WITHERING BURSTS of fire, the deafening ordnance sweeping over
     the SHRIEKS of terror and agony, and Ishmael...

     ...submerges behind his pack, splashing hard, keeping its bulk
     ahead of him as a shield, until he can wade and swim and plunge
     toward shore, as hellfire CRASHES everywhere, dead bodies floating,
     machine-gun blasts WHIPPING the water's surface, Ishmael at...

     ...the shallows now, men rising to make a run at the seawall, being
     CUT DOWN, Ishmael crouching in the water, watching other men draw
     fire, and in a moment's lull, four of them and Ishmael...

     ...GO for it, lungs BURSTING, pounding MADLY up the sand, one
     SHOT DEAD, another SCREAMS as his knee is blown away and goes down
     writhing, as three men...

     ...MAKE IT to the wall.  Gasping, puking, shivering with cold and
     fright.  They have no gear, no weapons.  One of them is Ishmael.
     He looks back to...

                     <u>help</u> me, PLEASE...!

     And flat against the seawall, three men watch.  Not daring to look
     at each other.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I knew nothing could save him.  Hell,

                     I also knew I was a coward.  For not

<b>     EXT. SEAWALL - DAY
</b>
     Ishmael and his companions have been joined by others.  Sixty or
     so men mill in the shadow of the seawall.  The beach is littered
     with dead marines and wounded, calling for help.  As Ishmael
     glances up, a SERGEANT leaps ONTO the seawall, cigarette dangling
     from his mouth...

     Ishmael has a carbine now and a field machete.  PULL BACK to reveal
     300 MARINES all down the wall, a striking force assembled from the
     survivors of multiple landings.

     They seem more resigned, or is it stunned numb, than terrified.
     There is no interaction.  Each man dealing with his own insides.
     And suddenly...

     ...squad leaders go OVER THE WALL, the firing ERUPTS, and three
     hundred marines SCRAMBLE into the teeth of it, mortar and machine-

<b>     INT. KABUO'S CELL - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     CLOSE on a dark blue suit.  Clean shirt.  Hanging on a hook against
     the green wall.  PAN ACROSS the bars in the cell door's tiny
     window.  All is dark out there, and silent.  Here...

     ...the bare bulb glows.  Its light throws shadows of castles and
     horses across the chessboard.

     Kabuo cross-legged on the floor, alone.  His back erect.  His eyes
     calm.  Stare at the pieces.

<b>     EXT. WOODS - NIGHT
</b>
     Kabuo at 19 sits on the earth.  By a shovel.  By a lantern.  This
     place is shielded by trees.  PAN across the ground to...

     ...his father.  Slowly, reverently, placing objects into burlap
     sacks, beside a shallow hole in the earth.  Wooden swords, hakama
     pants, a bokken, scrolls written with care.  Dialogue plays in
     subtitled JAPANESE...

</b>                     He killed himself.  On the

     The boy knows this.  Yet his entire being is focused on every word.

<b>                               ZENHICHI
</b>                     He went to battle with a sword.
                     Against rifles, mind you.  Knowing
                     what honor required.

     An elegant SWORD.  Its curved blade gleaming in the lantern light.

<b>                               ZENHICHI
</b>                     He was angry.  To the point of
                     being crazy, yes.  But he knew
                     what honor.  Required.

     A separate sack, just for this.  Folded with respect.

<b>                               ZENHICHI
</b>                     Honor can require loyalty.
                     Revenge.  Death.

     It goes into the ground.  With the others.  He seems nearly
     overcome now.  By some emotion that sweeps through him.  Prompting
     the boy to murmur...

                     manila, new condition, braided in

                     But it doesn't match Carl's lines.
                     It matches Miyamoto's.  perfect.

     Ah.  Hooks nods.  Significant.

<b>                               HOOKS

<b>                               HOOKS

<b>     EXT. THE ISLANDER - NIGHT
</b>
     Kabuo kneeling at the battery well of his boat.  He is sliding a
     new BATTERY into place.  Beside its older companion.  He bolts it
     down.  Starts his engine.  He is visibly tense.  As he steps onto
     the deck, he sees...

     ...two figures at the pilings.  Sheriff Moran makes a cutting
     motion across his throat, as Abel moves to grasp the mooring line.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Cut your engine, we're coming
                     aboard.

     Kabuo doesn't move.  The tension has fled beneath the surface.  His
     face now a mask.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     What for, Sheriff?

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     We have a warrant.  To search
                     your boat.

     He holds it up.  Abel looks uneasy, as if expecting anything.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Well, what are you looking f...

                               MORAN (calmly)
                     A murder weapon.  We think you
                     might be responsible for the death
                     of Carl Heine.

     Kabuo blinks.  As if hearing a foreign language.  Words that do not
     compute.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Sheriff, if somebody killed Carl,
                     it sure as hell wasn't me.

     Moran steps from the dock ONTO the boat, Abel awkwardly following.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Then let's get this over with, so
                     you can get to fishin'.  Now, cut
                     yor engine.

     And walks ahead into the cabin, shining his flashlight across
     everything.  Kabuo follows, killing the engine.  And in the sudden
     silence, Moran's beam finds...

     ...the still-open battery well.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     You always run with the well open?

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     I was checking the cables.

     Moran's light moves over the batteries.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     D-6s, huh?

     And says no more.  Runs his beam once more around the cabin.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     We'll come back, let's take a
                     look at the stern.

     Off he goes.  Kabuo's glance goes to the open well.  Then follows,
     noticing Abel Martinson prowling around the bow.  But in the stern,
     Moran is shining his light.  Third cleat.  Port side.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     See you replaced a mooring line,
                     lately.  This one's new.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Naw, I had that around for a while.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Sure you did.  Help me with this
                     hold cover, willya?

     So Kabuo slides the cover away.  They peer in.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     There's nothin' to see.  I need to

     He has the fishing GAFF.  Three-and-a-half feet long.  Steel hook
     at one end.  Hands it to Moran.

<b>                               ABEL
</b>                     There's blood on it.

</b>                     Fish blood, I gaff fish with that.

     Moran carefully examines the object.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     You gaff with the <u>hook</u> end.
                     Blood's on the butt.  Where

</b>                     Sure.  Blood gets all <u>over</u> your
                     hand, Sheriff, ask any fisherman.

     Moran takes out a handkerchief.  Holds the gaff with it.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Gonna have this tested.  Now you
                     go home, okay?  Wait til you hear

                     be in Canada.

     Kabuo's face has gone dead.  Which makes it seem somehow fierce,
     almost threatening.  And the sheriff is watching that.

<b>                               MORAN

     splashed with decorations.  Thick and powerful, no neck, razor cut.
     The eyes are alive.

     Hooks finds that interesting.  Begins to pace.

<b>     EXT. TRAINING FIELD, CAMP SHELBY, MISSISSIPPI - DAY

     The squad of Nisei recruits, one hundred young Asian faces,
     surround Sgt. Maples.  He paces before them, holding up a wooden
     staff, looking in their eyes...

<b>                               MAPLES
</b>                     Anyone.

     And Kabup steps forward.  Bows slightly.  Then salutes...

<b>                               KABUO
</b><b>                     SIR!

     Maples stares.  Hard.

<b>                               MAPLES
</b>                     You don't salute me, you don't
                     call me 'sir', soldier, I'm an

     Kabuo stares back.  Blank.

<b>                               MAPLES

<b>                               MAPLES
</b>                     No more 'sir'.  That's the last
                     of that.

     Tosses Kabuo a wooden staff and a helmet.  A little hard.  As Kabuo
     slips the helmet on...

<b>                               MAPLES
</b>                     The exercise is avoiding thrusts.

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     Ready, sergeant.

     Cut off in mid-word, Maples glares back.  Are you?  THRUSTS
     sharply, but Kabuo moves just enough to slip the blow by no more
     than an inch.  Their eyes lock.  Suddenly, Maples unleashes...

     ...a SAVAGE series of THRUSTS at blinding SPEED, and Kabuo...

     ...SLIPS them all effortlessly, scarcely seeming to move.  As a man
     might toy with a child.  Maples studies the face for any trace of
     mockery.  And sees nothing at all.  STABS out, only to have Kabuo...

     ...SLASH Maples' staff from his grasp, with a move so quick as to
     be nearly invisible.  Maples clearly STUNNED by the display.

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     Excuse me.

     He bends, picks up Maples' staff, hands it to him.  And bows.
     Slightly.  The sergeant is hot.  He looks into the faces of this
     Nisei regiment, searching for a single smirk.  There is none.

<b>                               MAPLES

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     For combat.  Sergeant.

     And Maples LUNGES with surprising speed, to be SWEPT off his feet
     in a BLUR, lying FLAT on the earth, his head PINNED to the ground
     by the tip of Kabuo's staff.

     A hush.  Kabuo withdraws his staff.  Retrieves Maples'...

                               KABUO (just above a whisper)
                     Your weapon, sergeant.

     And bows.

     Maples smiling easily.  Like a guy telling the story in a bar.

<b>                               HOOKS

                     And you would move onto the farm.

     In the box, the widow sits in lovely dignity.  Blonde and alabaster
     and modest, in her black dress of mourning.

     Her legs wrapped around his body, feet locked behind the small of
     his back.  Carl holds her high with his strong hands, so he can
     lick her breasts to the rhythm of the slow, slow thrusts.  Her wet
     blonde hair is pasted across her face, and her eyes are closed.
     The intensity holds us.

</b>
     Ishmael driving an aged DeSoto through the blanketed strawberry
     fields of Center Valley.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     My father had bought the DeSoto
                     fifteen years before.  Driving it
                     reminded me of him.  Which I
                     considered a neutral fact...

     He turns the wheel, using a cherry wood knob, specially mounted for
     his convenience.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Actually, it was pleasant.

     Following the curve, fields are pure white to the horizon.

</b>                     Snow made all the fields into one.
                     The notion that one man might kill
                     another for a small patch, made no
                     sense.

     Up ahead, a Willys station wagon has run into a ditch.  A middle
     aged Japanese man is working at a rear wheel with a shovel.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     But I knew such things occurred.
                     Having been to war and all.

     The man is Hisao Imada, and we can now see his eldest daughter
     working with a shovel behind the car.  Ishmael pulls up behind
     them.  And gets out.

     He crunches over to where Hisao works...

<b>                               ISHMAEL

     Hatsue has come around the car now, pulling her snowflaked hair
     from her eyes.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I didn't look at her.  I thought
                     that would be best.

     Her eyes on Ishmael's profile, Hatsue goes to her father's side.
     Murmurs to him in Japanese.  WHen he answers, she turns to face
     Ishmael...

<b>                               HATSUE

                     car, shortly.

     Ishmael smiles softly.  This car isn't going anywhere.  He goes to
     Hatsue, reaching gently for her shovel.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Okay, I'll help.

<b>     INT. DESOTO, SOUTH BEACH DRIVE - TWILIGHT

     Ishmael drives with Hisao beside him.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I know it's caused you trouble.
                     But don't you think the snow is
                     beautiful, coming down?

     His eyes flick to Hatsue in the rearview mirror.  She stares out
     the side window, concentrating on the world.  Two strands of wet
     hair pasted against her cheek.

<b>                               HISAO
</b>                     Yes, <u>very</u> beautiful.

     Suddenly, her eyes SNAP to meet Ishmael's in the mirror.  His dart
     away.  Hers hold.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     This trial is unfair.  You should
                     write about that in your newspaper.

     He keeps driving.  And he keeps his eyes on the road.

                               ISHMAEL (calmly)
                     What should I say?

                     It is only about prejudice, and that
                     is unfair.

     He thinks.  As he drives.  Hisao Imada silent beside him.

                     arrest people or convict them.  Or
                     run a newspaper.

     And his eyes come up.  Meet hers in the mirror.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Maybe I <u>should</u> write a column.
                     What do you think?

     She studies his face.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     What do <u>you</u> think?

     No smile.  On either side.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I think people.  Should be fair.

     His eyes on the road now.  The farmhouse seen through the drifting
     screen of white.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Will you write that?

     Her voice is soft.  The difference is palpable.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I might just.

     His voice is kindness and friendship.

</b>                     I was part of her life again.  I

     A tower of reinforced concrete, rising a hundred feet above the
     sea.  Ishmael's hand in his pocket.  Trudging toward it.

<b>     INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - DUSK

     Ishmael being led into a cramped room, stacked floor to ceiling
     with wooden crates, file cabinets, duffel bags.  Our host is
     LEVANT, a young Coast Guard radioman nearly six foot six, with a
     huge Adam's apple, and kinky black hair.  He gestures around the
     room at all the records.  Voila.

     Ishmael looks around.  There is a <u>lot</u> of stuff.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     And you keep the records, or

     Ishmael nods.  Guess so.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     All kinds of radio transmissions?
                     Fisherman in trouble, and such.

     Innocent question.  Random example.

</b>                     All kinds.  Make yourself at home.

     And leaves.  Ishmael looks at the task before him.  Then, out
     the window.  Dark now.  His reflection stares back.  As troubled
     as he is.

<b>     INT. PETERSEN'S GROCERIES - DAY
</b>
     Ishmael at 24, carrying milk and crackers down the aisle of a
     grocery store, the empty sleeve of his mackinaw pinned up at the
     elbow.  He turns the corner to see...

     ...three people in line at the register.  The second is Hatsue.  An
     infant carried at her shoulder.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I'd been back two months.  It was
                     the first time I'd seen her.

     He joins the line.  The CHECKER glances his way, then looks
     awkwardly down.  This makes the others turn.  And Hatsue's eyes.
     Meet his.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Hello.

     The voice, the face, are cool and formal.  There is no anger, no
     unkindness.  Only the absence of warmth.  Ishmael nods.  His face
     hard, stricken.  His heart pounds in his throat.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I couldn't say anything.  I just
                     stood there, hating her.

</b>                     The Japs did it.

     No one knows where to look.  Down, away, anything.  But Hatsue
     never blinks.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     They shot it off.  At Tarawa.

     She holds her ground, her eyes soften, somehow.  Somewhere between
     compassion and pity.  Her slender fingers stroke the baby at her
     shoulder.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I'm sorry, I'm sorry I said that.

     All the feeling comes to his eyes.  Everything he will never tell
     her.  A murmur...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I'm sorry about everything.  All
                     of it.

     He drops his milk and crackers on the counter.

     And walks away.

<b>     INT. LIGHTHOUSE RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT

     Ishmael sits alone.  Beyond the glass, a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the
     sea, the snow-covered shore.  But Ishmael stares at a folder.  Open
     in his lap.

                     a Greek-owned freighter, was lost.

     And Ishmael removes the page from the file.  Slowly, he folds it
     into quarters.  Slides it into his coat pocket.

     See Hatsue down on the beach.  Alone, raking for steamer clams.
     Her baby beside her on a blanket, beneath an umbrella.

     Ishmael walks down to the sand.  Crosses to where she works.  And
     squats down.  At a respectful distance.

</b>                     Can I talk to you?

     She must have seen who was coming.  Because the words do not
     startle her.  Or slow her work.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't
                     right for us to be alone.  People
                     will t...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u>
                     to talk to you.

     Her back is to him.  She is motionless.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Don't you owe me that?

     And she turns.  Her eyes go first to her sleeping child.  Then she
     walks over, and sinks to the sand.  Just before him.  Near enough
     to touch.

     She looks in his eyes.  And waits.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I'm like a dying person.

     The words just came out.  His eyes move over her face.  His aching
     for her is naked, beyond his ability to cope.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I don't sleep.  I tell myself this
                     can't go on, but it goes on anyway.

     He seems at the edge of insanity.  Or tears.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I did a terrible thing, Ishmael.
                     I knew what you felt.  And what I
                     didn't.

     Sadness in her voice.  But strength as well.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     And I never found the courage to
                     tell you.

     His eyes swim with tears.  He chokes them back, he has to.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     You'll think this is crazy, but all
                     I want is to hold you.  Just once.
                     And smell your hair.

     She absorbs this.  No sign of repulsion or anger.  Her eyes seem
     wise.  And very sad.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     You have to hear this, I can
                     never touch you, Ishmael.  Not
                     once, not ever.  There's no half-
                     way.  As much as I know it hurts
                     you, you have to let this go.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Look, I <u>want</u> to forget you, I do.
                     I think if you hold me, just this
                     once, I can walk away and never
                     speak to you again.

     She just keeps looking at him.  There is a bravery to her steady
     gaze.  Her calm resolve.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Please?  As one human being to
                     another, just because I'm miserable
                     and don't know where to turn.  I
                     need to be in your arms.  If it's
                     just for thirty seconds.

     His pleading look holds her for a moment.  In the silence...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I hurt for you.  Whether you'll
                     ever believe that or not.

     Feeling behind her eyes.  First time she lets it show.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     I feel sick sometimes, with the
                     guilt of what I've done to you.
                     And I can't make it right.

     She rises slowly.  Brushes the sand from her skirt.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     To hold you would be wrong and
                     deceitful.  You're going to have
                     to live without holding me, that
                     is the truth of the way things are.

     She takes one step back.

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Things end.  They do.  Get on
                     with your life.

     And turns away.  She gathers her baby in her arms.  Takes her
     blanket, her umbrella, her rake and her pail.  He watches, never
     moving, as she gathers her things.  Gathers them as if he wasn't
     there.  And with her back turned...

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     Get on with your life.

     She walks slowly away.  Her baby cries.

<b>     INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</b>
     CLOSE on a steaming soup kettle, resting on a woodstove.  A woman's
     hand stirs with a wooden ladle.  PULL BACK to see...

     HELEN CHAMBERS, slender and strong and keen.  She is not yet 60.  A
     code of fairness and self-reliance is written on the fine-boned
     features.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I drove from the lighthouse to
                     my mother's place.  I brought
                     her some groceries.

     Beyond the window, snow falls more heavily than ever.  Silent.
     Spellbinding.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     Your father thought that heavy snow
                     was God's kindness.  Despite the
                     hardship, it brought us beauty...

     Ishmael at the rustic table.  Watching her back.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     ...and reminded us.  Of our place
                     in things.

     Softer.  Not bitter, but regretful that...

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     You don't believe in God anymore.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve,
                     Ma.  We just don't pretend we know.

     She begins ladling the soup into big porcelain bowls.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     We don't <u>know</u> God, we <u>feel</u> Him.  You
                     felt Him as a child.  I remember.

     And turns.  Looks at him.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     That's a long time ago.  What a
                     child feels...that's different.

     She studies him silently for a moment.  Then brings the bowls to
     the table...

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     Spend the night, will you?  Don't
                     go back out into all that snow.

     Sets them down.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I felt Milholland's report in my
                     pocket.  And wondered why I wasn't
                     telling her.  Telling someone.
                     What I'd found.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     You've been busy with that trial,
                     I suppose.  Such a travesty...

     She takes her seat.  As he watches her.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     They only arrested that poor soul
                     because he's Japanese.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They
                     say the evidence is rock solid.

     She begins to eat.  Eyes on her bowl.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     They're not his neighbor, like
                     you are.  He is a husband, a father,
                     he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country.
                     The same as you.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Those aren't the facts that matter.

     She looks up.  Straight to his eyes.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     Well, folks are pretty cold.
                     And folks who believe in nothing
                     else...they're cold, too.

     No mistaking her meaning.  He swallows.  Uneasy as always, in the
     path of her disapproval.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     I've tried to understand your
                     unhappiness, all these years.
                     Having gone to war, losing your arm...

     The directness of her gaze.  He can't turn from that.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     But other boys came back.  And
                     pushed on.  They found girls, and
                     married, had babies...

     He doesn't flinch.  His voice too quiet with...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Someday I'll get lucky, too.

     Too quiet to conceal the hurt.  She thinks it is hurt she has
     caused.  It changes her tone to a plea...

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     Your father fought at Belleau

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     ...but he found you.

     Their eyes locked.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     It isn't the war, Ishmael.  All
                     those years growing up.  You never
                     had a real girl of your own.

     And now he looks down.  He sees that his fist is tight around the
     handle of his spoon.

<b>                               HELEN
</b>                     And I know you have it in you
                     to love.  I know that much.  I
                     wish I knew more.

     His fingers open, and the spoon clatters softly on the wood.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I'll stay tonight.  Thanks
                     for asking.

<b>     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Ishmael wanders through a silent room.  A bed, a dresser.  Work
     table and lamp.  A room denuded of all decoration, all possessions,
     all sign of life.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I came back from the war to
                     this room.  I stayed a few
                     months.  Until my father passed.

<b>     EXT. VETERAN'S CEMETERY - DAY
</b>
     Ishmael at 24, the left sleeve of his dark suit of mourning pinned
     at the elbow.  The diggers are filling a grave in distance.
     Mourners mingle, some casting glances back at Ishmael.  Keeping
     their distance out of awkwardness rationalized as respect.

     One man comes to him.  MASATO NAGAISHI is aging and frail.  But his
     voice is clear...

<b>                               NAGAISHI
</b>                     The Japanese people of the island
                     are saddened by this loss.  Your
                     father was a man of great fairness
                     and compassion for others...

     He stands at a respectful distance.  Ishmael clears his throat.  He
     nods, thank you.  No words to say.  So the small man adds...

<b>                               NAGAISHI
</b>                     A friend to us.  And to all people.

     Silence.  They are a tableau of stone.  Finally...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Well...

     And no more.  The man takes a step back...

<b>                               NAGAISHI
</b>                     We know you will follow in his
                     footsteps.  And honor his legacy.

     Which changes Ishmael's face.  To something harder.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     I thought it then.  And often since.
                     A balance, he's said.  Finding the
                     facts.  That folks needed to know.

<b>     INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Ishmael stands at an open closet.  Cardboard boxes have been set
     aside.  One has been searched for treasure.  The page is in his
     hand.  Only slightly discolored by age.

<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)
</b>                     Dear Ishmael.  These things are
                     very difficult to say.  I can't
                     think of anything more painful
                     than writing this letter.

     He closes his eyes.

                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)
                     Think of reading it.

<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)
</b>                     I don't love you, Ishmael.  There
                     is no more honest way to say it.

     He carries the letter to the twin bed.  Where he slept alone.
     Thinking of her.

<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)
</b>                     Whenever we were together, I knew
                     it.  I loved you and I didn't love
                     you at the same moment.

     He sinks slowly.  As if beneath the letter's weight.

<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)
</b>                     The last time.  At the cedar tree.
                     I knew we could never be right
                     together.  And that soon I would
                     have to tell you.

     His eyes are dry.  The letter has used up his tears long ago.

<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)
</b>                     This is the last time I will write
                     to you.  I am not yours anymore.

     He sets the letter on the bed beside him.

<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)
</b>                     I wish you the very best.  Your
                     heart is large and you are gentle
                     and kind.  I know you will do great
                     things in the world.

     He reaches now to his inside coat pocket.  Withdrawing...

<b>                               HATSUE (V.O.)
</b>                     I must say good-bye to you now.

                     we can.

     ...a page.  Folded in quarters.  Sets it near the letter.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Milholland's report was like her
                     letter.  Something no one else.

     He stares at them.  Side by side.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Thing about having only one hand.
                     It's hard to tear pages up.  And
                     I wasn't carrying a match.

     He lies back.  Across the bed.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     So I thought of my father.  The man
                     who would have taken this report to

     Tears stand in his eyes.

</b>                     But every reporter.  Chooses his own

<b>                               NELS

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     He didn't say no.  That was Kabuo's
                     point.  Given how Carl's mother
                     felt, Carl was <u>still</u> willing to
                     consider selling to us.  It was a
                     good sign.

     Nels considers that.

                     he respected Carl's right to
                     reflect.  He was sure Carl would
                     do the honorable thing.

                               NELS (right back)
                     And did he?

<b>                               HATSUE
</b>                     The night of the 15th, Kabuo helped
                     Carl at sea.  With his dead battery.

     Nels raises his eyebrows.  To give the point its weight.

                     agreed.  $8400 for the seven acres,

                     was so excited when he came home.

     Nels lets that sit.  And sit.

<b>                               HOOKS

                     here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.

     And looks at the prosecutor.  Who rises, easily.  A most polite
     fuck-you smile.  Hooks strolls now.  Slow and steady.  Straight to
     the witness box.  Rests his hands on the rail.  Leans in.

                     <u>defendant</u> left it, as a potential
                     alibi.  In case somebody saw him

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     My question is.  Could Carl have
                     tied up to help the defendant?

     A beat.  A cleared throat.

<b>                               GILLANDERS
</b>                     It <u>coulda</u> happened.  And if I start
                     to say it's doubtful, you'd probl'y
                     say 'no further questions', right?

     Once more, laughter.  Enough to bring the gavel DOWN.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     Right about that.  <u>And</u> right that
                     it 'coulda happened'.

     Turns his back, walks away.

<b>                               HOOKS

     All eyes follow the prosecutor, as he sits.  Except for the
     defendant.  His stare forward.  Recalling...

     Fog.  The sound of water.  Lapping at the hull of a boat.  The mist

     Eyes.  They are blue.  The heavy brows above them dark gold, matted
     and damp.

     CLOSE on a battery well.  One battery sits in place, one spot is
     empty.  And...

     ...CRASH!  The butt end of a fishing gaff BANGS against the metal
     flange.  Again.  Again.  AGAIN.  And as the next blow is STRUCK,
     the huge hand...

     ...slips, and the soft metal SLICES Carl's flesh across his palm.
     He stops.  Then SMASHES away, twice more.  We PULL BACK to see...

     ...two batteries lie above the well.  Carl sucks the blood from his

     Kabuo takes his gaff.  Heedless of Carl's blood on the butt end.
     Carl looks up, still crouching above his well.

                               CARL (quietly)

     No response from Kabuo.  He stands above the larger man.  Silent,
     neutral.  Waiting.

                     to be.

     Kabuo's face remains impassive.  Patient.  And the big man squints
     up into it.  Holding a handkerchief to his injured hand.

<b>                               CARL

     He is sorry.  And with that, Kabuo's face eases.  Becomes like
     Carl's own.

                               CARL (grins)

                     You can have it.  The hell with it.

     The look between them now.  Is very wonderful.  In the subtlety of
     its connection.

     The handkerchief comes away from Carl's palm.  And rising, his hand
     extends toward the smaller man.

     the straightness of their gaze, and the silence of the moment.
     Wash years away.

     composed.

                               KABUO (quietly)
                     I was thinking about it.  Every

     No reaction from the defendant.  Nothing anyone can see.

     A beat.

     Silence.

     Silence.

                     I didn't know that was a question.
                     It sounded like a speech.

     him.

                     wife woke me up with the news.  We
                     talked for a few hours.  I left at

                     boat.  That's the truth.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Yes.

     Hooks leans over the box.  Ever so slightly invading Kabuo's space.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     Well, the sheriff found <u>two</u> batteries
                     in your well.  If you left one with

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     I had a spare battery in my shed.
                     I brought it down, and put it in
                     just before the sheriff showed up.

     Ah.  I see.

<b>                               HOOKS

                     Why does this battery story change
                     every time a new question is raised?

     Kabuo looks at him, evenly.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     You asked if I went straight to the

     Hooks turns his eyes to Kabuo.  Stares him down, so the jury can
     watch Kabuo's implacable stare in return.  And softly...

</b>
     CLOSE on handcuffs SNAPPING into place.  Sheriff Moran checks their
     snugness about Kabuo's wrists, as the crowd mills through the
     courtroom in the wake of adjournment.  Grasping Kabuo's arm, Moran
     begins leading him toward a small doorway just at the rear of the
     witness box.  But...

     ...someone is there.  In the doorway.  And Moran's grip tightens as

     The edge on that, the ballsy undertone, throws him a little.

</b>                     Am I going to slip him a weapon

     And she reaches past him.  To take her husband's hands.  She looks
     in his eyes, as if they are alone.

<b>                               HATSUE

     Tears just flood her eyes.  Sudden, unbidden.  She holds tight to
     her smile.  And to his hands.

     ANGLE...from the gallery.  One man watches.  Watches as a woman
     brings manicled hands to her lips.  And walks quickly away...

     ...toward us.  Straight toward us, in fact.  And when she stands
     before us, her hands mangle her purse.  The eyes are hollow, flint-
     edged.

     his touch.

<b>     INT. KABUO'S CELL - NIGHT

     Kabuo sits on the cot, the way we have always seen him.  Alone in
     his mind.  Footfalls.  Kabuo oblivious, far away.  The door CLANGS
     open.

<b>                               MORAN

     And Moran leaves.  The door CLANGS shut.  They are alone.  Only one
     man smiling...

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     Please, sit down...

     But the tall man doesn't.  Doesn't move.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     She told me you're writing a
                     column.  We're very grateful.

     Ishmael nods, awkwardly.  Acknowledging this.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     She.  Said you two go way back...

     Ishmael stares into Kabuo's earnest smile.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     That's nice.

                     in his hand.  When you found
                     him in the fog.

     Kabuo blinks.  The man's tone is formal.  As if the offer of
     friendliness is somehow rejected.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     And another one.  Lashed to
                     the mast?

     Kabuo's own smile has faded.  The mask has returned.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     That's right.

<b>                               ISHMAEL

     And Kabuo grins.  In spite of himself.

<b>                               KABUO
</b>                     If I did the math right.

     Ishmael leans back.  Against the door.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     It's the sheriff's math.  I'm

<b>     INT. SOMMENSEN'S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     Blackness.  The sound of wind.  Of water lapping at wood.  CLICK of
     a key, springing a lock.  The SCRAPE of a large PADLOCK sliding
     away.  A door CREAKS open, and from the sound of it, a large one.

     Gray light seeps in.

<b>                               MORAN (O.S.)
</b>                     Blackmail.  That's all it is.

     See them now.  Three SILHOUETTES framed in thr barn's open doorway.
     Against the night sky.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (O.S.)

     A soft CLICK, and the LIGHTS go on.  Such as they are.  A few
     bare bulbs strung across the rafters of this towering ramshackle
     enclosure.  A 50-year-old mildewed barn, built of creosoted
     timbers.  This is a place for overhauling boats, with sea doors
     facing the harbor.

     Two BOATS are tied to wide-elbowed piers.  We've seen them before.

<b>                               MORAN

     Moran snorts.  Points up to the cross spar, high on the mast of the
     first boat.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     See, no lantern.

                     Sheriff?  That's Miyamoto's boat.

     Oh.  Moran swings his gaze up to the second boat.

                               MORAN (quiet triumph)
                     No lantern there, neither.

     Sure enough.  No lantern on the cross spar.  They keep walking.

<b>                               MORAN

</b>                     It's public record.  If the public
                     cares enough to read it.

     They step across the gunnel.  Onto Carl Heine's boat.  Flashlights
     working against the dim, eerie glow of distant bulbs, they enter
     Carl's cabin.

     Neat as a pin.  Ishmael scans the floor.

<b>                               ISHMAEL

     And points to the cup.  Sitting on the counter.

<b>                               ABEL
</b>                     It's the only thing I moved, I

     And stops.  Because Ishmael's gaze has gone to a kerosene lantern.
     In the corner.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     One lantern.  Like the inventory
                     says.  Sorry to disappoint you.

     But Ishmael is out the door.  Shining his flashlight.  Up the mast.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Actually.  I was hoping you got
                     it right.  What's that, up there?

     And they all squint up.  Shining their lights together.  Along the
     cross spar.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Nothin'.  Bits of string.

     That's what it looks like.  Many of them.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Pieces of twine aren't nothing.

     And he steps to the base of the mast.  Puts the flashlight in his
     pocket.  Wraps his arm around the shaft of wood.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     Here now, what are you fixin'

</b>                     Have a look.  At nothing.

     And wrapping his legs around the mast, he hoists himself up.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     You can't go up there, touch things...

     With all his strength.  Ishmael begins to climb.

                               ISHMAEL (grunting)
                     Trial's over, Sheriff, it's with
                     the jury now.

     Supporting himself with his legs, he struggles upward.

<b>                               MORAN
</b>                     You gonna climb that with one arm?

</b>                     You're right.  I better use two.

     Up he goes, inching his way, Abel shining his flashlight.  Moran
     swings his beam up, too.

<b>                               ABEL
</b>                     There's lots of 'em, Art, look.

     And Moran is looking.  Saying nothing.  Now, Ishmael is there.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     A dozen or more, all figure eights.

<b>                               ABEL
</b>                     And look at that streak of rust,
                     across the mast.

     His light playing on it.  Bracing his full weight with his legs,
     Ishmael fingers the scraps of rope...

<b>                               ISHMAEL

                     Coulda been the one in the cabin.

     Still supporting  himself with his legs, Ishmael pulls out his
     flashlight...

<b>                               ISHMAEL

<b>     INT. JURY ROOM - NIGHT

     Eleven citizens around a walnut table.  Eleven.  Glaring at the
     twelfth.

<b>                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
</b>                     Well.  I guess it comes down to
                     a feeling, don't it?  If I <u>feel</u>
                     uncertain, I feel a <u>doubt</u>.  Isn't
                     that it?

     And the boat builder smiles amicably, rubs his gray beard.  No
     other smiles.  Anywhere.

<b>                               HAROLD JENSEN
</b>                     Alex, nobody ain't ever <u>sure</u> about
                     nothin'.  It's <u>un</u>reasonable to be so
                     stubborn that you think you're smarter
                     than <u>eleven</u> folks who all <u>agree</u>!

</b>                     The man sat there and <u>admitted</u> he
                     <u>lied</u>, Mr. Van Ness.  Now <u>why</u> isn't
                     that enough for you?

<b>                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
</b>                     We're not tryin' him for lying.  Lots
                     of us told lies, one time or another.
                     Prob'ly none of us murdered anybody.

<b>                               HAROLD JENSEN
</b>                     But what <u>drives</u> a man to lie?
                     Means he's <u>hiding</u> somethin'.

<b>                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
</b>                     Not <u>necessarily</u> that he killed
                     Carl.  I'm not sayin' you're wrong,
                     just that I have my doubts.

<b>                               BURKE LATHAM
</b>                     Look, if you changed chairs right
                     now, cos you doubted that maybe a
                     chunk of the moon was gonna fall
                     through the roof, that wouldn't be
                     a <u>reasonable</u> doubt.

     Folks turn to Burke.  What the hell are you talking about?

                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS (laughs)
                     Okay, you win that one.  Now can

<b>                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
</b>                     I think it does.  Miyamoto was on

<b>                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
</b>                     There's a chance it came from his

<b>                               BURKE LATHAM
</b>                     There's a chance of everything.

                     a chance from there, the world ain't
                     made a coincidences only.

     Everyone agrees.  Almost everyone.

<b>                               EDITH TWARDZIK
</b>                     Look, if he gave Carl a battery
                     like he said, he'd only a had <u>one</u>
                     left.  Not two.

<b>                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
</b>                     He explained that.  He replaced it.

                               HARLAN McQUEEN
                     Only he threw that part in when he
                     got cornered.  But first time around,
                     he never mentioned it.

<b>                               ROGER PORTER
</b>                     Alex, stop arguin' just to argue.
                     You can see what <u>really</u> happened,
                     same as us.  Isn't that what we're
                     supposed to do is tell the actual
                     truth?  My God, Carl died, here.

<b>                               ALEXANDER VAN NESS
</b>                     So I don't care Carl died, unless
                     I'm ready to reach for the hangman's
                     rope?  You oughta stop tryin' to

<b>     INT. NELS' KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT
</b>
     Nels in a ratty, frayed old robe, pouring hot water from a kettle
     into mismatched cups.  His hair is wispy and wild, his eyes puffy.
     He COUGHS horrible.  CLEARS his throat...

<b>                               NELS

     And drops tea bags into the cups with a splash.

</b>                     ...I'll give you that.

     Lisps over to the cluttered table.  Where his guest is waiting.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     It's the way it happened, I know

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     No, you don't.

     Nels sits.  Slowly.  Ishmael removes his bag.  Sips his tea.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     That report.  About the freighter?
                     You didn't find that tonight, did you?

     No answer.  Ishmael keeps sipping.  Holding eye contact.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     You went right to the cell.  Then
                     to the boat.  Then here.  How long
                     did you know about the freighter?

                               ISHMAEL (just above a whisper)
                     One day.

     Nels' turn.  To sip his tea.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     This tastes horrible, hmmn?

<b>                               NELS

                     gonna like my waking up his old
                     bones.  in the middle of the night.

     And he smiles.  A wonderful smile.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Yes, he was.

     Another sip.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     He's looking down.  And he's not
                     thinking 'bout the man you were
                     yesterday.  He's proud of the man
                     you are tonight.  That's what counts.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     To my father.  Everything counts.

     Nels watches the pain in that.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     What if I told you he once said
                     to me...don't matter the road we
                     take.  Just so we get there.

                               ISHMAEL (smiles)
                     Then you'd be lying.

<b>                               NELS

</b>                     All right, let's say that twine
                     <u>had</u> been there to lash a lantern.
                     That it had come from the shuttle of
                     twine found in the deceased's pocket.

     Edith Twardzik.  Burke Latham.  Alexander Van Ness.

<b>                               NELS (O.S.)
</b>                     Now to re-open a trial that had
                     gone to jury...new evidence should
                     be pretty important.

     See Ishmael.  Quiet, intense.  On the witness stand.

<b>                               NELS (O.S.)
</b>                     Tell us why that lantern would be
                     so significant.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Well.  It shows the prosecutor was
                     wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was
                     dead in the water.  Or he'd never
                     have put up the lantern.

     Nels thinks about that.  So the jury will, too.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Now you believe there were <u>two</u>
                     lanterns when defendant arrived.
                     One in Carl's hand.  The second
                     lashed to the mast.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported,
                     and he'd have no reason to lie.
                     He couldn't know that it would help
                     his case.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Well, why does it?

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Because the second lantern, the one
                     on the mast.  Was never found.  So
                     we have to ask...

     A slight shurg.  Stating the obvious.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     ...where did it go?

     And then...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Maybe it went.  Where Carl went.
                     Over the side.

<b>                               HOOKS

</b>                     Your Honor, <u>all</u> of this is

     Nels Gudmundsson nods to himself.  Takes a stroll over to the jury
     box.  No limp today.  Something has put some spring in his step.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     So how does this fit with what

                     freighter that plowed through
                     Ship Channel Bank...

     And turns.  Leaning his scrawny butt against the jury's rail.
     He'll watch this with them now.

<b>                               ISHMAEL

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Fell.

     Ishmael settles in.  Here we go.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Miyamoto gave him the battery, and
                     left.  Carl's boat was running, he
                     goes back to fishing.  But at some
                     point, he thinks of the lantern...

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Still lashed to the mast.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     He figures a perfectly good
                     lantern could get banged around
                     up there.  So he climbs up.  To
                     cut it down.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Just as the freighter comes through?
                     Isn't that quite a coincidence?

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Coincidences happen.  You run a
                     yellow light <u>just</u> as a car comes
                     out of nowhere.  Split-second tragedy
                     happens every day.  Or maybe...

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Maybe...?

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Maybe Carl picks up something about
                     the freighter on his radio, which is
                     now working.  Same report Milholland
                     heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the
                     lantern fast.  Before the freighter's
                     wake can bang it around.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u>
                     have climbed up earlier.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Then where's the lantern?  And
                     where's the knife?

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     The knife.  What knife?

     As if he really has forgotten.  As if he wants to know.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Coroner found an empty knife sheath
                     on Carl's belt.  But they never
                     found the knife.

     He's nodding.  Yes, that's right.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     He climbs up.  His hand wound still
                     bleeding.  That's the blood I found
                     on the mast.  <u>And</u> the twine.

     Nels' eyes are rapt.  His mouth is shut.  No way he interrupts this

</b>                     He <u>cuts</u> the lantern free, the
                     freighter's wake <u>hits</u>, the boat
                     rolls <u>hard</u>, his bloody hand <u>slips</u>.
                     tracing blood along the mast...

     A hush.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     He falls.  The lantern, the knife,
                     go <u>into</u> the water.  Same as Carl.

     The words hang there.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     And inside the cabin, a coffee
                     cup falls off the counter.

     Shakes his head.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     But there's no one around.  To
                     pick it up.

     Nels ponders.  Puts his hand to his chin.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Still a coincidence.  Timing
                     and all.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     The freighter started through
                     at 1:42.  The sea water seeped
                     into Carl's watch and stopped it.
                     At 1:47.

     CUT to the defendant.  Ramrod straight, nothing revealed in his
     face.  And to his wife.  Elegant, erect.  Her eyes flooded with
     tears.

<b>                               NELS

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     He hit his head.  On the way in.

     Silence.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     You think so?

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     The sheriff and the deputy and I
                     inspected the deck closely.  We
                     found a small fracture in the wood
                     of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Well, anything coulda caused that.

     Ishmael nods.  No smile at all.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Anything.  That had a blond hair.

     And Nels is walking now.  Toward the prosecutor's table.  Pulling a
     small cellophane bag from hisinside pocket.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     Request introduction of Exhibit 18.
                     One single blond hair.  Which Sheriff
                     Moran dug out of that fracture.  Below
                     the mast.  Of Carl Heine's boat.

     Lays the bag on the table.  Just in front of Hooks.  Turns to the
     judge.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     We will call Sheriff Moran, who
                     will confirm this.  And Coroner
                     Whaley to testify that the damage
                     to the gunnel is of a size and
                     nature not inconsistent with the
                     deceased's skull fracture...

     Turns to the prosecutor...

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     But for now.  Your witness...

     And just strolls on over to his seat.  Looks in his client's eyes.
     How 'bout them apples?  Kabuo loves this old guy.  And right here,
     he lets a little of that show.

     Across the way, the prosector is rising.  He smiles.  Friendly,
     almost amused.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     I have to start reading your
                     paper more closely.  You're quite
                     a storyteller.

                               ISHMAEL (straight back)
                     Thank you.  Coming from the man who
                     wrote, 'But here, adrift in the fog,
                     I <u>plead</u> for your help'...that's quite
                     a compliment.

     There is a ripple of laughter.  But no smile on Ishmael's features.
     His game face is on.  Come and get me, sucker.  And Hooks does
     come, one step at a time.  Straight to the box.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     <u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u>
                     right.  For your little story to
                     fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be
                     on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I'm sorry, was there a question
                     in there?

     No love lost.  And no pretense about it.  Hatsue Miyamoto sits with
     her hand in her mother's.  Watching these men battle for her
     husband's life.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     Well, the freighter.  The twine.
                     The blood.  The knife.  The cup.
                     The watch.  The second battery.
                     The phantom lantern.  The fishing
                     gaff.  The cracked gunnel.  The
                     skull wound.  The blond hair.  That's
                     <u>eleven</u> things...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Twelve.

     Hooks smiles.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     I stand corrected, sir.  And you
                     have a neat explanation for every
                     one of them.

     Hooks nods.  Yes, you do.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     And since you confess this is
                     all pure guesswork.  What is your
                     expertise, sir, are you a detective
                     of sorts?

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     My expertise.  Is that I'm a
                     journalist.

     Right at his eyes.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     And journalism.  Is balance.  Finding
                     the facts folks need to know.

     The words ring with quiet, heartfelt conviction, that others cannot
     fully appreciate.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Then putting them together.  So
                     truth is revealed.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are
                     <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u>
                     of these twelve pieces.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Oh, yes.

     And the prosecutor stops.  Confused for an instant by this
     confession.  Until...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     But <u>no</u> other way.  To explain
                     them all.

     A heart-stopping hush.  As everyone, as Hooks himself, sees the
     cehckmate.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     And since they <u>all</u> happened.
                     This is the only explanation
                     that's the truth.

     The prosecutor looks like he's been slapped.  Like every act of
     will is necessary to maintain composure.  To find the easy,
     untroubled smile.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     Your line of work.  You must meet
                     a lot of men play fast and loose

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     Like you couldn't believe.

     Service returned.  Hooks leans in.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     Well, the defendant is a liar.
                     He's confessed that much.  And his
                     explanation is...he was afraid.

     And leans in some more.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     Afraid that the good folks of
                     this jury.  Would be too stupid
                     to understand.  Too prejudiced
                     to be fair.

     Shakes his head.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     You buy that?

                               ISHMAEL (gently)
                     I think he was greedy.

     And once more.  The prosecutor can only blink.  Can only move
     toward the trap.

<b>                               HOOKS
</b>                     Greedy.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     He didn't want to lose any more.

     No smile.  No smile as the trap springs shut.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     He'd lost a lot in the war, you
                     see.  I had sent him away.  To a
                     concentration camp.  But a nice
                     one.  <u>Far</u> less brutal than the Nazis.
                     Because I'm a civilized person.

     He stops.  Lets Hooks clear his throat.

<b>                               HOOKS

                     questions.

     Turns to Judge Fielding.  With all respect...

<b>                               ISHMAEL

                     Honor?  Anout the defendant's
                     motivation to lie?

<b>                               JUDGE

                     son.  Now, you say <u>you</u> sent the

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I didn't say.  I did it alone.

     And things get real quiet.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     So there he was.  His father lost
                     his health there, finally died.
                     They lost more than Etta Heine's
                     seven acres.  They lost their
                     liberty, their dignity.  Their
                     ideals about this country.

     So much feeling in this.  He has to stop.  Swallow hard.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     They lost their trust in us.  We
                     had treated them worse than animals.
                     How would we now see tham.  As human
                     beings?

     Tells the jury.  Straight to their faces.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     This man lost a lot in the war.
                     He didn't want now to lose his
                     babies.  Or the woman who loves him.

     Another level of quiet.  He turns to the prosecutor...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     And my expertise in this, sir.  Is
                     that I lost a lot in the war myself.

     Words coming from someplace very deep.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     And the fact that I am the only
                     witness.  Who placed his <u>right</u> hand
                     upon the Holy Bible.  Is the <u>least</u>
                     of it, sir.  I assure you of that.

     Silence.

<b>                               HOOKS

                     Nor is Judge Fielding, or myself.
                     Nor the good people of this jury.
                     For events that took place twelve

     No sir.

<b>                               HOOKS

                     people if they were a mite resent-
                     ful.  At a tactic that insults
                     their intelligence.

<b>                               ISHMAEL

<b>                               HOOKS

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a
                     reasonable doubt.

     And he smiles.  First time.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     It's fortunate that the man who
                     <u>needs</u> to prove <u>his</u> fancy story.
                     Beyond a reasonable doubt.  Is
                     someone else.

     There is laughter in the room, so welcome is any chance to relieve
     the tension.  The gavel BANGS.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I'm sorry, Mr. Hooks.  I apologize
                     for my tone.  This is not a contest.
                     Between you and me.

     Shakes his head.  No, it isn't.

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     For it is not.  As Mr. Gudmundsson
                     so wisely put it.  A small trial.
                     In a small place.

     His eyes are damp now.  Strangely enough, after all this.  He is at
     last on the brink of losing control.  Because...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     I lost more in that war than

                     a lot of folks.  And what we got
                     back in return...

     His voice breaks slightly.  But it rings with dignity on...

<b>                               ISHMAEL
</b>                     ...was a country.  Where a man
                     was innocent.  Until we <u>proved</u>

     CLOSE on Hatsue Miyamoto, speaking earnestly, her eyes down, her
     purse in her lap, her slender hands expressing the intensity of her
     feelings as she makes her point, and we...

     PULL BACK to reveal that she is on a corridor bench, surrounded by
     a half dozen REPORTERS, who are crouching, standing, scribbling
     away.  Two PHOTOGRAPHERS pop flashes that she does not seem to
     notice, as she continues with refined determination, and we...

     PULL BACK, down the hallway to the POV of a man who sits alone,
     unnoticed.  There is an unopened pack of cigarettes in his only
     hand, turning absently in long, strong fingers that crinkle the
     pristine cellophane.  His eyes are fixed to hatsue, holding court
     at a distance.  Fixed, as if no other sight could ever command this
     level of attention.

</b>                     All things considered...

     Hearing the voice, Ishmael looks down.  Uneasy to have been caught
     staring so intently.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     ...you were adequate.

     No smile accompanies the irony.  For that would be condescending.

<b>                               NELS
</b>                     I could make a few quibbles, but
                     I am loathe to hurt your feelings.

     The old man sits.  Very slowly.

<b>                               ISHMAEL

     Ishmael tries to tear the cellophane without success.  Nels seems
     not even to notice.

                               NELS (quietly)
                     She is simply.  Beautiful.

     Ishmael's eyes cut to him.  A little quickly.  Confides...

<b>                               ISHMAEL

     makes no move to intervene.

                     to a pack of cigarettes.

     Comfortable together.  In this hour of discomfort.  Ishmael brings
     the corner of the pack to his teeth, and tears the cellophane away.

<b>                               ISHMAEL

                     Maybe they won't.

     The way he said that.  Subtly ominous.  Ishmael watching Nels'
     face, as the old man takes two cigarettes...

<b>                               NELS

     Hatsue.

                     something.

     There it is.  Kindness in this old man's face.  He brings the other
     cigarette to his lips.  And Ishmael takes out the match box.  Never
     breaking eye contact.

<b>                               ISHMAEL

<b>                               NELS

     Asked so casually.  Ishmael turns.  Hatsue is standing now,
     surrounded by people, her mother grasping her arm.

                               ISHMAEL (a murmur)
                     Hooks called her deceitful.
                     And I knew she wasn't.

     He's watching her.  Across the way.  So intently.

<b>                               ISHMAEL

     Ishmael's eyes still fixed to Hatsue, grim-faced, listening to her
     mother's murmurings, as she...

     ...disappears through the door.  Never having looked our way.

<b>                               NELS

<b>     INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</b>
     The hush of a hundred silences.  We can feel the air crackle in the
     stillness.  Judge Fielding is leafing through papers.  No one
     coughs, no one blinks...

                               JUDGE (clears his throat)
                     Mister foreman, has the jury
                     reached a verdict?

     He looks up.  Across the distance, Harold Jensen rises in the jury
     box.

<b>                               HAROLD JENSEN
</b>                     We have, Your Honor.

     And holds out a slip of paper.  Little more than a scrap.  Folded
     once.

<b>                               JUDGE
</b>                     Will the bailiff please bring
                     the verdict to the bench.

     The bailiff does so, walking crisply to minimize his moment in the
     limelight.  He hands the slip to the judge, who unfolds it, and...

     ...stops.  Staring for a hung instant.  As if seeing something
     unexpected.  he folds it again, rather carefully, thoughtfully, and
     as he hands it back to the bailiff...

                               JUDGE (softly)
                     Will the defendant please rise.

     Kabuo and Nels rise together.  But it is only into the defendant's
     eyes that the judge stares.  No expression in the face of either
     man.  But something passes, all the same.

     As the bailiff crosses to return the verdict to the foreman, we
<b>     SNAP TO...
</b>
     REVERSE ANGLE...every pair of eyes in the room are on the foreman,
     now opening the slip of paper.

     Every pair.  But one.

<b>                               JUDGE (O.S.)
</b>                     Will the foreman please read the
                     verdict aloud.

     One reporter stares across the grain of all other sight lines.
     Toward a woman who does not see him.  In case she needs his eyes.
     To be waiting.

     citizens of Japanese ancestry have forgotten custom and decorum,
     as has...

     ...a woman who comes OUT of her seat, tears on her face, not
     even realizing she is standing, Hatsue clings to the railing that
     separates her from her husband.  Throughout the gallery, now...

     ...some of the citizens assembled add their applause.  Others look
     awkward, not knowing how to react.

     The gavel lies untouched, unnoticed, by a jurist who has no problem
     with anything that is taking place right now.  Saying only to the
     jury...

<b>                               JUDGE

     As they assent...

</b>                     Go home, son.  God bless.

     CRACKS the gavel on its block.  The defendant is OUT of his chair,
     and with one strong grip of gratitude to the frail shoulder of his
     counsel, he is...

     ...AT the rail, through the POPPING of flashbulbs, she is IN his
     arms, the embrace so FIERCE on both sides, everyone crowding around
     them.

     An old man's eyes sweep the gallery, looking for someone.  Only
     to find...

     ...Ishmael's back.  As he disappears through the door.

     to have caught her breath.  She holds tight to her husband's hand,
     as he...

     ...carries his baby son in the other arm, his 8-year-old daughter
     leaning against him, her 4-year-old sister standing on the bench

     squints up...

</b>                     God's kindness, my father said.
                     Despite the hardship...it reminds
                     us.  Of our place in things.

     Our place in things.  He slides a black cigar between his teeth...

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     What the hell.  Did he mean
                     by that?

     He has the match box.  Manipulating it with the dexterity we've
     come to know.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Things fall on us, I suppose.
                     From the sky.

     STRIKES the match on his belt buckle...

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Wars.  Freighters plowing through...

     Cupping it expertly in a single motion, he brings the flame to the
     cigar.  A single puff.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     And we seem...helpless.  Until we
                     understand.

     One more.  Savors it.  The sky.  The thought.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Accident rules every corner of
                     the universe...

     Down the steps.  Snow swirling between us.  Gone.

<b>                               ISHMAEL (V.O.)
</b>                     Except the chambers.  Of the
                     human heart.
