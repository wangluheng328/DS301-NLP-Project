Carl, a fisherman in the waters off Washington state, has been found dead, drowned in his own nets, but with a serious head wound.
Was he murdered?
Post-war anti-Japanese sentiments are still running high, and a murder suspect is found in the local Japanese-American community in the form of Kabuo, another fisherman, who had a grudge against Carl's family.
Ishmael, the small town's newspaperman, may have the information that would acquit Kabuo, but can he ever put his jilted love for Hatsue (Kazuo's wife) aside?
