Young Miranda Presley, an aspiring Country-singer/writer, comes to Nashville, Tennessee, to enter the weekly singer contest held at "The Bluebird Cafe".
There she meets James Wright, an energetic, but somewhat chaotic young man, Kyle Davidson, a more laid-back kind of guy and Linda Lue Linden, who's career may not necessarily be in Country...
When both James and Kyle get attracted to Miranda, she makes a decision.
