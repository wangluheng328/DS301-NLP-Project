Loosely based upon the story by Hans Christian Andersen.
Ariel, youngest daughter of King Triton, is dissatisfied with life in the sea.
She longs to be with the humans above the surface, and is often caught in arguments with her father over those "barbaric fish-eaters".
She goes to meet Ursula, the Sea Witch, to strike a deal, but Ursula has bigger plans for this mermaid and her father.
