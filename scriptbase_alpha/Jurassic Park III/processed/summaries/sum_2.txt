When a tragic accident maroons the party of seven, Grant discovers the true reason his deceptive hosts have invited him along.
In their perilous attempt to escape, the dwindling group encounters terrifying new creatures undisclosed by InGen, and Grant is forced to learn the dreadful implications of his raptor intelligence theory firsthand.
