The Fellowship has been broken.
Boromir is dead, Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee have gone to Mordor alone to destroy the One Ring, Merry and Pippin have been captured by the Uruk-hai, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli have made friends of the Rohan, a race of humans that are in the path of the upcoming war, led by its aging king, Théoden.
The two towers between Mordor and Isengard, Barad-dúr and Orthanc, have united in their lust for destruction.
The corrupt wizard Saruman, under the power of the Dark Lord Sauron, and his slimy assistant, Gríma Wormtongue, have created a grand Uruk-hai army bent on the destruction of Man and Middle-earth.
The rebellion against Sauron is building up and will be led by Gandalf the White, who was thought to be dead after the Balrog captured him.
One of the Ring's original bearers, the creature Gollum, has tracked Frodo and Sam down in search of his 'precious', but is captured by the Hobbits and used as a way to lead them to Mt.
Doom.
The War of the Ring has now begun...
