<b>SCENE ONE
</b>
A booth at a Chinese restaurant, Williamson and Levene are
seated at the booth.

<b>                         LEVENE
</b>            John...John...John.  Okay.  John.
            John.  Look:
                   (pause)
            The Glengarry Highland's leads,
            you're sending Roma out.  Fine.
            He's a good man.  We know what he
            is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying,
            you look at the board, he's
            throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's
            throwing them away, he's throwing
            the leads away.  All that I'm
            saying, that you're wasting leads.
            I don't want to tell you your job.
            All that I'm saying, things get
            set, I know they do, you get a
            certain mindset... A guy gets a
            reputation.  We know how this...all
            I'm saying, put a closer on the job.
            There's more than one man for the...
            Put a...wait a second, put a proven
            man out...and you watch, now wait a
            second--and you watch your dollar
            volumes...You start closing them
            for fifty 'stead of twenty-
            five...you put a closer on the...

<b>                         WILLIAMSON
</b>            Shelly, you blew the last...

<b>                         LEVENE
</b>            No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's
            back up here, I did...will you
            please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I
            didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't
            "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out,
            one I closed...

<b>                         WILLIAMSON
</b>            ...you didn't close...

<b>                         LEVENE
</b>            ...I, if you'd listen to me.
            Please.  I closed the cocksucker.
            His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know
            he was married...he, the judge
            invalidated the...

</b><b>                                                            2.

<b>                         WILLIAMSON
</b>            Shelly...

<b>                         LEVENE
</b>            ...and what is that, John?  What?
            Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I
            pray in your life you will never
            find it runs in streaks.  That's
            what it does, that's all it's doing.
            Streaks.  I pray it misses you.
            That's all I want to say.

<b>                         WILLIAMSON
</b>                   (pause)
            What about the other two?

<b>                         LEVENE
</b>            What two?

<b>                         WILLIAMSON
</b>            Four.  You had four leads.  One
            kicked out, one the judge, you say...

<b>                         LEVENE
</b>            ...you want to see the court
            records?  John?  Eh?  You want to
            go down...

<b>                         WILLIAMSON
</b>            ...no...

<b>                         LEVENE
</b>            ...do you want to go downtown...?

<b>                         WILLIAMSON

<b>                         LEVENE

</b>            Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April,
            September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't
            fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an
            order taker, John.  He talks, he
            talks a good game, look at the
            board, and it's me, John, it's me...

<b>                         WILLIAMSON

<b>                         LEVENE
</b>            Lately kiss my ass lately.  That
            isn't how you build an org...talk,
            talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch.
            When we were on Peterson, who paid
            for his fucking car?  You talk to
            him.  The Seville...?  He came in,
            "You bought that for me Shelly."
            Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing.
            Sixty-five, when we were there,
            with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em
            downtown.  What was that?  Luck?
            That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John.
            You're burning my ass, I can't get
            a fucking lead...you think that was
            luck.  My stats for those years?
            Bullshit...over that period of
            time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck.
            It was skill.  You want to throw
            that away, John...?  You want to

</b>            Well I'm going to worry about it,
            and so are you, so shut up and
            listen.
                   (pause)
            I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is
            mine, whatever he gets for himself,
            I'm talking half.  You put me in
            with him.

<b>                         ROMA
</b>            Do you understand?  My stuff is
            mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm
            taking half of his commissions--
            now, you work it out.

</b>            Mmm.

<b>                         AARONOW
</b>            Did they find the guy who broke
            into the office yet?

<b>                         ROMA
</b>            No.  I don't know.

Pause.

<b>                         AARONOW
</b>            Did the leads come in yet?

<b>                         ROMA

            Oh, God, I hate this job.
