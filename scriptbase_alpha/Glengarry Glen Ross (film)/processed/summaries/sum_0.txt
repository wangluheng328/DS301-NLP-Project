Times are tough in a Chicago real-estate office; the salesmen (Shelley Levene, Ricky Roma, Dave Moss, and George Aaronow) are given a strong incentive by Blake to succeed in a sales contest.
The prizes?
First prize is a Cadillac El Dorado, second prize is a set of steak knives, third prize is the sack!
There is no room for losers in this dramatically masculine world; only "closers" will get the good sales leads.
There is a lot of pressure to succeed, so a robbery is committed which has unforeseen consequences for all the characters.
