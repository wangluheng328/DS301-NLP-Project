While preparing for the examination of her Master Degree in Psychology, Julia Lund is called by her friend from childhood Billy Parks to meet him in a bar.
They both had nightmares when they were children, and Billy is totally disturbed with demons from the dark that would be chasing him and commits suicide in front of Julia.
The traumatic experience, plus the meeting with two friends of Billy, Sam Burnside and his girlfriend Terry Alba, in the funeral make Julia having nightmares again.
When Sam tells her that they four have been tagged in their childhood, and demons are coming to get them to the darkness, Julia becomes afraid of the dark and asks for help to her boyfriend Paul Loomis.
