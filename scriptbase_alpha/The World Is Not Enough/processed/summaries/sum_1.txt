When British oil tycoon and M's friend Sir Robert King is killed in a bombing at the MI6 headquarters, it becomes James Bond's new assignment to protect his daughter and heir Elektra from further harm.
Renard, a man who can't feel physical pain due to a bullet in his head, seems to play an important role in the sabotage of the ongoing construction of the new King pipeline, which can give oil to all the world for the future.
The three competing pipelines all end up in Istanbul, whereas the King pipeline is being laid elsewhere, and therefore is an easy goal to anonymous attackers.
James Bond involuntarily teams up with emancipated Dr. Christmas Jones, and they soon find out that there is more threat to the situation than just some pipeline sabotage.
