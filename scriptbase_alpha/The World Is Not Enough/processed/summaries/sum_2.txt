Seductive British secret agent James Bond 007 is injured in the line of duty trying to pursue the assassin who killed herself by blowing herself up in a hot air-balloon.
Fearing Sir Robert's beautiful daughter and heiress Elektra King's life is in danger, M assigns 007 to protect her as Elektra has inherited her father's legacy and has taken over the business, and is constructing a new oil pipeline.
Bond learns a evil terrorist known as Renard, who has a bullet in his head cutting off his senses so he can't smell, touch and feel no pain, was responsible for the assassination of Sir Robert.
With help of nuclear scientist Dr. Christmas Jones and former enemy, Ex KGB agent Valentin Zukovsky, Bond sets out to foil Renard's plan as he plots to wipe out Europe with a nuclear bomb.
Is the World not enough for James Bond 007 as he not only tries to stop Renard, but also begins to question Elektra's motives.
