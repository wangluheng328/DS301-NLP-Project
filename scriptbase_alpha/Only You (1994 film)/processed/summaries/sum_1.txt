Schoolteacher Faith Corvatch believes she is destined to spend her life with a man named "Damon Bradley."
Just days before she is to marry a podiatrist she may not love, she receives a phone call from a friend of her fiance's named, you guessed it, Damon Bradley.
Bradley is on his way to Venice, and Faith decides to spend her Labor Day weekend pursuing her dream man.
Accompanying her on the trip is her sister-in-law, Kate, who has just left her husband.
