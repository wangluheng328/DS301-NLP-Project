After he finds $2 million in the desert where a drug deal has apparently gone wrong, working man Llewelyn Moss finds himself on the run.
His pursuer is Anton Chigurh, an unemotional killer with a unique murder weapon at his disposal.
Throughout, soon to be retired Sheriff Ed Tom Bell attempts to convince Moss, mostly through his wife Carla Jean, that he should turn the money over to the authorities or this could all end in tragedy.
