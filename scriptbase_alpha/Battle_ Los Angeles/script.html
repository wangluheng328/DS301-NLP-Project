<b>                         FADE IN:
</b>          FROM SPACE, a view of the EARTH. The vibrant BLUE of its
          OCEANS is striking against the vast BLACK VOID of space.
          MOVE CLOSER TO THE EARTH, where the shimmering PACIFIC OCEAN
          meets the CALIFORNIA COASTLINE...
          A bird's-eye view of LOS ANGELES comes into relief-- a criss-
          cross of streets, freeways. The buildings not more than dots.
          Keep MOVING CLOSER as SOUND FADES IN.
          We notice MOVEMENT through the sprawl of city now: MASSES OF
          PEOPLE and CARS moving AWAY FROM THE OCEAN as we arrive at...

<b>          EXT. PICO BLVD. - GROUND-LEVEL - DAY
</b>
          The SOUND is at a frantic pitch here-- The sound of CHAOS on
          the streets. People SCREAMING, CAR HORNS BLARING as CARS
          jockey for position, moving eastward among...
          HORDES OF PEOPLE on foot, their PANICKED FACES rushing past.
          SUPER: LOS ANGELES-- CONTACT + 1 HOUR as we...

<b>          SUPER: MARINE CORPS BASE, CAMP PENDLETON. OCEANSIDE, CA.
</b>          Then SUPER: THE DAY BEFORE...
          We are CLOSE ON: SERGEANT MICHAEL NANTZ late 30s, tall,
          battle-hardened, staring forward, listening impatiently.

<b>          1ST SGT. ROY (O.S.)
</b>          Must be some kind of mistake...
          Company 1st SERGEANT JOHN ROY, also late 30s, sits behind his
          desk, holding Nantz' file. Smiles.

<b>          1ST SGT. ROY
</b>          I got paperwork here, with your
          signature, says you're retiring.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          No mistake, John.

<b>          1ST SGT. ROY
</b>          My ass. You got a box full a',
          medals, file full a' commendations.

          Nantzsmiles back now.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          I appreciate it, John. You know
          that. But, I been to too many
          funerals. Had to visit too many
          moms and dads, tell 'em about what
          happened to their sons...

</b>          You're gonna miss it.
          Nantz shakes.

<b>          THE GREEN WASH OF NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
</b>          Looking out onto ROLLING HILLS and TREES... We hear (O.S.) :

<b>          VOICE #1 (O.S.)
</b>          I don't see it...

<b>          VOICE #2 (O.S.)
</b>          I'm telling you, it's in the trees.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          3.

<b>                         FIVE MARINES
</b>          From the 1st Platoon, 2nd battalion, 5th Marines (the 2/5)..
           Camo uniforms, NIGHT VISION GOGGLES on, stare into the DARK.
          CPL. CORREGGIO, 20, linebacker-big, shakes his head,
          frustrated.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          Screw it. I'm gonna launch another
          one...
          The other marines back away quickly as...
          WIDEN to see we're...

<b>          EXT. OFFICER'S GOLF COURSE / CAMP PENDLETON - NIGHT
</b>
          Correggio, GOLF CLUB in hand, steps to a golf tee. WHACK.
          He tees off.
          The marines follow the ball as it sails into the darkness.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO -
</b>          That's more like it.
          PVT. LENIHAN, 18, baby-faced, looks impressed.

<b>           PVT. LENIHAN
</b>          Sweet.
          PVT. IMLAY, 19, a dense but good-natured country boy, moves
          to the tee.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Don't encourage him. Correggio's
          freakin' ego's big enough already.
          He takes the club from Correggio.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Let an expert show you how it's
          done, bro.
          Imlay TEES OFF, his swing plainly choppy, uncoordinated.

<b>          POV THROUGH IMLAY'S NIGHT VISION GOGGLES
</b>          As he WHACKS THE BALL, visible in the night vision's greenish
          glow. It HOOKS into a sand trap.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY (O.S.)
</b>          Mother fu...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          4.
</b>          Then he stops as a LIGHT flashes beyond the trees.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Foot mobiles. 3 O'clock.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          Told you they'd come!
          THREE GIRLS, 19-21, signal with a FLASHLIGHT. Then race down
          a small hill onto the golf course.

<b>          EXT. GOLF COURSE - LATER
</b>
          The THREE GIRLS sit around a beat-up TAHOE parked near the
          tee, CASE OF BEER on its back gate, sipping beers.
          Corpsman ADUKWU, 20, a tall, thin Nigerian, TEES OFF.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          That dog'll hunt! Damn, Daktari,
          you can play!

<b>                         ADUKWU
</b>
<b>                         (THICK ACCENT)
</b>          We have courses in Nigeria, Imlay.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Well, how would I know? I mean,
          it's an American game.

<b>          PVT. LENIHAN
</b>          Actually, Imlay, it's Scottish.
          PVT. KERNS, 19, an antsy fireplug of a guy, shakes his head.

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          Lenihan, you as good with an M-16
          as you are with your mouth?

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Kerns. Lay off him.

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          What? Just wanna make sure the
          rookie won't fold under fire.
          Correggio shoves a beer into Kerns' hand.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          Relax, dude.
          He throws an arm around Kerns' shoulder, smiles at the girls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          5.
</b>
<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          My buddy's jumpy 'cause he got an
          assfull a' shrapnel our last tour.

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          I'm jumpy? You're crawling up your
          own ass 'cause we train with Sgt.
          Nantz tomorrow.
          Correggio eyes Kerns. This was the wrong thing to say.
          One girl, smiling seductively, steps to Correggio, takes the
          golf club.from him.

<b>                         GIRL #1
</b>          If this is the officer's course,
          what happens if they catch you out
          here?
          She readies to take a shot. Correggio snuggles up behind
          her, ostensibly teaching her how to swing.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          We can handle it, baby. We're
          experts at night maneuvers.
          Nearby, the SECOND GIRL chats up Adukwu.

<b>                         GIRL #2
</b>          So you're from where again?
          Imlay pops a beer, interrupting.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Nigeria. Adukwu's our corpsman.
          Like a medic. Saved Kerns' ass.

<b>                         (TO ADUKWU)
</b>          Daktari, tell her about Nigeria.
          Adukwu starts to talk, but Imlay interrupts again:

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Adukwu's a green card marine...

</b>          Hey, barfy. Grab your beer.
          toast.
          Everyone holds beers aloft. Lenihan joins in reluctantly.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          To Lenihan. Who gets his first

          The marines chuckle knowingly, about to drink...
          Then they hear the sound of TIRES skidding to a halt. They
          look toward the hillside, see the WHITE HELMETS'of MPs.

</b>          We are marines. "Can't" is not the

          Lenihan checks and double checks a LIST with the contents of
          his pack, ticking off 'poncho liner,' 'gore-tex jacket,'
          'socks,' 'vest,' 'first aid kit,' flashlight'...

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          It's probably just a drill, right?

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          They shifted Nantz into our unit.
          Something must be going on.

<b>          PVT. LENIHAN
</b>          I heard Nantz kicked ass on his
          last tour. Went into a compound by
          himself, killed, like, ten
          insurgents...

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          That what you heard? You don't
          know shit, Lenihan.
          Correggio, pissed, grabs his pack, heads for the door.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          Move your asses. They want us in
          the armory.
          And he's gone. Lenihan, confused, looks at Imlay.

<b>          PVT. LENIHAN
</b>          What's his problem?

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Nantz lost a lotta guys on that
          tour. Correggio's brother was one
          of 'em.
          Lenihan nods, somber, getting it.

          aboard. Nantz hurries them along, grabbing packs, throwing
          them on after the marines.
          Then he grabs Correggio's pack, about to throw the pack on...
          Correggio grabs it back from Nantz.

          IN FLIGHT. The marines, helmets on, packs between their
          knees, sit facing each other.
          The sound of the CH-46's massive rotors is deafening. Some
          shout over the din, too nervous to remain quiet.

          seeing as the chopper BANKS toward Venice/Santa Monica:
          FIRES raging from various explosions. In the distance,
          MASSIVE LINES of TRAFFIC moving away from the ocean.
          The STREETS bordering the beach look deserted-- Except for
          the BODIES dotting the landscape.
          Nantz looks at Martinez, who is hunched over, scribbling a
          LETTER. Martinez folds it, then writes the name ANNA on it.
          We realize it's a letter in the event of his death.

          REVERSE to see what they're staring at:
          LINCOLN BOULEVARD. Being fortified into a defensive line.
          MARINES are setting up sand-bagged MACHINE GUN NESTS in a
          parking lot fronting a nail shop and a China Express.
          Other MARINES hunker behind barricades in front of a Goodyear
          Tire Store, firing MORTARS toward the ocean.
          RUBBLE. BURNING BUILDINGS. Smashed-in storefronts. Cars
          CRASHED at intersections, the echoing WAIL of CAR ALARMS.
          Pockets of CIVILIANS are being waved forward by MARINES. A
          LITTLE GIRL with a Smurf backpack is rushed across Lincoln.

          exploding in the distance.
          The ground SHAKES from massive AFTERSHOCKS. Billowing SMOKE
          rumbles from the west. Ash rains,down, the sky turns black.
          The squad hunkers down, panicked looks exchanged.

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          What the hell is that?!

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ
</b>          Keep it together. Watch your
          angles.
          The aftershocks fade. Ominous quiet again.
          The squad continues DOWN THE STREET.

<b>          CPL. HARRIS
</b>          Helluva way to get citizenship, eh,

<b>                         ADUKWU

<b>          25.
</b>          THICK SMOKE hangs in the air. The lack of visibility is
          clearly adding to the marines' fright.
          Numerous SHAPES become visible in the smoke.
          As the squad approaches slowly, the shapes become clear...
          BODIES splayed in the street.

<b>          CPL. HARRIS
</b>          Cherise and I were supposed to
          register at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond
          tonight...

<b>          CPL. STAVROU
</b>          Think you're gonna be busy, bro.
          Nantz points his rifle into a CRASHED PICKUP TRUCK. A BODY
          is slumped beneath the wheel.
          Simmons comes up behind Nantz. Peers into the truck:
          Sections of the BODY appear almost dissolved by a white
          phosphorous-like substance.

<b>          PVT. SIMMONS
</b>          What is that shit, Sergeant?

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          (caustic, dismissive)
          Something bad, private. Now get

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          Whoa, whoa... Contact! Twelve
          o'clock!
          A SHAPE is moving to them through the smoke.
          The marines aim, about to fire just as the smoke clears...
          A DOG. Standing there, staring mournfully at them.
          Nervous chuckles now. Correggio sidles up to Kerns.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          Relax, man.
          Kerns just shoots him a look. The squad moves on.
          As they approach a SIDE STREET that intersects 10th...
          The DOG WHINES. Correggio pets it, trying to comfort it...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          26.
</b>          But the dog suddenly RACES OFF, disappearing into the smoke.
          The marines spin, rifles up, growing unnerved...

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          What the hell...?

<b>          CPL. HARRIS
</b>          Something spooked that dog...
          Then Kerns sees the SMOKE SWIRLING DOWN THE SIDE STREET...
          As if something is racing through it.
          Kerns breaks formation, SPRINTS DOWN THE SIDE STREET, FIRING.

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          Contact! Contact!
          Discipline shatters as the squad follows Kerns...

<b>          DOWN THE SIDE STREET.
</b>
<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Marines! Hold your position!
          Kerns stops, spinning, looking. for targets, breath ragged,
          eyes panicked. Correggio races up.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          What'd you see?!
          Suddenly, the INDISTINCT FORM of an ALIEN CREATURE appears
          through the smoke, moving FAST down the side street.
          Kerns is ready, FIRING. The others react, FIRING as well.
          The ALIEN FORM is blasted, DROPPING into the smoke.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ
</b>          Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
          Everyone stops firing. Nantz gets in Kerns' face.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          One enemy runs and you break
          discipline and chase it?!

<b>          27.

          Nantz, unnerved himself, stares into the smoke...

</b>          What is it, sergeant?

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          That thing running down the

          Slowly, fading in, we hear what Nantz hears now...
          A RUMBLING SOUND BEHIND THEM. Building. Nantz spins to it.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          They're coming. We took the bait,
          now they're cutting us off.

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          I can't see a goddamn thing!
          But the SOUND of their ADVANCE tells us there's many.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Light it up!
          The squad lets loose with a barrage of FIRE as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          28.

          Glimpses of INDISTINCT FIGURES moving fast.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ
</b>          Mottola, get on the radio. See if
          we can get some air support.
          Mottola starts working the radio, trying to remain calm as.'..
          PROJECTILES EXPLODE in BRIGHT FLASHES around the marines.

<b>          PVT. SIMMONS

          Correggio, frustrated, peers through the smoke.

<b>          PVT. MOTTOLA
</b>          Lieutenant. Command says air power

          Martinez stares back at this ominous news as...
          The MARINES FIRE back into the THICK SMOKE. But the enemy
          attack keeps INCREASING in ferocity.
          One PROJECTILE hits a wall above Lenihan. It EXPLODES, some
          kind of liquid splashing onto him. Lenihan grimaces.

<b>          PVT. LENIHAN
</b>          Ahh, shit! It's burning!
          His HELMET is being eaten away by the liquid. Imlay is
          immediately at Lenihan's side, pulling the helmet off.
          Lenihan's skin is blistering, oozing.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Ugly as ever, bro.
          The squad hunkers down, trying to find any cover-available--
          behind cars, trees.
          Martinez drops BEHIND A CAR, pulls out his MAP, checking it
          for escape routes.-

          Martinez looks desperate, forced to FLEE FROM COVER by the

          The squad follows Martinez, retreating...

<b>          INTO A 'WALK' STREET.
</b>          JUST A SIDEWALK separates the houses opposite each other.
          A moment. SILENCE. Nantz looks at the heavy FOLIAGE, dense
          SHRUBS and TREES on both sides. He knows:

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          It's an ambush. This is the kill
          zone!
          Nantz slings his COMBAT SHOTGUN forward.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>
<b>          FIRE!
</b>          On Nantz' order, the SQUAD OPENS FIRE just as...
          ALIEN FIRE EXPLODES from the THICK COVER of bushes and trees.
          Nantz leads the brutal counterattack, PUMPING and FIRING his
          combat SHOTGUN.
          Martinez is shouting orders, directing the men as...

          Correggio steps in front of Kerns, firing to protect him.,
          Lenihan takes a hit from the enemy tracer fire explodingâ€ž
          around the marines. He's blown back into thick bushes as...
          THE REST OF THE SQUAD battles fiercely.
          An alien PROJECTILE slams into Cpl. Grayston'S ARM. The
          SPRAY OF LIQUID bubbles out from the wound.
          Then something grabs Grayston through the bushes...
          Nantz sticks his SHOTGUN into the bushes, fires. BOOM. And
          Grayston is suddenly free. Nantz drags him into...

<b>          THE FRONT YARD OF A HOUSE.
</b>          The squad follows, Correggio pulling Kerns into the yard.

<b>          THEY BACK TOWARD THE HOUSE.

          powerful SAWS (Squad Automatic Weapon), covering.the retreat.

          All this mayhem allows the squad to...

<b>          BARGE THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE.

</b>          Hell, now that just ain't fair.
          Nantz moves to Martinez, who is staring down at the wounded

          A SWIMMING POOL, its water gently lapping. A GARAGE nearby.
          Lenihan, startled by the SOUND of ALIENS RUNNING in the alley
          behind the house, takes cover BY THE GARAGE.
          He struggles to remain calm. Then the sound FADES. He
          waits. Silence. Lenihan starts to edge,out as...

          Lenihan CLICKS the radio OFF.
          Then waits, very still, listening, M-16 held tightly. His
          breathing turns shallow-- from loss of blood and from fear.
          Lenihan sees the BRANCHES of a bush SWAYING outside the
          window, as if something just brushed past it.

<b>          EXT. STREET - SAME

          Nantz, Mottola and Imlay moving through the thick smoke...
          Nantz still trying to raise Lenihan on the radio.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ

          Imlay taps Nantz on the shoulder, motions to his ears. He
          hears something...
          The marines freeze, Nantz clicking the radio off as...
          Nearby, they hear SOUNDS of aliens running... Somewhere...

          smoke. They remain stock still. Then...
          The sound fades into the distance.
          Nantz looks at the men. Motions. They creep forward as...

<b>          INT. GARAGE - SAME

          Lenihan moves TO THE WINDOW, searching the garage floor,
          desperate not to step on anything that would make noise. He
          edges forward to peer through the dirty glass. Then...
          THUD THUD THUD. More NOISES... On the garage roof now.
          Lenihan looks up, panicked as...
          CRASH! The WINDOW suddenly CRASHES IN.
          Lenihan spins, FIRING wildly, lighting up the garage as...
          He stumbles to the door, fumbling for the handle, falling...

<b>          EXT. BACK YARD OF HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          .OUT OF THE GARAGE. Lenihan staggers back, eyes darting
          along the garage roof, gun aimed.
          Nothing there.
          As Lenihan continues backing away, peering through the
          drifting smoke at the garage, he's unaware that BEHIND him...

<b>          A SHADOWY ALIEN FORM IS RISING FROM THE POOL.
</b>          Lenihan doesn't see it, but he senses it. He turns, FIRES...
          A SPLASH as the shadowy alien figure is blasted back INTO THE
          POOL, disappearing under the water.
          Quickly, nervously, he loads another mag, edging to the pool.
          He peers over the pool edge...
          An indiscernible DARK FORM lays on the bottom of the pool.
          Lenihan is transfixed a moment. Then he raises his rifle to
          punch more rounds into the thing as...
          WHOOOM! The creature launches OUT OF THE WATER!

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          36.

          The fusillade of bullets tears the creature up.
          The marines STOP FIRING as the alien falls to the ground.
          They stare amazed at the 7 ft. tall ALIEN CORPSE... Rigid
          skeleton bursting out of its skin, some strange layer of
          machinery intertwined with its flesh.

          An alien projectile slams INTO SIMMONS' THROAT. Choking, he
          CRUMPLES to the ground. Guerrero stands, blind, helpless.
          Panic. The marines spin, searching for targets.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ

          Nantz, Martinez and the rest of the squad hustle silently
          through the street, supporting their wounded. They take
          cover behind cars, peering out to see...
          The PARK in the distance. A wide open FIELD with a COMMUNITY
          CENTER BUILDING on the far side.
          There are distant sounds of warfare, but the area here seems

          Imlay and Stavrou get Simmons and Grayston on.
          Mottola helps Guerrero in, squeezing his hand.

          Nantz turns ominously as an unearthly BUZZING SOUND FADES IN.
          LIGHTS are ADVANCING from a street leading to the field.
          As the SOUND and LIGHTS BUILD, Nantz runs to the other
          marines to get them off that field.
          He pulls on them, urging them to the COMMUNITY CENTER doors.
          They REACH THE COMMUNITY CENTER, fall into it just as...
          Glowing through the heavy cover of smoke... The STROBING
          LIGHTS of some strange ALIEN AIRCRAFT zooming overhead.

          Nantz turns, can see the MEDEVAC ABLAZE out a window. His
          solemn stare hints at a growing desperation.
          Martinez steps up to him, looks out. Quietly:

          the dust and dirt from the kids' faces.
          The younger girl, KIRSTEN, 8, begins crying. She suddenly

</b>          Adukwu, bring your kit.
          Adukwu is immediately up, moving to Nantz.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          We're gonna cut one of these things
          open. See if we can figure out
          what makes 'em tick.
          Michele overhears, offering:

          All on edge, exhausted, dirty. No one says a word.
          Correggio eyes the other marines. They exchange an 'all-

          Correggio and Kerns look over the destroyed streets, smoke

          ALIEN BODY on the floor.
          Michele stops, stares. She and Adukwu are both taken aback
          at the sight of one of these things up close.

          attached to its arm.

<b>                         ADUKWU
</b>          Part of its arm has been amputated

</b>          Talk about commitment to cause.
          Adukwu examines a VENTED CAP just to the right of where the
          alien's 'heart' would be. Thick, fleshy veins run from it.

</b>          Thank you, private.
          Adukwu twists the cap. It comes free, revealing...
          A GELATINOUS ORGAN. Slimy, viscous fluid seeping from it..
          Everyone steps back, reacting to the putrid smell.

          Harris covers, staring off to the FAR STREET. Tree branches
          there cast LONG SHADOWS which sway with the breeze. Then...
          The indistinct FORM of an ALIEN scout appears in the shadows.

          TWITCHING, spreading through the alien's body like a seizure.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ

          Nantz pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE, thrusting it DEEP INTO

          so eager to decide the fate of all
          these people?
          Imlay is stone silent.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Didn't think so.
          Then Nantz looks up, meeting eyes with Martinez as...
          A NOISE in the distance now. A low VIBRATION, building.
          Nantz moves to Martinez. They peer out of the front.
          LIGHTS fill the sky, heading east. As they approach...
          The VIBRATION gets louder and louder, shaking the bus now.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Everybody get down, weapons inside
          the bus. Make no noise.
          The men pull their guns in from the windows, crouching as low
          as possible, straining to see, hear...
          The vibrations grow louder, LOUDER! Suddenly... WHOOSH!
          An ALIEN AIRCRAFT rips overhead.
          Then another, and another, and another... All heading east.
          The image of their speed, their power, their other-
          worldliness is overwhelming, devastating.
          Nantz stares, relief flooding his face, as the armada flies
          on. Leaving them behind. Until...
          Suddenly, Mottola's RADIO BLARES!

<b>                         COMMAND

          As the transmission rings out, Nantz looks up to see...
          One ALIEN SHIP split from the armada, TURN BACK TO THE BUS.

          The children scream, marines agitated... all hear a low
          vibration, echoing off buildings, heading their way.

          Mottola turns off the radio.
          The alien aircraft STOPS. Hovers a moment.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          They're tracking our signals! All
          radios, cell phones-- keep
          everything off!
          Everyone stares silently, tensely. Then...
          A single BEAM OF LIGHT suddenly shines from the alien craft.
          Then the alien aircraft MOVES FORWARD again. Slowly. But
          still heading their way.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ
</b>          It's still coming... It's
          searching...
          Nantz grabs a PORTABLE RADIO.
          He looks around the bus, sees the little girl, Kirsten,
          ponytail in her hair. He leans down to her.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Hi. Could I have your, uh, hair
          thing?
          She stares, wide-eyed, at this fearsome, sweating marine.

<b>                         KIRSTEN
</b>          My... pony holder?
          Nantz nods. She pulls the PONY TAIL HOLDER from her hair,
          hands it to Nantz. He smiles. Briefly. Heads to the front.

          Nantz runs down the street with the radio under his arm.
          Heading toward a GAS STATION.
          Nantz glances back, sees... The ALIEN AIRCRAFT SEARCHING the
          street below, getting closer and closer to the bus as...

<b>          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS

          Amy and Kirsten pressed under seats, Michele covering them

          The marines duck low, gripping their weapons.
          They hear the aircraft coming closer, almost above them.
          LIGHT starts shining through the windows as...

          Nantz, almost to the gas station, wraps the pony tail holder

          The ALIEN AIRCRAFT STOP, HOVERING OVER THE BUS!
          Shining lights into it, scanning, scanning...

<b>          INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

          Hector's eyes widen, staring up at the light. Michele pulls
          the girls in closer, trying to calm them, herself.

          Everyone freezes as the BEAM reflects off the walls, filling
          the space with a horrible bright light, exposing them as...

          Nantz presses the "Push to Talk" button on the radio as...
          The alien craft suddenly TURNS in NANTZ' DIRECTION.
          Nantz wraps the pony tail holder around the radio, keeping
          the button on it depressed so it's SENDING A CONSTANT SIGNAL.
          He slides the radio toward one of the GAS PUMPS...
          Keeps moving, diving BEHIND A VAN across the street.
          Nantz peers around it, sees...
          The alien aircraft HEADING FOR THE GAS STATION, descending.
          Nantz slams a grenade into the launcher on his M-16.
          The alien aircraft zooms at the gas pumps, its unearthly hum
          growing louder and louder as...

          The ALIEN AIRCRAFT, trailing smoke and flames, thunders out

          Then CRASHES into a building... BLOWING APART!

<b>          INT. BUS (STOPPED) - CONTINUOUS

          Marines ducking, civilians screaming as...
          DEBRIS from the alien ship BLOWS OVER THE BUS, burning pieces
          falling to the ground...

<b>          EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Nantz runs out from behind the van, checks the remains of the
          burning alien aircraft, rifle raised.
          NO ALIEN inside. The ship is a DRONE.
          Nantz takes this in, then starts back for the bus.

          Nantz runs back onto the bus as Stavrou pulls swiftly away.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>
<b>                         (TO MARTINEZ)
</b>          That ship was an unmanned drone,

          open had something in it receiving
          signals... They must have one
          helluva command and control center.
          Martinez pulls his map out, eyes Nantz.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ
</b>          That was some real John Wayne shit,
          Sergeant.
          Nantz tries to shrug it away. But Martinez nails him.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ
</b>          Don't do it again. We work as a

          Beat. Nantz nods.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          We're clear, Lieutenant.
          Nearby, Imlay whispers to Mottola:

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Who's John Wayne?
          Martinez looks up from the map, turns to Stavrou.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ
</b>          Take the freeway, Corporal. Cuts
          half the distance off our drive.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Sir. We get on that freeway, we'll

<b>          EXT. STREET BY FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER

          The bus bangs past a few stalled cars, cruising up a ramp,
          onto the freeway.

<b>          INT. BUS (MOVING) - 10 FREEWAY - SAME
</b>
          Martinez and Nantz crouch near the front, keeping watch.
          From this elevated vantage point on the freeway, the big
          picture emerges IN THE DISTANCE:
          The BATTLE FRONT is moving east... A DEFENSIVE LINE of TANKS
          is visible, blasting away at aliens.
          SWARMS of DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18 JETS flying at them.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ
</b>          Jesus...

<b>                         (TO STAVROU)

          The bus barrels forward, careening BETWEEN CARS, knocking
          some out of the way.

<b>          LT. MARTINEZ
</b>          Take the next exit. Head south.
          We're two clicks from the FOB.
          The bus drives onto the shoulder, past the sea of abandoned
          cars, heading to the off-ramp.
          Nantz appears uneasy. They are exposed on this freeway and
          he doesn't like it.
          He MOVES TO THE BACK, peering out windows, checking angles.
          Michele looks up as he passes, sees a GASH on Nantz' head.

<b>                         MICHELE
</b>          Your head, Sergeant. You're
          bleeding.
          Nantz touches his head, looks at the blood. He wipes it on
          his pants. Michele smiles at him softly.

<b>                         MICHELE
</b>          Bet when you woke up this morning,

          Stavrou guns the BUS BACKWARDS, knocking abandoned cars out
          of the way...

</b>          Guess you were right, Sergeant.

          TWO 2nd SQUAD MARINES are instantly killed, blown clear out
          of the hole. Civilians screaming...
          Stavrou hits the gas, BACKING THE BUS UP the best he can.
          An ILLUMINATION heading toward them... BOOM!
          Another projectile DESTROYS AN OVERPASS behind the bus!
          Trapped. And ALIENS are STREAMING AT THEM in the distance.
          Stavrou works the shift, grinding gears, gunning the bus...
          BEHIND A CONCRETE DIVIDER close by the COLLAPSED OFF-RAMP.
          The off-ramp now dangles precariously: a 15-foot cliff-face
          of missile-scarred concrete and re-bar.
          Martinez looks over to Nantz, not sure what to do...

<b>          SGT. NANTZ

</b>          Stavrou, get down that ramp, secure

          Imlay joins Harris, SMASHING THE SKYLIGHT out of the bus
          roof, CLIMBING OUT, taking position on the bus' roof.
          The rest of the marines EXIT THE BUS. Nantz grabs Adukwu.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ

</b>          Rincon starts to PULL Mottola TOWARD THE OFF-RAMP...
          Struggling to get him to safety.
          Mottola's body starts to convulse. Rincon stops, tries to
          control him. Sees Mottola's eyes rolling back in his head.
          Then Rincon is horrified when he looks up to see...
          ALIENS RACING FORWARD... Heading his way!
          Moving in and out of the sea of abandoned cars.
          Rincon redoubles his efforts, pulling on the injured Mottola.
          As he does, he looks back up to see...
          The ALIENS ARE ALMOST ON TOP OF HIM now as...
          BANG! The first alien is shot by...
          Nantz, suddenly there, M-16 poised.
          Rincon looks from Nantz to... MORE ALIENS coming at them!
          No choice-- Rincon PICKS UP the injured Mottola's RIFLE.
          Scared, but resolute. He looks at Nantz.

</b>          It's set to fire in three round
          bursts. We're low, so don't waste

          Rincon holds the M-16 against his shoulder, aiming.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          And give 'em hell.
          Rincon sights down the barrel of his rifle at ONE ALIEN in
          the distance. He squeezes the trigger...

          ADUKWU. It is about to FIRE as...
          BAM! BAM! BAM! Rincon FIRES, blowing the alien away.
          Adukwu looks up, realizing Rincon just saved him.
          He,meets eyes with Rincon, who stares back, stunned a moment
          by his own actions. Adukwu immediately shouts a. warning.:

<b>          PVT. ADUKWU
</b>          Keep fighting!
          Rincon snaps back, turns to fire... A moment too late as...
          THUMP! Rincon is HIT. He falls.
          Adukwu grabs Rincon, sees the pain and fear in the civilian's
          eyes. Adukwu rips open packages of QuickClot, begins
          spreading the fast-clotting powder on Rincon's wounds as...,

          yards closer to the enemy.
          Nantz and Kerns arrive at a large SUV.
          Kerns ducks low, covering Nantz. Nantz crouches, opens the
          gas tank...
          Unscrews the fuse from the smoke grenade body, tossing the
          canister aside... pulls the pin... flips the 'spoon' off...

          Correggio and a 2nd squad marine.
          Along with Harris and Imlay on the bus roof, they are the
          only ones left holding the aliens off. All FIRE forward as...
          More and more aliens begin pouring through, braving the
          flames... Into the line of fire...
          Many aliens go down. But because of their sheer numbers,
          few start to make it through, FIRING BACK at the marines.
          Martinez sees the 2nd SQUAD MARINE go down in front of him.
          Martinez rushes to his side... HE'S DEAD.
          Martinez rises to shoot and...THWUMMP. Martinez is hit.
          He looks down, blood running over his belt. Shock on his
          face. He's been shot in the stomach.
          Martinez looks around...
          The remaining aliens now only cars apart from them.
          Two forces taking cover behind spraying glass and punctured
          metal, firing directly into the faces of their enemy.
          Martinez pulls himself together, struggling over to Nantz.

          He pushes Nantz away, looks around, the chaos slowing down
          for him. He reaches into his vest...
          Martinez hands the LETTER we saw earlier to Nantz. A moment
          between them.
          Nantz nods, then spins, moving, yelling to the men.

          cover as the men head down.
          Harris and Imlay slide down off the roof of the bus, joining
          the others running to the off-ramp. Correggio sees...
          MARTINEZ STAYING BEHIND, shooting at the aliens, drawing

          Adukwu enter with Rincon, setting him down.
          Nantz pulls blankets from a nearby rack, covering Rincon. As
          he does, we see a glimpse of Rincon's BLOOD-SOAKED CLOTHING.
          He is very pale. Blood flecks his lips.
          Hector stares into his father's face, eyes filling. Rincon

          Stavrou watches him go as...

<b>          ACROSS THE BIG 5 FLOOR
</b>          HECTOR steps back to his dad's side. Rincon's eyes open
          slowly. He looks at Hector. Manages a small smile. Reaches
          out, wipes a tear from his son's face.

<b>                         RINCON
</b>          I'm very proud of you, son. You're
          being so brave...
          Hector throws his arms around his father, hugging him
          tightly.

<b>                         RINCON
</b>          I love you, Hector.
          Mr. Rincon smiles. His face peaceful. Hector is silent,
          tears rolling down his face.

          The marines back away from the windows into the center of the
          store, hunkering down with the civilians. Everyone stares at
          the CLOCK on the wall as it ticks...

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          That much ordinance? They'd feel

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Maybe it's good... Maybe we turned

</b>          Sergeant... Mr. Rincon is dead.
          Nantz turns, staring off at Hector, sitting by his father.
          It's all too much...

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Jesus...
          Nantz takes a deep breath, his mind racing, the world closing
          in on him. He turns to Michele.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Listen, our Forward Operating Base

          Michele nods. Watches as Nantz slowly walks to Hector.
          Nantz kneels by the boy.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          I'm sorry Hector. Your dad...

          Hector, sobbing, overwhelmed by grief and fear, looks up at
          Nantz.

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>          I don't wanna be here. I want my

</b>          Stavrou, eyes on the still street, sees...
          TWO ALIEN SCOUTS appear. They crouch by a car.

<b>          CPL. STAVROU
</b>          Sergeant, we got hostiles in front.
          All the marines stiffen, the clatter of rifles being raised.
          But Nantz, tearing up himself, just stays focused on Hector.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Me too, Hector. I wish it could go

</b>          Out of time, sergeant.

<b>                         NANTZ

          Nantz lifts Hector. We see Hector's face, stricken, staring
          back at his father as he's carried off.
          The other marines gather up Michele and the girls...
          And everyone is moving silently THROUGH THE STORE as...

<b>          AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE
</b>          CRASH! The plate glass window is SHATTERED as...
          An ALIEN smashes through it.
          The alien is very still, peering around. Then it begins to
          creep forward as...
          A SECOND ALIEN, then a third, a FOURTH follows, leaping into
          the store with sinewy power.

<b>          AT THE REAR OF THE STORE
</b>          Nantz peers out a BACK DOOR. It's clear. They MOVE OUT just
          as...
          MORE ALIENS leap in. They move in formation THROUGH THE
          STORE as...
          THE BACK DOOR silently shuts.

<b>          QUICK CUT TO:

          As Nantz and the others slip out of the back...

</b>          Yes, Sergeant.
          As the others RACE AWAY down the alley...
          Stavrou takes his rifle butt, SMASHES the WINDOW of a nearby
          CAR. Reaches in... Jams the car's gear into.neutral.
          As the massive Stavrou pushes the car AGAINST THE STORE'S

</b>          Harris pulls his KA-BAR FIGHTING KNIFE.
          Harris.slides UNDER THE CAR... Punctures the GAS TANK.
          As Harris rolls away from the FLOW OF GASOLINE...
          Stavrou LIGHTS it. Both men RUN DOWN THE ALLEY.

<b>          CPL. STAVROU
</b>          Don't think they'll be comin' out

          As... BOOM! The car, blocking the door, goes up in FLAMES.

<b>          DOWN THE ALLEY
</b>          Stavrou and Harris FALL BEHIND A BUILDING with the others.
          NANTZ, still holding Hector, looks off to a SIDE STREET..He
          signals to Kerns and Correggio.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Check it out.
          The two marines run down the alley to the SIDE STREET.
          Nantz sets Hector down. Looks the boy in the face.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          This is the hardest thing you'll
          ever have to do...
          Michele, arms around Kirsten and Amy, watches Nantz.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          8.1.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          But we'll get through it together.
          I promise, Hector.
          Hector nods, still crying. Nantz exchanges a glance with
          Michele, who moves to Hector, comforting him.
          Nantz steps away as Kerns and Correggio run up, reporting:

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          Looks good, both directions.
          Out of earshot of the civilians, Nantz spins to his men with
          fiery intensity.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          We are not losing one more of these
          civilians. Period. Am I making
          myself clear?

<b>                         (BEAT)
</b>          Let's move.
          The group jogs silently DOWN THE ALLEY.

<b>          EXT. STREET - LATER
</b>
          Nantz leads the group down the residential street, tidy
          bungalows on either side.

<b>          CPL. STAVROU
</b>          You okay, bro?

<b>          CPL. HARRIS
</b>          I hadn't a pushed Cherise to get
          married, she'd still be in Chicago.
          Suddenly, Nantz stops, fist raised. The squad halts as...
          A SOUND fades in, a deep RUMBLING.
          The marines FALL BEHIND CARS now, pulling the civilians down
          with them as the RUMBLING continues to BUILD.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Under the cars! Now!
          The marines frantically shed their packs, squirming UNDER THE
          CARS with the civilians, pulling the kids under as...

<b>          A GIANT HOST OF ALIENS
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          82.
</b>          Rounds the corner in the distance, THOUSANDS'OF THEM, filling
          the street from sidewalk to sidewalk. An army on the move.
          NANTZ DRAGS HECTOR UNDER ONE CAR with him,' pulls the boy in
          close, gets his legs under the car, under cover, just as...
          The mass of aliens SWARM PAST, the ground shaking, RUMBLING.
          The humans HUDDLE UNDER THE CARS, peering out to see the legs
          and arms of the aliens flying by. Some bound OVER THE CARS,
          which bounce up and down, BANGING with the aliens' weight.
          The RUMBLING EBBS as the aliens disappear into the distance.

<b>          EXT. STREET - LATER
</b>
          The squad moves in formation, surrounding the civilians.
          Little Kirsten comes up behind Correggio. He's surprised as
          she slips her hand into his. Correggio looks down, seeing
          how scared she is. He smiles, grips her hand tightly.
          Up ahead, Nantz leads, MAP in hand.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          How far, sergeant?

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          One block over.
          Imlay smiles at Kerns.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          We'.re gonna make it! Dude, we're
          gonna make it...
          But as they approach a CORNER... Nantz stops, exchanges a
          glance with his corporals.

<b>                         MICHELE
</b>          What's the matter?

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          The smell.
          An ominous beat. The squad moves down the dark street as...
          ASH FLOATS DOWN here from the sky... Like a beautiful early
          winter snow...

<b>          THEN THEY TURN THE CORNER
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          83.
</b>          We slowly MOVE IN TIGHTER and TIGHTER on Nantz.
          Until we are CLOSE ON NANTZ' FACE.
          A REDDISH GLOW is reflected there. Nantz stops, looking
          horrified. We REVERSE to see...
          A DEEP BLACK COLUMN OF SMOKE rising into the night sky from
          NUMEROUS FIRES that rage within the fence line of...

<b>          SANTA MONICA AIRPORT.
</b>          As they approach the Forward Operating Base, the devastation
          is slowly revealed:
          CRASHED F-18 JETS and COBRA HELICOPTERS line the runways.
          BODIES and SMOLDERING MARINE VEHICLES litter the airfield.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Jesus... They wiped our Forward
          Operating Base right off the map.

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          Now we know why those bombs never
          dropped. They took our jets out.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          This was a dug-in marine Corps

          Michele MEETS EYES WITH NANTZ. His look tells us everything--

<b>          THEY'RE LOSING THIS WAR.
</b>          Nantz turns, spies an AIRPORT FIRE STATION by the runways.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Let's get under cover. Now.

<b>          INT. DESERTED FIRE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

          The marines enter cautiously, rifles up. Then they hustle
          the civilians inside when it appears safe.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Lock this place down.
          The marines fan out, securing doors, checking windows as...
          Nantz kneels by Hector, tries to comfort him.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          He saved Pvt. Adukwu up on that
          freeway.
          Hector exchanges a glance with Adukwu. Something passes
          between them... One man died so another could live...

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          You save a marine under fire, you
          get a medal, y'know.
          Nantz pulls out a MEDALLION, the CREST of the 2/5 on it.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          This is our medallion. It's yours.
          For your dad.

</b>          You're 2/5 now, Hector.
          Hector takes the heavy medallion, looks it over, pointing to
          the 2/5 MOTTO on it:

<b>                         HECTOR
</b>          What's that mean, "retreat hell?"

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          During World War I, an officer from

          Nantz is happy to see a slow smile from Hector now.
          Harris calls out:

<b>          CPL. HARRIS

          Black plumes of SMOKE fill the night sky as Nantz and his men
          head silently toward the bodies of dead marines and aliens.
          The tarmac is a smoldering WASTELAND: Empty, bombed-out
          buildings on its outskirts, burning aircraft and vehicles
          litter the runways. Fires crackle.
          As they go, the marines rifle the pockets and pouches of
          their fallen comrades, pulling out any available ammo.
          IMLAY whispers a low, heartfelt refrain to the dead marines
          he searches.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Sorry, bro.
          He moves on to another fallen marine, searching.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Sorry, bro.
          Across the runway, Nantz pulls ammo from the pouch of a dead
          marine. Then looking up, he sees...

<b>          A LAV-25 ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER. INTACT.
</b>          Nantz moves to it. Then turns. A LOW WHISTLE from him and
          the marines look up. They hustle to Nantz. Everyone gives
          the LAV an excited once-over.

          That's an asset.
          Imlay grins. Nantz motions to him, starting off.

          Kerns has a tub of ice cream, scooping bowls for the kids.

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          My dad's a fireman. They love
          their ice cream. Used to visit the
          firehouse with my little brother,
          they always had tons of it...
          (re. the kids)
          My brother's not much older than

<b>                         MICHELE
</b>          You don't look much older, either.
          She gazes at the kids, pain and anger washing over her.

          Nantz enters with Imlay. They look around...
          The WINDOWS have been BLOWN OPEN. The wind rustles papers
          through the ghostly space, blowing them out into the night.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          88.

          From this, high vantage point, they can see for miles...
          Nantz looks out one end of the control tower, sees all the
          way to the ocean...
          Then he turns, looks the other way, dead east...
          A vista of EXPLOSIONS, spreading-into the distance. ALIEN
          DRONE AIRCRAFT engage F-18s. One jet is blown up, spiralling
          to the ground.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Look how far east they've gotten.
          That's almost the whole city...
          Nantz looks out through BINOCULARS:
          Sees the HOLLYWOOD SIGN ablaze in the hills...
          Then pans to a mid-city area. Stops when he sees one
          quadrant of the city, blocks wide, SHIMMERING an INKY BLACK.
          Some kind of DARK ENERGY WAVE emanating from the ground.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          What the hell's that?
          Imlay peers out.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          There's zero activity there.
          And the area does seem completely devoid of activity-- No
          alien or human aircraft above it. Like a DEAD ZONE.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          What are we gonna do, Sergeant?
          Nantz, panning with the binoculars, sees a CHOPPER TAKING OFF
          in the distance now.
          Nantz grabs a MAP on the desk, eyes roaming over it. Then
          looks back to where he saw the chopper.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          That must be the alternate
          extraction site. Maybe we can
          evacuate the civilians there...
          He turns to Imlay.

</b>          We're gonna give it one helluva

</b>          Nantz standing alone with a RADIO PACK looking out into the
          black night, wind blowing through the tower.
          The LAV WAITS ON THE TARMAC below, engine running.
          Nantz takes a deep breath. Presses the button on the RADIO.

          He turns to Stavrou behind the wheel.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Use the thermal sight. No lights.
          Stavrou drives, spins away as Nantz climbs...

<b>          INTO THE TURRET
</b>          He mans the M-240 MACHINE GUN. Imlay beside him on the 25MM

          An ALIEN DRONE winging toward the airport as...

<b>          EXT. STREET, NEAR SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT
</b>
          The LAV moves fast in total darkness down a car-strewn
          street. Santa Monica Airport fading behind them, suddenly...
          BOOOOOOM-! Bright burst of light!
          And the Control Tower explodes in a ball of fire.

<b>          INT. LAV - CONTINUOUS

          Nantz watches the alien drone fly off into the night.

          Miles away, the LAV drives through a CITY STREET, surrounded
          by TALL BUILDINGS, the area a desolate wasteland now.

          Stavrou drives, hands gripping the wheel as he maneuvers
          carefully through wrecked abandoned cars.

</b>          Extract site's only a couple more

          Imlay nods back. Nantz peers down to...

<b>          STAVROU, BEHIND THE WHEEL...
</b>          Eyes focusing tensely through the thermal sight scope.

<b>          THERMAL SIGHT POV

          Stavrou SLAMS THE BRAKES. Civilians and marines in the tight
          passenger compartment are thrown around.
          Right in front of the LAV...
          A massive CRATER. The street's impassable.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ

          Then they TURN A CORNER... And a VIEW BETWEEN TWO TALL
          BUILDINGS is harrowing...
          FOUR ALIEN DRONE AIRCRAFT hovering... Then turning. Flying
          toward them.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ

          Imlay OPENS UP on the 25MM BUSHMASTER CHAIN GUN.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Come on, you martian bastards!
          The Bushmaster is a rapid-firing CANNON spewing 200 rounds a
          minute, each capable of destroying a light tank.
          For once, the aliens are overmatched. The ALIEN SHIPS take
          HEAVY FIRE from the Bushmaster...
          One goes down IN FLAMES, the others PEEL OFF, flying behind
          buildings.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Where'd they go? Where'd they go?
          Nantz is scanning the sky, then...

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Imlay, on your six!
          Imlay spins in the turret, picking up...
          The three remaining ALIEN AIRCRAFT coming back around.
          The lead alien ship FIRES!
          A ,CAR EXPLODES next to the LAV. Imlay rocks in the turret.

          The lead alien ship is HIT, winging out of control INTO A

          The FINAL ALIEN AIRCRAFT dodges the FIREBALL, flying straight
          at the LAV...

<b>          SGT. NANTZ

<b>          PVT. IMLAY

<b>          93.
</b>          It PINWHEELS TO THE GROUND, exploding into FLAMING WRECKAGE
          which hurtles RIGHT AT THE LAV.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Stand on it, Stavrou!
          Stavrou pushes it, TRYING TO OUTRUN the burning wreckage...
          Which is almost on top of the LAV as...
          Stavrou spins AROUND A CORNER, escaping.
          The wreckage explodes into a building behind them as...
          THUMP - THUMP - THUMP! The sound of a UH-1'Medevac ECHOES.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          The chopper!
          Nantz looks out, sees the CHOPPER LANDING in the street.
          The LAV screeches up amid the RUBBLE and SMOKE.

<b>          INT. EVAC HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          The CHOPPER BEGINS TO LIFT OFF. As it rises, Nantz gazes out
          at the CITYSCAPE. He sees fires, wreckage everywhere. Then
          he looks off to see...

<b>          THE BLACK DEAD ZONE SHIMMERING NEARBY
</b>          Nantz watches the HELICOPTER BANK TOWARD THE BLACK ZONE. But
          as it gets closer...
          The HELICOPTER DIPS precipitously, suddenly losing altitude.
          The kids SCREAM. The marines hang on.
          Nantz sees the PILOT STRUGGLING with the controls. The
          HELICOPTER'S GAUGES are going crazy.
          The pilot BANKS HARD AWAY from the area, reversing course.
          And the helicopter STABILIZES.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          What the hell happened?!

<b>                         CREW CHIEF

          with our power!
          Nantz stares at this. Then notices Hector watching. him.
          He sees the 2/5 MEDALLION clutched tightly in Hector's hand.
          Sees the words "Retreat Hell."
          Nantz looks back at the MYSTERIOUS BLACK PATCH of cityscape.
          Then he turns to the crew chief.

          Nantz looks out. Spies a BUILDING with a FLAT OPEN ROOF. He
          points to it.

          Let's go, marines.
          The marines look frightened, confused. They start to pull
          themselves up. ROPES are dropped from the chopper as it
          hovers over the building...

<b>          SGT. NANTZ

          As the chopper hovers, Nantz drops to the roof, hunkers down
          with the other marines. Nantz watches the evac helicopter
          fly off to safety.
          Then he turns to the marines, who stare back hopelessly,
          clearly at their lowest point.

<b>          PVT. KERNS
</b>          Why'd we get off the chopper,
          Sergeant?

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          'Cause we have a job to do.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          But we were getting out...!

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          You have some hunch and now we're
          stuck out here in the shit?!

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          That's right. This fight's not
          over.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          Sergeant's gonna get us killed!
          Just like my brother.
          A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It's laid open now.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Believe me, Correggio, I grieved
          for every marine I ever lost...
          Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          But we are in the fight of our
          lives right now. And our duty is
          to keep moving forward. Keep
          fighting. That's how we honor men
          like your brother, Correggio. And
          Lt. Martinez. And Hector's father,
          who saved Adukwu's life. He wasn't
          trained for that. He just picked
          up a rifle and did what needed to
          be done. If a civilian can do
          that...

          Well then I better square my shit
          away and do whatever I have to do
          to defeat this enemy. But I can't
          do it alone.
          Nantz stares. The tension is palpable.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          I need you men. And maybe we'll
          die fighting today. Not because
          we're heroes. But because we're
          goddamn United States marines, and
          always will be.

<b>          CPL. STAVROU
</b>          Sergeant. We'll follow you to hell

          Nantz smiles, nods.

          Stavrou fires it up, drives off as... Nantz eyes the jumble
          of gear. He grabs his COMBAT SHOTGUN, a portable RADIO,
          which he makes sure is OFF...
          Then an olive case marked: GLTD. He stuffs it in his pack.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Laser target, sir?

          ALIEN SOLDIERS appearing on the street now.
          Nantz goes back to stuffing his pack.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got

          Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see...
          The aliens attacking, FIRING on the LAV as...
          Stavrou floors it, ALIEN FIRE pinging off the LAV's armor
          as... SPLAT!!!

<b>          STAVROU MOWS THROUGH THE ENEMY LINE.

          The LAV cruises slowly. Nantz stares forward.
          The BLACK DEAD ZONE looms ahead... As they get closer, it
          seems like the whole area is absent of light. A black hole.
          Nantz stares out, about to answer when the LAV LURCHES, then
          lurches again. Stavrou REVS the engine.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          What's going on?

<b>          CPL. STAVROU
</b>          Losing power, Sergeant. Gauges are
          dropping... losing voltage...
          The LAV slows. The engine skips. Then the LAV DIES.

          Nantz looks around, warily. The streets are quiet, deserted.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          All right, dismount. Grab anything

          The men nod, and move OUT OF THE LAV to...

</b>
          Correggio and Kerns on one side of the street, Stavrou and
          Harris on the other. Imlay with Adukwu. Nantz watches his
          men move forward, covering each other's advance. Scanning'
          the buildings, searching for targets...
          Then Nantz halts them. They crouch together, peering at...
          The middle of the DEAD ZONE just ahead of them. It is very
          dark. No lights are visible from any source. The men SWEAT.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Hot as hell here.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          No lights.

</b>          Something's generating heat.
          Messing with our electronics.
          Sucking up all the power...
          Nantz scans the street. The sweat dripping into his eyes.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Where would you put a critical

          Nantz points to A SUBWAY ENTRANCE AHEAD.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Harris, Adukwu, stay here, watch
          the street.
          Harris and Adukwu nod. Taking position at the entrance.
          Nantz motions to the others.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Let's go.
          Nantz leads Stavrou, Correggio, Kerns and Imlay down the
          stopped escalator to the SUBWAY PLATFORM.
          Nantz stands, gazing around at the empty subway platform.
          Silent. Spooky. A train is stopped. Doors open. It is
          dark, the only light bleeding in from the street above.
          He motions Stavrou to guard against anything coming from
          above. Then he moves forward with the others.
          A huge number of BIRDS line the dark cavity above the train
          tracks, taking cover themselves, roosting quietly.
          Nantz sees a DOOR in the tunnel wall, heads to it.
          He pulls his KA-BAR KNIFE out, sticks the blade into the door
          jam, pops the DOOR OPEN. Nantz turns to Correggio and Kerns.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ

          Nantz and Imlay slip through the doorway.

<b>          INT. UNDERGROUND SERVICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Nantz and Imlay stand very still, peering down the long, dark
          hall, looking for movement. Nantz motions and they move
          forward silently, guns ready.
          They turn a corner and stop. It is PITCH BLACK here.
          Nantz clicks on his flashlight. They move forward. After
          only a few feet, the FLASHLIGHT DIMS AND DIES.
          Imlay clicks on his flashlight.

          anything electronic we use.
          Imlay clicks his flashlight OFF. But now we see...
          A dim light ahead. Nantz and Imlay creep forward, very
          slowly. Turn a corner, see...
          A STRANGE LIGHT at the end of the hallway. THE LIGHT GLOWS
          fiercely, as if it's shining through the floor.
          Nantz, silhouetted by the light, signals Imlay to stay put.
          Nantz steps forward, toward the strange glow of light. As he
          approaches, he realizes it's coming through...
          An IRON GRATE in the floor.
          Nantz moves to the grate, kneels, PEERING DOWN INTO...

<b>          A MASSIVE SUBWAY TUNNEL
</b>          Fifty feet wide, the dim tunnel has been further EXCAVATED.
          It is a huge CAVERN now, extending off into the distance
          further than Nantz can see.
          The huge space is illuminated by MASSES OF ALIEN MACHINERY.
          An ELECTRIC HUM FILLS THE AIR.
          Tending the machinery: DOZENS OF ALIENS, bigger than the
          others.
          One of the ALIENS TURNS, focusing up, right at Nantz.
          Nantz spins, runs back into the darkness. Calling to Imlay:

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Run, Imlay! Run!
          BANG. The iron GRATE FLIES into the air.

<b>          INT. DIFFERENT PART OF UNDERGROUND SERVICE TUNNEL
</b>
          Nantz and Imlay, race along in the dark. They hear POUNDING
          FOOTSTEPS of the alien pursuing him.
          A glimmer of LIGHT ahead. Along the floor. It is, a DOOR.
          They burst through a DOOR, into...

<b>          A DIM STAIRWELL.
</b>
                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          102.
</b>          Nantz follows Imlay UP THE STAIRS as...
          The STAIRWELL DOOR below is SMASHED OPEN.
          Nantz spins, swinging his shotgun. HE FIRES.
          BOOM! The blast ILLUMINATES the huge ALIEN, filling the
          stairwell with its horrible bulk.
          Nantz backs up the stairs, pumping the shotgun, firing...
          Each blast ILLUMINATES THE ALIEN in a STROBE EFFECT. The
          alien moves up the stares. Nantz KEEPS FIRING.
          The NOISE IS DEAFENING in the enclosed space.
          Then the SHOTGUN RUNS DRY. And we're left IN DARKNESS.
          Imlay clicks on his FLASHLIGHT, revealing...
          The ALIEN at Nantz' feet, its strange "hand" on his boot.
          Nantz, terrified, aims at the alien, waiting to see if it
          will move. It doesn't.

<b>          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          Nantz and Imlay re-enter, running up to join the others.
          Up the stairs, by street-level, Harris and Adukwu keep watch.
          Harris motions: "ENEMY TROOPS".
          Nantz nods. Signals for all the marines to head down the
          stairs. The marines gather around Nantz. To Harris:

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          How many?

<b>          CPL. HARRIS
</b>          Hard to tell. A lot.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          I think I got their attention.
          Nantz kneels. He opens his pack, pulls out the radio and the
          case marked GLTD.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Look. There's something big down

<b>          SGT. NANTZ

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          We gotta hold 'em off long enough

</b>          If we can get a transmission out

          They all laugh softly.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Let's do it.
          He takes a deep breath, raises the radio, and TRANSMITS:

<b>          THE RADIO GOES DEAD.

          BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Nantz and the marines cover their heads
          as the station starts to come apart, chunks of concrete fall.
          The walls crack. Dust fills the air.
          Nantz SCREAMS as a chunk of concrete FALLS ACROSS HIS ANKLE.
          Then, it's over. All is silent. Nantz, GRIMACING in PAIN,
          strains to lift the concrete chunk off his ankle. He GROANS.
          The marines rise. Pale, sweating, Nantz hobbles to his feet.
          He slings his rifle, and carrying the GLTD, hurries on his
          bad ankle to the stairs.
          Nantz looks up. Rubble nearly fills the stairway. There is
          only a small opening of daylight near the ceiling.
          The men all unclip their web gear, begin climbing.

<b>          EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES STREET - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
          A chunk of rubble falls from the pile at the subway entrance,
          and Nantz emerges, rolling down the pile to the street.
          The other marines follow, set up a perimeter as..,.
          Nantz takes cover behind a berm of rubble, DROPPING down,
          flattening himself to the ground.
          He sets the GLTD (LASER DESIGNATOR) up on top of the pile.
          Nantz removes his flack jacket and places it over the laser
          designator.

          Nantz looks up to see...
          The street fill with ALIEN SOLDIERS rushing out now.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY

          rounds and the alien goes down.
          But the rest KEEP COMING... closing in...

<b>          FOLLOWING THE BEAM OF THE LASER BACK TO NANTZ.

          Then his rifle runs dry.
          NANTZ pulls his sidearm. He aim, FIRES, shooting a closing
          alien in its 'heart.' It drops.
          Rounds impact around Nantz as he shoots another alien...
          Then the next. The next. Then his sidearm is out of bullets
          as... An EXPLOSION rips near Nantz.
          Knocking the laser away.
          Nantz struggles...TO THE LASER. RE-AIMING it as...

<b>          MORE ALIENS POUR INTO THE STREET.
</b>          The marines are pushed into a SMALL CIRCLE around the laser.
          Fighting nearly back to back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          106.
</b>          Kerns is HIT. He is thrown to the ground, but is back up,
          arm bleeding, firing.
          An alien RUSHES AT CORREGGIO who spins just in time, FIRING
          repeatedly until the alien goes down.
          Stavrou swings his rifle butt, SMASHING another alien. It
          staggers back. Stavrou puts numerous rounds into it.
          An alien reaches ADUKWU, knocking him to the ground, about to
          blast him...
          Harris runs the alien through with his bayonet, twisting and
          firing his rifle at the same time. The alien falls.
          The marines are FIGHTING AS ONE.
          All focused on SURROUNDING NANTZ. THEN THE LASER DIES.
          Imlay notices the laser beam is gone.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Did we get a lock!?

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          I don't know!
          Then... An ear-splitting NOISE. The marines look up, see...

<b>          A CRUISE MISSILE COMING STRAIGHT DOWN THE STREET!
</b>          Nantz looks up at his men, yelling:

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          INCOMING! Fall back! This way!
          Nantz and his men begin BACKING AWAY. Firing as they do,
          trying to hold off the aliens.
          Nantz, limping on his injured ankle, GOES DOWN. Correggio is
          there to help him up.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          Think you just twisted your ankle,.
          sir.
          And through it all, Nantz still smiles at this.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Don't stop!! We're too close to
          the impact point!!
          The marines start running as...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          107.
</b>
<b>          MORE CRUISE MISSILES APPEAR, RIPPING TOWARD THE GROUND...
</b>          BOOOOOM! The first missile strikes!
          Then another...and another ...BOOOOM! BOOOOM!
          A piercing WHISTLE sounds. Nantz looks into the sky as...
          Suddenly KABOOOM!!! A 2000 pound laser-guided ARTILLERY
          SHELL explodes INTO THE GROUND...
          THE GROUND HEAVES UP. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION of fire and smoke
          erupting from beneath the surface.

<b>          A SHOCK WAVE BURSTS OUT FROM THE IMPACT POINT.
</b>
          THE MARINES ARE ENVELOPED... DISAPPEARING as...
          Buildings shatter, cars are tossed, flames erupt.
          Then SILENCE descends a moment. Only the crackle of flames,
          falling glass. The dust and ash settles in a grey haze.
          Nothing could have survived this. BEAT. Then...
          A FIGURE RISES UP out of the grey destruction.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>
<b>          MARINES!
</b>          AS ONE, the men rise out of the ash, standing tall.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>
<b>          ON ME!
</b>          The marines fall in. A PHALANX with Nantz at its center.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>
<b>          FIRE!
</b>          They move forward. Precise. Deadly. FIGHTING AS ONE.
          The seven remaining marines POUR FIRE on the mass of aliens.
          The Drone Ships fall from the sky, EXPLODING on the ground.
          The aliens, in disarray, are mowed down. The rest FLEE.
          And as the smoke drifts away, there is silence again.
          Nantz looks up to see...

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          108.
</b>          HIS MEN. His warriors. Standing with smoking weapons, ready
          for more. Correggio staggers up, covered in dust, bloody.

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          You know what, Sergeant? My
          brother said you were a bad ass.

<b>                         (SMILES)
</b>          I had no idea...

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          Your brother was one helluva
          marine, Correggio.

<b>                         (SMILES BACK)
</b>          So are you.

<b>                         CUT TO:
</b>
<b>          INT. MEDEVAC HELICOPTER
</b>
          Nantz sits in the rumbling chopper. Surrounded by his
          marines. Imlay stares out at the city below.

<b>          PVT. IMLAY
</b>          Man, it's quiet.

<b>          CHOPPER PILOT (V.0.)
</b>          They're in full retreat throughout
          Los Angeles, heading back into the
          ocean. Units are mopping up.
          On this, Nantz turns to his SQUAD. Beat.

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>          This has been a hell of a battle.
          Plenty of other battles to go.
          Everybody good with that?
          The marines don't hesitate.

<b>                         MARINES
</b>          Yes, Sergeant!

<b>          CPL. CORREGGIO
</b>          Well, uh, actually, Sergeant...
          there's this girl I was supposed to
          meet up with tonight...

<b>          SGT. NANTZ
</b>
<b>                         (SMILES)
</b>          I'm sure she'll understand.
          Nantz looks at his marines.

                         

                         

                         

                         

<b>          109.
</b>
<b>                         NANTZ
</b>          I think you men earned the right to
          call yourselves marines today. I'm
          damn proud of every one of you.
          Retreat!?

<b>                         MARINES
</b>
<b>          HELL!
</b>
<b>                         ALL
</b>
<b>          2/5!!!

<b>                         THE END
