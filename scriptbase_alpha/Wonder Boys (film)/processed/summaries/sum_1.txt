On the day his third wife leaves him and his literary agent arrives to pressure him to finish a novel seven years in the writing, Carnegie Mellon professor, Grady Tripp, also learns that his married mistress is pregnant.
Seven years before, with his first novel, he was a wonder boy.

Both now need something.
Over the weekend, instead of making choices, he vacillates in a pot-induced haze.
One of his students, James Leer, perhaps stirs paternal feelings in Grady and raises homo-erotic urges in the agent.
Academic politics complicate things: Grady's mistress is the college chancellor, her husband chairs Grady's department, James has just shot the husband's dog.
What to do?
