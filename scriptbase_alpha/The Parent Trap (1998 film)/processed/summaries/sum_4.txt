What if you spent your whole life wishing for something you didn't know you already had?
Hallie Parker and Annie James are about to find out.
Hallie is a cool girl from California.
Annie is a fair rose from London.
When the two accidentally meet at summer camp, they think they have nothing in common except...they're identical twins!
Now they're up to their freckles in schemes and dreams to switch places, get their parents back together and have the family they've always wished for!
