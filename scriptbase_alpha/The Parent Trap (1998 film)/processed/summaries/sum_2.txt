Summer camp in Maine, USA.
Two young redheads, Hallie and Annie, coincidentally meet and discover that they look pretty (and) similar.
Soon, their common history opens up when they are banned into the isolation cabin for unsocial behaviour.
Being twin sisters, their parents separated them at birth and divorced also.
So, Annie grew up in London, England, living with her mother Elizabeth, who is a wedding gown designer.
Hallie lived with her father Nick, a vineyard-owner, in Napa Valley, California.
Both sisters decide to switch sides, as Annie never had a father and Hallie never had a mother.
All works well, until Nick decides to marry Meredith, a creepy but beautiful woman who is only after his money.
Now, the girls decide to let the parents meet.
Let the games begin.
