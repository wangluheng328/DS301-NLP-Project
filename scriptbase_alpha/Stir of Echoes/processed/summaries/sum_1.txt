Tom Witzky is a lineman for a utility company.
He's a typical working-class guy who lives in Chicago with his pregnant wife Maggie and his son Jake.
Tom likes to hang out with his friends, who include Frank McCarthy and Harry Damon.
One night at a party, Tom ends up in a discussion with Maggie's sister Lisa, who believes in psychic communication and the power of hypnosis.
Tom challenges Lisa to hypnotize him, and she plants in him a post-hypnotic suggestion to be more open-minded...with results that were never, ever expected.
That night, he sees images of violence and the ghost of Samantha Kozac, a young woman who disappeared from the neighborhood some time ago, and is now believed to be dead.
Jake also sees Samantha's ghost, but while Jake is calm about it, Tom always seems angry that the images won't stop coming.
Jake's baby-sitter Debbie Kozac is Samantha's sister, who is still distraught because of Samantha's disappearance.
When Debbie discovers that Jake has been talking to Samantha's ghost, Debbie becomes frantic, and she thinks Jake may know where Samantha is.
Determined to figure out what's going on, Tom begins a hunt for Samantha's body, and it's a hunt that threatens to kill Tom, Maggie, and Jake, because there is someone who does not want Samantha's body to be found.
