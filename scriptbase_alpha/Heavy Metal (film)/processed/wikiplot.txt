The film's title sequence story (based on the original story by Dan O'Bannon and art by Thomas Warkentin) opens with a space shuttle flying in orbit over Earth.
The bay doors (on the belly of the shuttle) open, releasing a 1958 Corvette.
An astronaut seated in the Corvette then begins descending through Earth's atmosphere, landing in a desert canyon.
