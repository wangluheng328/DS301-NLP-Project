Ex-Navy pilot Ted Striker has been nervous about flying ever since THAT incident during the war.
He's on a flight which would cause anyone concern: he seems to be the only sane person aboard.
Of course, everything that could possibly go wrong on this flight will go wrong... what do you expect with a co-pilot who doesn't realize he's a basketball star, and an air traffic controller with a substance abuse problem?
