This is a spoof of the airport disaster movies.
When the crew of an airplane are struck by some form of virus, the fate of the passengers depends on an ex-war pilot who is the only one able to land the plane safely!
The passengers represent a selection of interesting wacky characters who seem to take every word for its literal meaning.
