Upon moving to San Francisco from New York City in 1972, forty year old Harvey Milk gains focus in his life as a gay activist in the city's Castro district.
Gay rights activism turns to political activism as Milk decides he can be a more effective voice for the gay community as a politician, elected or not.
Through several elections and losses both for a city seat and a state assembly seat, Milk becomes the first openly gay man in the United States to be elected to political office when he wins a San Francisco supervisor seat in 1977.
His many political battlefronts include one with the national anti-gay Save the Children crusade, led and fronted by singer Anita Bryant.
Closer to home, Milk has a continuing struggle with his fellow supervisor, Dan White, a staunch social conservative.
