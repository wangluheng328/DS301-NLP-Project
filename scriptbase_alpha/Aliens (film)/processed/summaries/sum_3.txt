The sequel to Alien is a non-stop, high-tech, war movie, with Space Marines.
Ripley is found in deep space by a salvage ship, 57 years after narrowly escaping with her life - and her cat - at the end of Alien.
She then discovers The Company have colonised the planet where the alien was first encountered.
When contact with the colony is lost, The Company send a team of Space Marines, with Ripley as an "advisor", to find out what has happened.
