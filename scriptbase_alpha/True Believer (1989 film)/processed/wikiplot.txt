Eddie Dodd is a burnt-out attorney who has left behind civil rights work to defend drug dealers.
Roger Baron is an idealistic young legal clerk, fresh out of law school, who encourages Dodd to take on the case of Shu Kai Kim, a young Korean man who was imprisoned for a gang-related murder.
Kim's mother believes her son was wrongfully accused.
Dodd and Baron's investigation leads to a conspiracy among the district attorney, a police informant, and several police officers.
