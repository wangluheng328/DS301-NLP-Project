</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. BAR - NIGHT

</p><p></p><p id="act">A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.

</p><p></p><p id="act">CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But, you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">In "Jailhouse Rock" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is 
rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck 
about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and 
leaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it 
big he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, 
and he's singing, "Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care". Now, they 
got him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this 
horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him 
wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the 
party, big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' 
motherfucker. I'd watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis 
looked good. I'm no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' 
prettier than most women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I 
mean had too 'cause my life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY
</p><p id="dia">I'd fuck Elvis.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Really?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY
</p><p id="dia">When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">I don't blame you.
</p><p id="spkdir">(they laugh)
</p><p id="dia">So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, 
isn't it?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Lucy laughs.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY
</p><p id="dia">How 'bout me what?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY
</p><p id="dia">What are we gonna see?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the 
Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY
</p><p id="dia">Who's Sonny Chiba?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY
</p><p id="spkdir">(not believing this)
</p><p id="dia">You wanna take me to a kung fu movie?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="spkdir">(holding up three fingers)
</p><p id="dia">Three kung fu movies.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LUCY
</p><p id="spkdir">(laughing)
</p><p id="dia">I don't think so, not my cup of tea.


</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM - DAY

</p><p></p><p id="act">The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained black.

</p><p></p><p id="act">On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. "Bewitched" is playing.

</p><p></p><p id="act">At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and FLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic bags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't know it listen to him.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">That's bullshit.

</p><p></p><p id="act">BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl and Floyd. Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in two greasy brown-paper bags.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">Naw man, that's some serious shit.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Nigger, you lie like a big dog.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="dia">What the fuck are you talkin' about?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="dia">Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">I heard that.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="dia">Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every 
motherfuckin' thang.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Preach on, Big D.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - 
but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. 
I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="dia">Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass 
things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' 
niggers' dicks.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Heard that.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl and Big D bump fists.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.
</p><p id="spkdir">(he takes a hit off of a joint)
</p><p id="dia">There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their 
pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with 
white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">- Because it's good!

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And 
because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up 
for every nigger in the world everywhere.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="dia">Drexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to 
express our gratitude -

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl and Big D bust up.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got 
pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to 
do a bunch of fucked-up shit.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="dia">So you do eat pussy!

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">Naw naw!

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="dia">You don't like it, but you eat that shit.
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Drexl)
</p><p id="dia">He eats it.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Damn skippy. He like it, too.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="spkdir">(mock English accent)
</p><p id="dia">Me thinketh he doth protest too much.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. 
You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with 
Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" 
and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' 
shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you 
say?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="dia">Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne 
County so fast -

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">I'd say fuck it!

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd sitting all alone.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching "Bewitched".

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="spkdir">(yelling after them)
</p><p id="dia">Ain't no man have to eat pussy!

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="spkdir">(not even looking)
</p><p id="dia">Take that shit somewhere else.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="spkdir">(marching back)
</p><p id="dia">You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">FLOYD
</p><p id="dia">If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, 
kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, 
nigger, you'd aim to please.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">BIG D
</p><p id="spkdir">(glued on TV)
</p><p id="dia">I'm hip.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, 
toss me that shotgun.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Without turning away from "Bewitched" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to Drexl.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Floyd)
</p><p id="dia">All right, check this out.
</p><p id="spkdir">(referring to shotgun)
</p><p id="dia">Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.

'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get 
that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he

you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry

I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead

seat, Pop, we gotta talk -

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF

problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a 
drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else 
did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not 
really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty 
resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say

</p><p></p><p id="act">A lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in front of it in the shape of a planet. 

</p><p></p><p id="act">A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly less kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.


</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. TRAILER - DAY

</p><p></p><p id="act">He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">GUN CARRIER (DARIO)
</p><p id="dia">Welcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men, standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy), and Tooth-pick Vic (a fireplug pitbull type).

</p><p></p><p id="act">Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Frankie)
</p><p id="dia">Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.

</p><p></p><p id="act">In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff. Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his hand, but he has yet to touch a drop.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">I give up. Who are you?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell 
the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly 
personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is 
Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your 
son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us 
before. Am I correct?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question 
you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, 
at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.

</p><p id="dia">I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this 
must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his 
brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road 
with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a 
choice.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -

</p><p></p><p id="act">Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with his fist.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got 
that pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It 
ain't any kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's 
ever gonna get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your 
neighbors. They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, 
parked in front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your 
son?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Cliff's defeated.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">I've seen him.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance 
you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore 
your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't 
just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. 
Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do 
some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room 
blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">What are you talkin' about?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it 
outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he 
is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the 
commode filled in all the blanks.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">I don't believe you.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that 
I believe you. Where did they go?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">On their honeymoon.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they 
go?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">They didn't tell me.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Coccotti looks at him.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years. 
Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me 
he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could borrow 
five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a check. We 
went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me God. They 
never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never thought to ask.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal on the wound. Cliff screams.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in the car.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my 
old man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from 
growin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen 
different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has 
seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen. And 
if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to 
hell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna 
show me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know 
where they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away 
from.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart. He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes. 

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">Sure.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">Got a match?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">Oh, don't bother. I got one.
</p><p id="spkdir">(he lights the cigarette)
</p><p id="dia">So you're a Sicilian, huh?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="spkdir">(intensly)
</p><p id="dia">Uh-huh.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I 
find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, 
Sicilians were spawned by niggers.

</p><p></p><p id="act">All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">Come again?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLIFF
</p><p id="dia">It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If 
you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years 
ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, 
Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, 
once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so 
much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, 
from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it 
absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, 
Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a 
fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, 
great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. 
That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets through Cliff's head.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon, and turns to his men.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">COCCOTTI
</p><p id="dia">I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity 
in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this 
comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me where 
that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this 
fucked-up family for good.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was all about.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer. When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic banana magnet that says: "Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and address)".

zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus 
appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about 
his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such 
a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. 
Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if 
I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he 
was from. And, so there you go.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">The oriental.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired 
to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him 
into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, 
while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a 
number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the 
window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Want some Goobers?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Thanks a lot.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I thought Sonny was the good guy.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be 
bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming 
up.

</p><p></p><p id="act">They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses.


</p><p></p><p id="right">TIME CUT:

</p><p></p><p id="act">On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him. THE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence. They're both applauding.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Great movie. Action-packed!

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Sonny kicks ass.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It 
was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw 
the R.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">My name is Clarence, and what is yours?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Is that your real name? Really?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.

</p><p></p><p id="act">She shows Clarence her driver's license.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Well, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker 
there, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie.
</p><p id="spkdir">(announcer voice)
</p><p id="dia">She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! 
She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her 
waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam 
Grier! Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the background they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and Alabama break up laughing.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I took a cab.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Sure. Why not?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">What time is it?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">'Bout twelve.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">No. Not particularly.
</p><p id="spkdir">(pause)
</p><p id="dia">How come?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and 
get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat 
pie after you've seen a good movie?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">I love to get pie after a movie.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Would you like to get some pie?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">I'd love some pie.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about 12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke. Alabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Well, enough about the King. How about you?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">How 'bout me what?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Tell me about yourself.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">There's nothing to tell.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">What do you want to know?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite 
color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What 
are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story 
behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a 
theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Ask me them again. One by one.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">What do you do?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I don't remember.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Where are you from.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">What's your favorite color?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">What's your favorite movie star?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Burt Reynolds.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Would you like a bite of my pie?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Yes, I would.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Like it?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Very much. Now, where were we?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">What kinda music do you like?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">What are your turn-ons?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like 
Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Turn-offs?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only 
thing that comes to mind are Persians.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Do you have a fella?

</p><p></p><p id="act">She looks at Clarence and smiles.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town 
alone?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a 
form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or 
where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even 
know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a 
Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they 
told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on 
me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For 
some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told 
him to stop and I got out.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure 
couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until it makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul.

</p><p></p><p id="act">A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Aren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy?
</p><p id="spkdir">(eats her last piece of pie)
</p><p id="dia">Where to next?


</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT

</p><p></p><p id="act">It's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a comic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-cool.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Wow. What a swell place to work.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, 
play music.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">How long have you worked here?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Almost four years.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">That's a long time.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what 
I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of 
the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Do you get paid a lot?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow 
some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks 
like?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">You bet. How much is that worth?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence gets a box off the shelf.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Four hundred bucks.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch 
boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main 
business. There's a lot of collectors around here.

</p><p></p><p id="act">She holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">What's that?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. 
They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors 
in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid 
playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He pulls a plastic-cased "Spiderman" comic form the box.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">"Spiderman", number one. The one that started it all.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">God, Spiderman looks different.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. 
Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, 
just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. 
Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He pulls out another comic.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos". One of the coolest series known to 
man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about four 
bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.
</p><p id="spkdir">(he opens one up)
</p><p id="dia">Just look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look 
at this one.

</p><p></p><p id="act">We see the "Sgt. Fury" panels.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Nick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on 
a chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on 
a ship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain 
and the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. 
Isn't that cool?

</p><p></p><p id="act">She's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Alabama, I'd like you to have this.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence hands her the "Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos" comic book that he loves so much.


</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis, anything you can imagine. The two walk through the door.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">What a cool room!

</p><p></p><p id="act">She runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Later. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album. Clarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you 
then?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Five.

</p><p></p><p id="act">She turns the page.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE

</p><p></p><p id="act">LATER - LIVING ROOM

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's "Piece of My Heart".

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">You know when you sat behind me?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">At the movies?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, 
she doesn't want me bothering her.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">What would make you think that?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">You're not stupid. Just wrong.

</p><p></p><p id="act">They move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the song.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I love Janis.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">She OD'd, didn't she?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take 
too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what 
she took.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">You mean she got a bad batch?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the 
happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't 
trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her 
to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she 
couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her 
money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I 
wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter 
what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she 
did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told 
her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">So he really loved her?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Uh-huh.

</p><p></p><p id="act">They kiss.


</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

</p><p></p><p id="act">It's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks around, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a robe and investigates.


</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair crying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.

</p><p id="dia">What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">You didn't do nothing.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Did you hurt yourself?
</p><p id="spkdir">(he takes her foot)
</p><p id="dia">Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the 
theater. I was paid to be there.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make 
sure they're not rippin' the place off.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Pause.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">You're a whore?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.
</p><p id="spkdir">(pause)
</p><p id="dia">I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that 
comic book place.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">"Heroes For Sale"?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Who?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into 
you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I 
was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. 
That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich 
millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">That dazzling imagination.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write 
anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not 
to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had 
that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let 
him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back 
to Drexl and fuck yourself."

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Who and what is a Drexl?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">My pimp.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">You have a pimp?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Uh-huh.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">A real live pimp?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Uh-huh.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Is he black?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Is he nice?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty 
decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough 
with Arlene the other day.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">What did he do to Arlene?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty 
scary.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">This motherfucker sounds charming!

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence is on his feet, furious.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer 
before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck 
did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an 
agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They 
have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total 
white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least 
five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry 
beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was 
ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says 
he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's 
gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or 
wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the 
ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till 
last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. 
Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I 
want a second date.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. 
Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE

</p><p></p><p id="act">A Young Black Man, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has really big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation they were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the confrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty.

</p><p id="dia">These bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get 
the kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-out boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL

</p><p></p><p id="act">This is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he expected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table, demanding Drexl's attention.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="spkdir">(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence)
</p><p id="dia">Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">No thanks.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? 
All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to 
be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've 
already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly 
where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some 
dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to 
myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the 
world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, 
he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, 
watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you 
been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't 
even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, 
but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not 
stayin'. I'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause I saw it seven years ago. It's 
"The Mack" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by 
Bobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama Releasing 
Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In that 
envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener 
pastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter.  I don't like to 
dicker. I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's 
in that envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that 
much. Not one penny more, not one penny more.

</p><p></p><p id="act">You could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full alert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">It's empty.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, "That's right, asshole."

</p><p></p><p id="act">Silence.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Oooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we got 
here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be? Mr. 
Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't got 
no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand -

</p><p></p><p id="act">Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at Clarence, catching him of guard.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold. 

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus. We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.

</p><p></p><p id="act">All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about it.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Ya wanna fuck with me?

</p><p id="dia">Ya wanna fuck with me?
</p><p id="spkdir">(hits Clarence)
</p><p id="dia">I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!

</p><p></p><p id="act">He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs his nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and starts twisting.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of his head.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's thumb.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and busting his nose.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his knees.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of LPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">MARTY

</p><p id="dia">You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Drexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Well, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost 
like a nigger name.
</p><p id="spkdir">(to Clarence)
</p><p id="dia">Hey, dummy.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DREXL
</p><p id="dia">Before you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I 
just chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're some

Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th  street, apartment

</p><p></p><p id="act">While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger and blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like a pillbug.

it." I could. So I did.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA

those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot 
to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a 
little bit at a time -

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DICK

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="dia">I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred 
thousand. How difficult can that be?

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DICK

Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two 
hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more 
important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly 
help you.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DICK
</p><p id="dia">He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a 
very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could 
be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DICK

green money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was  
the bitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to hoe. Now,

hoe. You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">VIRGIL
</p><p id="dia">Well, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great.  
One less thing I gotta worry about.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Virgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">VIRGIL
</p><p id="dia">OK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth -

</p><p></p><p id="act">He moves close.

</p><p id="dia">You don't have anything to lose.

</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSEUP - Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose. Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into "I'll take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do" seething hatred.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.


</p><p></p><p id="act">CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE

</p><p></p><p id="act">Talk about bloodcurling yells.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running down his face.

</p><p></p><p id="act">While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster, so it doesn't kill him.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">VIRGIL
</p><p id="dia">OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the nose, breaking it.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to it, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back, sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama. Alabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not one of them has ever laughed before he did it.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">VIRGIL
</p><p id="dia">What's so fuckin' funny?!!

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="spkdir">(laughing)
</p><p id="dia">You look so ridiculous.

</p><p></p><p id="act">She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">VIRGIL
</p><p id="dia">Laugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you  
laughing now?

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his eyes.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">VIRGIL
</p><p id="dia">Oh Jesus!

</p><p></p><p id="act">She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">VIRGIL
</p><p id="dia">Oh Mary, help me!

</p><p></p><p id="act">The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming toward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into the toilet.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net hairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground. He crawls toward it.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama snatches the shotgun.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second hits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been functioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;

O Divine Master, grant that I may not
so much seek to be consoled as to console;
to be understood as to understand;
to be loved as to love;

it is pardoning that we are pardoned,

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama's so scared she pees on herself.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Lee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and flings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees,

</p><p></p><p id="act">Instinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama screams.

</p><p></p><p id="act">A shot catches Clarence in the forehead.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama screams.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Dario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the bathroom sink, smashing the mirror.

</p><p></p><p id="act">It might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either hits the ground or runs for cover.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Boris dives into the kitchen area.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Monty tips the table over.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marvin dives behind the sofa.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Dario runs out of the door and down the hall.

</p><p></p><p id="act">With bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA Officers are shot right away.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Frankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Elliot gets it from both sides.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the bathroom.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Clarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama continues crawling.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast hits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty.

</p><p></p><p id="act">As Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over the apartment.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Dick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door.

</p><p></p><p id="act">An IA Officer goes after him.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Lenny makes a break for it.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Wurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin.

</p><p></p><p id="slug">INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ANOTHER HALLWAY

</p><p></p><p id="act">The hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes around the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the same corner.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">IA OFFICER

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">IA OFFICER
</p><p id="dia">Put your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch!

</p><p></p><p id="act">He does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer, sending him to the wall.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DICK
</p><p id="dia">Oh shit.

</p><p></p><p id="act">He starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the corner and runs down the hall.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Dick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Lenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">DICK
</p><p id="dia">Look, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm  
sorry.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Two elevator doors on either side of them open.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Lenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says:

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">LENNY

</p><p></p><p id="act">The Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each other down.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Wurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned down in the kitchen.

</p><p></p><p id="act">In the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get his heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of times.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA

</p><p></p><p id="act">Dimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the grip of a dead Wise-guy.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Boris peeks around the wall to fire.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Dimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the floor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back. Alabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She reaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her hand and remembers Clarence saying:

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">CLARENCE
</p><p id="spkdir">(off)
</p><p id="dia">She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'!  
She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her

Grier! Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Marvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Dimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She fires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor.

</p><p></p><p id="act">Alabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be funny. She's muttering to herself.

</p><p></p><p id="speaker">ALABAMA
</p><p id="dia">I could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked 
away. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred 
percent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling 
bad. I should laugh 'cause you don't deserve any better. I could get 
another guy like that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. 
Asshole. You're a asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted 
it all, didn't ya? Didn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. 
You ain't got me. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. 
Nada. Zip. Goose egg. Nil. Donut.

</p><p></p><p id="act">The song "Little Arrows" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks down and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues. She wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on the dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.

</p><p></p><p id="act">She pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view mirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens on the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads it: "You're so cool".

</p><p></p><p id="act">She tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She looks around for, and finally finds, the "Sgt. Fury" comic book Clarence bought her.

</p><p></p><p id="act">And with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away from the Mustang forever.
