Delores is having an affair with her Mafia boss, Vince.
Her career as a singer in Las Vegas is going nowhere and Vince won't divorce his wife and she goes to him to break it off, witnessing a murder Vince just ordered.
Running from the club, she seeks police protection.
They agree to hide her in the one place Vince would never look for her.
She finds, to her chagrin, that it is a convent, where she must impersonate a nun.
After several false starts, she is assigned to the convent's dismal choir.
She challenges and reorganizes them to become a modern singing group.
In this she is successful, and as the choir gets better, success brings it's own problems.
