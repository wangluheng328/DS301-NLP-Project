Over a 24 hour period, 17-year-old sisters Jane and Roxy Ryan, adversaries who begrudgingly journey together from their Long Island home to New York, where the uptight overachiever and Straight A student Jane (Ashley Olsen) is due to deliver a speech to qualify for a prestigious college scholarship abroad.
Meanwhile, laid-back punk rock rebel Roxy (Mary-Kate Olsen) hopes to get backstage at an underground music video shoot for punk pop band Simple Plan so that she can slip her demo tape to the group.
Roxy and Jane’s plans go awry when a mix-up involving Jane’s day planner lands them in the middle of a shady black-market transaction.
Pursued by an overzealous truant officer (Eugene Levy) and accused of kidnapping a dog belonging to a senator, the Ryans must find a way to work together to thwart the forces threatening to jeopardize Jane’s college dreams and ship Roxy off to a convent school.
Romantic interest comes in the form of a Senator's bad boy son (Jared Padalecki) and a bike messenger (Riley Smith).
