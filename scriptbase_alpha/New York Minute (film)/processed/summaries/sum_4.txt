Jane Ryan and her sister Roxy, two sisters who just can't get along have to learn to when they travel from Long Island to New York City.
Jane must get her Callahan Fellowship scholarship to enter a prestigious college while Roxy hopes to get backstage at an underground music video shoot for punk pop band Simple Plan so she can slip her demo tape to the group.
While getting there, they are chased by an overzealous truant Officer Lomax for being accused for stealing Senator Anne Lipton's dog.
