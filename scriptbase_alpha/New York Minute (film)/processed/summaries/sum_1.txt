Jane and Roxy (Roxanne) Ryan don't get along but have to on their way from Long Island to New York City.
Jane is an overachiever who is trying to win the Callahan Fellowship scholarship abroad and Roxy is a rebel who is trying to sneak backstage a shoot with Simple Plan to hear her demo tape.
Somehow Jane's dayplanner causes them to get in the middle of a black market deal involving a computer chip that the limo driver is after(they find it in a pork roll).
They also are accused of kidnapping the senator's dog, Reinaldo after he EATS the pork roll including the chip.
Jane gets arrested but Jim the bike messenger helps her out.
They can't fail or Roxanne could end up in a convent school and Jane might not have her college dreams come true.
In the end the sisters come closer with Roxy prepared to 'be' her twin siser to try and win her the scholarship when Jane is arrested.
