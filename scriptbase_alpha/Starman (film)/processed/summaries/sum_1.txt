Having accepted an invitation to visit Earth (sent in the one of the Voyager space probes in the 1970s) an alien receives a rude reception when his ship is fired upon and disabled.
He has only three days to get to the giant crater near Winslow, AZ where he will be rescued or else he will die.
Taking human form, he seeks the assistance of the recently widowed Jenny Hayden.
Initially terrified, she comes to care for the alien visitor.
All the while, government agents seek to track them down.
