In 1977, the Voyager 2 travels to the outer space with messages of peace and greetings from Earth.
A small alien spacecraft comes to Earth to make contact with Earthlings but the military airplanes shoot it down.
The spacecraft crashes in Chequamegon Bay, Wisconsin and the alien wanders in a form of energy to the house of the young widow Jenny Hayden, where he uses the DNA from a hair of her husband Scott to take his human form.
The Starman contacts his mother ship and he needs to be in a crater Arizona in a couple of days to return to his star; otherwise he will be left behind and will die.
The Starman forces Jenny to take him to Arizona and she is hostile with him in the beginning.
However, she learns that he is a peaceful being and she chooses to help him.
But the army is chasing them and the despicable NSA chief George Fox wants to hunt him down while the SETI scientist Mark Shermin wants to help The Starman since he is sure that he has come to visit Earth peacefully.
