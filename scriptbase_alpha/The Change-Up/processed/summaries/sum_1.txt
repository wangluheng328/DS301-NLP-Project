Friends since third grade, Dave is a driven attorney hoping to make partner, married with kids; Mitch is a slacker enjoying life.
After an evening of drinking, they wish for each other's lives in front of a statute in an Atlanta park; the next morning they wake in the other's body.
The statue's been moved to who knows where, so until they can find it and re-exchange bodies, they must carry on for each other: it's a crucial week professionally for Dave and Mitch has things lined up involving sex.
Mitch gets a shot at responsibility and Dave at relaxing, and they learn secrets about themselves.
Plus Mitch's dad is remarrying and Dave live out his attraction to a colleague.
