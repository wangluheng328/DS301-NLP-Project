In Atlanta, Dave Lockwood is an efficient and dedicated lawyer that expects to be promoted to partner of the law firm where he has been working for ten years after a merging operation and a family man, married with the gorgeous Jamie Lockwood and father of three children.
His best friend is the aspirant actor Mitch Planko, who is single, reckless and unemployed, and a quitter that never concludes what he is doing.
One night, Dave and Mitch drink a lot and they go to a fountain to pee and they both simultaneously wish to have the life of the other.
On the next morning, they wake up and discover that they had switched bodies.
They return to the square and find that the fountain has moved to an unknown place.
Therefore, Mitch needs to become responsible to save the job and the promotion of his friend, while Dave feels how complicated is for him to date with his sexy and gorgeous colleague Sabrina McArdle.
Sooner they learn more about themselves and also that the life of the other is not as good and they believe it could be.
