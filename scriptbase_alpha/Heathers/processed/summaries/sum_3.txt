Dear Diary: Veronica Sawyer is sick of being part of the Heathers, the most powerful clic of Westerberg High; making fun of Martha Dunnstock ("Dumptruck"), the fat girl, or doing some stupid polls is something she'll never get used to.
Meanwhile she meets JD, a cool rebel guy who wouldn't mind shooting a gun at school just to make his point.
Remington University's party is where Veronica has to go as a Heather, and there's where she gets her ultimatum as a Heather from Heather Chandler, the head of the Heathers.
So Veronica and her lover JD "accidentally" kill Heather Chandler and manage to cover it up by making a suicide note.
Will this be just the beginning of the assasination-turned-suicide serie of Westerberg High which nor the FBI, the CIA or the PTA would be able to stop?
Or will Veronica be able to pull herself together and stop her psychotic lover from killing absolutely EVERYONE at school?
