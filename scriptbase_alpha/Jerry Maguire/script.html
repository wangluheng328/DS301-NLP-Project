              than that.  He drills it over the first baseman's head, just
              out of reach of his glove. Art runs to first, laughing.  Pats
              the first baseman's butt.  Gotcha.

              huge offensive lineman, BOBBY "BAJA" BRUNARD, 22.  He is
              angry, and he is handcuffed.

<b> 
</b>              She laughs, it's an infectious laugh -- two strangers
              enjoying the good life -- as we DRIFT BACK three rows, past
              the panel separating the cool comfort of first class from the
              stuffy airless and uncomfortable world of coach.
<b> 
</b>              We meet DOROTHY BOYD, 26.  A harried passenger on this bus in
              the sky.  Her clothes are part-contemporary, part mother-
              functional. She is never as composed or in control as she
              wants to be. Right now she is devoted to the sneezing kid in
              the wrinkled white-shirt sitting next to her.  It is RAY, her
              five-year old son.  Dorothy is covered in toys and books.
              Stuffed into the side pocket is Jerry's Mission Statement.
              The easy laughter from three rows ahead washes over her like
              cold water, as she rings again for a Flight Attendant.  The
              overworked ATTENDANT arrives, pissed, snapping off the bell.

<b> 
</b>              (The movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation,
              is a Hi-8 confessional of Jerry's former girlfriends.
              MICHAEL JORDAN is cut into this, nodding, as if he were
              actually interviewing.  The effect is funny, but the
              confessions are brutally honest.  There is The One He Was Too
              Good For, The One He Wasn't Good Enough For ("He hated being
              alone.") The Still in Love Girlfriend, The Punk Rock
              girlfriend ("Sports makes me ill"), The Now Married With Kids
              Girlfriend, The Cynical Girlfriend ("Beneath the cute
              exterior, more cute exterior.") The Purely Sexual Girlfriend,
              The Brainy Girlfriend, ("Great at friendship, bad at
              intimacy") and even the Girlfriend Who Does A Great Jerry
              Imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless Jerry-on-his-
              way-to-the-airport).  All seem to agree on some basic points
              (and if necessary maybe Jordan narrates the following
              information to underscore it.)  Jerry always has a
              girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up
              with the last one.  The relationship always competes with his
              job, and the job always wins.  The final confrontation
              happens somewhere around the 18-month mark. Sequence ends
              with Avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to
              burn all these old phone numbers.)

                        Something's wrong.
<b> 
</b>              Jerry nods, takes a swig of beer.  He knows the response is
              little more than polite.  None of the other agents can keep
              eye contact with him.  Dooler is right.  On the screen, the
              finale features a good-humored collage of Jerry photos, cut
              to music.

              through the buzzing SMI headquarters, heading for his corner
              office.  He is like an FBI man searching treetops and corners
              for the Gunman. Everywhere he looks is a potential Grassy

              Basketball Player. Moving forward. There is trouble in the
              air, but only he seems to sense it.  He turns corner and is
              met by assistant WENDY, who hands him a long list of calls.

<b> 
</b>              Tyson just stares at Jerry.  Jerry has little luck with kids.
              He gives Marcee a quick peck and heads for the fridge.  He
              grabs a two-pint bottle of orange Gatorade -- another

              uncomfortable. Emplazoned above his head: IN ROD WE TRUST.

<b> 
</b>              A beat of silence, then noise returns to its normal

</b>              The tragic-sounding beep of the elevator passing floors.
              Jerry Maguire stands with Dorothy, both still charged with
              adrenalin. And then the first pangs of dread. There is
              silence.  The elevator stops.  A young, amorous Couple
              enters.  Both are about 24, and the Guy presses a number five
              flights down.  In a moment, we realize they are deaf.  They
              sign to each other, murmuring noises of love. And then the
              Guy signs something, obviously powerful, because the Girl
              emits a delighted gasp, as does Dorothy.  The Couple are
              truly in their own world.  They kiss before exiting on their
              floor.  And suddenly the elevator seems empty without them.

              "Let's Groove Tonight" by Earth, Wind and Fire. Excellent.

              again.  All he wants is to sing along with a song he knows.
              Finally he finds Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' "Refugee."
              He drives through the countryside, singing the call and

              her.

</b><b>              EXT. MARRIOTT MARQUIS -- NIGHT
</b><b> 
</b>              The headquarters for the NFL draft is buzzing with activity.
              Limo doors open and out pours Maguire and company.  Media
              lights flick on, bathing Cush.  Reporters chatter. ("Is it
              San Diego or Denver, Cush?N  "Cush!")  Fans at the outskirts
              are calling out to the young star ("Go get the big chi-ching,
              Cush!") Avery smoothly pulls ESPN into the front position.
              Telegenic Cush shrugs and smiles. ("I'll either surf or
              ski.")  Jerry admires his fiancee.  There is nothing more
              attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job.

</b>              Shot drifts off this media bubble to find Tidwell watching at
              the outskirts.  He turns and exits unnoticed.

</b><b>              INT. GIFT SHOP -- NIGHT -- LATER
</b><b> 
</b>              Tidwell hides out in the gift shop, thumbing through
              magazines. The chip on his shoulder grows by the minute.
              Elsewhere in the gift shop, he sees the very real and
              emotional scene of a young athlete and his mother.  Both wear
              self-promoting colorful homemade t-shirts with the young
              athlete's face on it.  Something about them, their pure
              enthusiasm, rubs Tidwell in an odd way.  He almost cries, for
              himself, for humanity, as Jerry enters.  Tidwell is
              embarrassed to have been caught in this misty state.

              ego.

              wears the odd combination of a Nirvana t-shirt and a NFL
              jacket.  He signs for more room service and continues

              Endorsement placards in evidence everywhere.  NFL reps and
              media workers move tables and work out camera and seating
              arrangements.  Elevated in a open ESPN booth six feet off the
              ground, host Chris Berman records voice-overs for tomorrow's
              draft.  Fans heckle him by singing the ESPN theme.  He rolls
              with it, expertly.  Jerry spots Avery across the empty
              ballroom, moving fast, passing out media packets on the empty
              tables.

                        lamp.

</b>                        I'm glad you're home.  That
                        "alone" thing is... not my
                        specialty...
<b> 
</b>              He ducks the lamp, barely. Laurel exits through his shot,
              miming "drinking" behind his back. Jerry takes off his
              glasses, revealing a welt and a cut below his eye.

                        And yet!  My family.  I grew up
                        with repression as a... a

                        worked for the United Way for 38
                        years!  You know what he said when
                        he retired? He said, "I wish I'd
                        had a more comfortable chair." 38
                        years he sat in it!  Do you know
                        what I'm saying, Dorothy?
                        Repression as a religion. I'm
                        almost as old as his chair.
<b> 
</b>              He rubs his face.  She looks at him, and the situation
              slightly overwhems her. Here he is, wide-open, ripe for the

              Dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair.  She breaks the

              Stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the
              front porch, he recovers with style.

<b> 
</b>              She laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen.  She
              regards the poker still in her hand. Laurel watches her
              conflicted, slightly lovesick sister.

              scratching at his soul, trying to get in. Music continues. He
              was strangely comfortable there, as the house disappears from
              his view.

              pass, and slams into a padding post.  Dennis Wilburn, the GM

              awkwardly to give him one, and Ray plants a kiss on Jerry's
              cheek.  All are surprised, especially Jerry.  Dorothy is
              struck and moved.  Shot falls on Ray who watches Jerry exit
              with wonder. Even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees

              tying her straps back on. Her expression says there is a

              impossible to ignore, and Jerry collapses backwards on the

              him.  He opens the door, scoots the kid over, and sits next
              to him.

              goodbye too many times. He's anxious not to be left alone.
              Finally Chad grabs him by the shoulders, says goodbye, as a

              reading wedding vows.  Ray holds the ring, and waits for his
              cue to offer it.  But he has forgotten the cue.  And every
              time the Reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring.

              b.g.  More laughter and family noise in the background now.
              He holds onto a table for a moment, steadies himself.  Jerry
              takes a breath and moves into the kitchen.  Finds a beer.  He
              turns and finds himself alone with Laurel, for the first
              time.  She raises her beer.  They toast, warily.

</b><b> 
</b>              Swenson, the Arizona quarterback, throws a wobbly pass into
              the end-zone.  Tidwell leaps for the catch, tucks the ball in
              and is promptly and brutally hit by two defenders from two
              different sides.  This hit is bad.  Worse than bad.  Tidwell
              flips and comes down like a sack of potatoes, with a thud,
              ball still in his hands. His head hits the astroturf, hard.
              Tidwell is out cold.  And the ripple effect of the injury
              shoots through the stadium.  Jerry stares at the monitor,
              stunned by the sudden brutality.

              still on turf.  Overhead, the fight music continues for a few
              seconds before disappearing abruptly. Players and coaches
              begin to gather around the still body of Rod Tidwell.

</b>              The hit in replay.  It is brutal.  And we can see a flash of
              his pride as he catches the lousy pass, and then... like two
              bulls, the Philadelphia defenders enter from each side.  One
              cuts his legs out from under him, and Rod's taut body
              literally flips.  The second defender then hits him at the
              shoulders.  Tidwell lands on the back of his neck, crumpling
              downwards.  Still holding the ball.  Still.

              Statement.  The blue cover is ripped along one edge.  It
              clearly has served as a manifesto for this younger man's
              career.

              flood with the passing pages.   Shot holds on Jerry's face,
              as Tidwell continues singing in the background.  Suddenly, an
              odd feeling.  A shiver runs up and down his spine.  His
              forehead tingles.  He rubs his face.  All he can do is think

                        I've not been fair to you.  Women
                        need to stick together, and not
                        depend on the affections of a man
                        to "fix" their lives.  Maybe
