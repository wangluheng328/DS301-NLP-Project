George Lucas adapted this, his first film, from a short he made at University.
THX 1138, LUH 3417, and SEN 5241 attempt to escape from a futuristic society located beneath the surface of the Earth.
The society has outlawed sex, with drugs used to control the people.
THX 1138 stops taking the drugs, and gets LUH 3417 pregnant.
They are both thrown in jail where they meet SEN 5241 and start to plan their escape.
