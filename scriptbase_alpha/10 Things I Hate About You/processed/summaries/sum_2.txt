In an updated version of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, new kid Cameron James is head over heels for popular sophomore Bianca Stratford, but Bianca's overprotective father forbids her to date Cameron unless Bianca's older ill-tempered, rebellious sister Kat dates.
But Joey Donner wants Bianca, so he uses sullen senior Patrick Verona to attempt to win Kat's heart.
Will Patrick be able to win Kat over and Cameron will be able to have Bianca?
