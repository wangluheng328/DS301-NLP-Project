Updated version of William Shakespeare's "Taming of the Shrew," set at the fictional Padua High School in Tacoma where a new transfer student, Cameron, is interested in the popular sophomore Bianca Stratford.
But Bianca's overprotective and domineering father forbids Bianca to date unless her older sister Katerina, an unpopular and hostile senior, does.
In a bid to get Katerina a boyfriend, Cameron sets up a plan to have the school stud, Joey Donnar, bribe Patrick Verona, an outcast senior with a rumor-filled past, to take the volatile Katerina out on dates so he can go to the school's homecoming dance with Bianca.
However, neither Pat or Kat expect their 'going steady' to lead where nobody expects it too.
