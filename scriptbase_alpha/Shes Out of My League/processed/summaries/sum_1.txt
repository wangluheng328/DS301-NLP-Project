Kirk is a nice guy, who finishes last.
He's an airport security guard in Pittsburgh, his ex-girlfriend hangs out at his parents' house with her new guy, he's out of shape and uncoordinated, and his car's a junker.
At the airport, he finds the phone of a stunning, successful blonde, Mollie, and when he returns it, she offers dinner as thanks.
She enjoys his company - he's unassuming and safe - and he's dazzled.
His three friends warn him that she's out of his league and offer bad advice; he knows it will end soon and stumbles through a series of embarrassing moments.
His ex has gotten jealous and invites him back: should he return to where he belongs?
All roads lead to the airport.
