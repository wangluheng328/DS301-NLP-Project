In Pittsburgh, the clumsy and average Kirk works as a TSA security agent at the airport.
Kirk is out of shape, uncoordinated, not college graduate, has never been in Europe and drives a shitbox Neon.
His friends are a bunch of losers that also work at the airport and use to rank themselves and women.
His family does not support him and his father used his college money to build a large swimming pool in the backyard of their house.
Kirk dreams on becoming an airplane pilot, but he is insecure and without self-esteem.
He also misses his former girlfriend Marnie, who is a bitch that humiliate him all the time.
One day, the gorgeous Molly McCleish is helped by him in the check-in to a flight to New York, but she forgets her iphone and Kirks hold it for her.
On the next day, Molly invites Kirk to go to a party at the Andy Warhol Museum and he delivers her iphone to her.
Sooner they date and he learns that she is a successful promoter of events that lives in a fancy apartment and drives a nice car.
However, the lack of confidence of Kirk does not let him see that Molly loves him since she is totally out of his league.
