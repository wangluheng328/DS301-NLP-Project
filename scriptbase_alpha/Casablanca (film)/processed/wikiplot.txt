It is early December 1941.
American expatriate Rick Blaine is the proprietor of an upscale nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca.
"Rick's Café Américain" attracts a varied clientele: Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them.
Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, it is later revealed he ran guns to Ethiopia and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.
