A Great White Shark decides to make the small beach resort town of Amity his private feeding grounds.
This greatly frustrates the town police chief who wants to close the beaches to chase the shark away.
He is thwarted in his efforts by the town's mayor who finally relents when nothing else seems to work and the chief, a scientist, and an old fisherman with revenge on his mind take to the sea to kill the beast.
