It is the year 2054 - Washington D.C. - dreams can be recreated through computers, computer monitors and displays are transformed into holograms, and identification is done through eye-scanning.
John Anderton lost his son, and to prevent horrible events from occurring to other individuals he joins a unit known as "Pre-Crime" - where murderers are arrested before they can commit the murder.
How does Pre-Crime work?
Through 3 people known as "precogs".
They are 3 psychics used to see the future and they see murders exactly the way they will occur.
Through advanced technology, Pre-Crime officers are able to see what the precogs see, and they analyze the data, identify the perpetrator and victim, and try their best to stop the murder from occurring.
The perpetrator is put into a sleep state with a device called a "halo".
John Anderton gets accused of murdering a man he has never even met, causing him to run from Pre-Crime and prove his innocence.
