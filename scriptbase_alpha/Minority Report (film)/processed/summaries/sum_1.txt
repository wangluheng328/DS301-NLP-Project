In Washington, D.C., in the year 2054, murder has been eliminated.
The future is seen and the guilty punished before the crime has ever been committed.
From a nexus deep within the Justice Department's elite Pre-Crime unit, all the evidence to convict--from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details--is seen by "Pre-Cogs," three psychic beings whose visions of murders have never been wrong.
It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system.
And no one works harder for Pre-Crime than its top man, Chief John Anderton.
Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through.
Six years later, the coming vote to take it national has only fueled his conviction that Pre-Crime works.
Anderton has no reason to doubt it until he becomes its #1 suspect.
As the head of the unit, Anderton is the first to see the images as they flow from the liquid suspension chamber where the Pre-Cogs dream of murder.
The faces are unknown to him, but this time, the killer's identity is clear when Anderton will murder a total stranger in less than 36 hours.
Now with his own unit tracking his every move, led by his rival Danny Witwer, Anderton must go below the radar of the state-of-the-art automated city, where every step you take is monitored.
Because people can't hide, everybody runs.
With no way to defend himself against the charge of Pre-Crime, John must trace the roots of what brought him here, and uncover the truth behind the questions he has spent the past six years working to eliminate: Is it possible for the Pre-Cogs to be wrong?
