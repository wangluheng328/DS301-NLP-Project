Ine the year 2054, murders are predicted before they happen.
This is due to three supernatural beings called Precognitives.
The three of them are kept in a milky substance in a room called the temple.
Images from their brain are produced onto a screen, where Chief John Anderton searches for clues to the murder's location using the images.
His faith in the system is born of pain.
He lost his son, Sean, six years ago.
He's now separated and divorced from his wife, Lara, and has resorted to drugs to keep himself in control.
One day, however, his life turns around when the Precogs see a vision of him killing a man named Leo Crow.
Now on the run from the cops of Precrime, Anderton has to prove his innocence and discover if his murder was one of the rare cases in which one Precog sees things differently from the other two, called a Minority Report.
