Based off of a short story.
It is the near future, a future where murders have become so common, that a system had to be established.
This system is called "Precrime", where 3 physics can predict murders before they happen.
Allowing police to stop the murders.
This system is in production in Washington D.C. Where police officer John Anderton (who lost his son to a murder 6 years previous) has stopped numerous murders in his career.
One day, he found out that he is the next person to commit a murder.
Now, he is running away from a system he helped become successful, and trying to find out why he was set up to commit murder.
