In Massena, New York, nearby a Mohawk Reservation and the Canadian border, the middle-aged Ray Eddy is left by her husband a couple of days before Christmas.
Her husband is a gambler and stole the family savings and the car, driving to an unknown destination and leaving Ray alone and without money to raise her two sons.
When she sees the Mohawk Lila Littlewolf driving her car, she follows the woman up to her trailer to retrieve the car.
Lila lures her telling that she has a buyer for the vehicle, but she actually wants to use the large trunk to smuggler illegal immigrants from Canada into the United States through a frozen river in the Mohawk Reservation.
Ray unsuccessfully tries to convince her boss to promote her in her part time job; without any alternative to make honest money, Ray decides to associate to Lila to raise enough money to pay for her dream house and do not lose her down payment.
