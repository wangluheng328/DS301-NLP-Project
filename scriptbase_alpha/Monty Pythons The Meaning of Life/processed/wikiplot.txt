The film begins with a stand-alone 17-minute supporting feature entitled The Crimson Permanent Assurance (directed by Terry Gilliam).
A group of elderly office clerks in a small accounting firm rebel against their emotionlessly efficient, yuppie corporate masters.
They commandeer their building, turn it into a pirate ship, and sail into a large financial district, where they raid and overthrow a large multinational corporation.

The film itself opens with several fish in a restaurant aquarium, performed by the Pythons.
They look on and see one of their number, Howard, being eaten by a customer, and then start to ask themselves about the meaning of life.

The film proper consists of a series of distinct sketches, broken into seven chapters.
