</b>





<b>     NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS
</b><b>     AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR
</b><b>     THIS SOFT COPY.
</b>



<b>     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     PAN across details in a bedroom...we see discarded
     shirts...pants...socks...and hear

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
</b>               Oooh, yeah.  Oh, baby, you're so good.

<b>                         JIM (O.S.)
</b>               Yeah, I'm the best, baby.

     Now we see a TV...but the picture isn't clear.  Or, more
     appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in
     and out.  Bars scroll across it.  And we get occasional
     glimpses of what looks like --

<b>                         JIM (O.S.)(CONT'D)
</b>               ...oh -- that was a tit, tits...

     As most high-school guys know (but few will admit), it is
     possible to watch the pay channels while they're
     scrambled.  You just need a decent imagination to fill in
     the rest of the picture.  We PULL BACK to see JIM -- 17,
     short, horny.

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
</b>               Give it to me!  Yes!

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.

     Jim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe.
     We TILT DOWN to see a small multimedia presentation next
     to Jim on his bed.  "Cosmopolitan" is open to a sexy
     model...a yearbook is open to the "girl's swim team"
     section...and a dictionary next to Jim, open to the
     "Vagina" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram.

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
</b>               Don't you love my sexy body?!

<b>                         JIM
</b>               I do, baby, I do.

     He frantically looks around...and grabs a tube sock off
     the floor.

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
</b>               You're so big!

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yeah, that's right.

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)
</b>                   (deep macho voice)
               Ohhh, tell me you're a nasty girl!

     Jim is thrown off.

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)(CONT'D)
</b>               Yeahhh, you been bad, real bad!

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Man, shut up!

     Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door, immediately after
     which JIM'S MOM enters.  Jim scrambles and quickly covers
     himself and the dictionary with a pillow.  She's
     oblivious to his doings.

<b>                         JIM'S MOM
</b>               Hey, Jimmy.  I just wanted to say
               sweet dreams.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yep, okay Mom, 'night.

<b>                         JIM'S MOM
</b>                   (leans in to Jim)
               Kiss goodnight.

     Jim is revolted.  Very reluctantly he gives her a kiss.
     She turns to leave, and notices the TV.

<b>                         JIM'S MOM (CONT'D)
</b>               Is something wrong with the reception?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yeah.  Damn cable.  There's this
               nature show that I'm trying to watch.

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
</b>               Fuck me!  Yes!

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Uh...

     He hurriedly tries to change the channel with the REMOTE,
     but instead the VOLUME GOES UP.

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
</b><b>               BLOW YOUR WAD ON MY TITS!!
</b>
     Jim panics as his mom reacts, shocked.

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (choking)
               Must...be...broken...

     JIM'S DAD enters.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               What the heck is this?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Nothing!

<b>                         JIM'S MOM
</b>               I think he's trying to watch one of
               the illegal channels.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Jesus, Mom!  They're not <u>illegal</u>!
               They're <u>pay</u> channels.  How could a
               television channel be illegal?!  God,
               get a clue!

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               James, don't speak that way to your
               mother!

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL STUD (V.O.)
</b>               Play with my hairy balls!

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               Turn that garbage off!  Give me that!

     Jim's Dad grabs for the remote, which is sitting on the
     pillow that's been covering Jim.  The pillow gets brushed
     aside -- revealing the Big Vagina Diagram, Jim with his
     shorts down, and a very strategically placed tube sock.

<b>                         JIM'S MOM
</b>               Oh my God!

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               Honey, why don't you let me handle this
               one.

     He ushers her out.  Jim's Dad is stuck there with his
     half-naked son.  Horrible, awful embarrassment.  A long,
     strained beat.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)
</b>               Jesus Christ.  The dictionary?  Hell,
               son, I'll buy you some dirty
               magazines.

     Jim's Dad exits, shaking his head.  Jim sits agape,
     humiliated.

<b>                         PORNO-CHANNEL CHICK (V.O.)
</b>               Oooh, spank me, daddy, spank me!

<b>     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS - DAY
</b>
     We see a Honda Accord drive by a sign at the city limits:
     "Welcome to East Great Falls, Michigan -- A Great Place
     To Be"

<b>     EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
     The front of the school.  KEVIN drives up in his Accord.
     He's a good-humored, good-enough-looking high school
     senior.  VICKY rides shotgun -- pretty, smart, confident.
     She's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big
     "Vanderbilt" return address on it.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky.
               You got in.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               You think so?

     She tears it open.  Pulls out a course catalog, various
     forms, and a letter which she hands to Kevin.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               "Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but
               after keeping you on the wait list for
               the past couple months, we've decided
               you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a
               100-page, full-color brochure on how
               rejected you are."

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Kevin, this is serious!

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               You got in.

     Vicky SCREAMS in excitement, like a girl at a Beatles
     concert.  Then she LAUGHS, and gives Kevin a big kiss and
     hug.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               I love you!

     She hugs Kevin tighter -- as he looks a little frazzled,
     almost perfunctorily returning the hug.

<b>     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - MORNING
</b>
     Jim has met up with CHRIS OSTREICHER -- "OZ" -- a cocky
     senior with a football-player build.  He cradles a ball
     in a lacrosse stick.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's
               any channel that should be illegal,
               it's whatever that women's channel is.
               Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some
               shit.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little
               Mermaid on TV the other night?  That
               Ariel, whew.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               She's a mermaid, dude.

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (trumping him)
               Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.

     bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker, catching it
     again.  Kevin speaks a little distantly, unnerved.

     The guys pass by a GROUP OF BAND DORKS, most notable of
     which is MICHELLE, who proudly polishes her flute.

</b>               And what we should do today, in band?
               Instead of playing our instruments

               backwards!  That'll be so funny!

     The Band Dorks LAUGH and agree, "hilariously" attempting

     Someone is HOLLERING down the hall.  Running towards Oz
     is STEVE STIFLER -- very clean-cut and preppy, he's a
     maniac, a jackass, much worse than Oz.  Not really part

</b>               Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like

<b>                         OZ

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Really, Stifler.  He's the manager.

     Oz gives a little nod, avoiding the issue.

<b>                         STIFLER

               since Homecoming and all she'll do is
               blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a
               steaming turd.

     off.

     A small, nostalgia-themed dive.  Despite the theme,

     condiments.

<b>                         KEVIN

     Jim is paging through Great Falls' equivalent of the LA
     Weekly.

<b>                         JIM

<b>                         OZ
</b>               "Fun loving" -- insane.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind,"
               equals old.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               No, "Charming" is old.  "Older" is
               <u>really</u> old.  "Youthful mind" is dead.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Perhaps you should consider actually
               answering an ad.

               uh, third base feel like?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Oh, man, that's kind of sad.

     Jim shrugs, embarrassed.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Feels like warm apple pie, dude.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Apple pie...
                   (then)
               McDonald's or homemade?

     They just look at him.  Finch hops on his scooter.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Gentlemen, see you at the Bacchanalia.

     He MEEPS his horn and buzzes away.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</b>
     For a high-school party, it's pretty good.  The house is
     peppered with ALL TYPES OF HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS.  MUSIC
     blends with the din of excited conversation.

     Kevin and Jim are drinking beers.  Around them, students
     mingle and flirt.  CHUCK SHERMAN comes up.

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>               What's up, fellas?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>               Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys.
               Confidence is high, repeat, confidence
               is high.
               Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full
               strategic arsenal ready for
               deployment.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               You've got something going?

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>               Did you see that Central chick?
               Brunette?

<b>                         KEVIN/JIM
</b>               No.

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>               She's around.  Seems that she's taken
               a liking to me.  Fellas, it's time
               that she experienced -- The
               Sherminator.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Yeah, okay Sherman, whatever.

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>               I'm a sophisticated sex robot, sent
               back through time...to change the
               future for one lucky lady.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Yeah man, right on!

     Sherman saunters off into the party.

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>                   (shakes his head)
               Hopeless.

     Vicky approaches, having a good time, joining the guys,
     EXCHANGING GREETINGS.  Jim spots NADIA across the room.
     She's beautiful, a masterpiece of a woman.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Oh, shit!  There she is.  Nadia.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               You like her?  Her sponsor family
               lives on my block.  Why don't you talk
               to her?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               What would I say?

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Just tell her what's on your mind.
               And smile, you've got a good smile.
                   (then to Kevin)
               Come on.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>                   (to Jim)
               Gotta go.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               But --

     Kevin and Vicky disappear into the crowd -- just as Jim
     sees Nadia approaching him.  He freaks.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Kevin, get back here!

     But he's gone.  And Nadia is now in front of him.  With
     no other alternative, Jim readies himself, smiling big.

<b>                         NADIA
</b>                   (with a really sexy accent)
               You are in my English class, no?

     Jim smiles.

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (barely)
               Yes.

<b>                         NADIA
</b>               I thought so.

     Jim's smile grows even bigger, almost stupid.  A beat.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               So you are having fun?

     Jim nods, still smiling away.  Staring right through her
     head.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               I said, you are having fun?

     A little SQUEAK escapes his throat.  Jim is on mental
     vacation.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               Me too.

     A beat.  Jim's expression is now plasticized.  Eyes
     vacant.  A frozen, completely artificial smile. Nadia is
     confused.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               Well...I am going to get another beer.
               You want one?

     Jim strains to speak, through his smile.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               No...you...go...ahead.

<b>                         NADIA
</b>               Okay.

     She walks off.  Jim SIGHS, completely relaxing, like a
     huge burden is now off of him.  He wipes his brow.  Then,
     realizing --

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Oh, shit.  No!  Shit!

     He pounds his head with his fist.

<b>     EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
     A group of band dorks is on the porch, including
     Michelle.  Stifler stands in the doorway, staring at them
     in disbelief.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               We're here for the party?

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               What party?  There's no party.

     MUSIC blares from inside.  A drunken HAND reaches through
     the door and ruffles Stifler's hair.

<b>                         PARTY GUY (O.S.)
</b>               Stiff-lerrr!  Par-tyyy!!

     The hand disappears back into the house.  A beat.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Try the house down the street.

     Stifler slams the door.  The dorks wait a moment.

<b>                         BAND DORK
</b>               Ring the bell again.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Ringing the bell is dorky -- let's
               just go in.

     We hear a CLICK OF A DEADBOLT.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Kevin and Vicky are on the bed, making out.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Oh, Kev.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's
               time for us to take the next step in
               our relationship?

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Tonight?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Yeah, it's such a perfect evening.
               Isn't this how you've always pictured
               it?

<b>                         PARTY GUY (O.S.)

</b>               You reek like a fuckin' Yeti, dude!
               Go take a shit or something!

     Kevin and Vicky exchange a glance.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Or not.

     Vicky pushes him onto his back.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Just relax.

<b>     INT. CAR - NIGHT
</b>
     Oz is in the passenger seat, making out with the
     aforementioned COLLEGE CHICK.  She's attractive and older-
     looking (from a high-school perspective).  They are
     parked near the river that flows through downtown Great
     Falls.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Great evening, isn't it?

<b>                         COLLEGE CHICK
</b>               Sure.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               There's something about the spring
               that's just cool.  Like the smell of
               fresh rain or something.

     At this, she snuggles up to him.  Oz smiles confidently.

<b>                         OZ (CONT'D)
</b>               Suck me, beautiful.

     The College Chick backs off, confounded.

<b>                         COLLEGE CHICK
</b>               What did you just say?

<b>                         OZ
</b>                   (not so confidently)
               Suck me...beautiful?

     The College Chick's eyes flutter in disbelief.  She tries
     to keep her cool -- but can barely restrain her laughter.

<b>                         COLLEGE CHICK
</b>               What?!

     Oz attempts to maintain a suave exterior, but he's just
     had the rug pulled from under him.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova
               -- as in Casanova.

<b>                         COLLEGE CHICK
</b>               You need some work, buddy!

     She bursts into laughter.  Oz is ill.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Well...jeez, don't laugh at me.

     Seeing Oz's defeated expression, she collects herself.

<b>                         COLLEGE CHICK
</b>               Look, Chris.  There are just some
               things you need to learn, that's all.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Like what?

     She sees that he's lost.  Almost feels sorry for him.

<b>                         COLLEGE CHICK
</b>               Alright, well...you've got to tone it
               down.  You don't need to go to Lookout
               Point and spout cheeseball lines to be
               romantic.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               ...okay...

<b>                         COLLEGE CHICK
</b>               You have to pay attention to a girl.
               Be sensitive to her feelings.
               Relationships are reciprocal.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               I'm not good in math.

     She's trying not to laugh again.

<b>                         COLLEGE CHICK
</b>               Come on, I'll drop you off at your
               friends'.

     Oz couldn't be humiliated any further.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - SAME TIME
</b>
     Oz is nursing a beer, having just told the story to Jim,
     Stifler, and some guys.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>                   (hysterical, toppling over)
               You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Shut the fuck up.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Oh that's really reassuring.  And
               don't call me Nova anymore.  I'm a
               fraud.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               This is pathetic.  I'm gonna find me a
               little hottie.

     Stifler strides into another room.

                         STIFLER (O.S.)(cont'd)
                   (yelling)
               Suck me, beautiful!

     Oz wallows in his beer can, beaten.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Vicky is pleasuring Kevin...you know.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>                   (brief pause)
               Let me know.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Okay, don't stop.

     She resumes.  A moment more -- and then Kevin is about to
     lose it.

                         KEVIN (cont'd)
               Oh -- Now!

     With awkward hurriedness, Vicky stops as Kevin
     frantically searches for a receptacle.  He grabs a nearby
     cup of beer.

<b>     EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT
</b>
     Insert -- A hand pumping up the keg.  A fresh beer foams
     out into the cup.

<b>                         GUY #1
</b>               There we go.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
     Vicky is buttoning up her shirt.  Kevin tentatively sets
     down the beer and buttons his pants.  Suddenly the DOOR
     BURSTS OPEN.  Stifler is standing there.  A coat hanger
     sticks out of the doorknob.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b><b>               SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               God dammit, Stifler!

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Check-out time!  Please vacate the
               room.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Stifler, you're such a jerk.

     She runs out, grabbing her clothes.  Kevin runs after
     her.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Vicky, wait!

     Stifler enters the bedroom, laughing, pulling a SOPHOMORE
     CHICK behind him.  He closes the door.

<b>                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
</b>               God, I can't believe there are so many
               cool people at this party.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Yep.

<b>                         SOPHOMORE
</b>               And you got a keg, too, wow.
                   (realizing)
               Oh, wait, I left my beer downstairs.

     Stifler notices Kevin's beer sitting on the night table.
     He hands it to her.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Here, babe.

<b>                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
</b>               Thanks.

     She's about to take a sip.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>                   (gazing into her eyes)
               You're really beautiful.

     Thrown off, she sets the beer down.

<b>                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
</b>               Really?

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Uh huh.

     She's totally enthralled.  Nervous, she raises the beer
     again to take a sip.  Then Stifler moves in.  Takes the
     beer from her and sets it down.  Starts kissing her.  She
     breaks it off.

<b>                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
</b>               I don't know if I want to be doing
               this.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>                   (sighs)
               Doing what?

     Stifler looks inconvenienced.  He picks up the beer,
     annoyed.

<b>                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
</b>               You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow
               I'll just be some girl you go telling
               all your friends about.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>                   (shifty)
               No way.

     Avoiding her look, he raises the beer to take a sip.

<b>                         SOPHOMORE CHICK
</b>                   (a little angry)
               Steve!  You could at least look at me
               when you say that.

     Stifler stops and SIGHS, the beer inches from his mouth.
     Lowers it.  Stares her in the eye.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Look...
                   (searching, remembers)
               ...Sarah.  I wouldn't go telling
               stories or whatever about you.  I
               promise.

     Smiling, he raises the beer...

<b>                         JIM
</b>               What the hell?  I should be able to
               talk to chicks.  I'm articulate.  I
               got a 720 on my SAT verbal.
                   (starts listing off words)
               Copious.  Verisimilitude.

     A GUY SCREAMS upstairs.

<b>                         JIM (CONT'D)
</b>                   (unaffected)
               Intransigence.

     A GIRL SCREAMS upstairs.  The SOPHOMORE CHICK comes
     running through the kitchen.  SCREAMING.  And
     indeterminate stain is on her shirt.  She bolts out the
     door and into the night.  A moment passes.

<b>                         JIM (CONT'D)
</b>               Regurgitation.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Stifler is on his knees, barfing in the toilet.  Jim and
     a few other guys rush in.

<b>                         GUY #1
</b>               Oh, gross.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Jesus, what did you eat?

     Stifler just keeps hurling.  Kevin enters, holding the
     remains of the tainted beer.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Stifler, how's the man chowder?!

     Stifler barfs even more violently.

<b>     EXT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - BACK PORCH, BY THE KEG - NIGHT
</b>
     Jessica and Vicky are refilling their beers at the keg.
     Nadia waits patiently beside them with an empty cup.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               He likes it.

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Of course he does.  What about you?
               Have you just never had one with Kevin
               -- or have you never had one, period?

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               I think I've had one.

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Well that's a no.  No wonder you're
               not psyched about sex.
                   (starts filling Vicky's beer)
               You've never even had one manually?

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               ...I've never tried it.

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Are you kidding?  You've never double-
               clicked your mouse?

     Vicky shrugs.

<b>                         JESSICA (CONT'D)
</b>               Hell, just a pair of tight pants will
               set me off.
                   (noticing Nadia next to them,
                    she passes the tap along)
               Am I right or what, Nadia?

<b>                         NADIA
</b>                   (no bones about it)
               You are right.  The hands are not
               always necessary.

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>                   (to Vicky)
               See?

<b>                         NADIA
</b>               In fact -- I should teach you my own
               special method.  I developed it myself
               at the ballet institute in Prague.
               You use nothing but the muscles of the
               inner thigh.

     Nadia walks off.

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               No wonder she never pays attention in
               class.

     Vicky nods, traumatized.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER
</b>
     Kevin and Jim are looking at a PICTURE OF STIFLER'S MOM
     on the wall.  Very attractive, late 30's.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Shit, I can't believe a fine woman
               like this produced a guy like Stifler.

     TWO FRESHMAN GUYS are walking by as Jim says this.

<b>                         FRESHMAN GUY
</b>               Dude!  That chick -- is a MILF!

<b>                         FRESHMAN GUY #2
</b>               What the hell is that?

<b>                         FRESHMAN GUY
</b>               M-I-L-F!  Mom I'd Like to Fuck!

     Suddenly, a bedroom door opens a couple inches.  Sherman
     pokes his head out.

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>                   (hushed, to guys)
               Don't you think you fellas could try a
               little tact?  I've got company.  Know
               what I mean?

     In the bedroom in the background, we see the Central
     Girl.  Sherman closes the door, leaving the guys there,
     dumbstruck.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT
</b>
     Jim and Kevin are coming down the stairs.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>                   (snapping)
               Dammit!  If Sherman has sex before I
               do, I'm gonna be really fucking
               pissed.

     They turn the corner into the kitchen.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUING
</b>
<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Man, I just gotta get laid already!
               This blowjob thing is bullshit!

     He stops.  Vicky is there with Jessica.  Staring at him.
     Vicky quietly grabs her purse.  Hurt.  OTHER STUDENTS
     watch, silently.  Kevin doesn't know what to say.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Jessica, can you drive me home?

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Sure.

     The guys watch as the girls head for the door.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Vicky, wait.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Not for you.

     The girls exit.  Nobody says anything.  Kevin is in
     shock.

<b>                         PARTY GUY (O.S.)
</b>               Yeti!  I am the Yeti!

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
     The next morning.  The party is long over.  Plastic beer
     cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not
     trashed.

     Jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head.  He
     stumbles over a body.  It's Kevin.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Ow, what the hell?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Sorry, I thought you were dead.

     They walk over to the other side of the room.  Finch is
     sitting on the couch.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Good morning gentleman.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Finch!  Where were you last night?
               What happened to the foolproof plan?

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               I thought a fashionably late entrance
               would enhance my appearance.
                   (off their looks)
               When I got here, the Bacchanalia was
               over and the nymphs had left.

     Oz wanders in, still sullen.  Takes a seat, sulking.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Feeling better, Oz?

<b>                         OZ
</b>               I'm such a loser.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               That's the spirit.

     We hear FOOTSTEPS coming down the stairs.  It's the
     CENTRAL GIRL.  She wears a "Central" sweatshirt.  Sherman
     follows behind her.  The guys watch in disbelief as
     Sherman and the girl speak hushed, intimately.

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>                   (snippets of conversation)
               ...I'll never forget...thank you.

     The Central Girl smiles.  Notices the other guys
     watching.  Just gives Sherman a kiss on the cheek.

<b>                         CENTRAL GIRL
</b>               Bye.

     She exits.  The guys are dumbfounded.  Jaws hang.
     Sherman looks triumphant.  Strides over to the guys.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               You did it.

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>               Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman,
               the boy.  I am now a man.

     The guys are shocked and amazed.

<b>                         SHERMAN (CONT'D)
</b>               I highly recommend you join the club.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I -- I don't get it, how the hell did
               you do that?

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>               It was just my time, fellas, it was
               just my time.  Best of luck to you,
               boys.

     Sherman exits.  Silence.  The guys look like they just
     lost the World Series on errors.  They slowly take seats,
     ruined.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I put in months of quality time with
               Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one
               night and scores?  This is just wrong.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               No shit, I'm never gonna get laid.
               How the hell am I gonna become this
               Mr. Sensitive Man?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Jesus, we're all gonna go to college
               as virgins.  They've probably got
               special dorms for people like us.

     A long beat as they give this serious consideration.
     Then, Kevin strides purposefully to the front of the
     group.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Alright, I got an idea.  But it stays
               between us.  Agreed?

     They do.

                         KEVIN (cont'd)
               Okay.  It's really simple.  We
               make an agreement -- no wait, more
               than an agreement.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Like a bet?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               No, a <u>pact</u>.  No money involved.  This
               is more important than any bet.  Now
               here's the deal: We all get laid
               before we graduate.

     A beat

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Dude, it's not like I haven't been
               trying to get laid.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               This is different.  This is better.
               Think of when you're working out, Oz.
               You need a partner, someone to spot
               you.  Someone to keep you motivated.

     Oz nods, getting into it.  Kevin smiles and continues,
     arms outspread.

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>               That's what we are, we keep each other
               on track.  Prior to this day, we've
               postured.  We've procrastinated.
               We've pretended.  We've -- well I
               can't think of other p-words, but
               we've probably done them too.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Pontificated.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>                   (ignoring him)
               Separately, we are flawed and
               vulnerable.  But together, we are the
               masters of our sexual destiny!

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (kung fu voice)
               Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong;
               but our dragon style will defeat it!

<b>                         OZ
</b>                   (going on)
               The Sha-lin masters from east and west
               must unite!

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Guys, guys -- you're ruining my
               fucking moment here.  Now think about
               it --

     Kevin jumps up on a chair.

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>               No longer will our penises remain
               flaccid and unused!  From now on, we
               fight for every man out there who
               isn't getting laid when he should be!
               This is our day!  This is our time!
               And, by God, we're not gonna let
               history condemn us to celibacy!  We
               <u>will</u> make a stand!  We <u>will</u> succeed!
               <u>We will get laid</u>!

     Kevin jumps down off the chair, and puts his hand out in
     front of him.  One by one, the guys pile their hands on
     top, in between them -- it's a pact!  They break with a
     CHEER.  Woo-hoo!

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>                   (wandering down from upstairs)
               What the hell are you losers doing?

     They all stop.  Stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his
     mouth.  A goatee of dried toothpaste.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               If I might ask, when you brush your
               teeth, do you spit or swallow?

     Stifler tries to give a retort to Finch, but turns green
     and heads back upstairs.

<b>     INT. DOG DAYS - DAY
</b>
     The guys are finishing up breakfast.  Hot dogs &amp; eggs.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Now, the sex -- it's got to be valid,
               consensual sex.  No funny stuff.  And
               no prostitutes, if you were thinking
               about that, Finch.

     Finch gives a wistful "Who, me?"

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>               So, I'm thinking prom is basically our

<b>                         OZ

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I know, but think about it -- At the

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yeah, it's like tradition or

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Right.  That gives us...

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Exactly three weeks to the day.

     They take this in with some trepidation.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Alright then.  It's official.  Any
               questions?

     There are none.  Kevin raises his Pepsi.

                         KEVIN (cont'd)
               To the next step.

     The guys raise their drinks.

<b>                         ALL
</b>               To the next step.

     They toast.  And from this, we go into our STRATEGIZING
<b>     FOR SEX MONTAGE:
</b>
<b>     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Jim sits in the room as Kevin goes through the yellow
     pages.  Finds a "Floral Delivery" listing.  Kevin dials.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY
</b>
     Kevin, Jim, and Oz are pooling a few dollars together,
     which Kevin takes.  They part ways.

<b>     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Oz is watching the Lifetime Channel as Jim looks on in
     confusion.  A Martha Stewart-type thing where they pain
     pottery with little sponges.  Oz looks dubious.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY
</b>
     Finch is unpacking his lunch.  He carefully unfolds a
     napkin to reveal a sandwich, crust removed.  Other than
     that, he's doing absolutely nothing.

<b>     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Jim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera
     attached to his computer.  The computer screen reads, "E-
     DATE:  We Make Love Happen."  As Jim fiddles with the
     camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image.
     He clicks an onscreen-button labeled "FREEZE IMAGE" --
     the image freezes, showing Jim with an awkward grimace.
     The screen reads, "IMAGE SENT."

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGHS - LIBRARY - DAY
</b>
     Kevin holds a copy of the HOLY BIBLE.  We see he's in the
     "Religion" section.  Surrounded by piles of different
     bibles.  No luck.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY
</b>
     Finch pulls out a small mustard packet.  He neatly snips
     the end with scissors.  Then rolls the packet, like a
     tube of toothpaste, economically dispensing every last
     bit of mustard.

<b>     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Jim is on his computer.  The screen reads "YOU HAVE 00
     REPLIES."  Jim is nonplussed.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY
</b>
     Kevin, Oz, and Jim are closely gathered around Kevin's
     locker, holding their backpacks open.  Kevin holds a big
     shopping bag, which he turns over, and a box of condoms
     falls out.  He hands it over to Jim...and we see that the
     guys' packs are full of various condom boxes.

<b>     INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Jim has unraveled a bunch of condoms and is curiously
     examining them.

     And THE MONTAGE COMES TO AN ABRUPT END with a KNOCKING.

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (shoving the rubbers into his
                    night table)
               Just a minute!

     He opens the bedroom door.  Jim's Dad is standing there.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>                   (trying not to look inside)
               Can I come in?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yeah, sure.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               You're not...busy?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Dad, come in.

     Jim's Dad reluctantly enters, carrying a brown paper bag.
     He takes a seat on Jim's bed.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>                   (fatherly attempt)
               Sit down, Jim.  Let's talk.

     Jim takes a seat next to his dad.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Okay.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               These are for you.  From father to
               son.

     Jim looks at the bag.  Uncomfortable.  Hesitantly, he
     takes it.  Slowly, dreadfully, he pulls out a copy of
<b>     PERFECT 10.
</b>
<b>                         JIM
</b>               Uh...dad...

     Jim's Dad is doing his best to be the good father.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               Go ahead son, there's more.

     Beyond embarrassed, Jim reaches into the bag.  Cringes.
     Pulls out a PENTHOUSE.

                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)
               Now, that one's a little more...a
               little more...graphic.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               I know, Dad.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.

     Jim's Dad takes the bag back.  Pulls out a copy of
<b>     SHAVED.
</b>
                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)
               This, son, is your more exotic dirty
               magazine.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Dad!  I know!

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               Do you know about the clitoris?

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (through clenched teeth)
               Yes dad.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               Sometimes it can be pretty hard to
               locate.

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (interrupting, hand up)
               Thank you, dad, I got it.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               Okay, well that about covers it.

     Jim MURMURS something incomprehensible.

                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)
               Now, let's put these somewhere where
               your mother won't find them.

     Jim's Dad takes the stack of magazines.  He goes to open
     Jim's night table.  Jim freaks.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Wait!

     But it's too late.  Jim's Dad is face-to-face with the
     unraveled prophylactics.  He sours.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>                   (beaten)
               I'll have to save this speech for
               another day.  I'm too worn out.

     Jim's Dad exits, a condom stuck to the back of his pants.

     The VOCAL JAZZ GROUP is practicing, singing one of those
     doo-wop, Acapella love songs (i.e. "Love You Like I Do").
     Singing with the group is none other than Oz.  He's not
     doing too badly, but mainly he's checking out the various
     vocal jazz girls.  Smiling at them, giving suave little
     waves.

     Kevin, Stifler, and Jim take seats in the back of the
     auditorium, listening.

<b>                         JIM

     bibles on the bottom shelf.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd)
               After a couple years, guys started
               adding their own techniques.  Things
               they figured out themselves.

     Kevin slides out the section of bibles from the bottom
     shelf.  Pulls out a pocket knife.  Flips up the bottom of
     the shelf.  Slides it out.

                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)(cont'd)
               You have to keep it a secret, and
               return it at the end of the year.  So,
               now you know.  Good luck.

     There, a bit dusty, is an old book.  Many extra pages of
     notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking
     the binding.  The original title is now obscured -- over
     it, someone has written "The Bible."

     Remember when Indian Jones found that gold statue?  It's
     like that right now.

     Kevin carefully pulls it out.  Reverently flips through
     it.  Full of details.  Explicit diagrams.  Anecdotes.
     And atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the
     date it was added.

     Kevin reaches the last page.  It's blank.  He lightly
     runs his hand down the empty page.

<b>     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

     Jim enters his house, slinging his backpack off his
     shoulder.

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (yells)
               Mom?!  I'm home!

     No response.  Jim walks into the kitchen, noticing a
     fresh-baked pie on the counter.  Next to it is a note:
     "Jimmy - Apple, your favorite.  I'll be home late.
     Enjoy!  Love Mom."

     Jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma.  Then stops...as
     a quizzical look spreads across his face.

     After a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the
     pie.  Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency.

     Then Jim becomes more curious.  We can see the gears in
     his head start to turn.  He looks down at the pie like
     it's... well, not a pie.

     Jim's dad gets out of his car, carrying his briefcase.

     Jim's dad comes in the door and stops dead in his tracks.
     His face drops, appalled.

<b>     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

     Jim and his Dad sit in silence, opposite each other at
     the table.  Jim stares into his lap, humiliated.  Jim's
     dad is crushed.  You've never seen such disappointment...
     but he's trying to keep his chin up for Jim's sake.

     In the middle of the table is the pie.  It's decimated.
     Mushed up, ruined...violated.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD

<b>     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Late.  Kevin sits on his bed, reading a book -- the
     Bible.

     If all students studied the way Kevin's studying this
     book, we'd have a nation of geniuses.  He's scrutinizing
     it.  Turning it sideways and upside down as if trying to
     decipher cave paintings.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - DAY
</b>
     The Vocal Jazz Group is doing a song.  Oz is singing
     along, really making it look like he's into it.  He
     closes his eyes, singing with even more enthusiasm.  As
     the song ends, Oz continues just a moment more with his
     shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal "scat" to tag the
     number.  The thing is, it actually sounds really good.

     Oz opens his eyes...to see the whole group -- especially
     the girls -- looking at him, somewhat awed.

     The CHOIR TEACHER is a smartly-dressed black woman.

<b>                         CHOIR TEACHER

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Sorry.

<b>                         CHOIR TEACHER
</b>               No, it was good.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Oh, well...
                   (noticing Heather looking at
                    him, he acts "sensitive")
               It came from the heart.

<b>                         CHOIR TEACHER
</b>               Well then keep it coming.
                   (to everyone)
               Alright, people, good work!  Keep it
               up and we'll do great at the state
               competition.

     Rehearsal wraps up, and Heather comes up to Oz.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Not bad, Chris.

<b>                         OZ

               Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather,
               right?

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Yeah...so...you've got this sort of...
               Bobby McFerrin thing going there.

<b>                         OZ
</b>                   (no idea)
               Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.
                   (then, back into it)
               I feel like I've discovered this whole
               new side of me.  Music is so
               expressive.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>                   (amused)
               Okay.
                   (then)
               I mean, I agree, but...aren't you
               supposed to be out, like, trying to
               decapitate someone with your lacrosse
               stick or something?

     Oz "gets serious" at this.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Oh sure.  I know what people think.
               It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass
               lacrosse player -- I also play
               football, by the way -- But that's
               like...not <u>all</u> that I am.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Of course, I didn't --

<b>                         OZ
</b>                   (cutting her off)
               I mean it really bothers me when
               people try to pigeonhole me like that.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>                   (sparking to this)
               You?  You think I don't get that?
               God, it's like just because I don't
               get drunk and barf every weekend,
               people say "Oh, here's this goody-two-
               shoes choir-girl priss."

     Of course, this is what Stifler said about her.  And for
     a moment, this catches Oz off guard.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>                   (offended)
               Well the same things you do.  Hang out
               with friends and stuff, you know,
               whatever.
                   (then)
               What do you think I do?

<b>                         OZ
</b>                   (genuine)
               I just -- realized that I didn't know
               anything about you.  I was interested.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.

<b>     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - DAY

     Kevin is walking home with Vicky.  He's a couple paces
     behind her, almost tagging along.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I was being selfish.  And majorly
               insensitive.  And I'm a total idiot.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               I think "shithead" really says it.

</b>               Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete
               and total shithead!

     She cracks a little smile.

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>               And I want to try to make it up to

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               How?

     Vicky stops walking.  Looks at Kevin.

<b>     EXT. VICKY'S HOUSE - DAY

     Vicky's perfect suburban home...as we hear VICKY MOANING
<b>     IN ECSTASY.
</b>
<b>                         VICKY (V.O.)
</b>               Oh...ungghhhhh!

<b>                         KEVIN (V.O.)
</b>               Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.

<b>     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Tight on Vicky's face, in sexual bliss, writhing.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Oh Kevin -- don't stop!

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Just a second!

     We see that Kevin is kneeling on the floor.  Vicky's legs
     are to both sides of him -- he's ducking down, consulting
     the bible, which is hidden beneath the bed.  It's open to
     a page titled "The Tongue Tornado."

     Kevin resumes, out of frame.  Vicky goes nuts.

                         VICKY (cont'd)
                   (a little too loudly)
               Oh, God!

     Vicky reaches blindly for a pillow.  She squeezes it over
     her face, moaning into it.

                         VICKY (cont'd)
               Moly shmmmt!  Fmmkkkk!

     Noticing that Vicky now can't see him, Kevin cautiously
     pulls out The Bible from under the bed.  Sets it next to
     her.  He constantly refers from the book to Vicky, and
     back again.

<b>     INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</b>
     VICKY'S MOM is straining some pasta.  On the fridge, we
     see a collage in tribute to Vicky -- her senior portrait,
     National Honor Society certificate, a report card.

<b>                         VICKY'S MOM
</b>                   (yells to Vicky's Dad)
               Hon?  Can you tell Vick to come on
               down for supper?

     VICKY'S DAD is at the table reading the paper.  He gets
     up with a GRUNT.

     Vicky can barely control herself.  She SCREAMS into the
     pillow.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Vicky, shhh, you know there's no lock
               on your door.

     Vicky's dad is trudging up the stairs.

<b>     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Vicky wrestles with her own ecstacy.  Groans.  Kevin
     keeps referencing The Bible.  Whatever he's doing, it's
     working.

<b>     INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
     Vicky's dad approaches the bedroom door.

<b>     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY

     Vicky is about to explode.  She pulls the pillow off her
     face, gasping.

<b>     INT. VICKY'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

     Vicky's dad reaches for the doorknob.

<b>                         VICKY (O.S.)

</b>
     Jim's door opens...he winces...REVERSE to see Jim's dad
     looking at the family portrait of Jim's family in the
     hallway outside Jim's room, his back turned to Jim's
     door.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Hey, dad.  Did you knock?

     Jim's dad continues to study the picture.  A beat.  Then
     he turns around, like he just realized the door was open.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               Oh, Jim!  I'm looking at the ol'
               family portrait, here.  Yep.  It's a
               good one.

     Jim can only shrugs in response.  He goes into the hall
     and looks at the portrait.  A beat.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)

     Jim's face drops, seeing his death unfold.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)

               Now, you may have tried it in the
               shower, or maybe in bed at night, and
               not even known what you were doing.
               Or perhaps you've heard your friends
               talking about it in the locker room.

     Jim's eyes dart about, looking for a place to hide.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               Sure you know, son, but I think you've
               been having a little problem with it.
               It's okay, though.  What you're doing
               is perfectly normal.  It's like
               practice.  Like when you play tennis
               against a wall.  Some day, there'll be
               a partner returning the ball.
                   (a beat)
               You do want a partner, don't you son?

<b>                         JIM

<b>                         JIM'S DAD
</b>               That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u>
               to play with yourself.  Or, as I
               always called it --

               "Stroke the salami!"
                   (chuckles)
               Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be
               ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and
               I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle
               Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.

     Nauseated and entirely disoriented, Jim tries to stumble
     back into his room.  He SMACKS the doorframe.  Keeps
     going, slamming the door behind him.  A beat.

                         JIM'S DAD (cont'd)
               Poor guy thought he was the only one.

<b>     EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
</b>
     The football field also doubles as the lacrosse field.
     East Great Falls is battling Central.  It's a rough game,
     muddy, brutal.  We see Oz grunting and groaning, playing
     very tough.

     On the sidelines, we see Heather has shown up.  She's
     watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches Oz's
     agility and domination.  Oz runs up the field, cradling
     the ball in his stick.  A couple CENTRAL PLAYERS try to
     check him.  Heather cringes with each impact, and is then
     excited to see Oz dodge his opponents.

     Finally, Oz scores with a triumphant YELL.  Heather
     CHEERS with the crowd as the EGF players congratulate
     each other.

<b>     EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
</b>
     After the game.  Oz sees Heather waiting for him on the
     sidelines.  He's about to run over when COACH MARSHALL
     snags him --

     FOLLOW WITH OZ as he trots over to Heather, covered in
     mud.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Okay.
                   (pause)
               So I had this...thought, and...this
               may seem like it's out of left field,
               and I don't know if you can, but since
               I'm not going with anyone --

     Before she can finish, Stifler runs up, sweaty and
     excited.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Hah!  Central sucks!
                   (noticing Heather)
               Choir Chick?  What the hell are you
               doing here?

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Well, I uh, I was --
                   (decides to stand her ground)
               I was asking Chris to prom.
                   (turns to Oz)
               So do you wanna go?

     Oz is surprised at her directness.  Impressed.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               <u>Yeah</u>!

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for
               the limo.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Stifler, fuck --
                   (noticing Heather, "sensitive")
               ...man, you don't have to be so
               insensitive.

     A beat.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               <u>What</u>??
                   (he dismisses it)
               Whatever -- look uh, don't forget --
               my cottage after prom.  On Lake
               Michigan.

     Stifler joins some other LACROSSE BUDDIES.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the

               really good.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Yeah, me too, okay, cool.

     They share a smile.  Then Heather walks off towards her
     car.  Oz trots off to Stifler and the other lacrosse
     guys.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               My man Oz, working it with the choir

</b>                   (cheering, slapping him)
               Yeah, go Oz! etc.

     Oz laughs, embarrassed.

<b>                         OZ
</b>                   (pandering to them)
               Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig
               those cute little sweaters she wears.

<b>                         STIFLER

               she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies,
               right?

     Stifler goes into what can only be described as the Spank-
     Me-And-Fuck-Me-Like-A-Whore-Dance.

<b>                         STIFLER (CONT'D)
</b>               Yeah!  Sing for me!  yes!

     The other guys LAUGH.  Oz joins in, laughing in spite of
     himself.  They all high-five.

     And from the other side of the field, we see Heather
     peering over at them.  Hardly believing it as Oz joins in
     the laughter.

<b>                         TEACHER
</b>               So once Hal becomes king, he has to
               take on the responsibilities of
               leadership, and turn his back on his
               old, drunken friend, Falstaff.  You
               see, Hal was going through a rite of
               passage, much like you all are.  Make
               the most of the time you've got left
               together.  You'll miss it later.

     Jim, Kevin, and Oz sit in the back of the classroom in
     one corner.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               So does your tongue cramp up?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Wow, that's amazing, she's probably
               gonna want to do it soon.

     Kevin shrugs as the BELL RINGS.  Sherman passes by.

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>               Still questing after the holy grail,
               eh guys?

     He CHUCKLES and exits.  The guys stand up, exiting the
     classroom.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Hey, where's Finch?

<b>                         KEVIN

<b>                         JIM
</b>               I don't get it.  How does a guy like

<b>                         OZ

<b>                         KEVIN

     He taps a passing RANDOM CUTE GIRL on the shoulder.

                         KEVIN (cont'd)
               Excuse me.  Do you know who Paul
               Finch is?

<b>                         RANDOM CUTE GIRL

<b>                         RANDOM CUTE GIRL
</b>               Is it cool?  I heard it was like an
               eagle, blazing in fire and stuff.

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (nods, loving it)
               Actually, it's an eagle and this big
               python.

<b>                         RANDOM CUTE GIRL
</b>               Really?!

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yeah, see it's on his stomach, here,
               and the eagle -- the eagle is actually
               grasping the python in its talons, so
               the snake is like his --

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>                   (interrupting)
               That's good, Jim.

<b>                         RANDOM CUTE GIRL
</b>               Woah, no way!  That guy is so cool!

     She hurries off to tell her friends.  The guys exit the
     classroom.

</b>               I can't, I have no idea how he's doing

               Yeah, I know.  I'm working on it.

     Jim turns around -- to find Nadia is standing right in
     front of him.  Jim says nothing.  Stuck.  Staring.  Oz
     elbows him.  Jim gives a startled GRUNT.

<b>                         NADIA

     Jim looks over to Kevin and Oz, who excitedly give him
     encouraging looks and gestures.

<b>                         JIM (CONT'D)
</b>                   (trying to decipher the guys'

               Yes.  No.  Yes.

<b>                         NADIA
</b>               Perhaps you can help me with my
               studies?

     The guys nod, "Yes!  Yes!"

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Okay...that would be cool sometime.
                   (sees the guys gesticulating)

<b>                         NADIA

               afterwards.  I can change clothes at

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (barely, overwhelmed)
               I suppose that would be okay.

     Nadia walks off.  Jim collapses into Oz's and Kevin's
     arms, like a marathon runner at the end of a race.  They
     pat him heartily in congratulations.

     After school.  Oz is there as Heather pulls up in a new
     Saab.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Nice car.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               I'm glad you think so.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               You don't like it?

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               No, I like the car.
                   (then, direct)
               By the way, though, about prom?  That
               was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited
               you.

     She hastily walks towards the school.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               What?!

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Oh, please.  I asked you because I
               thought you might actually be worth
               going with.  But you are just a jock.
               No wait.  You're a jerk.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               What?  No I'm not.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               I saw you making fun of me with your
               lacrosse buddies.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               I wasn't making fun of you.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Give me a break, you're so full of it.

     She hurries up more, breaking off from Oz, and enters the
     school.  After a moment, he slowly heads in.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LITTLE AUDITORIUM - LATER
</b>
     Oz and Heather are singing with the group, at opposite
     ends of the room.  It's a pop, contemporary arrangement
     of "HOW SWEET IT IS."  It sounds jazzy, cool.

     Oz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him.  He
     sings along, distant.  Heather, almost defiantly, sings
     clearer and better than ever.  Oz watches her, though she
     never looks his way.  At the bride of the song, Heather
     breaks into a solo.  She sings beautifully.  Oz is
     hooked.

     The Choir Teacher halts the song.

<b>                         CHOIR TEACHER
</b>               Okay, Heather, that was good, but I
               want to thicken up that solo.
               Michigan State is this Saturday, and I
               want that part to <u>smoke</u>.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               I know, my timing's off.

<b>                         CHOIR TEACHER
</b>               A little, but I think it'll work
               better as a duet.  With a tenor part.

<b>                         OZ
</b>                   (interrupting)
               I'll do it.

     A beat as the Choir Teacher is impressed and Heather
     looks indifferent.

<b>                         OZ (CONT'D)
</b>               I'll do it.

<b>                         CHOIR TEACHER
</b>               Okay then.  The rest of you okay with
               that?

     The rest of the choir agrees, as Heather looks to Oz with
     skepticism.

<b>                         CHOIR TEACHER (CONT'D)
</b>               Great.  See you tomorrow.

     The group starts packing up.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>                   (annoyed)
               Why are you doing this?

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Because I want to.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way
               through this.  You better practice.

     She leaves.

     She sets her duffel on Jim's bed.

     Jim's Mom and Dad are sitting downstairs.  Jim bolts
     through the room.

<b>                         JIM

     Finch simply waves off the question.  He's glued to the
     screen.

     Jim bursts into the room, breathless.

     Jim grabs a seat by the computer.  All three guys watch,
     transfixed.  Nadia is slipping out of her leotard.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Woah!

     Nadia's leotard is off.  Bra and panties.  Outstanding
     body.

     INTERCUT BETWEEN JIM'S BEDROOM and the guys around the
     computer screen in Kevin's Bedroom.

     Nadia pauses.  Looks in Jim's full-length mirror.
     Admiring her body.

</b>               Oh, man!  This is incredible.

     And...yes!  Nadia peels off her sportsbra.  Supple
     breasts.  The guys are awestruck.

               day.

     Nadia still primps in the mirror.  Then she looks around.
     Very carefully, she pokes through the stuff on Jim's
     night table.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Hey!  You can't touch my stuff!

     Nadia opens the night table.  Stops.  Jim flushes.  Nadia
     delicately reaches into the night table as Jim crumbles.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Oh no no no.

     She pulls out the stack of porno magazines.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Nice collection there, Jim.

     Nadia takes a PENTHOUSE.  Starts thumbing through it.
     She sits on Jim's bed.  Lingering on some pages.  Getting
     aroused.

               Gentlemen, I'd like to make an
               announcement.  There is a gorgeous

     herself.

     Jim stops outside his door, catching his breath.  He can

     Jim stands there, bewildered.  Nadia hasn't noticed him,

     Nadia leans over to Jim's clock radio.  Turns it on.  We
     hear COUNTRY MUSIC.  She flips the dial, and we hear A
     FEW STATIONS FLIP BY.  Then a DRIVING, EURO-TECHNO SONG.

     He struts clumsily back and forth.  Takes his shirt off.
     Swings it in a circle around his head...and lets go of
     it, aiming for the QuickCam, where it lands.

               James.

     Jim nods eagerly.  Concentrates on the music...as we see
     the shirt slide off the camera.  Jim starts writhing to
     the beat.  Like a hyperactive chicken.

     Groping.  They're tangled in each other.  Nadia backs off
     for a moment.  Slowly, teasing, she hooks her thumbs in
     the sides of her panties.  Starts sliding them down.

<b>                         NADIA
</b>               So, "shaved" is the expression?

     CLOSE UP on Jim as his eyes bug out.  Yep, it is, and she
     is.

     Jim is stuck.  Staring at Nadia.  She moves towards him.
     Nadia is inches from his face.

<b>                         NADIA
</b>               Touch me Jim...here.

     Jim is trembling, straining with himself.  A shudder runs
     through him.

     And it's over, again.

     The girls are LAUGHING again.

               I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will

<b>                         JIM
</b>               No!  I've got...reserve reserves!

     Nadia starts getting dressed.  Jim is whimpering.

<b>                         NADIA
</b>               It is too bad.  I was at first hoping
               you would ask me to the prom.  But...

     She gathers her things.  Eyes Jim over.

                         NADIA (cont'd)
               You should change your shorts.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               ...okay.

     Jim is stunned.  Ruined.  Nadia exits.  CLOSE on Jim's
     tormented face as we hear...

<b>                         COMPUTER VOICE

     Jim is walking through the courtyard, a bit dazed.  A
     COUPLE GIRLS pass by him, giggling.  He trudges
     along...noticing a CLIQUE OF GIRLS staring at him as he
     passes by...and Stoner #1 giving him a peace sign...and
     the Computer Nerd staring at him like a celebrity......
     Jim's pace slows.  He hears a SNICKER behind him...he
     slows even more, taking very careful steps...as he sees a
     GIRL doing a really strange dance -- and his eyes pop out
     as he sees that, yes, it's <u>his</u> dance.  He stops.  ALMOST
     EVERYONE is staring at him.  Jim pulls his coat up over
     his face and hurries off into the school, like a fugitive
     avoiding the media.  People APPLAUD and LAUGH.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
     Kevin and Oz catch up to Jim.  Here and there, people
     still give Jim funny looks.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Hey, minuteman.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Shut up.  You're supposed to be
               supportive.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               You've still got a chance with Nadia,
               right?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing
               on the net.  I don't think they liked
               it.

<b>                         KEVIN

<b>                         JIM
</b>               She's already on a plane back home.

     Kevin winces.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               You know, maybe I'm just not good with
               girls, period.  Like I was born
               without that part of the brain.  I
               mean, I can't talk to girls.  And when
               I do talk to them, I screw it up.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Yeah?  Well come prom night, those
               excuses aren't going to do you much
               good.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.

     A nearby OLD JANITOR starts GUFFAWING at Jim as he walks
     by.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
     Jim sits, waiting for class to start.  Miserable.  Some
     students are obviously talking about him in the
     background.  Others study and chat.

     Next to Jim is Michelle -- the reject, band dork that
     we've seen earlier.  She's got a flute case on her desk.
     She's blabbering to Jim.  The kind of blabbering where
     every other sentence sounds like a question, even though
     it isn't.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               And so, one time?  I was at band camp?
               And we weren't supposed to have pillow
               fights?  But we had a pillow fight!
               And it was so much fun!

     Jim couldn't care.

                         MICHELLE (cont'd)
               And one time, we all lost our music?
               And we were supposed to play this
               song?  But we didn't know it.  So we
               just made it up!  And we kept playing
               and playing but the conductor didn't
               know what we were doing and it was so
               funny!

     Jim looks wistfully over at Nadia's empty desk.

                         MICHELLE (cont'd)
               So you're pissed about something, huh?
               You know what I do when I'm angry?  I
               just play some Bach on my flute.  It's
               so relaxing.  I learned to do that at
               band camp.

     Jim perks up the slightest bit.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm
               angry?

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Is it because we have a test tomorrow?
               Sometimes I get cranky when I know I
               have a big test to study for.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yeah, that's pretty much it.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               I thought so.  Because, one time?  I
               was at this --

<b>                         JIM

               What was your name again?

<b>                         MICHELLE

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my
               date for the prom?

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Really?  You seriously want to go with

<b>                         JIM
</b>                   (so forced)
               Yes.  Seriously.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Are we going to Steve Stifler's party
               afterwards?  That would be so cool.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Whatever you want.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun!
               It's like this one time, at band

     Heather is walking down the hall.  She turns to go into
     the Little Auditorium -- and through the window in the
     door she sees Oz.  She stops.

     Oz is singing, working through the solo.  Determined to
     get it right.  He bounces his lacrosse ball off the
     floor, in rhythm, keeping time.  There's one point that
     he keeps getting stuck at and going back over.  Heather
     watches this, softening as she sees that Oz is actually
     putting his heart into it.  Finally he's frustrated --

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Dammit!

     He whips the lacrosse ball at the wall.  Heather recoils,
     still watching, unseen by Oz.  After a moment, Oz cools
     off.  He gets the ball, and diligently starts up again.
     Heather is impressed.

</b>               You're not doing the extra credit

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence
               of random numbers that look like I'm
               doing the extra credit problems.  Mr.
               Bender doesn't bother to check
               homework past April.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               That's my trick!

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               It's everyone's trick, Kevin.
                   (she turns to him)
               But I did pick it up from you.

     She gives him a little kiss on his hand, continuing with
     her work.  Kevin keeps rubbing her back, more serious.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               We've come a long way since
               Homecoming.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>                   (playful)
               Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four-
               point into a three-nine-five.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Indeed I did.  But, our relationship.
               It's progressed a lot.  It's time for
               us to...express ourselves in new ways.

     Vicky stops working and turns, sitting up on the desk,
     facing him.  Her mood has shifted, more romantic.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Like how?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Well, I feel that...things are getting
               to that point in a relationship.
               When two people share...a special
               moment between them.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               I think you're so right, Kevin.

</b>                   (pause)
               You want to do it?

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Yes --

     She takes his hand.  Readies herself, and declares.

<b>                         VICKY (CONT'D)
</b>               I love you.

     Kevin falters.  This is definitely not what he was
     expecting.  He's caught.  Trying to formulate a response.

<b>                         VICKY (CONT'D)
</b>               Kevin?  Do you not love me?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               No, I don't not love you.  I like, I
               know that we've definitely got
               <u>something</u> between us.  Something good.
               Something special.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               But you don't love me.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's
               like a term that gets thrown around.
               People say things, they get married,
               have kids, and then what?  It's like
               they call it off, going "I was wrong."

     A beat.  Vicky seems to know where he's coming from.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two

     Oz is closing up the store.  He looks up to see Heather
     at the door.  Oz goes and opens it, surprised,
     embarrassed.  The air is awkward between them.

<b>                         HEATHER

               gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I
               really have no idea.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Oh thank God, I thought I was the only
               one.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Yeah.  You know, people are always
               like, "What're you gonna major in?"
               And I don't know.  And they're like,
               "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?

<b>                         OZ
</b>               I know.  Salt and pepper?

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Sure.

     Oz cuts the sub in half with a flourish and puts it on a
     tray.

<b>                         HEATHER (CONT'D)
</b>               So we're gonna be close next year?

               ...yeah.

     A beat...a little uncomfortable, but nice.

<b>     EXT. SUBWAY - NIGHT - LATER

     The remains of a couple subs are on a table.  Oz and
     Heather are doing their song...it's rough, but they're
     working through it.  And when they're in sync, they sound
     really good together.  We SLOWLY PULL BACK as they sing
     into the night.

     A GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH talks to Stifler.

<b>                         GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH
</b>               I'm sorry, I really can't go with

<b>                         STIFLER

<b>                         GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH
</b>               I know it's a long shot, but I figure
               Paul Finch might ask me.

<b>                         STIFLER

               okay...I mean you can't even tell...

     Flustered, she heads down the stairs.  Stifler, entirely
     confused, heads off into the second floor.  As the Girl
     Holding Out For Finch descends, Kevin catches up with
     her.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Hey...what was that all about?

<b>                         GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH
</b>               He's still embarrassed because Finch
               kicked his ass.  Knocked out a tooth,
               but you can't see it.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Right, and who told you that?

     Kevin is talking to SOME CHICK.  Taking notes.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - OUTDOOR MURAL - DAY
</b>
     Kevin is talking to YET ANOTHER GIRL.  We see that his
     notepad is a spiderweb of girl's names, all interlinked
     with arrows.  They all point to one girl's name in the
     center of the page -- Jessica.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY

     Kevin follows Jessica down the cafeteria line.

<b>                         JESSICA

               I've never seen someone's image change

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Thanks.  It was my idea.

<b>                         KEVIN

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Then what the hell are you talking
               about?

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Well...I guess it's okay for me to
               tell you now.  That reputation of his
               isn't going anywhere.
                   (then)
               Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica,
               I need help with this, blah blah,
               etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two-
               hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple
               girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So
               he did, and I did.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I don't get it, that really works?

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I
               embellished a little bit.  Hey, did
               you hear that Finch had sex with an
               older woman?

     Kevin is speechless.

<b>                         JESSICA (CONT'D)
</b>               No?  Damn, that one was my favorite.

     Toweled guys exit the steamy showers, doing a macho GREAT

     the showers, to hear --

</b>                   (singing happily)
               ...I needed the shelter of someone's
               arms...there you were -- woo-hoo-
               hoo...

     He exits in a towel and goes to his locker, next to
     Stifler.

<b>                         OZ (CONT'D)

     Stifler is staring at Oz, horrified.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Oh my fucking God.  You're gay.

               along.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               No thanks, you've been singing that

               this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't
               know you.

     Oz stops.

<b>                         OZ

<b>                         STIFLER

<b>     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD, A BENCH - LATER

     Heather is studying outside.  Oz stands before her,
     breathless, his hair still wet.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's

               And you know, Central almost beat us
               last time, so I really want to kick
               their ass, and it's like cool because
               we're gonna get to play at State,
               which means that after the game I

               You can't sing at the competition.

                   (a beat)
               So I guess...I'll see you later.

     An uncomfortable moment.  Oz walks off.  Heather looks
     let down.

<b>     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - ENTRANCE TO SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY

     Kevin is at his locker, getting ready for class.  Stifler
     comes running up with a wicked grin on his face.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Kevin!  You seen Shitbreak lately?

<b>                         KEVIN

               Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Me?  Nothing.  I'm the one whose ass
               he kicked.
                   (off Kevin's look)
               I'll tell you one thing, though.  I
               don't think he's gonna have a problem
               shitting in school anymore.

     Stifler pulls out an empty bottle of PRESCRIPTION
     LAXATIVE, maniacally LAUGHING.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY
</b>
     Finch is sitting at a table, reading his paper.  Kevin
     comes tearing around the corner and runs up to him.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Easy, tiger.  What's in there?

<b>                         KEVIN

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Charming.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some
               sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino
               or whatever.  It's fast acting.  I
               mean <u>really</u> fast.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               First of all, it's <u>Mocha</u>ccino, and
               secondly...Oohhhh!

     Finch jumps up and sprints down the hallway.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - CONTINUING
</b>
     We FOLLOW with Finch.  We see Stifler down the hall,
     holding open the bathroom door like a pleasant doorman.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               This way, sit.

     Finch darts into the bathroom.  Stifler LAUGHS
     hysterically.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
     Finch leaps into a stall and slams the door behind him.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY
</b>
     Finch has stopped.  He's staring down at the toilet.  It
     looks entirely uninviting.  But he's straining,
     struggling, starting to dance around, moaning as he
     cramps up.

     He grabs a length of toilet paper and lines the seat with
     it.  Then another, and another.  Sweat drips off his
     forehead.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Come on come on come on...

     He's got the seat lined with at least three layers of
     toilet paper.  Notices a spot where there's still bare
     toilet seat.  He tears off one square of toilet paper,
     placing it on the spot.  He steps back and looks it over,
     still wriggling to contain his bowels.

<b>                         FINCH (CONT'D)
</b>               Okay.  You can do this.

     He unbuckles his pants.  Sits down -- just as we hear
     someone enter the bathroom.  Finch, still restraining,
     listens for a moment...only to hear the CLICK-CLICK-CLICK
     of heels.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY
</b>
     The bathroom door swings closed to reveal the universal
     symbol for "Women."  Stifler is there, LAUGHING even
     harder.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY
</b>
     Finch is terrified.  Through the crack between the stall
     door and the frame, Finch catches glimpses of bright
     colored skirts and dresses.  He grits his teeth,
     straining.

     And a GURGLE comes from Finch's stomach.  His eyes bulge.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
     A GROUP OF GIRLS is at the mirror, including the Girl
     Holding Out for Finch, fixing their hair.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

     Finch is in hell.  Desperately trying not to shit.
     Holding it in for all he's worth.

<b>                         GIRL #2

</b>               Of course, it was Stifler's mom.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY
</b>
     Pure agony.  Finch is sweating badly.  Every muscle in
     his body is tensed.  Tears stream from his fiercely shut
     eyes.

     A gastric RUMBLING.  Finch's eyes flash open in terror.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
     We hear another, deeper RUMBLING.  Girl #2 turns to her
     friend in surprise.

</b>               Joanie, was that you?

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM STALL - DAY

     Finch is struggling.  Rocking back and forth.  But it's
     no use.  He's at his limit.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Aaaaaaarrrgghhhh!

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY
</b>
     The girls at the mirror freeze -- and we hear what can
     only be the SOUND OF DIARRHEA exploding into a toilet
     bowl.

     The girls run out SCREAMING and LAUGHING.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - BATHROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER
</b>
     Finch exits the stall with trepidation, pulling up his
     pants.  Slowly, slinking, he approaches the door.  Grabs
     the handle.  Composes himself.  And like nothing ever
     happened, he opens it.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - MAIN HALL - DAY
</b>
     Finch comes out of the bathroom.  Stops.  His eyes
     register complete disbelief.

     A SEMI-CIRCLE OF GIRLS, including the ones we have seen
     gossiping about him, has crowded around the door.  All
     staring at him with complete repugnance, open-mouthed.

<b>     INT. BACKSTAGE (MSU) - DAY

     Heather and the rest of the vocal jazz group are behind
     the curtain.

     They all wear flashy, borderline cool outfits.  Heather
     looks worried, lost.  Looking to the door, as if Oz might
     come running in.

<b>                         VOCAL JAZZ TEACHER
</b>               Okay.  Albert, you ready?

     ALBERT steps next to Heather.  He's kind of funny-
     looking, with an overly-suave attitude that comes off as
     plain weird.

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>               No problemo.

     He SINGS a couple lines.  Way too melodramatic and
     cheesy.  Heather looks trapped.

<b>     EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY
</b>
     A scoreboard shows that East is leading by five goals.
     Oz is running up the field, towards the goal, cradling
     the ball in his stick.  He seems to have a good lead.
     Suddenly he is tumbling, falling, losing the ball.
     Someone has checked him.  He lays stunned on the ground,
     as Stifler recovers the ball and scores.

     The players run back to the sidelines to reset for the
     face-off, and gather around the coach.

<b>                         COACH MARSHALL
</b>               Alright!  Good hustle, guys, but we
               can still lose.  You all saw what

               ever want to see you guys <u>thinking</u>
               you're gonna score.  You don't score
               until you score, period.

     The team is getting into it.  Shouts of "Hell yeah!"  But
     Oz's got a quizzical look on his face.

     Heather waits with the group to go onstage.  Albert paces
     like a Shakespearean actor, psyching himself.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               That would be a start.

<b>     EXT. LACROSSE FIELD (MSU) - DAY
</b>
     Oz shows some emotion peeking through.  Confused.

<b>                         COACH MARSHALL
</b>               It all boils down to today.  For you
               seniors, this marks the culmination of
               your past four years.  Think of what
               that means to you.  Are you guys gonna
               look back on your days at East and
               know that you made the most of the
               time you had?

     A wave of realization washes over Oz.  He stands up tall.

                         COACH MARSHALL (cont'd)
               Now that's the attitude, Ostreicher!

     Oz collects himself.  Takes a deep breath.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Good luck, guys.

     he sets his lacrosse stick down and starts to leave.

<b>                         COACH MARSHALL
</b>               Christ!  I didn't say you were out of
               the game!

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Sorry, coach.

<b>                         COACH MARSHALL
</b>               What the fuck is this?  You got
               someplace more important to be?

     Coach Marshall is fuming.  The entire team is staring at
     Oz.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Yeah.

     He runs off.

<b>     ANGLE ON JIM AND KEVIN IN THE STANDS
</b>
     A beat of confusion.  Then they stand up.

<b>     EXT. MSU CAMPUS - DAY
</b>
     Oz runs through a gate.

<b>     INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY
</b>
     The vocal jazz group is on their feet, lined up, waiting
     to go onstage.  Oz bursts into the room, still in his
     lacrosse gear.

<b>                         VOCAL JAZZ GUYS
</b>               Oz -- You're back -- Yeah --

<b>                         ALBERT
</b>               -- Oh, great.

     Oz rushes up to Heather.  She's happy but confused.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               What about the game?!

<b>                         OZ
</b>               I'm not playing.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               You're missing the game for us?!

<b>                         OZ
</b>               No.  I'm missing the game for you.

     Heather melts.  Oz pulls her close.  And they kiss.

<b>                         VOCAL JAZZ TEACHER
</b>               Okay, okay.  You guys got about a
               minute to go.  Spend it warming up,
               not making out.  This ain't the prom
               yet.

     Oz and Heather share a smile.

<b>     INT. MUSIC HALL STAGE - DAY
</b>
     The vocal jazz group is belting their hearts out, singing
     "How Sweet It Is."  Oz sings with them now in his vocal
     jazz outfit...we TILT DOWN to see he's still wearing his
     cleats.  He and Heather sound great, backed by the vocal
     jazz group.  They sail through their duet, join hands,
     and finish perfectly.  The audience APPLAUDS with
     enthusiasm -- and we Kevin and Jim, WHOOPING AND
     CLAPPING, loving it, like they're at a rock concert.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>                   (gives that "You rock!" hand
                    sign)
               You fuckin' rule!

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS - CLASSROOM - DAY
</b>
     Class has just ended, students are filing out of the
     classroom.  A teacher grades papers in the back of the
     room, routinely writing "A, A-, A, A-" on each paper.
     Vicky is studying a pull-down map hanging over the
     chalkboard.  Kevin comes up next to her.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Hey...

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Did you know that it's...450 miles
               from Ann Arbor to Nashville?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               It's like a six or seven hour drive.
               That's easy, I don't mind driving.

     A beat.  Kevin looks back over his shoulder to the
     inattentive teacher.  Moves closer to Vicky.

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>               About the other day...I've been
               thinking.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               So have I.  And I know you want to
               make things perfect for me.  And I
               understand that you really wouldn't
               tell me that until you were 100%
               comfortable with it.

     Vicky looks over to the teacher, who COUGHS.  She steps
     closer.  Kevin, somewhat nervous, takes the bottom of the
     map, fidgeting with it a little.

<b>                         VICKY (CONT'D)
</b>               And I want to make things perfect for
               you.  You're right, Kev, we do have
               something good...and special.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Yeah, we have something great, Vick.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Kevin...
                   (very close, whispered)
               I want to have sex with you.

     The map goes FLAPPING upwards.  The teacher looks up.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>                   (almost frightened)
               Now?!

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               No...I know the perfect time...

     She looks to the calendar on the wall...and taps next
     Saturday -- "Prom."  Kevin can't believe it...MUSIC UP
     for PRE-PROM MONTAGE --

<b>     INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY
</b>
     Jim is trying on a tux.  he shrugs, like it fits well
     enough.

     He turns to see Oz trying on his -- Oz is fidgeting,
     trying on different ties, vests, shoes, very sincere and
     focused.

<b>     INT. VICKY'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Vicky is trying on a rather elegant dress, looking to
     Jessica for support, showing it off.  Jessica jokingly
     does the same, showing off her shorts and T-shirt, as if
     she could care.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY
</b>
     Finch sits alone.  Not like alone.  More like Forrest
     Gump.

<b>     INT. TUXEDO LAND - DAY
</b>
     Jim is paying for his tux.  We see Oz trying to decide on
     a cumberbund.  There are about ten of them scattered
     around him that he's already tried.  In the background,
     an ATTENDANT looks impatient.

<b>     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY
</b>
     Finch still sits.  His head is cocked at a different
     angle.

<b>     INT. JIM'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</b>
     Jim's dad fixes Jim's bow tie.

<b>     INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (END MONTAGE)
</b>
     Kevin is in his tux.  He's staring at himself in the
     mirror.

<b>     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT
</b>
     The parking lot is full.  VARIOUS FORMALLY DRESSED
     STUDENTS make their way into the school.  One group piles
     out of a stretch limo.  We see a STEALTHY STUDENT slip a
     bottle of liquor into his tux.  A FLUSTERED GUY struggles
     to re-attach his date's corsage.

     This is the prom.

<b>     INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GYM - NIGHT
</b>
     The gym is decorated in a clashingly festive manner.
     Like a combination of Mardi Gras, New Year's Eve, and
     somebody's bar mitzvah.  A CRAPPY BAND plays CRAPPY
<b>     IMITATION ROCK MUSIC.
</b>
     Most students mill about, talking, generally bored.  The
     only people who are enjoying themselves are the OBVIOUSLY
     DRUNK STUDENTS, slam-dancing with the obviously drunk
     Stifler in a corner.  CHAPERONE PARENTS try to calm them
     down, futilely.

     The band breaks into a CHEESY BALLAD.  Couples lock
     together and sway back and forth like zombies.

<b>     ANGLE ON JIM AND MICHELLE
</b>
     They're dancing at arm's length.  Jim is not enthused.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               You know, at band camp?  We have
               dances like this.  Only they're way
               funner.  Don't you think prom is just
               highly overrated?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Highly, highly overrated.

<b>     ANGLE ON KEVIN AND VICKY
</b>
     They dance.  Both looking a little nervous.  Anxious.

<b>     ANGLE ON OZ AND HEATHER
</b>
     Dancing much slower than anyone else.  Tight embrace.
     Heather's got her head on his shoulder, eyes closed.

     Kevin, Oz, Jim, and Finch are hanging out.  Finch is
     drunk.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Okay.  I'm here for your dumb...dumb

     Sherman passes by.

<b>                         SHERMAN
</b>               I'm on the offensive, boys.  The
               Sherman Tank is going back in.

     The guys are impassive.  Sherman indicates the Central
     Girl nearby.

<b>                         SHERMAN (CONT'D)
</b>               Locked on target, flying in stealth
               mode under enemy sex radar.  Ready to
               drop the payload...<u>again</u>.

     Sherman confidently walks off.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Alright, how do you guys stand?  Well,
               Finch, I know where you are, but you
               can't use that as an excuse.  Jim?

<b>                         JIM
</b>               My date's a flute-toting band dork.
               That answer your question?

<b>                         KEVIN

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Attitude?  Me?  I think that <u>you</u> guys
               should be more enthusiastic.  Shit,
               we've been trying to get laid forever,
               and tonight's the night we've been
               waiting for.  We're in this together.
               Don't back out on me now!

<b>                         JIM

               laid.  You afraid or something?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               No, but come on guys, we made a pact!

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Kevin, it was just a --

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               <u>It was a pact</u>.  You break it and there

               I don't have to do shit!  Forget it
               already!

     Kevin is taken aback.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               I'm tired of all this bullshit
               pressure!  I mean, I've never even had
               sex and already I can't stand it!  I
               hate sex!  I don't want it, I've never
               wanted it, and I'm not gonna sit here
               busting my balls over something that
               just isn't that damn important!  So
               fuck this stupid pact, fuck <u>you</u>, and
               fuck sex!  Now, I'm gonna go hang out
               with that geek over there, 'cause at
               least she's got something else to talk
               about besides sex!  God damn!

     Kevin storms off.  A beat.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               At least I learned how to shit in
               school.

     Jessica approaches.  She's dressed well, but not
     lavishly.

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               Hey, Finch.  Wanna dance?

     Finch looks to the guys.  They shrug.  We FOLLOW WITH
     Jessica and Finch as they dance out onto the floor.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               How come you have no date?

<b>                         JESSICA
</b>               I like to keep my options open.  And
               let me just clarify that you have no

</b>               So, I guess you and Sherman are pretty
               close.  You met at that party a while
               back?

<b>                         CENTRAL GIRL
</b>               Yeah, we were up the whole night
               together.  We had one of those
               amazingly deep conversations, where
               you really feel like you get to know
               someone.

<b>                         VICKY

     The Central Girl has taken over the band's microphone.

<b>                         CENTRAL GIRL
</b>               Excuse me, everyone, sorry to
               interrupt.

     Her voice reverberates throughout the gym.  A couple WOLF-
<b>     WHISTLES.
</b>
                         CENTRAL GIRL (cont'd)
               I just wanted to let you all know
               this:  Chuck Sherman is a liar.  I
               never had sex with him.  He's never
               had sex with anyone -- I know because
               he told me.  Once, he tried to screw a
               grapefruit, but that's it.  Oh, and he
               also told me that sometimes when he
               gets nervous he wets his pants.  Thank
               you for your attention.

     Girls around the gym CHEER and APPLAUD.

     Pissing his pants.

<b>     ANGLE ON JIM

     Shocked.  He looks back to Oz, who shares his expression.

<b>     EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - NIGHT

     Kevin still sits there.  Jim, Oz, and Finch come out of
     the school.  Slowly they walk up to Kevin.

<b>                         OZ

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I'm not going.

     A beat as the guys don't know what to say.  Kevin's
     speech is halting, downbeat.

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>               This isn't how I wanted things to turn
               out.  Making the pact wasn't just
               about getting laid.  It was about
               doing one last thing with you guys
               before we graduated.  But now I've
               just wasted my last few weeks here
               trying to do what?  I don't even know.
               All I managed to do was fuck up our
               friendship.

     A beat.  Oz shrugs.

<b>                         OZ

<b>                         JIM
</b>               So do I, Kev.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Me too.  For the most part.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I
               don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm
               acting like I've got it all together
               tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna
               ask me if I love her.  And I don't
               know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's
               like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the
               whole thing.

<b>                         JIM

               We're finally going to a post-prom
               party on the lake.  We've been waiting
               to do this for the last four years.
               Why else are we still friends with
               Stifler?  You gotta go.

     A beat as Kevin ponders this.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               And by the way, Sherman didn't even
               get laid.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               He didn't?

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Nope.  He pissed himself.

     The guys LAUGH as Kevin is puzzled.  THEY are suddenly
     illuminated by the glare of headlights.  A charter bus
     pulls in front of the school.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               There it is.  I want to grab my bag.
               Oh, and my date.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Come on, Kevin.  Vicky's looking for
               you.

     Jim holds out a helping hand.  Kevin looks at it.  Grabs
     it, and Jim pulls him up.

<b>     EXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
</b>
     A beautiful cottage on the shore of Lake Michigan.
     Students are filing out of the charter bus.

     Jim and Michelle are walking up to the cottage.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               It reminds me of this one time --
                   (changing thoughts)
               Hey, can I ask you a question?  How
               come you don't have any stories?  I've
               got lots of stories, and you don't
               have any.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Oh, I've got stories, believe me.
               They're a little more risque than
               tales of Band Camp.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Are they gross or something, like guy
               stuff?  Tell me.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Okay.  You want a story?  Here's a
               story.  Stifler finds this beer,
               right?  And...

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM
</b>
     Kevin leads Vicky into the bedroom.  A large bay window
     overlooks moonlit Lake Michigan.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               See -- this is the nicest room.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Wow, Kev...it's perfect.

     Vicky opens a closet -- to find Stifler's Little Brother
     inside, grinning.

<b>                         STIFLER'S BROTHER
</b>               You guys are gonna fuck, aren't you!?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               No!  Get out of here!

<b>                         STIFLER'S BROTHER
</b>                   (running out of the room)
               Fuckers fuckers fuckers fuckers!

     Stiflers brother is gone.  They LAUGH...and Vicky closes
     the door.

<b>     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</b>
     Oz and Heather are walking down the beach.  Holding
     hands.  Deep in the background, we see kids partying.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               There's something I've been meaning to
               tell you, Heather.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               What's that?

<b>                         OZ
</b>               It's gonna sound really bad, but I
               want you to know.

     She nods.  They stop walking.  Oz swipes his feet around
     in the sand.

                         OZ (cont'd)
               See, uh, I'm a virgin.  And me, Kevin,
               Jim, and Finch, we all made this pact.
               That we would...lose our virginity...
               before high school was over.

     Heather is listening.

                         OZ (cont'd)
               And, see, tonight is supposed to be
               the night we all do it.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               This isn't the best way to proposition
               me.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               No, that's not what I mean.  I mean --
               look.  You know what made me leave
               that game?  Coach was giving this
               speech, about not slacking off when
               you see the opportunity to score.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               This isn't any better, Chris.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               No, see Heather, what I realized is
               that...with you, it's not like I'm
               running towards the goal, trying to
               figure out the best way to score.  And
               this may sound corny, but --

     He takes her hand.

                         OZ (cont'd)
               I feel like I've already won.

     Heather softens, taken off guard.

                         OZ (cont'd)
               And, well, I really care about you.  A
               lot.  And I want you to know that.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Oz, it's okay, I know.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               You called me Oz.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Well, that's what your friends call
               you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of
               your friends now...and also...your
               girlfriend.

     Oz seems truly touched.

<b>                         OZ
</b>               Dieter.  My middle name is Dieter.

     Heather nods, and speaks pensively.

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Hmm.  You know that's
                   (cracking up)
               really a shitty middle name!

<b>                         OZ
</b>                   (laughing)
               I know, it sucks!

     Through their laughter, they kiss.  After a moment, it
     grows more passionate.  Lost in each other.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
     The party rages in the rest of the cottage, but the
     basement is empty.  STIFLER'S MOM sits in the corner,
     smoking a cigarette.  She's as attractive as her photo we
     once saw, but the divorce has replaced her sexy smile
     with a bitter smirk.

     Finch stumbles in.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for
               letting us have a great party.

<b>                         STIFLER'S MOM
</b>                   (dry)
               As if there were any alternative
               in the matter.  Are you enjoying
               yourself?

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!

<b>                         STIFLER'S MOM
</b>                   (deadpan)
               I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge
               off, doesn't it?  And where might your
               date be?

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.

<b>                         STIFLER'S MOM
</b>               Pardon me?

     Finch pauses a moment.  He's got an idea.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               ...Nevermind.  You have anything to
               drink?

<b>                         STIFLER'S MOM
</b>               I believe the kegs are upstairs.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               No, no, that's what the cretins drink.
               I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.

     She considers him as she drags off her cigarette.

<b>                         STIFLER'S MOM
</b>               All right, I got some scotch.

<b>                         FINCH
</b>               Single malt?

<b>                         STIFLER'S MOM
</b>               Aged eighteen years.
                   (she gives him a look)
               Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind
               the bar.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - PARTY ROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     It's a great party.  Stifler is with a group of guys
     drinking a beer, which he inspects very carefully before
     every sip.

<b>     ANGLE ON JIM AND MICHELLE
</b>
     Both drinking and talking, almost enjoying themselves.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               That is a <u>nasty</u> story!

<b>                         JIM
</b>               I told you.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               You wanna hear a nasty story of mine?
               It's kind of sexual.

     Ding!  A light goes off in Jim's head.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Yeah, bring it on!

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Well, this one time?  At band camp?
               We were playing this game, I don't
               know if you know it?  But it's called
               spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss
               this guy named Marc Wander on the
               lips?  And...

     Jim's expression sinks.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     The lights are down.  Vicky and Kevin are in bed.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               You comfortable?

<b>                         VICKY

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Yeah.

     A beat.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               You sure you're comfortable?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Yeah.  Are you sure?

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Yeah.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Me too.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Okay.
                   (a beat)
               Did you bring a condom?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Yeah, right here.

     He pulls out a condom.  A beat as they contemplate it.

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>               So, do you want to be -- I mean, how
               do you want to do it?

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               I don't know.  How do you?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Like, normal style.  The...missionary
               position.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Okay.

     A moment as they realize there's nothing left to do, but -

                         VICKY (cont'd)
               Kevin...

<b>                         KEVIN

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               I want to hear you say it.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Okay.

     Kevin swallows hard.  And says --

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>               Victoria...I love you.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               I love you.

     They both take a deep breath.

<b>     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</b>
     Oz and Heather lay in a secluded spot in the dunes,
     surrounded by tall beach grass that swishes in the spring
     breeze.  Stars and a lustrous moon above.

     The silence speaks.  We can see it in their eyes.
     Yearning.

<b>                         OZ

<b>                         HEATHER
</b>               Then don't.

     They kiss.  It's time.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     A brief moment of uncertainty.  Kevin shifts around a
     bit, trying to position himself.  Vicky's hand goes under
     the sheets.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Here.

     We know what she's doing.  They both maintain eye
     contact...

<b>     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</b>
     Heather and Oz are re-inventing the idea of passion.
     Discovering love.  This is the stuff that you thought
     only existed in romance novels.  Seriously.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - PARTY ROOM - NIGHT

     Jim is trying to stay interested in Michelle's drivel.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               So, the end of the story is...you had
               to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And
               everyone laughed at me, but I didn't
               care?  Because it was so funny!

<b>                         JIM

               Okay, I get it.

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Oh!  And then this one time?  At band
               camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.

     Jim CHOKES on his beer.  Michelle considers her
     revelation no big deal, watching with some amusement as
     Jim struggles to recover.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               ...excuse me?!

               get myself off?  Hell, that's what
               half of band camp is!  Sex ed!

     Jim is ga-ga.  He watches in disbelief as she lets her
     hair down.  And wouldn't you know it, she's pretty cute.

                         MICHELLE (cont'd)
               So are we gonna screw soon?  I'm
               getting kind of antsy.

     Jim pauses in disbelief.  Then --

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

     Michelle and Jim burst in and slam the door.  A toy
     basketball hoop falls off the back of the door.  They are
     standing in a cluttered, toy-strewn, pit of a kid's room.
     One of those stupid plastic airplanes on a string hangs
     from the ceiling, flying in circles.

<b>                         JIM

<b>                         MICHELLE
</b>               Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them
               both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't
               want you coming so damn early.

<b>                         JIM

     Kevin and Vicky.  Silently doing it.  Curious looks on
     their faces.  The look you get when your waiter delivers
     your food in a fancy restaurant, and you look at the
     creation on the plate, and secretly you're not sure if
     it's really what you ordered.  But you don't say
     anything, and you just eat it.

     -- A piggy bank gets knocked over and shatters.

     -- An x-wing fighter flies across the room.

     -- A pillow explodes in a cloud of feathers.

     -- One of the legs on the bed breaks.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - OUTSIDE BASEMENT DOOR - NIGHT
</b>
     The Basement door is closed.  We hear from the inside...

<b>                         STIFLER'S MOM (O.S.)
</b>               I had no idea you'd be this good!

<b>                         FINCH (O.S.)
</b>               Neither did I!

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Jim and Michelle going at it.  Again, we HEAR but can't
     see them.  The room is more trashed than before.  And as
     we PAN across the disaster area they've created --

<b>                         JIM (O.S.)
</b>               Are you gonna do what I think you're
               gonna do?

<b>                         MICHELLE (O.S.)
</b>               Don't you want me to?

<b>                         JIM (O.S.)
</b>               Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!

<b>                         MICHELLE (O.S.)
</b>               Okay!

     We see her...on top of Jim.  She clears her throat.  And
     then we see her raise a children's plastic recorder to
     her lips -- and she whistles THE MICHIGAN FIGHT SONG.  On
     cue, Jim chimes in --

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Hail, hail, to Michigan, the leaders
               and best!

<b>     EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
</b>
     Oz could be coming.  Heather could be coming.  But it's
     all so darn passionate that the whole thing looks like
     one big orgasm anyway.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</b>
     Jim and Michelle lay on the floor, tangled in sheets and
     each others' clothing.  Exhausted, gasping.

     And then we see the closet door is open, just a crack.
     It swings open.  Standing there is Stifler's Little
     Brother.  Jaw hanging.

<b>                         STIFLER'S BROTHER
</b>               That was <u>awesome</u>!

     Jim and Michelle are stunned.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
</b>
     Finch and Stifler's Mom are just off-camera.  We can't
     see it, but we can tell Finch's status from his ORGASMIC
<b>     MOANING.
</b>
     What we <u>do</u> see is the kitchen door handle rattling.  The
     chair falling out of place.  And the door opening as
     Stifler walks in.  He stops, horrified.

<b>                         STIFLER
</b>               Ugh...oh no...

     He looks like he's going to barf.  Instead, he passes
     out.

<b>     EXT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - SUNRISE - ESTABLISHING
</b>
     The sun rises over Lake Michigan.  A brand new day.
     Various students are passed out here and there.

<b>     EXT. BEACH - DAY
</b>
     Oz holds Heather in his arms.  Completely peaceful.
     SEAGULLS CALL to each other.  WAVES BREAK on the shore.

     Oz has lost all pretense.  Smiling to himself, or maybe
     to the world.

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - STIFLER'S BROTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Jim wakes up in bed, alone.  He looks around.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               She's gone.

     He considers this.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Oh my God.  She used me.

     He considers this further.  Smiles.

                         JIM (cont'd)
               Wow!  I was used!  Cool!

     He jumps up and does a little dance, SINGING...

<b>                         JIM (CONT'D)
</b>               Hail! to the victors, valiant; Hail!
               to the conquering heroes, hail...

<b>     INT. STIFLER'S COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY
</b>
     Kevin and Vicky lie next to each other in bed, staring at
     the ceiling.  Though they're trying to conceal it, we can
     see a bit of dissatisfaction, uncertainty, peeking
     through.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               That was a great night.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Yeah.

     A beat.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               I can't believe we just had our senior
               prom.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Yeah, the time went by so fast.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               It did.

     Another beat.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Kevin, next year...with you in Ann
               Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not
               gonna work, is it.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               Don't say that, we can do it somehow.
               It might not be perfect, but --

<b>                         VICKY
</b>                   (interrupting)
               No, Kevin --
                   (she sits up)
               That's the whole thing, that's what
               I've been realizing.  That nothing's
               perfect, that you can't plan
               everything.

     Kevin thinks this over.

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               It is far away...and we'll be on our
               own...meeting new people...

     A moment as they think this over.

<b>                         KEVIN (CONT'D)
</b>               Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               I know.
                   (a beat)
               Let's go.  Don't you have something to
               tell your friends?

<b>                         KEVIN
</b>               What?

<b>                         VICKY
</b>               Your little pact.  Jessica told me all
               about it.
                   (hits him lightly)
               Way to go, Kev!

     Kevin gives an embarrassed smile.

               Of course, I have no frame of

<b>                         KEVIN'S BROTHER (V.O.)

     Kevin arrives in the back of the library.  Kneels down to
     put the bible back.

<b>                         KEVIN (V.O.)
</b>               Um...I'm sort of wondering

     We hear Kevin's Brother CHUCKLE knowingly.

</b>               That's the next book, Kevin.  That's
               the next book.

     He puts the bible back without the reverence he once had
     for it.  Stands up with some new confidence.  We FOLLOW
     WITH HIM as he walks out of the library...and enters the
     courtyard, crowded with students.  He disappears into

               Son.  That's the best damn story I

     Jim beams proudly.

<b>                         JIM'S DAD (CONT'D)

               school, my parents let me do some
               traveling...

<b>     INT. A HOTEL HALLWAY
</b>
<b>     SUPER:  "PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC"
</b>
     A WAITER ascends a beautiful, red-carpeted staircase,
     carrying a tray with bottle of champagne and a rose.  He
     arrives in front of a hotel door.  KNOCKS.  A BELLBOY
     passes by, noticing the waiter.  And HE SPEAKS TO HIM IN
<b>     AUTHENTIC, THICK CZECH.
</b>
<b>                         BELLBOY
</b>                   (subtitled)
               Another bottle?

<b>                         WAITER
</b>                   (subtitled)
               He knows how to treat a woman.

     The door opens -- to reveal Jim, sweaty but not the least
     bit tired, tying on a robe.

<b>                         JIM
</b>               Thanks guys.

     A pair of arms wraps around him from behind.  And --
     Nadia peeks her head over Jim's shoulder.

<b>                         NADIA
</b>               Come back to bed, James.

     Jim smiles to the guys and takes the tray, as Nadia pulls
     him back in and closes the door.

<b>                         WAITER
</b>                   (subtitled)
               That is one lucky man.

<b>                         BELLBOY

               Funny -- I swear I have seen those two
               somewhere before.  The boy is some
