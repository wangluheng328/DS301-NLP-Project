A gang of thieves carry out an armed robbery on a diamond warehouse.
The police are after them so quickly that they suspect they have a rat in their company.
This film starts right before the robbery, with flashbacks to before the robbery and to the planning of the crime.
We are also introduced to the main characters in flashback mode.
Plenty of fast action and plenty of blood and gore.
