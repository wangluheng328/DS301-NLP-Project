Mel Gibson is a New York taxi driver, who has a strange habit.
He makes complicated scenarios of conspiracies and publishes them in a newsletter sent out to five recipients.
He keeps doing that, until something unbelievable happens: One of his "conspiracy theories" turns out to be real, and so he finds himself chased by the man hiding behind the whole thing.
