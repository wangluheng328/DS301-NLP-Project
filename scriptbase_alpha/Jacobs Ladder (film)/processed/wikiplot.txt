The story begins on October 6, 1971, when Jacob Singer is a soldier with the 1st Air Cavalry Division, deployed in a village in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War.
Suddenly, his unit comes under heavy fire from the treeline and many of Jacob's comrades are killed or wounded.
Soldiers around also begin to exhibit very abnormal behavior, some even going catatonic or collapsing into bloody seizures.
Horrified, Jacob attempts to flee into the jungle, only to be stabbed in the stomach with a bayonet by an unseen attacker.

In 1975, Jacob wakes up in the New York City Subway, dressed as a postal worker and with a copy of The Stranger in his hands.
After Jacob finds himself locked in the underground he tries to escape via the tracks, where he is nearly hit by a train.
The film then shifts back and forth between Jacob's chaotic memories of Vietnam, as well as memories of his late son Gabe (who was hit by a car and killed prior to the war) and ex-wife Sarah, to his present life as a mailman living in Brooklyn with a postal clerk named Jezzie (an abbreviation of Jezebel).
He experiences grotesque hallucinations, apparently suffering from a severe case of posttraumatic stress disorder, and faces more direct threats to his life.
