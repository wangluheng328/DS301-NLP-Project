The Creed family has moved to a nice little community, but shortly after the move, their son is killed.
Grief-stricken, the father fins out that there is a cemetery where you can bury your loved ones, and they can come back to life.
He takes his son to this place, and he is brought back.
It seems all is well again, until the son kills a person.
That is where the father learns , "Not everything that comes back is the same."
Now, he has to find a way to stop his son before he kills the whole town.
