<b>                         WILD THINGS: DIAMONDS IN THE ROUGH
</b>

                                     Written by


                              Andy Hurst &amp; Ross Helford
<b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          INT. MUSEUM - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          A perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless DIAMONDS,
          glinting in the morning sun.
<b>          
</b>          Tounted on crushed velvet, the identical diamonds are on a glass
          covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast, marble MUSEUM HALL.
<b>          
</b>          The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the
          breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them. MARIE
          CLIFFORD's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the
          cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds...
<b>          
</b>          She reaches out tentatively towards the glass case. Not to touch
          the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted
          in the case below the priceless jewels. It's of a MOTHER cradling
          her BABY DAUGHTER...
<b>          
</b><b>                              MARIE
</b>                    Today's the day, Mom...
<b>          
</b><b>                              CURATOR (O.S.)
</b>                    You here again, Marie?
<b>          
</b>          Marie spins round, sees the bespectacled CURATOR, 60's, standing
          behind her.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MARIE
</b>                    Just leaving.
<b>          
</b>          Marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case...
<b>          
</b><b>          'THE MOTHER DAUGHTER DIAMONDS...'
</b><b>          
</b><b>          EXT. MUSEUM - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Marie fires up her powerful BMW, parked right outside the austere
          Museum building. The powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds
          fluttering skywards...
<b>          
</b>          CREDITS appear over...
<b>          
</b>          ARIEL FOOTAGE of a narrow highway, Marie's BMW streaking through
          the endless tract of Florida wetlands. In the water, GATORS, warm
          themselves in the early morning sun...
<b>          
</b>           MOVING over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical BIRDS
          stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant
          waters in their deafening AIRBOATS...
<b>          
</b>           Through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing
          and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip
          three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club.
<b>          
</b><b>                                                             03/22/2004   2.
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          Marie steers her BMW into the showroom-like parking lot of Blue
          Bay High School.
<b>          
</b><b>          INT. MARIE'S BMW - MORNING
</b><b>          
</b>          Marie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot, when...
<b>          
</b><b>          SCCCREEEECCCHHHH!
</b><b>          
</b>          She SLAMS on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car.
          Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing
          arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt.
<b>          
</b>          She sits stock still for a second, then looks up, out of her
          windshield at the young woman scouring at her, only inches from
          the front bumper of the BMW.
<b>          
</b>          The sudden jolt has changed the radio station. A newscaster
          rambles on...
<b>          
</b><b>                              RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
</b>                    ... operation, aimed at finally capturing
                    the Black Widow suspect after a six month
                    trail of embezzlement and fraud, once
                    again failed to snare its subject.
<b>          
</b>          ELENA SANDOVAL, 17, stands defiantly in front of the BMW, her
          don't-fuck-with-me stare in direct contrast with her come-fuck-me
          clothes.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
</b>                    Blue Bay Police Detective Michael
                    Morrison was able to recover over
                    $400,000 in stolen money, but the
                    suspect, described as Female, between
                    eighteen and thirty, remains at large...
<b>          
</b>          Marie reaches out with a trembling hand, turns off the stereo,
          then leans out of the car window.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MARIE
</b>                    I'm... so... sorry...
<b>          
</b>          Elena smiles wryly.
<b>          
</b><b>                              ELENA
</b>                    You will be.
<b>          
</b>          And she means it...
<b>          
</b><b>                                                          03/22/2004   3.
</b><b>

</b><b>          INT. BLUE BAY HIGH AUDITORIUM - MORNING
</b><b>          
</b>          The auditorium is packed with the Blue Bay High student body. The
          natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat
          headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back.
<b>          
</b>          Marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still
          shocked by what happened out in the parking lot...
<b>          
</b><b>                              JENNY
</b>                        (handing over a present)
                    Happy birthday, babe. They ain't
                    diamonds, but you're just gonna have to
                    wait for those...
<b>          
</b>          Marie tentatively opens the gift, sees a pair of OPAL EARRINGS.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MARIE
</b>                        (unconvincing)

</b><b>                              JENNY
</b>                    Are you OK, hon?
<b>          
</b>          Marie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the
          freaks and geeks crowd round Elena, worshipping her like the
          Goddess she is...
<b>          
</b><b>                              MARIE
</b>                    I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's
                    just...that new girl...I almost hit her
                    in the parking lot...
<b>          
</b><b>                              JENNY
</b>                    You mean the towel girl, the one who
                    transferred in? Jesus, she's trouble. You
                    know the only reason she's slinging
                    towels is 'cos it's court ordered...
<b>          
</b>          Marie and Elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea
          of hormonally challenged students as Principal LIONEL MOSSTER, his
          ill-fitting sports jacket coffee-stained, steps onstage.
<b>          
</b><b>                              MOSSTER

<b>          
</b>          He pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down...

</b><b>                              MOSSTER

</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b><b>          
</b>          The students all cheer, naturally.

</b><b>                              MOSSTER
</b>                    We'll see who's cheering when you've got
                    an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or
                    get slapped with a paternity suit...Or
                    arrested for date rape. But don't take my
                    word for it...
<b>          
</b>          He motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS, early 30's, a natural
          beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and
          glasses, and CHAD BORMAN, late 20s, devilishly handsome...

                    Richards. I'm an officer for the Miami
                    juvenile parole board, as some of you

                    When I heard about Principal Mosster's
                    sex education program I thought I'd
                    volunteer my own personal story, in hopes
                    that you might learn from the mistakes I
                    made. Back in High school all I wanted to
                    do was get drunk, stoned and laid...

                    cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every
                    night of the week...

</b><b>                              CHAD
</b>                    Thank you, Miss Richards. My name's Dr.
                    Chad Borman. I run the forensics lab at
                    the police department, where my work has
                    helped convict hundreds of sex offenders.
                    Most teens like Ms. Richards never get
                    their lives together. The physical scars
                    may go away, but the emotional damage
                    stays forever.
<b>          
</b>          While Chad drones on, MUDDY, a Gremlin-eyed drooler, sitting in
          front of Elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up
          on the back of the chair. He spots the ugly plastic bracelet
          locked around one of her ankles.

<b>          
</b>          Back at the podium, Chad leans forward, making sure his words
          resonate with the student body.
<b>          
</b><b>                              CHAD
</b>                    And as for the perpetrators of this
                    heinous act, even if you are still a
                    minor, you will be tried as an adult,
                    and, if convicted, you will do hard time.
<b>          
</b>          He pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students.

<b>          
</b>          Kristen is taken aback by Elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her

</b>          But all eyes are on the home team. Masturbatory fantasies abound
          as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches...
<b>          
</b>          And as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to
          absolutely sweet Marie, stunning in her nearly see-through white

</b>          JAY CLIFFORD, Marie's chisel-jawed stepfather in his late

          platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into
          the air.
<b>          
</b>          It's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double
          back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form. She quickly
          resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with

<b>          
</b>          Marie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at
          hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop
          looming beyond...
<b>          
</b>          She slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. It's an odd
          design. Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond...
<b>          
</b>          She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting
          in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split
          second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne...

</b>          And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks,
          does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible
          instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash.
<b>

</b>          Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the

          of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland...

<b>          
</b>          An imposing Cuban businessman, MR. BARAJAS, stands threateningly
          over a visibly frightened Jay. Another man, CICATRIZ, dressed in
          designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn
          of this little operation.

<b>          
</b>          Barajas nods to Cicatriz, who moves in on Jay with lightning
          quickness, holds a Razor sharp KNIFE against his thumb.

</b>          Cicatriz runs the steel blade across Jay's thumb. Marie has to
          cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood
          stain the spotless white carpet.

          Elena won't let go. They wrestle for control of the video camera.
          And finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across
          the room and SHATTERS on the concrete floor...

          She pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around
          inside, then trailing it back across the vine covered ground...

                    You know it, and I know it. Gonna need to
                    think fast if you wanna keep the Cubans
                    off your back...
<b>          
</b>          Jay's tiny mind can't take it all in.

</b>          Elena walks seductively into the unfinished office. It's on.

</b>          Marie sits in the bleachers by the side of the school dive pool,
          looking at her Mother's soon-to-be-diamond ring through teary
          eyes...

</b><b>          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT

          Jay's video camera on her, wailing on her in a drunken stupor.

          identical GLASS REPLICAS, and replaces the diamonds...
