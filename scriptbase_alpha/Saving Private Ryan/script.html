<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
               CREDITS:  White lettering over a back background.  The
               THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard.  The
               power is astonishing.  It roars through the body, blows back
               the hair and rattles the ears.

<b>               FADE IN:
</b>
<b>               EXT. OMAHA BEACH - NORMANDY - DAWN
</b>
               The ROAR OF NAVAL GUNS continues but now WE SEE THEM FIRING.
               Huge fifteen inch guns.

<b>               SWARM OF LANDING CRAFT
</b>
               Heads directly into a nightmare.  MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from
               German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the
               beach.  Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers,
               pour out a red snowstorm of bullets.

</b>                         June 6, 1944

                         thirty men, near the beaches.

<b>                                     THE CLIFFS
</b>                         At the far end of the beach, a ninety-
                         foot cliff.  Topped by bunkers.
                         Ringed by fortified machine gun nests.
                         A clear line-of-fire down the entire
                         beach.

<b>                                     TEN LANDING CRAFT
</b>                         Make their way toward the base of
                         the cliffs.  Running a gauntlet of
                         explosions.

</b><b>                         THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE
</b>                         STORY THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT Plows
                         through the waves.

<b>               THE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE FACES OF THE MEN
</b>
               Boys.  Most are eighteen or nineteen years old.  Tough.
               Well-trained.  Trying to block out the fury around them.

<b>               A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT
</b>
               A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh.

<b>               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT
</b>
               The Motorman holds his course.  Shells EXPLODE around them.
               FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water.  CANNON FIRE SMASHES into
               the bow.

<b>               THE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS
</b>
               BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him.  The mate takes
               the controls.

<b>                                     A YOUNG SOLDIER
</b>                         His face covered with the remains of
                         the motorman.  Starts to lose it.
                         Begins to shudder and weep.  His
                         name is DeLancey.

<b>               THE BOYS AROUND HIM
</b>
               Do their best to stare straight ahead.  But the fear infects
               them.  It starts to spread.

<b>                                     A FIGURE
</b>                         Pushes through the men.  Puts himself
                         in front of DeLancey.

               The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far
               the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,
               powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a
               cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's
               helmet and lights the cigar.

               DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw
               and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is
               terrified.

               Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?

               Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.

               Delancey Oh, Jesus...

               Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your
               left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for
               those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're
               not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage
               thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves
               his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the
               cheek and moves on to the bow.

<b>                                     MILLER

<b>                         IN FRONT OF THEM.
</b>
<b>               PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND
</b>
               It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none
               of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it
               belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his
               eyes back to the objective.

<b>               THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH

               The six surviving boats alongside.

<b>               EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE

               From the landing crafts.  Arc toward the top of the cliffs.

<b>               THE LEAD CRAFT RAMP GOES DOWN
</b>
               A river of MACHINE GUN FIRE pours into the craft.  A dozen
               men are INSTANTLY KILLED.  Among them, DeLancey.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Somehow survives.  Jumps into the
                         breakers.

<b>               THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE

<b>               MILLER SEES A STALLED CLIMBER

               A soft-faced boy.  Grabs him by the back of his collar.

               deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of

               officer, walks in.

               Young captain Colonel, I've got something you should know
               about.

               Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha
               Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother
               was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this

               and freeze.

               One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.

               Young captain There's more.  There's a fourth brother.  The
               youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First
               Airborne the night before the invasion.  He's on the front.

               She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her
               house.  She starts to grow uneasy.

               As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.  She
               reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.

               inland, near Ramelle.  That's still deep behind German lines.

               The other officers freeze, listening without turning.  Colonel

                         Congressional Medal of Honor, you
                         can say any damn thing you please to
                         your superior officers?

               Miller considers the question, then smiles.

               Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head
               off, then he smiles, too.

                         heart crapola from three thousand
                         miles away.  One private is simply
                         not worth a squad.  Colonel anderson
                         This one is.  He's worth a lot more
                         than that.  Which is why I'm sending

               Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's
               time to get back to business.

               Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables.
               Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices
               the other officers in the tent watching.  A glare and they
               go back to work.

               and CHATTERING men move out around them.  DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE.

               Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious
               nerds the day before finals.  They're breaking down and
               gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious,
               detailed work.

               One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,
               patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick
               glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT
               EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.
               Miller strides in.  Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham.

               Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.

               Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.

               Upham I'm writing a book and I...

               Miller's expression gives him his answer.

               Upham scurries away.  Miller sighs.

<b>               EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY
</b>
               Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the
               others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA
               CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion
               in military history.

               The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered
               with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles
               winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored
               by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-
               shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers
               swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships
               and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of
               hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some
               distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.

               It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny
               band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,
               speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the
               bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day
               Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and
               infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are
               littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned
               equipment, bodies.

               Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine
               M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly
               take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in
               the back of the jeep.

                         goddamned walking, I'd pay a thousand

                         Martha fart through a field-phone.

               The men are stunned.

               Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain
               I'd remember.

               Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men.

               They walk on.

</b>                         Cap'n, my feet are most uncomfortable.

               Miller smiles, situation normal.

<b>               EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON
</b>
               A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active
               battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR
               EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers
               crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans.

               Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a
               couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across
               and disappear into the remains of a building.

               Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a
               corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread
               out down the block behind him.

               Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental
               picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of
               an alley across the street and down the block.  They are
               CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN.

               As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET
               SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.

               Miller motions Jackson across first.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Stay low.

               Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,
               kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and
               makes it to the cover of the far side.

<b>                                     JACKSON
</b>                         Dang!  That was close!

               Miller nods to Upham.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Your turn.

               Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him
               very gently.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Zig-zag, change your pace a couple
                         times, you'll be alright.

               Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Okay, I'm going to draw fire for
                         you.

                         But if I do, you goddamned well better
                         go.

               Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath.

               CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers.

<b>                                     MILLER

               Upham nods, still terrified.

<b>               MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN
</b>
               Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.

<b>                                     MILLER

               Upham runs.

<b>               A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.
</b>
               He doesn't budge.

               UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast.

               REIBEN watches Upham run.

<b>                                     REIBEN
</b>                         Hey, that guy can move.

               A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear.  UPHAM gets to
               the far side.

               MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don't
               even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed.
               He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent.

                              speaks to Reiben)
                         Glad of it.

<b>                                     UPHAM
</b>                         On the other side of the street,
                         crouches in a doorway with Jackson.
                         Upham is a bit in shock, less from
                         the nearness of the bullets than
                         from what Miller just did for him.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         DASHES across the street.

               GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches
               behind him.

               HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge.

<b>                                     MILLER

               UPHAM, tries to thank Miller.

</b>                         Captain, I...

               Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade.

</b>                         Ducks out of the doorway and crouch-
                         runs down the block.  He passes a:

</b>                         Out of the line of fire.  A dozen
                         dead American soldiers lined up on
                         the ground.  The battered, bloody
                         bodies, only partially covered by
                         ponchos.

               Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead.
               Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.

</b>                         Sees the dead and wounded, shows no
                         reaction.  Runs to:

<b>                                     AN ALLEY
</b>                         Captain Hamill and his men are bunched
                         there, out of the line of fire.
                         He's sending off a squad to continue
                         their door-to-door.

               Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the
               corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go.

               The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two
               captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak
               familiarly.

               Captain hamill How was the road in?

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         We had a jeep until a few hours ago,
                         a nice one, it had a cute little
                         flag with a couple of stars on it.

               Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.

               One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         We called in a strike on the eighty-
                         eights that took it out, but it's
                         the Kraut spotter that counts,
                         wherever the hell that bastard is.

               Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant
               chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.

               Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying
               to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying
               to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant
               steeple.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Jackson.

               Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson
               knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and
               takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to
               his back.

               He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and
               methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very
               unusual, long-barrel, rifle.

               Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,
               along with Upham, watch curiously.

               Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,
               sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he
               takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He
               adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham
               is fascinated.

<b>                                     UPHAM
</b>                         What is that?

               Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized
               shell.

<b>                                     JACKSON

                         with dual-groove, parallel rifling,
                         elevated three-glass scope and a
                         single-throw hammer.

</b>                         Not where I come from.

               Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and
               FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.

               Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the
               dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight
               and waits, absolutely motionless.

                              eye from the scope)

               Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks
               back with an expression that clearly says, "What are you,
               some kind of fucking idiot?" Reiben puts himself between
               Upham and Jackson.

                         Kentucky windage?

               Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the
               trigger.

<b>                                     JACKSON

               Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart
               the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his
               radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them
               the St. Mere road is open.

               The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to
               Miller.

               Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?

               Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in
               with the early wounded or dead.

               Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED
               PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.

               Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted
               a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two
               companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,

               Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in
               real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If
               you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,
               you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by
               tomorrow night.

               Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his
               head.

               Captain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers?

               Miller shrugs.

               Captain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home.

               Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful

               The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets
               serious.

                         get some sleep.

               The men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all
               settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to
               follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange
               men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow
               suit.

               Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his
               flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,
               he studies his maps while his men rest.

               flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake,
               watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in

               Miller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of

               SMALL ARMS FIRE ECHOES through the village.  DISTANT ARTILLERY

               toward the outskirts of town.  They're just a small squad,
               but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are
               very formidable-looking.

               Miller's men are getting ready to move out.  Captain Hamill

<b>               A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON

               Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.  The sky is on fire.  The

               countryside like a tidal wave.

               Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL.

               Frozen in place.  The lights play on their faces.

               MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.

               SARGE notices, says nothing.

               MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop.  Their eyes
               go back to the BLAZING SKY.

               Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns
               to Upham and sees that he's really scared.  Miller get a
               hold of himself and speaks gently.

                         all night, anyway.

               Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for
               a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.

                         us for.

               Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it.  He points
               the way.

               gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until
               you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods.

               As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to
               move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private
               who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up
               with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to
               Reiben.

               Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-
               ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private's
               vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.

               Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at
               Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.

               Reiben takes the ammo.

               Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands
               them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.

               Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes
               the ammo back.

               Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness,
               lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill
               and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a
               strange bit of hope.

               The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The
               night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way
               warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside
               Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear.

               Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at
               point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge
               brings up the rear.

               A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate
               only with hand signals.

               JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.

               MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease
               into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY
               MEN appear.

               REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission
               to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them
               go." A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the
               bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of
               relief and lowers hi B.A.R.

               THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet
               from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed
               with fear.  The others are stone-faced.

               MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.

               UPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh
               of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing
               the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.

               UPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly
               exposed.  Shitting bricks.

               Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad
               approaches.

               Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in
               the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak-
               kneed, amazed that he's still alive.

               MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the
               rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries
               after Miller, staying close on his heels.

               parallel to a cart path.  Wary.

               Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each
               other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and
               motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so.

               signs.  One of them reads:  "Ramelle 16 Km." Miller puts
               away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn

               Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at
               the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass.
               The war is far away.

               Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to
               feel an overwhelming wave of sadness.  Then he turns himself
               back into a commander and barks at Upham.

               Miller strides away.  Upham watches him, trying to figure
               him out, then he simply follows him.

<b>               EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWN
</b>
               The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by
               war.  Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is
               lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable,
               hundred of years old.

               Miller sees SMOKE AHEAD.  He motions to the men.  They
               advance.  Ext. french farm - day A burning house and barn.
               An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to
               this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and
               a boy, no more than ten.  His animals, a pair of cows and a
               draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.
               A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with
               empty shell casings around his body.

               Miller and his men approach carefully.  Miller motions to
               Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks
               gently to him in French.

               The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance.  Upham stands
               and translates.

                         to come and when he got back, this
                         is what he found.  The Krauts must

                         about his loss.

               Miller heads off without glancing back.  The men hesitate.
               Sarge jerks his head for them to move out.  They do so.

               Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his
               hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.

<b>               EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY
</b>
               A beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass.  The last
               of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.

               The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the
               edge of the field.

               Miller notices something.  He silently signals stop, crouches
               and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.

               Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him.  Jackson points to
               some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with
               bullets.

               Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.

               WADE IS HIT.  HEAVY BULLETS RIP APART HIS BELLY.  He spins.

               Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The
               life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,
               tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for

               Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller

                         saw.  My father used to go to these
                         Saturday night games and lose his
                         shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him
                         an ultimatum, either she gets a
                         regular seat at the table or she
                         locks him in every Saturday night.

                         but after a while they gave in and
                         from the first night she sat down,
                         she never lost.  She could read those
                         cocky bastards like they were playing
                         open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had
                         sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her
                         eyes, the tone of her voice, her
                         bets, her jokes, the way she sipped
                         her coffee, she was a master.  She
                         won more money on shit hands than
                         anyone in the history of the game.
                         Every Saturday night, my father would
                         lose two, three hundred bucks and

                         Kraut companies to Ramelle.

               Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something
               the others don't hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they
               do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.

<b>               EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY
</b>
               THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop
               trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack
               Wehrmacht troops.  Heavily armed.  Imposing.  Crossing a
               bridge.

               Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.
               Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.

                         with the vehicles.  MILLER AND HIS
                         MEN Catch a glimpse of an approaching
                         German Flank Squad.  They flatten
                         themselves into the mucky water.
                         Ready their weapons.  Prepare to

               Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast
               is clear.  They head out.

               A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,
               cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone
               walls.  The twos is visible beyond.

               Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the
               stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.

<b>               ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD

               There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.

               Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more
               threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER
               and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know
               that sound, they don't like it.

<b>               FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS
</b>
               Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who
               greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,
               far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two
               tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and
               impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.
               There are four of them.

                         his head for his men to follow, low,
                         along the wall.  The men are happy
                         to do so, looking back nervously at
                         the German tanks.

<b>               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY
</b>
               The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE.  The town square is
               a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell
               casings and bodies, German and American and a few French
               civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons
               ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.

               Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging
               debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of
               the firing.

               Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He
               signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the
               firing.

               They move on, dashing from cover to cover.

<b>               EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY

               A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC
               FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near
               the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of
               heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings
               are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.
               There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on
               both sides of the bridge.

               Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward
               the bridge.

<b>               THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP

               Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive
               jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies.

               He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the
               young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are
               some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller
               catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to
               nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime.

               Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as
               they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.

               Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and

               They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men
               to leap over the barricade.

               Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge
               was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us
               ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.

               Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's
               hailing I.D.   No response.

               Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?

               Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:

</b>                         Dashing from cover to cover, making
                         his way toward them.  Ryan is an

               Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the
               barricade.  He salutes Miller.

               Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally
               face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,
               searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.
               Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers
               have been killed in action.

               The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.
               Somehow he remains upright.

                         at Ryan, there's nothing else they
                         can do.

                         after another, they turn away,
                         adverting their eyes, looking a their
                         own boots, the debris on the bridge,

               Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and
               the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a
               little room.

               to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting
               him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on
               the arm and speaks softly to him.

               That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,
               but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I'm still not going.

               Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.

               Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn't
               resist.

                         and freezes in the shadows.

               Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun
               nest.

               REIBEN jumps down and moves forward.

               MILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in
               the rear machine gun nest.

               Miller and Sarge exchange a look.  Then Miller slips off to
               check the others.

               Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber.
               Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes.  They run as fast as
               they can.

               REIBEN takes a glancing slug.  Falls.  Rolls and gets up.
               Bleeding from the side, but not mortal.  Upham helps him.

               They MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade.

                         Amazed to see GAPING HOLES.  An
                         instant of surprise, more than fear.

               He looks to Miller.  Takes two more stumbling steps.  Falls
               onto the sandbags.  Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge.  Dies.

                         weak, starting to sway.  He gently
                         tries to move Miller aside.

               Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body.  Miller
               grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made
               as he kneeled over Wade's body.

               But this time it doesn't work.  He can't make it stick.  The
               hard expression, disappears.  He drifts, utterly lost.  He's
               called his own bluff.

               tightened their perimeter.

               Miller is in a trance.  The others glance at him nervously.

               They eat in silence.  K-rations.  Some bread.  A last supper.

               Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks:

                         She's an easy forty-four, double E,

                         eight D and I'm watching her try and
                         squeeze herself into a side-stay,
                         silk-ribboned, three-panel girdle
                         with s Helf-lift brassiere.

</b>                         You see, I've got the best house in
                         all of Addley.  It's not the biggest
                         house, but it's got the best location,
                         right next to the junior high baseball
                         field.  The garage windows face left
                         field.  The guy who owned the house
                         before me had these heavy screen S
                         put over them.  The first thing I
                         did when I bought the place was take
                         off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty-
                         two yards from home plate to my garage
                         windows.  It takes a hell of a junior
                         high kid to hit a ball that far.  I
                         look at my garage windows as a
                         Motivator and a way to scout the
                         kids coming up, the ones who are
                         going to give us a shot at the state
                         championship.  I lay there in my
                         hammock and every time I hear the
                         sound of breaking glass, I know we're
                         one step closer to winning it all.

<b>                                     REIBEN
</b>                         With the machine gun.  Covers Miller.
                         Keeping most of the German infantry
                         down.

               RYAN jumps behind the second machine gun.  Opens up.  Helping
               to cover Miller.

<b>               THE LAST GERMAN TANK
</b>
               Turret spins.  Turning toward the fast approaching Miller.
               Ready to blow him to bits.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Is almost there.  He arms the satchel
                         charge.

<b>               THE TIGER'S MACHINE GUNS OPENS UP ON HIM.
</b>
<b>               BLASTS A TRAIL OF BULLETS
</b>
<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Throws the satchel charge under the
                         tank.  Rolls off the edge of the
                         bridge.  Lands on the embankment
                         below.

<b>               THE LAST TIGER TANK EXPLODES
</b>
               MILLER, RYAN, REIBEN continue FIRING.

               Almost out of ammo.

               MILLER SCRAMBLING UP THE EMBANKMENT, back onto the bridge,
               hears something over the SOUNDS OF FIRING.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b><b>                         HOLD IT!  HOLD IT!
</b>
               Ryan and Reiben cease firing.  Now they hear it, too.

               A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they've heard
               yet.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Goddamn it!

<b>                                     REIBEN
</b>                         More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them
                         The fear on their faces turns to
                         resignation.  They know that they
                         are dead men.  They settle into their
                         positions, and prepare to fire and
                         die.

               They wait.  The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.

               THEN MILLER'S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a
               smile...then a real smile...

               AN AMERICAN SHERMAN TANK APPEARS from over the rise.  Then
<b>               ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...
</b>
<b>               MILLER, REIBEN AND RYAN
</b>
               Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along
               with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.

               They keep coming and coming.  American tanks, with wave after
               wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets.  They find a
               few among the departing Germans.

<b>                                     THE ADVANCING TROOPS
</b>                         Run onto the bridge and start to
                         secure the position.  A SERGEANT and
                         a few of HIS MEN look around,
                         curiously eyeing Miller, Reiben and
                         Ryan, battered and bloody, standing
                         among the bodies.

               A MAJOR strides up.

               Major Report, Captain.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Miller, Company B, Second Rangers,
                         that's Private Richard Reiben and
                         that's Private James Ryan, Hundred-
                         and-First Airborne.

               The Sergeant and several other soldiers overhear.

<b>                                     SERGEANT
</b>                         Ryan?

               One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.

               Soldier That's him, that's Ryan.

               The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder.

               Major Command is looking for you, son.  You're going home.

               Ryan looks up, tired.  He nods.

<b>               EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAY
</b>
               American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the
               road and over the bridge.

<b>               MILLER, RYAN AND REIBEN
</b>
               Watch.  In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies
               of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers
               are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.

               Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if
               they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by
               any of the advancing troops or vehicles.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Walks to the bodies.  He kneels down
                         next to Sarge and looks at him for a
                         long moment.  Then, with a steady
                         hand, he takes one of Sarge's two
                         dog-tags.  Then he does the same to
                         Jackson and Upham.

               REIBEN AND RYAN watch silently.

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Stands and walks back to Reiben and
                         Ryan.  He hands the dog-tags to Ryan
                         who grips them tightly and nods in
                         thanks.

               Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then
               he shoulders his gear.  Miller Let's move out.

               Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear.  They walk with Miller
               down the road, away from the bridge.

<b>                                     CAMERA CRANES UP
</b>                         The three dirty, bloodied, tired men
                         walk down the road, ignored by the
                         fresh troops marching in the opposite
                         direction.

<b>                                     RYAN
</b>                         Captain?

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Yes, Private.

<b>                                     RYAN
</b>                         Upham and Jackson, what were they
                         like?

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Upham?  Good kid, smart, he was
                         writing a book.

<b>                                     RYAN
</b>                         Yeah?

<b>                                     REIBEN
</b>                         Yeah, and he was fast, too, ran the
                         220 in twenty-four-five.

<b>                                     RYAN

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Jackson was from West Fork, Tennessee,
                         he was going to be a preacher, his
                         father and uncles have a traveling
                         ministry out of the back of a stretch
                         Hudson.

<b>                                     RYAN
</b>                         And Sarge?

<b>                                     MILLER
</b>                         Sarge?
                              (beat)
                         He was the best friend I ever had.
                              (smiles)
                         Lemme tell you about Sarge...

               They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds
               and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the
               road and over the bridge.

               Fade out.
