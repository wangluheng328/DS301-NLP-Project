Following the Allied invasion of Normandy, two brothers lay dead in the wake of the onslaught.
Meanwhile, in New Guinea, a third brother has been killed fighting the Japanese.
After the Army General Staff learns that a fourth brother is missing in the French countryside, a rescue mission is ordered to find the young soldier and return him safely home.
The mission is mounted by a veteran Ranger Captain commanding a squad of men who have mixed feelings about risking their lives to "Save Private Ryan".
